11915,the karst aquifers of india are an indispensable source of water to millions of people but the current globalization and climate change have altered the hydrological and other processes and thus have threatened the sustainability of the groundwater reserves in both quantity and quality the study aims to conceptualize the recharge processes and estimate the groundwater recharge in a karst aquifer located in semi arid southern india for this reason we used stable isotopes of rain and groundwater to understand aquifer dynamics and estimate the recharge volume as well as gain knowledge about different factors that are affecting the aquifers the isotope data show that the southwest monsoon rainwater has a weighted mean wm δ2h δ18o and chloride concentration of 10 5 1 03 and 0 81 mg l respectively the rainfall of other seasons is highly depleted in heavy isotopes the δ2h vs δ18o plots of rainwater and groundwater suggest that recharge is highly variable in space and time and depends on climatic factors as well a mixing model based on isotopes and chloride values shows that recharge around highly karstified areas of the aquifer is about 64 and largely infiltrates as fast allogenic type high hydraulic conductivity and fast transfer velocity make such areas very prone to contamination irrigation return flow contributes about 53 of the aquifer storage in the paddy cultivated areas which along with several other factors contaminate the groundwater this study provides an estimated annual replenishable groundwater volume of the narji limestone aquifer of 1031 180 mcm the chemical and isotope modeling enables a better understanding of water resources in fractured karst aquifer and the study encourages their use to investigate the karst hydrodynamics in india and elsewhere as well graphical abstract image 1 keywords isotopes recharge karst india 1 introduction understanding the groundwater recharge processes has helped to solve many water related problems all over the world accurate quantification of recharge volume has led to estimates of groundwater reserves preventing contamination problems and proposing suitable aquifer management strategies in many aquifer types however in karst aquifers estimating a precise recharge volume is quite difficult due to certain reasons recharge is a highly complex and spatiotemporally variable hydrological process healy and scanlon 2010 martínez santos and andreu 2010 zomlot et al 2015 the heterogeneity and anisotropy of karst aquifers increase the complexity in recharge calculation andreo et al 2010 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 furthermore in arid and semi arid regions variability of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration also produces uncertainty in recharge values scanlon et al 2006 jebreen et al 2018 several approaches and methodologies have been used to overcome such limitations in the assessment of groundwater the evaluation of stable isotopes of water coupled with different solutes is one of the widely used approaches to investigate karst groundwater and quantify their resources more accurately lakey and krothe 1996 perrin et al 2003 sappa et al 2018 iacurto et al 2020 the use of physicochemical parameters major ions and isotopes is an efficient tool for hydrological studies in karst aquifers but they need to be monitored frequently delbart et al 2014 the method has also been used in several aquifers in india e g kumar et al 1982 gupta et al 2005 sukhija et al 2006 mukherjee et al 2007 négrel et al 2011 but there are very few examples from carbonate aquifers of the country jeelani et al 2015 shah et al 2017 in india carbonate aquifers cover about 3 of land area and strategically provide groundwater to more than 35 million people dar et al 2014a in semi arid andhra pradesh telangana and karnataka the aquifers fulfill water demands for drinking irrigation and industrial use dar et al 2011 the groundwater quantity and quality have deteriorated in the last few decades dar et al 2014b 2017 limestone exploitation for building stones and cement manufacture which is expanding at 0 6 km2 year dar et al 2014a is a major threat to the aquifers besides climate change declining water resources rising water demands and urbanization also impact the aquifers and their sustainability dar et al 2014b the present study uses 2h and 18o isotopes of water coupled with water chemistry to improve the hydrogeological understanding of the karst aquifer and quantify groundwater recharge for better aquifer management the areas with karst aquifers are comparatively isolated and have typical land use as well as a lack of adequate data thus the study provides meaningful and useful support to further investigate such aquifers scientifically and generate suitable data set for advanced studies and utilize this worthwhile resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description karstified narji limestone is located in the kurnool district of andhra pradesh india fig 1 topographically the area is flat and the drainage of pal eru river a tributary of the river kundu mainly flows during monsoons the climate is semi arid with an average annual rainfall of 709 mm and potential evapotranspiration of 1800 mm the daily rainfall data of the belum site shows that the southwest sw monsoon season which extends from june september indian meteorological department contributes 60 65 of the annual rainfall and 20 25 occurs in the northeast ne monsoon season october november other months often remain dry and hot wind speed and relative humidity are high during the monsoon season fig 2 rain fed crops are mainly cultivated however paddy is grown year round northeast of the owk reservoir using canal water fig 1 groundwater is used for drinking and domestic purposes and irrigation of paddy vegetables and fruits rainwater stored in shallow ponds is also used for some domestic purposes prosopis juliflora is the common plant shrub which has a low rate of evapotranspiration oliveira et al 2017 the limestone is 100 200 m thick and overlain by owk shale and paniam quartzite producing confined aquifer conditions in some areas dar et al 2011 2014b shallow depressions sinkholes caves and springs are common in the area the general flow of groundwater is towards the southeast most of the borewells yield on average 10 l s from 20 to 65 m depth aquifer geometry and hydrological processes are highly complex in the area the area towards the northeast has up to 9 m thick soils a shallow water table and paddy cultivation and the groundwater shows high concentrations of solutes the central part of the area has intermittent soil cover which is 1 m in thickness dominantly fast recharge and mainly rain fed crops with patches of paddy vegetables and fruits fast recharge occurs through various karstif features such as a number of sinkholes inset in fig 1 that were mapped in this area it hosts the well known touristic belum cave c1 which has a permanent water flow at 46 m depth the belum spring s1 overflows provisionally during monsoons fig 3 a and its water level remains at the deepest level 5 5 m bgl during dry months the groundwater is also influenced by the infiltration of contaminated water stored in the abandoned limestone quarries which are mostly used for dumping the domestic waste in the area karst is almost barren in the catchments of permanent springs s2 s3 and s4 fig 1 where agricultural and other human influence on groundwater is much less pronounced s2 flows fig 3b from the base of the limestone in yadiki valley with a maximum discharge q of 8 l s the spring s3 discharges through a small opening at a higher elevation and maintains q up to 0 2 l s even during dry months both s2 and s3 represent phreatic storage like s1 munagamanu guha c2 and yaganti guha c3 are two well developed caves near these two springs dar et al 2011 c2 maintains streamflow at 0 1 l s several weeks after the monsoon the ephemeral s5 and s6 epikarst springs flow only during monsoon months when qmax reaches 15 l s at s5 and 14 l s at s6 due to monsoon recharge increased water flow and water level rise of 3 4 m was observed in a stream at 17 m depth inside the bandarlapalli cave c4 near s5 and s6 springs the limestone is karstified as indicated by a well developed unsaturated zone or epikarst particularly in the areas around the springs dar et al 2011 this zone captures the infiltrating water rapidly thus minimizing the effects of isotope modification of the recharging water groundwater is also fed by owk reservoir during its high levels noble and ansari 2017 an observation borewell at kolimigundla village shows lower water levels in may and high in october fig 4 estimated change in storage change in water level δh specific yield sy of the aquifer varies over a wide range 0 08 0 32 m average 0 2 m over the past ten years which indicates that recharge and groundwater draft are not in phase in the aquifer changing land use and different anthropogenic factors have highly affected the groundwater chemistry over the past years carbonate dissolution is the major process but sulfate nitrate and chloride generally termed snc are substantially related to human sources in the absence of rock water interaction dar et al 2014b a seasonal shift from pure ca mg hco3 waters to the contaminated water types is observed after recharge specific conductivity spc vs total hardness th shows that about 92 of samples have spc 600 μs cm and snc 20 of total anion sum out of which 50 of samples have spc between 1000 and 3800 μs cm fig 5 the regression equation between spc and th spc 1 1 th 405 5 r 2 0 2 this study compared with polluted karst waters globally spc 0 88 th 409 6 r 2 0 22 indicates that plenty of chemicals are added into the groundwater by agriculture and other human activities in addition to those related to carbonate dissolution krawczyk and ford 2006 2 2 sampling and analysis daily rainfall and pan evaporation were measured at belum cave station fig 1 during 2009 2011 daily rainfall data of 10 years 2002 2010 at kolimigundla village 3 km from belum was available from mandal revenue office kurnool twenty one rain samples were analyzed for chloride concentration and 2h and 18o isotopes fig 6 samples were collected immediately after rain events and refrigerated until analysis six karst springs belum s1 yadiki s2 yadiki s3 yaganti s4 rati s5 and dewalakona s6 were monitored every 3 4 months each year for three hydrological years 2009 2011 groundwater samples were also collected occasionally from borewells cave streams and runoff the procedure of collection and analysis of groundwater for solutes other than isotopes in the same samples has previously been discussed in dar et al 2017 samples in 10 ml glass vials covered with parafilm were analyzed for 2h and 18o delta values at csir national geophysical research institute hyderabad using isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms isoprime system using the co2 equilibration method for δ18o epstein and mayeda 1953 and zinc reduction method for δ2h coleman et al 1982 the usual precision of the instrument was 1 5 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o isotope data is discussed in the usual δ scale in as per v smow vienna standard mean ocean water according to δsample rsample rstandard 1 1000 with r 2h 1h or 18o 16o atomic ratios for the sample and standard respectively craig 1961a water level data of 15 days resolution from 2002 to 2011 at kolimigundla borewell was available from andhra pradesh groundwater department although the local pumping effects on the water level of the well could not be observed the effects are minimal as the borewell is located outside the village 2 3 methodology the methodology used in the paper is based on three main aspects of the work understanding the recharge processes estimating the rainfall contribution to the groundwater and calculating the proportion of groundwater that infiltrates from other sources such as irrigation return flow irf the δ2h δ18o and water chemistry data of the groundwater and rainwater were cross correlated which helped to characterize the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of the aquifer and to identify the main processes in the area a widely used two end member mixing model leaney et al 1993 lakey and krothe 1996 plummer et al 1998 perrin et al 2003 long and putnam 2004 aquilina et al 2005 delbart et al 2014 is used to evaluate the groundwater recharge from rainfall the method implies that groundwater after recharge represents a mixture q m with its chemical signature c m the mixture comprises pre recharge volume q pre multiplied by its signature and rainfall recharge fraction q r multiplied by its concentration this yields eq 1 1 q r q m c m c p r e c r c p r e the ratio of qr qm is the recharge from rainwater that infiltrates in the spring catchments the concentration of chemicals in the groundwater before recharge cpre was taken from the lowest discharge events of the spring hydrographs and then averaged over the hydrological year cr is the concentration of recharge causing rainfall events and its value was taken as a weighted mean of rainfall the method has yielded better estimates using conservative tracers such as chloride δ2h and 18o e g doctor et al 2006 binet et al 2017 which normally do not exchange between water and aquifer matrix at biospheric temperatures wood 1999 toran 2006 the fractionation of these tracers in the unsaturated zone is also minimal particularly where epikarst is well developed areas other than the northeastern parts of the study site as the infiltrating water travels fast into the groundwater storage dar et al 2011 the epikarst layer in these areas is about 10 15 m in thickness the rainfall water level relationship of the kolimigundla observation well was also used to estimate site specific recharge generally in common settings a rainfall event distributes into runoff and evapotranspiration and a part recharges the groundwater and increases the water table from the well hydrograph water level rise δh was calculated corresponding to different rain events fig 4 a correlation between δh and the amount of respective rain events leads to recharge estimation the method assumes that an increase in water level in the well is only due to rainfall recharge as infiltration from sources such as canals and ponded irrigation is negligible the effect of abstraction is considered minimal as no pumping is carried out from the well by the andhra pradesh groundwater department which uses it exclusively for recording the water level data for research purposes a three end member mixing analysis was carried out using the chemical and isotope data to calculate the contribution of different sources in the groundwater mainly irf which is affecting the quality of the groundwater particularly in the intensively irrigated paddy fields of northeastern parts of the study area 3 results 3 1 isotope and chloride values in rainwater statistics of δ2h and δ18o values of the rain n 21 and mean and weighted mean wm values corresponding to the southwest sw and northeast ne monsoon rainfall are presented in table 1 the data are plotted in figs 6 and 7 δ2h ranges from 58 8 to 9 0 with a mean 21 0 22 4 δ18o varies from 5 81 to 1 75 with a mean 1 60 2 24 the d excess δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 ranges from 18 85 to 5 32 with an average value 8 16 7 43 the weighted mean wm δ2h and δ18o for 2010 11 rainfall is 22 9 and 2 0 respectively wm of δ2h and δ18o in sw monsoon of 2010 is 15 4 and 1 56 and in 2011 the values are 5 5 and 0 51 respectively and the average wm of two year sw monsoon is 10 5 and 1 03 respectively yadava et al 2016 also showed that the ranges of δ2h δ18o and d excess of rainwater of the area during 2010 11 were 93 69 to 19 57 8 32 to 1 94 and 27 09 to 9 12 respectively the mean standard errors and wm in parentheses are similar for this study δ2h 29 62 28 46 31 5 δ18o 2 56 2 65 3 1 d excess 9 11 12 07 n 16 the cl of rainwater ranges between 0 20 and 2 41 mg l and its wm is 0 81 mg l the mean 0 73 0 2 mg l is similar to the estimated 0 77 mg l of soumya et al 2009 this suggests a main atmospheric origin of chloride in rainfall and hence increases its applicability as a tracer in recharge estimation 3 2 isotope and physicochemical parameters in groundwater the value of stable isotopes of groundwater from six springs and the physicochemical parameters are statistically analyzed in table 2 the δ2h vs δ18o plot fig 7 shows a large spatial variability in the groundwater of the area δ2h ranges from 30 3 at s2 to 8 9 at s5 similarly δ18o ranges from 4 45 at s2 to an enriched value of 0 45 at s6 δ2h of bore wells ranges from 17 4 at b13 to 3 7 at b12 whereas δ18o is 2 30 at b13 and 0 95 at b12 table 3 the linear plots of discharge major ions and isotopes of spring waters shown in figs 8 10 show the intrasite variability of the aquifer the values at each site were analyzed and the results are statistically presented in table 2 the range mean and standard deviation of different parameters show that the spring sites are easily differentiated from each other which indicates a high heterogeneity within the aquifer a few samples of runoff water cave streams and epikarst springs were also analyzed once during the study period and the values table 3 justify some of the results for the aforementioned springs for example in fig 9 the data of the epikarst spring and cave stream correlate well with the spring water of s2 located nearby the runoff water from the quartzite shows similar values as rainwater and this water rapidly enters the limestone aquifer through the sinkholes generally located at the boundary of the quartzite dar et al 2011 4 discussion 4 1 rainwater isotopes 2h and 18o and climate the rainwater is relatively depleted in δ2h and δ18o as compared to western india deshpande et al 2003 mainly due to rayleigh rain out effect mook 2006 the local meteoric water line lmwl is defined eq 2 and fig 7 by a non weighted least square regression equation 2 δ 2 h 9 5 0 7 δ 18 o 5 6 1 8 n 21 r 2 0 91 p 0 01 the slope 9 5 0 7 and intercept 5 6 1 8 are slightly greater than the lmwl for mumbai 8 3 0 9 δ18o 7 97 0 3 iaea wmo 1998 and previously reported lmwl of the study area 8 36 0 92 δ18o 8 01 3 48 n 36 yadava et al 2016 these values are suggestive of equilibrium condensation isotopic equilibrium of the vapors clark and fritz 1997 however the d excess value and intercept of lmwl are depleted negative value compared to the long term weighted mean global meteoric water line gmwl slope 8 2 0 07 and intercept 11 27 0 65 rozanski et al 1993 because of substantial local evaporation under semi arid conditions yadava et al 2016 generally relative humidity rh of 25 75 produces a slope of 4 5 in lmwl here the higher slope is due to high rh range 50 80 in the area fig 2 seasonality of the indian summer monsoon is noticeable by the mean and wm δ2h δ18o and d excess and data variability table 1 fig 7 enriched sw rainfall signifies west coast arabian sea vapor source and considerable moisture recycling by evaporation in highly humid and windy conditions kumar et al 2010 comparatively depleted ne monsoon mainly indicates an inland source and greater travel distance of vapors and effect of rainout effect e g faure and mensing 2015 a gentler slope 5 8 in ne monsoon is mainly indicative of high temperature and evaporation in these months compared to a higher slope 6 6 of sw rain which is attributed to 70 rh between june september fig 2 the seasonal rainfall is also differentiated by the wm values which are enriched in sw monsoon and depleted in ne monsoon samples table 1 empirical correlation amount effect i e depletion of isotopes with the amount of rainfall is also observed particularly in sw monsoon when rainfall is 30 mm mainly because of local climatic effects rozanski et al 1993 lekshmy et al 2014 jasechko 2019 evaporation ev modifies the isotope dynamics before recharge takes place as observed by a positive correlation temperature effect jasechko 2019 between δ values and daily evaporation eq 3 3 δ 2 h 9 2 e v 68 93 r 2 0 46 a n d δ 18 o 0 82 e v 5 7 r 2 0 3 n 21 p 0 01 runoff from barren quartzites table 3 shows mean δ2h of 12 1 and δ18o of 1 79 similar to the rainwater average δ2h 11 7 and δ18o 1 29 of the same period i e september 2010 these values were used in calculating the contribution of rainfall infiltration in the groundwater 4 2 hydrology of karst groundwater using δ2h δ18o and physicochemical parameters statistics of δ2h δ18o and physicochemical parameters tables 2 and 3 and bivariate plot fig 7 show a large variability of groundwater sources and behavior most of the groundwater falls within the sw monsoon cluster illustrating it as a major recharge source however the samples s2 s3 and s4 fall between two contrasting rain types because recharge in the highly karstified catchments occurs during both seasons an epikarst spring in s2 s3 catchment shows ec 708 μs cm cl 30 53 mg l δ2h 22 8 and δ18o 3 15 similar to these springs reflecting a high connectivity between the aquifer zones the epikarst springs s5 and s6 show large variability in isotope composition the groundwater isotope data fits the least square regression equation eq 4 fig 7 4 δ 2 h 2 6 0 26 δ 18 o 11 1 0 64 n 69 r 2 0 61 p 0 01 due to the large scatter of groundwater data the regression equation may be physically less significant but the pattern of the samples shows linearity very low slope 2 6 and small d excess mean 0 79 of groundwater than lmwl reflect the evaporation influence clark and fritz 1997 as observed by previous studies dar et al 2017 evaporative isotope fractionation of water occurs during infiltration sheffer et al 2011 and by the precipitation of calcite from drip water oster et al 2012 the fractionation will be less in the epikarst zone than in diffuse infiltration through the soil cover drip water collected in the yadiki cave c2 on august 10 2010 table 3 had δ2h 27 2 and δ18o 1 06 whereas the wm of rainwater events before this date had 21 3 and 1 56 respectively compared to groundwater of s2 and s3 fig 1 the enriched drip water particularly in δ18o reflects the evaporative effect similar behavior was observed in the isotopes mainly δ18o of belum drip water average δ2h and δ18o 4 7 and 0 62 and wm rainwater 31 and 2 67 during 2010 11 yadava et al 2016 the evaporation effect on δ2h and δ18o is different mainly because evaporation occurs in a windy unsaturated atmosphere with varying ambient humidity in which kinetic fractionation dominates the equilibrium type furthermore the difference in diffusion rates of the two isotopes produces prominent evaporative fractionation in 18o the magnitude of fractionation also varies in the two caves because c2 is deep with mainly closed conduits contrary to belum cave with most of the passages open to the atmosphere inside c1 the mean annual air temperature is 27 c seasonal variations 3 c and mean annual rh is 88 while the surface mean annual temperature is 30 c but the mean annual rh is 55 yadava et al 2016 the partly evaporated infiltrating water recharges and consequently impacts the groundwater differently in different hydrogeological settings for example the slope is more gentle for s1 and c1 samples than other springs fig 7 the temporal variability of groundwater data at different sites also illustrates the karst aquifer heterogeneity in spring s1 generally a rain event of 30 mm immediately produces flow of 30 50 l s that is sustained for 3 4 days between 5 and november 12 2009 80 mm rain increased δh by 4 m similarly a single event of 67 8 mm between 11 and august 12 2010 increased δh by 3 m these events resulted in dilution of groundwater solutes e g spc decreased from 948 to 434 μs cm and yielded δ2h and δ18o similar to wm of sw monsoon i e depletion of values fig 8a the mean value of different parameters during high flowing and low or non flowing conditions is presented in table 4 thus quick response of water level and solutes isotopes even within hours indicates rapid infiltration through preferential pathways high hydraulic conductivity transmissivity fast transfer velocity and small lag time between recharge and rainfall ford and williams 2007 dar 2014 almost overlapping chemical and isotope data between s1 and c1 stream fig 8 also signify these properties e g marfia et al 2004 turbid muddy water of the spring during high discharge periods fig 3a shows that because of these aquifer properties the contaminants from the catchment are not properly filtered during infiltration which makes the groundwater highly vulnerable to pollution the temporal data of groundwater at s2 s3 and s4 springs is shown in fig 9a b and c despite fewer samples a good association is observed between ec bicarbonate and isotopes with the discharge and rainfall the periods of high q grey bars generally have lower values than in low discharge conditions table 4 the data of the munagamanu cave stream c2 in table 3 and marked in fig 9a correlate well with s2 and s3 indicating similar catchment and good connectivity between the springs and cave the stream shows average ec 453 μs cm δ2h 23 8 and δ18o 3 95 in monsoon months similarly an epikarst spring near c2 es in table 3 and marked in fig 9a and drip water of c2 also correlate with s2 spring no clear variability could be established in s5 and s6 due to very few samples fig 10 the stream inside the bandarlapalli cave c4 during the dry season january 5 2010 showed ec 477 μs cm δ2h 27 and δ18o 3 6 table 3 similar to that of c2 stream ec 455 μs cm δ2h 24 4 and δ18o 4 22 denoting phreatic storage in both the caves spatial hydrogeological and hydrodynamic variability is also reflected by the groundwater δ2h and δ18o data the location of the samples in fig 7 and the statistical values of different chemicals show that the samples can broadly be grouped into three categories samples b3 b9 b10 b11 and b12 group 1 have comparably enriched values the isotope fractionation that causes this enrichment is mainly because of diffuse recharge high evapotranspiration and irf inset of fig 7 it has been reported that transpiration fractionates water isotopes and stores enriched water in plant and biomass which following decomposition contributes to the soil system and ultimately groundwater farquhar et al 2007 sprenger et al 2016 springs s2 s3 and s4 group 3 are differentiated by depleted δ2h and δ18o and their proximity to the meteoric water line is indicative of little evaporation before groundwater recharge jasechko 2019 recharge also occurs during ne monsoons in these karstified catchments and a lack of agriculture and other human activities inhibits further isotope fractionation in the groundwater samples s1 b1 b2 b5 b8 and b13 group 2 possess mixed isotopic and chemical character both fast and diffuse infiltration irf from rain fed and irrigated vegetable flower crops and other human induced factors cause extensive mixing of groundwater samples s5 and s6 show large variability and do not exclusively fall in any group these catchments are devoid of any soil cover and the aquifer is barren with well developed epikarst exposed in places further studies on a larger number of samples can validate such observations 4 3 recharge estimation the mean values of δ2h δ18o and cl in groundwater table 4 during peak flow concentrations after recharge cm and low flow periods pre event concentrations cpre were used in eq 1 to estimate the recharge percentages for the spring sites table 5 using cr equal to wm rainfall δ2h 10 5 and δ18o 1 03 average cm of seven recharge events in s1 fig 8a and the corresponding mean cpre give a recharge of 59 9 and 66 1 using δ2h and δ18o respectively chloride concentration in s1 groundwater ranges from 3 mg l during monsoons to 70 mg l in dry months using sw monsoon wm cl of 0 81 mg l and an average clm and clpre give a mean recharge of 67 for three recharge events fig 8a the recharge average 64 is in the range of percolation rate 40 90 modeling by δ2h and δ18o of rain and drip water in belum cave yadava et al 2016 the data of the c1 stream fig 8b table 2 show the large anthropic influence and are not suitable for computing recharge for example cl is very high compared to s1 and δ2h and δ18o also show large evaporative fractionation effects inside the cave as discussed above average cm of δ2h δ18o and cl and cpre values of spring s2 table 4 give recharge of 45 5 49 4 and 50 using those three tracers respectively table 5 for spring s3 the respective recharge values are 21 3 28 9 and 46 2 and the values are 54 9 47 2 and 41 5 for s4 because of a similar hydrogeological setup a mean of s2 and s4 was taken equal to 48 for spring s5 fig 10 average δ2h and δ18o values of 14 0 and 1 38 during peak flow periods are similar to the wm of sw rainwater similarly in s6 δ2h and δ18o of 11 2 and 0 45 measured on september 23 2010 are similar to the wm of rainwater during this month this shows that these sites have high connectivity between the unsaturated epikarst and the saturated zones table 5 shows that recharge follows s1 s2 s4 s3 the highest value around s1 and c1 catchment indicates a karst dominated setting in which several karst features promote fast allogenic and autogenic recharge dar et al 2011 water level variation at kolimigundla observation well fig 4 is compared to the daily rainfall to estimate recharge the deepest level 19 25 m bgl was observed in 2003 and the shallowest 0 4 m bgl in 2007 generally water level sharply declines from october to december water level rise δh of several events shaded bars plotted against the event rainfall fig 11 shows a good correlation r2 0 91 the trend line meets the abscissa at 195 mm except for two outliers of unexpectedly large water level change this amount of event rain called rainfall intercept generally becomes runoff and or evaporation the remaining rainfall event volume minus rainfall intercept infiltrates and produces groundwater recharge estimated recharge ranges from 11 1 in 2004 to 65 9 in 2005 the average annual recharge is 150 8 mm i e 36 7 of annual rainfall out of 12 events fig 4 table 6 7 values have a range of 42 7 65 9 and are consistent with the results from spring sites the lower recharge in the rest of the events could be due to less rainfall or unforeseen change in water level further the recharge value 65 5 calculated from the 2010 water level data of the bore well matches with the estimates using the chemical and isotope data of the s1 spring of the same year the s1 spring is nearly 3 km from the well the specific yield computed from the good correlation between the recharge and water level rise is equal to 2 3 average value corresponding to the regression line slope such a value is in agreement with a fractured karstified unconfined aquifer context dar et al 2015 gec 2017 4 4 sensitivity of estimates recharge estimates from the springs and observation well show consistency using δ2h δ18o cl and water level as indicated by the mean and standard deviations however the observed deviation and uncertainty arise because recharge in karst is highly complex and estimation depends on certain factors assumptions jones et al 2000 one of the reasons could be the modification of isotopes and chemistry in soil and the epikarst and anthropogenic influence on the tracers the estimated recharge is somewhat different at s2 and s3 using δ2h and δ18o but the values closely match when using chloride uncertainty due to analytical procedures is negligible because of the good precision of the data the recharge values fall within the upper range of those calculated from the water level fluctuation method using a simple model and soil water balance approach dar 2014 estimated that 29 of the annual rainfall infiltrates in the belum area with a fast to diffuse ratio of 16 13 this value is close to the one calculated at the well site similarly injected tritium indicates that diffuse recharge is 14 of annual rainfall in this aquifer with thick and continuous soil cover dar et al 2015 however the values from the present study are more representative of a karst system as the study was carried out using more karst specific approaches by comparison the percentage of annual rainfall that infiltrates in similar karst settings is 56 85 in morocco el ouali et al 1999 47 in saudi arabia de vries and simmers 2002 27 55 in portuguese algarve de vries and simmers 2002 30 55 in southern spain andreu et al 2011 alcala et al 2010 43 67 in syria al charideh 2011 and 17 53 in florida usa ritorto et al 2009 this shows that natural tracer and water table fluctuation methods provide accurate and realistic estimates of total recharge diffuse and direct compared to local and conventional approaches with large assumptions however increasing the number of samples and using more specific methodologies would reduce the uncertainty in results various agencies e g central ground water board cgwb and andhra pradesh groundwater department and some ngos are collecting water level data from these aquifers which could be useful to estimate and correlate recharge at several sites due to semi arid conditions there is significant seasonal and annual variability in rainfall which affects the recharge of the aquifers under normal rainfall conditions the aquifers get recharged mainly during 5 7 rainfall events in a year with more than 30 mm rain amount dar 2014 the results reflect a non linear nature of the rainfall to recharge ratio and the fraction of rainfall that ultimately recharges the aquifer depends on the magnitude of the event the recharge is also low in flat homogeneous areas e g lerner et al 1990 but increases with relief heterogeneity and permeability such as in central parts of the study area andreu et al 2011 therefore future studies focusing on such aspects will help to understand the recharge variability in detail 4 5 broader implications the study has broader scientific and societal implications for managing karst aquifers as they are continuously under threat from natural and human stressors the hydrological information gained about the aquifers through this study leads to more precise groundwater estimates the total area of the narji limestone is 4333 km2 but only 2816 km2 outcrops and represents the unconfined aquifer with direct recharge assuming a constant average recharge coefficient of 49 11 mean of table 5 and an average annual rainfall of 750 mm an effective rainfall of 367 5 82 5 mm year recharges the karst aquifer this yields an annual groundwater volume of 1031 180 mcm in the entire narji aquifer this volume is 5 1 of the annual replenishable groundwater 20 390 mcm of telangana and andhra pradesh states cgwb 2017 and indicates the significance of the limestone aquifer in terms of water resources in this semi arid climate the total annual natural discharge 0 31 mcm through the three known springs s2 s3 and s4 is negligible as compared to the annual groundwater stored in the aquifer the rest of the groundwater volume could be baseflow to streams reservoirs draft for irrigation household and industrial use and flow to undocumented springs or storage under confined settings hence balancing these water volumes needs proper quantification and requires further studies the contribution of several factors that affect the groundwater is evaluated the δ2h vs δ18o plot of the post recharge groundwater and the mean of the above discussed three sample groups broadly define three sources fig 12 component 1 represents the anthropogenic member with its value equal to cave c1 stream water δ2h and δ18o of 7 4 and 3 25 the water of the stream remains concentrated in solutes even during the depleted monsoon period e g august 2010 and is affected by agriculture and other human activities therefore the sample represents a viable end member signature component 3 defines pre recharge or old groundwater prgw with δ2h and δ18o averaged between january to april when the recharge is usually nil and the values 26 2 and 4 01 respectively denote purely stored water component 2 represents infiltrating water and its δ2h and δ18o are defined by the weighted mean of sw monsoon this study using long term average annual values of hyderabad station located 200 km north of the area http www naweb iaea org napc ih ihs resources gnip html and mean of runoff over quartzite rocks during monsoons table 3 we slightly adjust δ2h and δ18o to 9 5 and 3 4 to enclose all the samples within the triangle end member mixing analysis calculates that towards the north of the area about 53 of the groundwater is composed of component 1 i e evaporated or mixed water from paddy as irf e g dewandel et al 2008 the groundwater towards group 3 constitutes 65 of pre stored water and very little from irf around group 2 41 of groundwater comes from irf 36 from rainwater recharge and 24 is the stored groundwater the irf in the group 2 and 3 which infiltrates from cultivated pulses vegetables and flowers is less and varies from 10 to 25 negrel et al 2011 average cl and d excess of three groups also support this interpretation 5 conclusions δ2h and δ18o of rain and groundwater were used to quantify recharge in a semi arid karst aquifer rainfall is more depleted in heavy isotopes than in western india and shows large temporal variability the lmwl δ 2 h 9 5 0 7 δ 18 o 5 6 1 8 n 21 r 2 0 91 p 0 01 indicates the effect of evaporation the sw monsoon is enriched and ne monsoon depleted in δ2h δ18o and d excess suggesting a difference of vapor sources weighted mean δ2h and δ18o are 10 5 and 1 03 in sw monsoon and 53 7 and 4 64 respectively in ne monsoon the wm cl in rainwater is 0 81 mg l compared to lmwl the gentle slope of δ2h vs δ18o in groundwater suggests an evaporation effect during infiltration the large variability of δ2h and δ18o in groundwater is due to karstification recharge processes land use and anthropogenic practices the major source of groundwater in the paddy dominated areas is irf which adds about 53 of the total groundwater storage annually this has long term potential impacts on the quality of the aquifer more negative δ2h and δ18o values of s2 and s4 suggest that the groundwater of these sites is mainly composed of old non evaporated water in the belum area s1 and c1 sites about 64 of the groundwater is added through rainfall recharge mainly as fast allogenic type through karstified pathways the average recharge in s2 s3 and s4 springs is 49 well developed epikarst also plays a significant role in the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer annually 1031 180 mcm groundwater replenishes the narji limestone which is a significant volume in a semi arid climate the study specifically focused on a karst aquifer and estimated the recharge for the first time in the indian context it also discusses several processes and factors which control the functioning of the karst aquifers therefore the study has importance in deliniating protection zones identification of sites for managed aquifer recharge mar and planning for the management of the

11915,the karst aquifers of india are an indispensable source of water to millions of people but the current globalization and climate change have altered the hydrological and other processes and thus have threatened the sustainability of the groundwater reserves in both quantity and quality the study aims to conceptualize the recharge processes and estimate the groundwater recharge in a karst aquifer located in semi arid southern india for this reason we used stable isotopes of rain and groundwater to understand aquifer dynamics and estimate the recharge volume as well as gain knowledge about different factors that are affecting the aquifers the isotope data show that the southwest monsoon rainwater has a weighted mean wm δ2h δ18o and chloride concentration of 10 5 1 03 and 0 81 mg l respectively the rainfall of other seasons is highly depleted in heavy isotopes the δ2h vs δ18o plots of rainwater and groundwater suggest that recharge is highly variable in space and time and depends on climatic factors as well a mixing model based on isotopes and chloride values shows that recharge around highly karstified areas of the aquifer is about 64 and largely infiltrates as fast allogenic type high hydraulic conductivity and fast transfer velocity make such areas very prone to contamination irrigation return flow contributes about 53 of the aquifer storage in the paddy cultivated areas which along with several other factors contaminate the groundwater this study provides an estimated annual replenishable groundwater volume of the narji limestone aquifer of 1031 180 mcm the chemical and isotope modeling enables a better understanding of water resources in fractured karst aquifer and the study encourages their use to investigate the karst hydrodynamics in india and elsewhere as well graphical abstract image 1 keywords isotopes recharge karst india 1 introduction understanding the groundwater recharge processes has helped to solve many water related problems all over the world accurate quantification of recharge volume has led to estimates of groundwater reserves preventing contamination problems and proposing suitable aquifer management strategies in many aquifer types however in karst aquifers estimating a precise recharge volume is quite difficult due to certain reasons recharge is a highly complex and spatiotemporally variable hydrological process healy and scanlon 2010 martínez santos and andreu 2010 zomlot et al 2015 the heterogeneity and anisotropy of karst aquifers increase the complexity in recharge calculation andreo et al 2010 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 furthermore in arid and semi arid regions variability of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration also produces uncertainty in recharge values scanlon et al 2006 jebreen et al 2018 several approaches and methodologies have been used to overcome such limitations in the assessment of groundwater the evaluation of stable isotopes of water coupled with different solutes is one of the widely used approaches to investigate karst groundwater and quantify their resources more accurately lakey and krothe 1996 perrin et al 2003 sappa et al 2018 iacurto et al 2020 the use of physicochemical parameters major ions and isotopes is an efficient tool for hydrological studies in karst aquifers but they need to be monitored frequently delbart et al 2014 the method has also been used in several aquifers in india e g kumar et al 1982 gupta et al 2005 sukhija et al 2006 mukherjee et al 2007 négrel et al 2011 but there are very few examples from carbonate aquifers of the country jeelani et al 2015 shah et al 2017 in india carbonate aquifers cover about 3 of land area and strategically provide groundwater to more than 35 million people dar et al 2014a in semi arid andhra pradesh telangana and karnataka the aquifers fulfill water demands for drinking irrigation and industrial use dar et al 2011 the groundwater quantity and quality have deteriorated in the last few decades dar et al 2014b 2017 limestone exploitation for building stones and cement manufacture which is expanding at 0 6 km2 year dar et al 2014a is a major threat to the aquifers besides climate change declining water resources rising water demands and urbanization also impact the aquifers and their sustainability dar et al 2014b the present study uses 2h and 18o isotopes of water coupled with water chemistry to improve the hydrogeological understanding of the karst aquifer and quantify groundwater recharge for better aquifer management the areas with karst aquifers are comparatively isolated and have typical land use as well as a lack of adequate data thus the study provides meaningful and useful support to further investigate such aquifers scientifically and generate suitable data set for advanced studies and utilize this worthwhile resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description karstified narji limestone is located in the kurnool district of andhra pradesh india fig 1 topographically the area is flat and the drainage of pal eru river a tributary of the river kundu mainly flows during monsoons the climate is semi arid with an average annual rainfall of 709 mm and potential evapotranspiration of 1800 mm the daily rainfall data of the belum site shows that the southwest sw monsoon season which extends from june september indian meteorological department contributes 60 65 of the annual rainfall and 20 25 occurs in the northeast ne monsoon season october november other months often remain dry and hot wind speed and relative humidity are high during the monsoon season fig 2 rain fed crops are mainly cultivated however paddy is grown year round northeast of the owk reservoir using canal water fig 1 groundwater is used for drinking and domestic purposes and irrigation of paddy vegetables and fruits rainwater stored in shallow ponds is also used for some domestic purposes prosopis juliflora is the common plant shrub which has a low rate of evapotranspiration oliveira et al 2017 the limestone is 100 200 m thick and overlain by owk shale and paniam quartzite producing confined aquifer conditions in some areas dar et al 2011 2014b shallow depressions sinkholes caves and springs are common in the area the general flow of groundwater is towards the southeast most of the borewells yield on average 10 l s from 20 to 65 m depth aquifer geometry and hydrological processes are highly complex in the area the area towards the northeast has up to 9 m thick soils a shallow water table and paddy cultivation and the groundwater shows high concentrations of solutes the central part of the area has intermittent soil cover which is 1 m in thickness dominantly fast recharge and mainly rain fed crops with patches of paddy vegetables and fruits fast recharge occurs through various karstif features such as a number of sinkholes inset in fig 1 that were mapped in this area it hosts the well known touristic belum cave c1 which has a permanent water flow at 46 m depth the belum spring s1 overflows provisionally during monsoons fig 3 a and its water level remains at the deepest level 5 5 m bgl during dry months the groundwater is also influenced by the infiltration of contaminated water stored in the abandoned limestone quarries which are mostly used for dumping the domestic waste in the area karst is almost barren in the catchments of permanent springs s2 s3 and s4 fig 1 where agricultural and other human influence on groundwater is much less pronounced s2 flows fig 3b from the base of the limestone in yadiki valley with a maximum discharge q of 8 l s the spring s3 discharges through a small opening at a higher elevation and maintains q up to 0 2 l s even during dry months both s2 and s3 represent phreatic storage like s1 munagamanu guha c2 and yaganti guha c3 are two well developed caves near these two springs dar et al 2011 c2 maintains streamflow at 0 1 l s several weeks after the monsoon the ephemeral s5 and s6 epikarst springs flow only during monsoon months when qmax reaches 15 l s at s5 and 14 l s at s6 due to monsoon recharge increased water flow and water level rise of 3 4 m was observed in a stream at 17 m depth inside the bandarlapalli cave c4 near s5 and s6 springs the limestone is karstified as indicated by a well developed unsaturated zone or epikarst particularly in the areas around the springs dar et al 2011 this zone captures the infiltrating water rapidly thus minimizing the effects of isotope modification of the recharging water groundwater is also fed by owk reservoir during its high levels noble and ansari 2017 an observation borewell at kolimigundla village shows lower water levels in may and high in october fig 4 estimated change in storage change in water level δh specific yield sy of the aquifer varies over a wide range 0 08 0 32 m average 0 2 m over the past ten years which indicates that recharge and groundwater draft are not in phase in the aquifer changing land use and different anthropogenic factors have highly affected the groundwater chemistry over the past years carbonate dissolution is the major process but sulfate nitrate and chloride generally termed snc are substantially related to human sources in the absence of rock water interaction dar et al 2014b a seasonal shift from pure ca mg hco3 waters to the contaminated water types is observed after recharge specific conductivity spc vs total hardness th shows that about 92 of samples have spc 600 μs cm and snc 20 of total anion sum out of which 50 of samples have spc between 1000 and 3800 μs cm fig 5 the regression equation between spc and th spc 1 1 th 405 5 r 2 0 2 this study compared with polluted karst waters globally spc 0 88 th 409 6 r 2 0 22 indicates that plenty of chemicals are added into the groundwater by agriculture and other human activities in addition to those related to carbonate dissolution krawczyk and ford 2006 2 2 sampling and analysis daily rainfall and pan evaporation were measured at belum cave station fig 1 during 2009 2011 daily rainfall data of 10 years 2002 2010 at kolimigundla village 3 km from belum was available from mandal revenue office kurnool twenty one rain samples were analyzed for chloride concentration and 2h and 18o isotopes fig 6 samples were collected immediately after rain events and refrigerated until analysis six karst springs belum s1 yadiki s2 yadiki s3 yaganti s4 rati s5 and dewalakona s6 were monitored every 3 4 months each year for three hydrological years 2009 2011 groundwater samples were also collected occasionally from borewells cave streams and runoff the procedure of collection and analysis of groundwater for solutes other than isotopes in the same samples has previously been discussed in dar et al 2017 samples in 10 ml glass vials covered with parafilm were analyzed for 2h and 18o delta values at csir national geophysical research institute hyderabad using isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms isoprime system using the co2 equilibration method for δ18o epstein and mayeda 1953 and zinc reduction method for δ2h coleman et al 1982 the usual precision of the instrument was 1 5 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o isotope data is discussed in the usual δ scale in as per v smow vienna standard mean ocean water according to δsample rsample rstandard 1 1000 with r 2h 1h or 18o 16o atomic ratios for the sample and standard respectively craig 1961a water level data of 15 days resolution from 2002 to 2011 at kolimigundla borewell was available from andhra pradesh groundwater department although the local pumping effects on the water level of the well could not be observed the effects are minimal as the borewell is located outside the village 2 3 methodology the methodology used in the paper is based on three main aspects of the work understanding the recharge processes estimating the rainfall contribution to the groundwater and calculating the proportion of groundwater that infiltrates from other sources such as irrigation return flow irf the δ2h δ18o and water chemistry data of the groundwater and rainwater were cross correlated which helped to characterize the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of the aquifer and to identify the main processes in the area a widely used two end member mixing model leaney et al 1993 lakey and krothe 1996 plummer et al 1998 perrin et al 2003 long and putnam 2004 aquilina et al 2005 delbart et al 2014 is used to evaluate the groundwater recharge from rainfall the method implies that groundwater after recharge represents a mixture q m with its chemical signature c m the mixture comprises pre recharge volume q pre multiplied by its signature and rainfall recharge fraction q r multiplied by its concentration this yields eq 1 1 q r q m c m c p r e c r c p r e the ratio of qr qm is the recharge from rainwater that infiltrates in the spring catchments the concentration of chemicals in the groundwater before recharge cpre was taken from the lowest discharge events of the spring hydrographs and then averaged over the hydrological year cr is the concentration of recharge causing rainfall events and its value was taken as a weighted mean of rainfall the method has yielded better estimates using conservative tracers such as chloride δ2h and 18o e g doctor et al 2006 binet et al 2017 which normally do not exchange between water and aquifer matrix at biospheric temperatures wood 1999 toran 2006 the fractionation of these tracers in the unsaturated zone is also minimal particularly where epikarst is well developed areas other than the northeastern parts of the study site as the infiltrating water travels fast into the groundwater storage dar et al 2011 the epikarst layer in these areas is about 10 15 m in thickness the rainfall water level relationship of the kolimigundla observation well was also used to estimate site specific recharge generally in common settings a rainfall event distributes into runoff and evapotranspiration and a part recharges the groundwater and increases the water table from the well hydrograph water level rise δh was calculated corresponding to different rain events fig 4 a correlation between δh and the amount of respective rain events leads to recharge estimation the method assumes that an increase in water level in the well is only due to rainfall recharge as infiltration from sources such as canals and ponded irrigation is negligible the effect of abstraction is considered minimal as no pumping is carried out from the well by the andhra pradesh groundwater department which uses it exclusively for recording the water level data for research purposes a three end member mixing analysis was carried out using the chemical and isotope data to calculate the contribution of different sources in the groundwater mainly irf which is affecting the quality of the groundwater particularly in the intensively irrigated paddy fields of northeastern parts of the study area 3 results 3 1 isotope and chloride values in rainwater statistics of δ2h and δ18o values of the rain n 21 and mean and weighted mean wm values corresponding to the southwest sw and northeast ne monsoon rainfall are presented in table 1 the data are plotted in figs 6 and 7 δ2h ranges from 58 8 to 9 0 with a mean 21 0 22 4 δ18o varies from 5 81 to 1 75 with a mean 1 60 2 24 the d excess δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 ranges from 18 85 to 5 32 with an average value 8 16 7 43 the weighted mean wm δ2h and δ18o for 2010 11 rainfall is 22 9 and 2 0 respectively wm of δ2h and δ18o in sw monsoon of 2010 is 15 4 and 1 56 and in 2011 the values are 5 5 and 0 51 respectively and the average wm of two year sw monsoon is 10 5 and 1 03 respectively yadava et al 2016 also showed that the ranges of δ2h δ18o and d excess of rainwater of the area during 2010 11 were 93 69 to 19 57 8 32 to 1 94 and 27 09 to 9 12 respectively the mean standard errors and wm in parentheses are similar for this study δ2h 29 62 28 46 31 5 δ18o 2 56 2 65 3 1 d excess 9 11 12 07 n 16 the cl of rainwater ranges between 0 20 and 2 41 mg l and its wm is 0 81 mg l the mean 0 73 0 2 mg l is similar to the estimated 0 77 mg l of soumya et al 2009 this suggests a main atmospheric origin of chloride in rainfall and hence increases its applicability as a tracer in recharge estimation 3 2 isotope and physicochemical parameters in groundwater the value of stable isotopes of groundwater from six springs and the physicochemical parameters are statistically analyzed in table 2 the δ2h vs δ18o plot fig 7 shows a large spatial variability in the groundwater of the area δ2h ranges from 30 3 at s2 to 8 9 at s5 similarly δ18o ranges from 4 45 at s2 to an enriched value of 0 45 at s6 δ2h of bore wells ranges from 17 4 at b13 to 3 7 at b12 whereas δ18o is 2 30 at b13 and 0 95 at b12 table 3 the linear plots of discharge major ions and isotopes of spring waters shown in figs 8 10 show the intrasite variability of the aquifer the values at each site were analyzed and the results are statistically presented in table 2 the range mean and standard deviation of different parameters show that the spring sites are easily differentiated from each other which indicates a high heterogeneity within the aquifer a few samples of runoff water cave streams and epikarst springs were also analyzed once during the study period and the values table 3 justify some of the results for the aforementioned springs for example in fig 9 the data of the epikarst spring and cave stream correlate well with the spring water of s2 located nearby the runoff water from the quartzite shows similar values as rainwater and this water rapidly enters the limestone aquifer through the sinkholes generally located at the boundary of the quartzite dar et al 2011 4 discussion 4 1 rainwater isotopes 2h and 18o and climate the rainwater is relatively depleted in δ2h and δ18o as compared to western india deshpande et al 2003 mainly due to rayleigh rain out effect mook 2006 the local meteoric water line lmwl is defined eq 2 and fig 7 by a non weighted least square regression equation 2 δ 2 h 9 5 0 7 δ 18 o 5 6 1 8 n 21 r 2 0 91 p 0 01 the slope 9 5 0 7 and intercept 5 6 1 8 are slightly greater than the lmwl for mumbai 8 3 0 9 δ18o 7 97 0

intercept 11 27 0 65 rozanski et al 1993 because of substantial local evaporation under semi arid conditions yadava et al 2016 generally relative humidity rh of 25 75 produces a slope of 4 5 in lmwl here the higher slope is due to high rh range 50 80 in the area fig 2 seasonality of the indian summer monsoon is noticeable by the mean and wm δ2h δ18o and d excess and data variability table 1 fig 7

monsoon mainly indicates an inland source and greater travel distance of vapors and effect of rainout effect e g faure and mensing 2015 a gentler slope 5 8 in ne monsoon is mainly indicative of high temperature and evaporation in these months compared to a higher slope 6 6 of sw rain which is attributed to 70 rh between june september fig 2 the seasonal rainfall is also differentiated by the wm values which are enriched in sw monsoon and depleted in ne monsoon samples table 1 empirical correlation amount effect i e depletion of isotopes with the amount of rainfall is also observed particularly in sw monsoon when rainfall is 30 mm mainly because of local climatic effects rozanski et al 1993 lekshmy et al 2014 jasechko 2019 evaporation ev modifies the isotope dynamics before recharge takes place as observed by a positive correlation temperature effect jasechko 2019 between δ values and daily evaporation eq 3 3 δ 2 h 9 2 e v 68 93 r 2 0 46 a n d δ 18 o 0 82 e v 5 7 r 2 0 3

were used in calculating the contribution of rainfall infiltration in the groundwater 4 2 hydrology of karst groundwater using δ2h δ18o and physicochemical parameters statistics of δ2h δ18o and physicochemical parameters tables 2 and 3 and bivariate plot fig 7 show a large variability of groundwater sources and behavior most of the groundwater falls within the sw monsoon cluster illustrating it as a major recharge source however the samples s2 s3 and s4 fall between two contrasting rain types because recharge in the highly karstified catchments occurs during both seasons an epikarst spring in s2 s3 catchment shows ec 708 μs cm cl 30 53 mg l δ2h 22 8 and δ18o 3 15 similar to these springs reflecting a high connectivity between the aquifer zones the epikarst springs s5 and s6 show large variability in isotope composition the groundwater isotope data fits the least square regression equation eq 4 fig 7 4 δ 2 h 2 6 0 26 δ 18 o 11 1 0 64 n 69 r 2 0 61 p 0 01 due to the large scatter of groundwater data the regression equation may be physically less significant but the pattern of the samples shows linearity very low slope 2 6 and small d excess mean 0 79 of groundwater than lmwl reflect the evaporation influence clark and fritz 1997 as observed by previous studies dar et al 2017 evaporative isotope fractionation of water occurs during infiltration sheffer et al 2011 and by the precipitation of calcite from drip water oster et al 2012 the fractionation will be less in the epikarst zone than in diffuse infiltration through the soil cover drip water collected in the yadiki cave c2 on august 10 2010 table 3 had δ2h 27 2 and δ18o 1 06 whereas the wm of rainwater events before this date had 21 3 and 1 56 respectively compared to groundwater of s2 and s3 fig 1 the enriched drip water particularly in δ18o reflects the evaporative effect similar behavior was observed in the isotopes mainly δ18o of belum drip water average δ2h and δ18o 4 7 and 0 62 and wm rainwater 31 and 2 67 during 2010 11 yadava et al 2016 the evaporation effect on δ2h and δ18o is different mainly because evaporation occurs in a windy unsaturated atmosphere with varying ambient humidity in which kinetic fractionation dominates the equilibrium type furthermore the difference in diffusion rates of the two isotopes produces prominent evaporative fractionation in 18o the magnitude of fractionation also varies in the two caves because c2 is deep with mainly closed conduits contrary to belum cave with most of the passages open to the atmosphere inside c1 the mean annual air temperature is 27 c seasonal variations 3 c and mean annual rh is 88 while the surface mean annual temperature is 30 c but the mean annual rh is 55 yadava et al 2016 the partly evaporated infiltrating water recharges and consequently impacts the groundwater differently in different hydrogeological settings for example the slope is more gentle for s1 and c1 samples than other springs fig 7 the temporal variability of groundwater data at different sites also illustrates the karst aquifer heterogeneity in spring s1 generally a rain event of 30 mm immediately produces flow of 30 50 l s that is sustained for 3 4 days between 5 and november 12 2009 80 mm rain increased δh by 4 m similarly a single event of 67 8 mm between 11 and august 12 2010 increased δh by 3 m these events resulted in dilution of groundwater solutes e g spc decreased from 948 to 434 μs cm and yielded δ2h and δ18o similar to wm of sw monsoon i e depletion of values fig 8a the mean value of different parameters during high flowing and low or non flowing conditions is presented in table 4 thus quick response of water level and solutes isotopes even within hours indicates rapid infiltration through preferential pathways high hydraulic conductivity transmissivity fast transfer velocity and small lag time between recharge and rainfall ford and williams 2007 dar 2014 almost overlapping chemical and isotope data between s1 and c1 stream fig 8 also signify these properties e g marfia et al 2004 turbid muddy water of the spring during high discharge periods fig 3a shows that because of these aquifer properties the contaminants from the catchment are not properly filtered during infiltration which makes the groundwater highly vulnerable to pollution the temporal data of groundwater at s2 s3 and s4 springs is shown in fig 9a b and c despite fewer samples a good association is observed between ec bicarbonate and isotopes with the discharge and rainfall the periods of high q grey bars generally have lower values than in low discharge conditions table 4 the data of the munagamanu cave stream c2 in table 3 and marked in fig 9a correlate well with s2 and s3 indicating similar catchment and good connectivity between the springs and cave the stream shows average ec 453 μs cm δ2h 23 8 and δ18o 3 95 in monsoon months similarly an epikarst spring near c2 es in table 3 and marked in fig 9a and drip water of c2 also correlate with s2 spring no clear variability could be established in s5 and s6 due to very few samples fig 10 the stream inside the bandarlapalli cave c4 during the dry season january 5 2010 showed ec 477 μs cm δ2h 27 and δ18o 3 6 table 3 similar to that of c2 stream ec 455 μs cm δ2h 24 4 and δ18o 4 22 denoting phreatic storage in both the caves spatial hydrogeological and hydrodynamic variability is also reflected by the groundwater δ2h and δ18o data the location of the samples in fig 7 and the statistical values of different chemicals show that the samples can broadly be grouped into three categories samples b3 b9 b10 b11 and b12 group 1 have comparably enriched values the isotope fractionation that causes this enrichment is mainly because of diffuse recharge high evapotranspiration and irf inset of fig 7 it has been reported that transpiration fractionates water isotopes and stores enriched water in plant and biomass which following decomposition contributes to the soil system and ultimately groundwater farquhar et al 2007 sprenger et al 2016 springs s2 s3 and s4 group 3 are differentiated by depleted δ2h and δ18o and their proximity to the meteoric water line is indicative of little evaporation before groundwater recharge jasechko 2019 recharge also occurs during ne monsoons in these karstified catchments and a lack of agriculture and other human activities inhibits further isotope fractionation in the groundwater samples s1 b1 b2 b5 b8 and b13 group 2 possess mixed isotopic and chemical character both fast and diffuse infiltration irf from rain fed and irrigated vegetable flower crops and other human induced factors cause extensive mixing of groundwater samples s5 and s6 show large variability and do not exclusively fall in any group these catchments are devoid of any soil cover and the aquifer is barren with well developed epikarst exposed in places further studies on a larger number of samples can validate such observations 4 3 recharge estimation the mean values of δ2h δ18o and cl in groundwater table 4 during peak flow concentrations after recharge cm and low flow periods pre event concentrations cpre were used in eq 1 to estimate the recharge percentages for the spring sites table 5 using cr equal to wm rainfall δ2h 10 5 and δ18o 1 03 average cm of seven recharge events in s1 fig 8a and the corresponding mean cpre give a recharge of 59 9 and 66 1 using δ2h and δ18o respectively chloride concentration in s1 groundwater ranges from 3 mg l during monsoons to 70 mg l in dry months using sw monsoon wm cl of 0 81 mg l and an average clm and clpre give a mean recharge of 67 for three recharge events fig 8a the recharge average 64 is in the range of percolation rate 40 90 modeling by δ2h and δ18o of rain and drip water in belum cave yadava et al 2016 the data of the c1 stream fig 8b table 2 show the large anthropic influence and are not suitable for computing recharge for example cl is very high compared to s1 and δ2h and δ18o also show large evaporative fractionation effects inside the cave as discussed above average cm of δ2h δ18o and cl and cpre values of spring s2 table 4 give recharge of 45 5 49 4 and 50 using those three tracers respectively table 5 for spring s3 the respective recharge values are 21 3 28 9 and 46 2 and the values are 54 9 47 2 and 41 5 for s4 because of a similar hydrogeological setup a mean of s2 and s4 was taken equal to 48 for spring s5 fig 10 average δ2h and δ18o values of 14 0 and 1 38 during peak flow periods are similar to the wm of sw rainwater similarly in s6 δ2h and δ18o of 11 2 and 0 45 measured on september 23 2010 are similar to the wm of rainwater during this month this shows that these sites have high connectivity between the unsaturated epikarst and the saturated zones table 5 shows that recharge follows s1 s2 s4 s3 the highest value around s1 and c1 catchment indicates a karst dominated setting in which several karst features promote fast allogenic and autogenic recharge dar et al 2011 water level variation at kolimigundla observation well fig 4 is compared to the daily rainfall to estimate recharge the deepest level 19 25 m bgl was observed in 2003 and the shallowest 0 4 m bgl in 2007 generally water level sharply declines from october to december water level rise δh of several events shaded bars plotted against the event rainfall fig 11 shows a good correlation r2 0 91 the trend line meets the abscissa at 195 mm except for two outliers of unexpectedly large water level change this amount of event rain called rainfall intercept generally becomes runoff and or evaporation the remaining rainfall event volume minus rainfall intercept infiltrates and produces groundwater recharge estimated recharge ranges from 11 1 in 2004 to 65 9 in 2005 the average annual recharge is 150 8 mm i e 36 7 of annual rainfall out of 12 events fig 4 table 6 7 values have a range of 42 7 65 9 and are consistent with the results from spring sites the lower recharge in the rest of the events could be due to less rainfall or unforeseen change in water level further the recharge value 65 5 calculated from the 2010 water level data of the bore well matches with the estimates using the chemical and isotope data of the s1 spring of the same year the s1 spring is nearly 3 km from the well the specific yield computed from the good correlation between the recharge and water level rise is equal to 2 3 average value corresponding to the regression line slope such a value is in agreement with a fractured karstified unconfined aquifer context dar et al 2015 gec 2017 4 4 sensitivity of estimates recharge estimates from the springs and observation well show consistency using δ2h δ18o cl and water level as indicated by the mean and standard deviations however the observed deviation and uncertainty arise because recharge in karst is highly complex and estimation depends on certain factors assumptions jones et al 2000 one of the reasons could be the modification of isotopes and chemistry in soil and the epikarst and anthropogenic influence on the tracers the estimated recharge is somewhat different at s2 and s3 using δ2h and δ18o but the values closely match when using chloride uncertainty due to analytical procedures is negligible because of the good precision of the data the recharge values fall within the upper range of those calculated from the water level fluctuation method using a simple model and soil water balance approach dar 2014 estimated that 29 of the annual rainfall infiltrates in the belum area with a fast to diffuse ratio of 16 13 this value is close to the one calculated at the well site similarly injected tritium indicates that diffuse recharge is 14 of annual rainfall in this aquifer with thick and continuous soil cover dar et al 2015 however the values from the present study are more representative of a karst system as the study was carried out using more karst specific approaches by comparison the percentage of annual rainfall that infiltrates in similar karst settings is 56 85 in morocco el ouali et al 1999 47 in saudi arabia de vries and simmers 2002 27 55 in portuguese algarve de vries and simmers 2002 30 55 in southern spain andreu et al 2011 alcala et al 2010 43 67 in syria al charideh 2011 and 17 53 in florida usa ritorto et al 2009 this shows that natural tracer and water table fluctuation methods provide accurate and realistic estimates of total recharge diffuse and direct compared to local and conventional approaches with large assumptions however increasing the number of samples and using more specific methodologies would reduce the uncertainty in results various agencies e g central ground water board cgwb and andhra pradesh groundwater department and some ngos are collecting water level data from these aquifers which could be useful to estimate and correlate recharge at several sites due to semi arid conditions there is significant seasonal and annual variability in rainfall which affects the recharge of the aquifers under normal rainfall conditions the aquifers get recharged mainly during 5 7 rainfall events in a year with more than 30 mm rain amount dar 2014 the results reflect a non linear nature of the rainfall to recharge ratio and the fraction of rainfall that ultimately recharges the aquifer depends on the magnitude of the event the recharge is also low in flat homogeneous areas e g lerner et al 1990 but increases with relief heterogeneity and permeability such as in central parts of the study area andreu et al 2011 therefore future studies focusing on such aspects will help to understand the recharge variability in detail 4 5 broader implications the study has broader scientific and societal implications for managing karst aquifers as they are continuously under threat from natural and human stressors the hydrological information gained about the aquifers through this study leads to more precise groundwater estimates the total area of the narji limestone is 4333 km2 but only 2816 km2 outcrops and represents the unconfined aquifer with direct recharge assuming a constant average recharge coefficient of 49 11 mean of table 5 and an average annual rainfall of 750 mm an effective rainfall of 367 5 82 5 mm year recharges the karst aquifer this yields an annual groundwater volume of 1031 180 mcm in the entire narji aquifer this volume is 5 1 of the annual replenishable groundwater 20 390 mcm of telangana and andhra pradesh states cgwb 2017 and indicates the significance of the limestone aquifer in terms of water resources in this semi arid climate the total annual natural discharge 0 31 mcm through the three known springs s2 s3 and s4 is negligible as compared to the annual groundwater stored in the aquifer the rest of the groundwater volume could be baseflow to streams reservoirs draft for irrigation household and industrial use and flow to undocumented springs or storage under confined settings hence balancing these water volumes needs proper quantification and requires further studies the contribution of several factors that affect the groundwater is evaluated the δ2h vs δ18o plot of the post recharge groundwater and the mean of the above discussed three sample groups broadly define three sources fig 12 component 1 represents the anthropogenic member with its value equal to cave c1 stream water δ2h and δ18o of 7 4 and 3 25 the water of the stream remains concentrated in solutes even during the depleted monsoon period e g august 2010 and is affected by agriculture and other human activities therefore the sample represents a viable end member signature component 3 defines pre recharge or old groundwater prgw with δ2h and δ18o averaged between january to april when the recharge is usually nil and the values 26 2 and 4 01 respectively denote purely stored water component 2 represents infiltrating water and its δ2h and δ18o are defined by the weighted mean of sw monsoon this study using long term average annual values of hyderabad station located 200 km north of the area http www naweb iaea org napc ih ihs resources gnip html and mean of runoff over quartzite rocks during monsoons table 3 we slightly adjust δ2h and δ18o to 9 5 and 3 4 to enclose all the samples within the triangle end member mixing analysis calculates that towards the north of the area about 53 of the groundwater is composed of component 1 i e evaporated or mixed water from paddy as irf e g dewandel et al 2008 the groundwater towards group 3 constitutes 65 of pre stored water and very little from irf around group 2 41 of groundwater comes from irf 36 from rainwater recharge and 24 is the stored groundwater the irf in the group 2 and 3 which infiltrates from cultivated pulses vegetables and flowers is less and varies from 10 to 25 negrel et al 2011 average cl and d excess of three groups also support this interpretation 5 conclusions δ2h and δ18o of rain and groundwater were used to quantify recharge in a semi arid karst aquifer rainfall is more depleted in heavy isotopes than in western india and shows large temporal variability the lmwl δ 2 h 9 5 0 7 δ 18 o 5 6 1 8 n 21 r 2 0 91 p 0 01 indicates the effect of evaporation the sw monsoon is enriched and ne monsoon depleted in δ2h δ18o and d excess suggesting a difference of vapor sources weighted mean δ2h and δ18o are 10 5 and 1 03 in sw monsoon and 53 7 and 4 64 respectively in ne monsoon the wm cl in rainwater is 0 81 mg l compared to lmwl the gentle slope of δ2h vs δ18o in groundwater suggests an evaporation effect during infiltration the large variability of δ2h and δ18o in groundwater is due to karstification recharge processes land use and anthropogenic practices the major source of groundwater in the paddy dominated areas is irf which adds about 53 of the total groundwater storage annually this has long term potential impacts on the quality of the aquifer more negative δ2h and δ18o values of s2 and s4 suggest that the groundwater of these sites is mainly composed of old non evaporated water in the belum area s1 and c1 sites about 64 of the groundwater is added through rainfall recharge mainly as fast allogenic type through karstified pathways the average recharge in s2 s3 and s4 springs is 49 well developed epikarst also plays a significant role in the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer annually 1031 180 mcm groundwater replenishes the narji limestone which is a significant volume in a semi arid climate the study specifically focused on a karst aquifer and estimated the recharge for the first time in the indian context it also discusses several processes and factors which control the functioning of the karst aquifers therefore the study has importance in deliniating protection zones identification of sites for managed aquifer recharge mar and planning for the management of the

11916,silicate plays a vital role in the coastal regions biogeochemistry submarine groundwater discharge sgd is one of the significant silicate sources to the coastal regions the silicate concentrations in groundwater gw are considerably higher than in neighbouring coastal waters as a result sgd increases the concentrations of silicate in the coastal waters and influences the marine ecosystem to examine the spatial and temporal variability in silicate concentrations and export of silicate to the adjacent coastal waters through sgd groundwater samples are collected at 90 locations along the east and west coast regions of india during the dry and wet periods this study revealed that the concentration of dissolved silicate was lower during the dry period than during the wet period the soil silicate concentration displayed a significant variability and has a good correlation with silicate concentrations in the coastal groundwater of india silicate in groundwater showed significant linear relations with bacterial respiration bicarbonate and pco2 and inverse relation with dissolved oxygen saturation suggesting that remineralization and weathering processes are responsible for the silicate in the coastal groundwater of india the average sgd of freshwater varied between 1 6 104 m3 day and 1 75 1011 m3 day from the indian coastal groundwater into adjacent coastal regions the fluxes of silicate through sgd to the bay of bengal was estimated as 1 97 0 85 tg 1 tg 1012 g and 3 22 1 56 tg to the eastern arabian sea the estimated total sgd fluxes of silicate to the northern indian ocean from east and west coastal regions of india is 3 07 1 15 tg y and it is almost three times higher than silicate discharged from monsoonal rivers 1 03 0 25 tg y the silicate through sgd from indian coastal groundwater contributes 7 of silicate to the total silicate export to the world coastal regions through sgd graphical abstract image 1 keywords silicate sgd bay of bengal arabian sea groundwater coastal regions 1 introduction since the beginning of time water from beneath the ground has been used for domestic purposes irrigation and livestock although the precise nature of its occurrence was unknown several methods have been invented for bringing the groundwater to the surface and groundwater usage has increased ever since in the entire world groundwater is a composition of several inorganic and organic components like nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate silicate anions cations metals minerals hydrocarbons carbohydrates amino acids proteins pesticides urea etc kurwadkar 2019 the qualitative and quantitative features of groundwater depend on several factors such as geological structure the composition of minerals land usage agriculture industrialization and forest almuhisen et al 2019 the export of these compounds along with freshwater to adjacent coastal waters is called submarine groundwater discharge sgd the sgd may vary from the region to region based on the geological structure of india and most sgd can expect in the regions where the soil have more porosity along the indian coast kumar et al 2020 a few studies were addressed the sgd in india along with the arabian and bay of bengal coast in the west coast jacob et al 2009 rahaman and singh 2012 sartandel et al 2014 kavitha et al 2017 and in east coast rengarajan and sarma 2015 chakrabarti et al 2018 were reported the sgd fluxes at some particular regions of india by using ra rn sr isotopic studies a very recent study of kumar et al 2020 reported that sgd takes place along the coastal waters of arabian sea and bay of bengal along with nitrate and phosphate into coastal waters of arabian sea and bay of bengal this sgd plays a vital role in the biogeochemistry of coastal waters short and burdick 1996 garce et al 2011 ryan et al 2008 lecher et al 2015 mamahon et al 2017 according to known et al 2014 the amount of sgd is 3 4 times greater than the surface runoff although the sgd values vary from region to region the amount of solute carried by sgd into the coastal regions was greater than that of the number of solute particles carried by river discharge lujjendijk et al 2020 nutrients such as din nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate into the coastal regions comes from various sources like river discharge sarma et al 2009 krishna et al 2016 aerosol deposition srinivas et al 2013 yadav 2016 sgd rengarajan and sarma 2015 kumar et al 2020 sewage discharge jin et al 2017a coastal upwelling sarma et al 2013 b however silicate can enter into the coastal waters mainly through river discharge sgd and coastal water upwelling in which coastal water upwelling brings very little amount of silicate into the surface waters of bay of bengal than the arabian sea as stratification plays a key role in the bay of bengal naqvi et al 2000 sarma et al 2013 a b in recent years river discharge into coastal regions getting reduced because of drop in precipitation over india and the construction of more dams on rivers kumar 2014 so the only major source of silicate into coastal regions is through sgd silicate is one of the important nutrients which can modify the phytoplankton community and composition in fresh and marine water egge and aksnes 1992 berdalet et al 1996 pan and subbarao 1997 wu and chou 2003 yadav et al 2016 jin et al 2017b few studies in coastal waters noticed that the change in the nutrient concentrations and composition have a significant impact on the phytoplankton community shift especially with silicate to nitrate ratios officer and ryther 1980 rabalais et al 1996 dortch et al 2001 gilpin et al 2004 davidson et al 2012 yadaav et al 2016 conducted the microcosm experiments in the coastal bay of bengal during different seasons and found that a sharp decrease in the diatoms to dinoflagellates ratios during the low silicate periods in the study region in addition to this prakash et al 2017 hypothesized that the changes in si n ratios were the possible reason for the occurrence of frequent harmful algal boolms habs dinoflagellates in the coastal waters of the arabian sea the above set of studies are suggesting that it is very impotent to understand and monitor the different sources of silicate into coastal regions and their export studies in all coastal regions of the world therefore the main aims of this study are to 1 investigate the variation in silicate concentrations in the groundwater near the coastal regions of indian during wet and dry periods 2 examine the potential sources of silicate to the groundwater along the indian coast concerning the geological setting and 3 estimate the silicate fluxes to adjacent coastal waters the bay of bengal and the arabian sea using available sgd rates in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the terrain on the indian subcontinent is varied ranging from the himalayan peaks to the indian ocean india has a 7517 km coastline

odisha od and west bengal wb are the coastal states along the east coast groundwater samples were collected at 90 sites wells along the indian s west and east coast during the dry non monsoon and the wet monsoon periods fig 1 2 2 hydro climatology over the indian sub continent india has an amazing variety of climate changing regions varying from tropical in the south to himalayan in the north and temperate where elevated territories receive continuous winter snowfall the thar desert and himalayas have a strong influence on the indian climate the mountains of the himalayas act as a wall to the cold katabatic winds that blow down from central asia maintaining most of the indian subcontinent warmer than the majority of areas at the same latitudes during the summer season the northern parts of india suffer from severe summer conditions as well as very cold temperatures that drop below freezing during the winter in contrast indian coastal regions where the temperature is uniform and rains are very common attri and tyagi 2010 because of seasonal reversal winds from january to july india is mainly influenced by two rainy seasons south west and north east during the winter season cold and dry air blows from the northern latitudes in a northeasterly direction over the indian subcontinent the summer monsoon southwest monsoon occurs when the north parts of india get to be hotter and draw the high humid winds above the ocean causing a reversal of winds over this region this is a significant feature controlling the indian climate approximately 75 of the annual rainfall falls during four month periods june to september the other one is the northeast monsoon winter monsoon which happens from november to february the precipitation over the indian subcontinent because of the northeast monsoon is comparatively less than that of the summer monsoon soman and kumar 1990 the climate difference may be higher than in any other similar area of the world the amount of rainfall received at different locations within the same country varies significantly the annual average rainfall in western rajasthan is less than 130 mm while in meghalaya the highest rainfall is 1140 mm at mausiram and chirapunji the pattern of rainfall demonstrates the countries different climate regimes which range from humid in the north east to dry in north west 2 3 geology of the indian subcontinent india has a diverse geological system some parts of india have a rocky geological structure that dates back to various geologic periods many of the rocks are severely altered and deformed only certain depositions contain new intervention alluvial that is still digenesis in addition to this a vast quantity of minerals deposits found in the indian subcontinent with a wide variety of compositions guha 2010 moverover archaeological records of india revealed that they contain more fossils of plant vertebrates invertebrates and stromatolites the geographical land area of india is divided into three parts such as vindhyan deccan traps and gondwana the formation of the deccan trap was happened after breaking away from the gondwana plate and it moved towards the north passing over the reunion hotspot in the indian ocean it covers almost gujarat gj madhya pradesh mp a few parts in karnataka ka maharashtra mh andhra pradesh ap http bhubankosh com the thickness of the deccan traps is 150 m on the east side of india and in the western region it is 3000 m the deccan trap rocks have a new type of soils known as black cotton which are formed due to forced weathering and soil emotion and the main composition of these rocks are the tholeiitic basalts 95 other rock types contain alkali basalts carbonated minerals lamprophyre nepheline guptha and malhotra 2000 the gondwana and vidyan cover most

largest source of coal in india containing up to 98 of indian coal deposits gondwana system is most common in coastal regions and major deposits are at rajahmundry ongal south krishna ap cuttack od these rocks mostly consist of clay grit shells sandstone conglomerate guha 2010 and the mineralogy of india also varied from states to state table 1 shahid and naseem 2017 noticed that alluvial black red and yellow laterite and arid are the most common soils in india the very common soil in india is red and yellow soil in central and some parts of coastal regions such as ga kl ka tn ap and od this soil type was produced mainly by the disintegration of archaic basalt rocks such as gneisses and granites as well as these rocks are rich in magnesium mg iron fe and poor in nitrogen and phosphorus kaolinitic minerals are the main components of clay fractions of the soils shahid and naseem 2017 alluvial soil is indians largest and most important soil group found primarily along the country s coastline this alluvial soil is dark in colour with more siliceous and aged alluvium is the composition of lime nodules with less nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter desert soils are found in rajasthan and the northern parts of gujarat this soil contains more soluble minerals and siliceous compounds and is low in inorganic carbon and nitrogen the black soil is thick and dark in colour with high clay content a few locations in the coastal states of mh gj ap and tn and western central and southern states are also covered with this soil this soil is formed because of deccan trap basalts and they got their name from their colour which could be due to the presence of titanium iron and calcium and magnesium carbonates shahid and naseem 2017 table 1 2 4 sample collection and analysis during the wet monsoon and dry non monsoon periods one sample of groundwater was collected every 100 km along indian s coastal line for a total of 90 samples in each period table 1 and all the samples

5a indicating that weathering processes with carbon dioxide as carbonic acid is also one of the responsible processes for silicate in groundwater during both wet and dry periods respectively according to davil 2018 if geochemical weathering was the prevailing mechanism for providing higher concentrations of silicate in the groundwater in such case bicarbonate ions could also increase and is corroborated with the results of our study during both wet r2 0 53 p 0 05 and dry r2 0 61 p 0 05 periods vandevivere et al 1994 noticed that dissolution of silicate minerals can also happen by bacterial activity at neutral ph so as silicate showed a linear positive relation with bacterial respiration rates this could also one of the possible sources of silicate in the coastal groundwater in addition to this silicate showed significant positive relations with chloride in ap r2 0 52 p 0 05 and tn r2 0 61 p 0 05 states on the east coast and with gj on the west coast r2 0 65 p 0 05 and also chloride have a positive correlation with tds in these states especially in dry period suggesting that salinity instruction soil leaching also another possible source of silicate into study region 4 2 soil and lithology s effect on groundwater chemistry alluvial red and yellow and black soils are abundant along the indian coast fig 1 table 1 bhattacharyya and kumar 2015 except for gj where alluvial soil is prevalent red and yellow soils are the most predominant soil types along the indian s west coast alluvial soils are typical along india s east coast fig 1 many of these soils have diverse minerals organic matter and nutrient composition shahid and naseem 2017 even though both alluvial and red and yellow soils contain large amounts of siliceous content the silica percentage in these two alluvial soils is higher than in red and yellow soil shahid and naseem 2017 alluvial plain dominated the eastern part of coastal india in concurrent with soil profile the state average concentrations of groundwater silicate is high in tn wb and od but poor in ap state groundwater during both the periods table 3 on the west coast the highest groundwater silicate was noticed in gj where the dominant soil type is alluvial fig 1 table 3 in the dry period also higher silicate quantities are noticed in the eastern region of coastal india where all these areas have been covered by alluvial soils this suggests that the silicate concentrations in indian groundwater significantly influenced by the soil structure and composition the most typical types of minerals in india are quartz felspar granite ball clay china clay calcite dolomite pyrite magnetite limestone coal hematite sandstone chromite bauxite fire clay silica sand zircon sillimanite kyanite silica sand bentonite diatomite lignite table 1 in east coast majority of the minerals are enriched with silica than west coast table 1 during the wet period more silicate concentrations were noticed in the east coast region groundwater table 3 which is possible due to the presence of more siliceous type minerals such as quartz granite feldspar china clay pyroxenite ball clay sandstone fire clay which has silica percentage in between 50 and 60 and mh and gj states are also have higher concentrations of silicate during the same period it is also due to more mineral water interaction as these two regions also have the majority of silicate mineral type structure table 1 furthermore bsk kumar personal communication noticed that during the wet period rock water interaction was the dominant process occurring in the east and west coast groundwater in india fig 6 4 3 impact of biogeochemical parameters on silicate concentrations in indian coastal groundwater the variability and distribution of silicate concentrations in groundwater may depend on several processes such as bacterial respiration weathering ion and reverse ion exchange and rock water interaction significant linear positive correlations were noticed to silicate in groundwater with bacterial respiration rates table 4 figs 4a and 5a pco2 table 4 figs 4b and 5b hco3 table 4 figs 4c and 5c and inverse relation with do saturation table 4 figs 4d and 5d during wet and dry periods this suggests that the biological activity of bacteria and dissolution weathering of silicate rocks by carbonic acid also contributed to the silicate concentrations in the groundwater during the wet and dry periods the groundwater silicate concentration was higher in the wet period 93 09 66 85 mg l than dry period 69 06 40 79 mg l along the east and west coast of india and it is consistent with higher bacterial respiration rates during the wet period 3 5 2 mg l h than the dry period 0 85 0 5 mg l h table 2 therefore higher concentrations of silicate during the wet period might have due to higher rock water interaction along with bacterial remineralization and leaching of soil silicate resulting in the release of more silicate into the groundwater the strong correlation of groundwater silicate with bacterial respiration pco2 hco3 and do saturation might have the reasons for the accumulation of silicate in groundwater 4 4 silicate export to neighbouring coastal regions from coastal groundwater the dissolved silicate levels in coastal waters of india vary between 0 06 and 2 4 mg l sarma et al 2013 a b and the silicate levels in coastal groundwater are always higher than coastal waters tables 2 and 3 because of this feature there are more chances of groundwater seepage into the adjacent coastal environment and this seepage can cause significant changes in coastal waters many studies reported that the east coast of india is affected more than the west coast by seawater intrusion bobba 2002 basack et al 2012 in chennai almost 14 of coastal area groundwater are contaminated with seawater intrusion and also reported that around 7 of the coastal area of india is affected by seawater intrusion where groundwater levels are below mean sea level manivannan and elango 2019 around 57 of the coastal area of india has groundwater level higher 0 10 msl than mean sea level where there is an excellent chance for seepage of groundwater into coastal regions manivannan and elango 2019 the sgd fluxes are estimated at several locations along the indian coast using various tracers primarily 228ra 222rn 87sr table 5 the average sgd values ranged from 1 6 104 m3 d on the kerala coast to 1 75 1011 m3 d on the karnataka coast table 5 the estimated sgd rates along the coastal regions of india are concurrent with the sgd rates noticed in various regions of the world table 6 to calculate the amount of silicate discharged into indian coastal waters silicate fluxes were calculated using available sgd data given in table 7 the annual mean export of silicate is observed to be 1 97 0 85 tg 1 tg 1012 g to the coastal bay of bengal east coast of india and 3 22 1 56 tg y to the coastal arabian sea west coast of india the silicate sgd fluxes are concordant with earlier studies in the bay of bengal region by georg et al 2009 found that 2 tg y silicates were being exported to the bay of bengal through sgd the sgd silicate export is higher on the west coast than on the east coast which might be due to lithological structure and soil nature one of the reason for the highest sgd along the west coast is that this region dominated by red and yellow soil which is highly porous table 1 the total annual export through sgd of silicate from coastal groundwater along the indian coast is 3 97 2 15 tg and this flux is very low when compared to the silicate export from other regions of the world table 7 but higher than export from yellow sea korea 2 2 tg y sanya bay china 0 05 tg y jiaozhou bay china 0 042 tg y the total sgd flux of silicate from coastal groundwater of india along the east and west coast contributes 7 of silicate to world oceans the flux of silicate through sgd in the indian coastal region to adjacent coastal waters 3 07 1 15 tg y is three times higher than that of monsoonal riverine flux to the indian coastal waters the bay of bengal and the arabian sea 1 03 0 25 tg y krishna et al 2016 and it is equal if we consider glacial rivers silicate export also 3 58 0 89 tg y krishna et al 2016 laruelle et al 2009 reported that the silicate fluxes to entire world coastal regions through sgd is 55 2 tg y and the amount of silicate exported from indian coastal ground waters contributes 7 to total silicate export from sgd to entire world coastal regions on the other hand because of the strong salinity stratification caused by rivers draining into the bay of bengal which prevents vertical mixing the nutrients supply from bottom waters to the ocean surface along indian s east coast is very limited sarma 2012 sarma 2013a b in contrast to the above in the western indian coastal region weak stratification due to lower river discharge promotes vertical mixing and nutrient supply to the surface de sousa et al 1996 gauns et al 2005 however several authors reported that silicate plays a key role in the alteration or community shift of coastal water phytoplankton yadav et al 2016 prakash et al 2017 officer and ryther 1980 and subsequent studies have noticed that the si n ratio determines the dominant phytoplankton group in coastal waters several research studies in coastal waters noticed that the decrease in the si n ratios led to a decrease in the diatom population and enhance the harmful algal blooms davidson et al 2012 found that shifting of phytoplankton community from diatoms to dinoflagellates with decreasing in si n ratios the mesocosm experiments conducted at trondheim fjord norway reviled the dominance of flagellates over diatoms when fall in the ratios of si and n gilpin et al 2004 in the louisiana shelf also noticed that the potential reduction of diatoms to pseudonitzchia species observed with the decline in the si n ratios rabalais et al 1996 dortch et al 2001 acharya et al 2014 noticed that the seasonal change in the phytoplankton community with change in nutrient composition and ratios during south west monsoon season diatoms are dominant phytoplankton group with si n ratio 5 6 and during northeast monsoon cyanobacteria is the dominant group with si n ratio 3 1 padmakumar et al 2012 noticed that the number of harmful algal blooms are increasing tremendously from 1910 to 2010 in the coastal arabian sea and the most common bloom forming phytoplankton species are pyrophacus steinii dinoflagellate chaetoceros spp thalassiosira spp rhizosolenia spp pseudo nitzschia sp and ceratium spp in addition to this prakash et al 2017 reported that the phytoplankton community was shifted from diatoms to dinoflagellates when there was a silicate limitation in the coastal waters of the arabian sea the above studies are also suggesting that change in variability of phytoplankton groups can also be identified with the help of nutrient ratios in coastal waters though the silicate export is more into the arabian sea than the bay of bengal the phytoplankton blooms including toxic algal blooms habs has been linked to seasonal suboxic in the coastal arabian sea during south west monsoon naqvi et al 1998 and the central west coast of india during winter gomes et al 2014 it could be due to the lack of bioavailability of lithogenic silica in the aquatic environment schutte et al 2019 furthermore recent studies have also concluded that 97 of lithogenic silica at neutral ph of seawater ph 8 is un dissolved and non bio available and only 3 of it could be available for biological uptake at surface seawaters del amo and brezeinski 1999 demarest et al 2009 ehrlich et al 2010 lithogenic silica as well as biogenic silica dissolved at high saline high pressure and acidic ph regions of deep seawaters samuela et al 2012 satyanarayana and sarma 2016 elraies and basbar 2015 loucaides et al 2008 in addition to this the divalent alkaline earth metal ions such as calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 are more effective in screening silicate in marine aquatic systems they also shape metal silicate precipitates through ion exchange processes which is relatively insoluble in water over a broad ph range hamouda et al 2014 ragueneau et al 2000 and krom et al 2005 noticed that the ratios of si ca was increased with increasing water column depth at the arabian sea greenland sea atlantic ocean southern indian ocean suggesting that the increasing the silicate concentration with depth is the reason for increasing high ratios at deeper depths the above reasons could be helpful for better understanding the occurrence of algal blooms hab s in the arabian sea even though the export of silicate is more into this region through sgd further studies are needed for a better understanding of point sources of silicate and its bioavailability nature through silicate isotopic studies 5 conclusion submarine groundwater discharge sgd is one of the important routes for silicate transport to coastal waters where as lack of silicate alters phytoplankton community shift the silicate concentrations in coastal indian groundwaters varied from 9 65 to 284 95 mg l with higher concentrations during the wet period 93 09 66 85 mg l compared to the dry period 69 06 40 79 mg l the mean concentration of silicate in the coastal groundwater of india 80 5 mg l is lower than that observed in several developed nations the concentrations of silicate in groundwater displayed significant positive relations with soil silicate bacterial respiration bicarbonate ions pco2 and inverse relation with dissolved oxygen saturation suggesting that remineralization by bacteria weathering by carbonic acid and leaching of soil silicate are major sources of silicate into the coastal groundwater the silicate export from east coast groundwaters to the bay of bengal 1 97 0 85 tg y is less than that of silicate export from west coast groundwaters to the arabian sea 3 22 1 56 tg y the overall flux of silicate through sgd from indian coastal groundwater 3 07 1 15 tg y is three times higher than riverine fluxes to the indian coast 1 03 0 25 tg y suggesting that a significant amount of silicate is brought to the coastal waters through sgd and it can impact the phytoplankton community structure in coastal waters and can change the ecosystem dynamics which needs further evaluation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

11916,silicate plays a vital role in the coastal regions biogeochemistry submarine groundwater discharge sgd is one of the significant silicate sources to the coastal regions the silicate concentrations in groundwater gw are considerably higher than in neighbouring coastal waters as a result sgd increases the concentrations of silicate in the coastal waters and influences the marine ecosystem to examine the spatial and temporal variability in silicate concentrations and export of silicate to the adjacent coastal waters through sgd groundwater samples are collected at 90 locations along the east and west coast regions of india during the dry and wet periods this study revealed that the concentration of dissolved silicate was lower during the dry period than during the wet period the soil silicate concentration displayed a significant variability and has a good correlation with silicate concentrations in the coastal groundwater of india silicate in groundwater showed significant linear relations with bacterial respiration bicarbonate and pco2 and inverse relation with dissolved oxygen saturation suggesting that remineralization and weathering processes are responsible for the silicate in the coastal groundwater of india the average sgd of freshwater varied between 1 6 104 m3 day and 1 75 1011 m3 day from the indian coastal groundwater into adjacent coastal regions the fluxes of silicate through sgd to the bay of bengal was estimated as 1 97 0 85 tg 1 tg 1012 g and 3 22 1 56 tg to the eastern arabian sea the estimated total sgd fluxes of silicate to the northern indian ocean from east and west coastal regions of india is 3 07 1 15 tg y and it is almost three times higher than silicate discharged from monsoonal rivers 1 03 0 25 tg y the silicate through sgd from indian coastal groundwater contributes 7 of silicate to the total silicate export to the world coastal regions through sgd graphical abstract image 1 keywords silicate sgd bay of bengal arabian sea groundwater coastal regions 1 introduction since the beginning of time water from beneath the ground has been used for domestic purposes irrigation and livestock although the precise nature of its occurrence was unknown several methods have been invented for bringing the groundwater to the surface and groundwater usage has increased ever since in the entire world groundwater is a composition of several inorganic and organic components like nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate silicate anions cations metals minerals hydrocarbons carbohydrates amino acids proteins pesticides urea etc kurwadkar 2019 the qualitative and quantitative features of groundwater depend on several factors such as geological structure the composition of minerals land usage agriculture industrialization and forest almuhisen et al 2019 the export of these compounds along with freshwater to adjacent coastal waters is called submarine groundwater discharge sgd the sgd may vary from the region to region based on the geological structure of india and most sgd can expect in the regions where the soil have more porosity along the indian coast kumar et al 2020 a few studies were addressed the sgd in india along with the arabian and bay of bengal coast in the west coast jacob et al 2009 rahaman and singh 2012 sartandel et al 2014 kavitha et al 2017 and in east coast rengarajan and sarma 2015 chakrabarti et al 2018 were reported the sgd fluxes at some particular regions of india by using ra rn sr isotopic studies a very recent study of kumar et al 2020 reported that sgd takes place along the coastal waters of arabian sea and bay of bengal along with nitrate and phosphate into coastal waters of arabian sea and bay of bengal this sgd plays a vital role in the biogeochemistry of coastal waters short and burdick 1996 garce et al 2011 ryan et al 2008 lecher et al 2015 mamahon et al 2017 according to known et al 2014 the amount of sgd is 3 4 times greater than the surface runoff although the sgd values vary from region to region the amount of solute carried by sgd into the coastal regions was greater than that of the number of solute particles carried by river discharge lujjendijk et al 2020 nutrients such as din nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate into the coastal regions comes from various sources like river discharge sarma et al 2009 krishna et al 2016 aerosol deposition srinivas et al 2013 yadav 2016 sgd rengarajan and sarma 2015 kumar et al 2020 sewage discharge jin et al 2017a coastal upwelling sarma et al 2013 b however silicate can enter into the coastal waters mainly through river discharge sgd and coastal water upwelling in which coastal water upwelling brings very little amount of silicate into the surface waters of bay of bengal than the arabian sea as stratification plays a key role in the bay of bengal naqvi et al 2000 sarma et al 2013 a b in recent years river discharge into coastal regions getting reduced because of drop in precipitation over india and the construction of more dams on rivers kumar 2014 so the only major source of silicate into coastal regions is through sgd silicate is one of the important nutrients which can modify the phytoplankton community and composition in fresh and marine water egge and aksnes 1992 berdalet et al 1996 pan and subbarao 1997 wu and chou 2003 yadav et al 2016 jin et al 2017b few studies in coastal waters noticed that the change in the nutrient concentrations and composition have a significant impact on the phytoplankton community shift especially with silicate to nitrate ratios officer and ryther 1980 rabalais et al 1996 dortch et al 2001 gilpin et al 2004 davidson et al 2012 yadaav et al 2016 conducted the microcosm experiments in the coastal bay of bengal during different seasons and found that a sharp decrease in the diatoms to dinoflagellates ratios during the low silicate periods in the study region in addition to this prakash et al 2017 hypothesized that the changes in si n ratios were the possible reason for the occurrence of frequent harmful algal boolms habs dinoflagellates in the coastal waters of the arabian sea the above set of studies are suggesting that it is very impotent to understand and monitor the different sources of silicate into coastal regions and their export studies in all coastal regions of the world therefore the main aims of this study are to 1 investigate the variation in silicate concentrations in the groundwater near the coastal regions of indian during wet and dry periods 2 examine the potential sources of silicate to the groundwater along the indian coast concerning the geological setting and 3 estimate the silicate fluxes to adjacent coastal waters the bay of bengal and the arabian sea using available sgd rates in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the terrain on the indian subcontinent is varied ranging from the himalayan peaks to the indian ocean india has a 7517 km coastline which includes the east coast west coast and andaman and nicobar gujarat gj maharashtra mh goa ga karnataka ka kerala kl are the coastal states along the west coast and tamil nadu tn andhra pradesh ap odisha od and west bengal wb are the coastal states along the east coast groundwater samples were collected at 90 sites wells along the indian s west and east coast during the dry non monsoon and the wet monsoon periods fig 1 2 2 hydro climatology over the indian sub continent india has an amazing variety of climate changing regions varying from tropical in the south to himalayan in the north and temperate where elevated territories receive continuous winter snowfall the thar desert and himalayas have a strong influence on the indian climate the mountains of the himalayas act as a wall to the cold katabatic winds that blow down from central asia maintaining most of the indian subcontinent warmer than the majority of areas at the same latitudes during the summer season the northern parts of india suffer from severe summer conditions as well as very cold temperatures that drop below freezing during the winter in contrast indian coastal regions where the temperature is uniform and rains are very common attri and tyagi 2010 because of seasonal reversal winds from january to july india is mainly influenced by two rainy seasons south west and north east during the winter season cold and dry air blows from the northern latitudes in a northeasterly direction over the indian subcontinent the summer monsoon southwest monsoon occurs when the north parts of india get to be hotter and draw the high humid winds above the ocean causing a reversal of winds over this region this is a significant feature controlling the indian climate approximately 75 of the annual rainfall falls during four month periods june to september the other one is the northeast monsoon winter monsoon which happens from november to february the precipitation over the indian subcontinent because of the northeast monsoon is comparatively less than that of the summer monsoon soman and kumar 1990 the climate difference may be higher than in any other similar area of the world the amount of rainfall received at different locations within the same country varies significantly the annual average rainfall in western rajasthan is less than 130 mm while in meghalaya the highest rainfall is 1140 mm at mausiram and chirapunji the pattern of rainfall demonstrates the countries different climate regimes which range from humid in the north east to dry in north west 2 3 geology of the indian subcontinent india has a diverse geological system some parts of india have a rocky geological structure that dates back to various geologic periods many of the rocks are severely altered and deformed only certain depositions contain new intervention alluvial that is still digenesis in addition to this a vast quantity of minerals deposits found in the indian subcontinent with a wide variety of compositions guha 2010 moverover archaeological records of india revealed that they contain more fossils of plant vertebrates invertebrates and stromatolites the geographical land area of india is divided into three parts such as vindhyan deccan traps and gondwana the formation of the deccan trap was happened after breaking away from the gondwana plate and it moved towards the north passing over the reunion hotspot in the indian ocean it covers almost gujarat gj madhya pradesh mp a few parts in karnataka ka maharashtra mh andhra pradesh ap http bhubankosh com the thickness of the deccan traps is 150 m on the east side of india and in the western region it is 3000 m the deccan trap rocks have a new type of soils known as black cotton which are formed due to forced weathering and soil emotion and the main composition of these rocks are the tholeiitic basalts 95 other rock types contain alkali basalts carbonated minerals lamprophyre nepheline guptha and malhotra 2000 the gondwana and vidyan cover most

punjab pb these are mainly sedimentary deposits that were accumulated in the synclinal troughs and older plateau surface this system contains huge carbon deposits within them this makes them the largest source of coal in india containing up to 98 of indian coal deposits gondwana system is most common in coastal regions and major deposits are at rajahmundry ongal south krishna ap cuttack od these rocks mostly consist of clay grit shells sandstone conglomerate guha 2010 and the mineralogy of india also varied from states to state table 1 shahid and naseem 2017 noticed that alluvial black red and yellow laterite and arid are the most common soils in india the very common soil in india is red and yellow soil in central and some parts of coastal regions such as ga kl ka tn ap and od this soil type was produced mainly by the disintegration of archaic basalt rocks such as gneisses and granites as well as these rocks are rich in magnesium mg iron fe and poor in nitrogen and phosphorus kaolinitic minerals are the main components of clay fractions of the soils shahid and naseem 2017 alluvial soil is indians largest and most important soil group found primarily along the country s coastline this alluvial soil is dark in colour with more siliceous and aged alluvium is the composition of lime nodules with less nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter desert soils are found in rajasthan and the northern parts of gujarat this soil contains more soluble minerals and siliceous compounds and is low in inorganic carbon and nitrogen the black soil is thick and dark in colour with high clay content a few locations in the coastal states of mh gj ap and tn and western central and southern states are also covered with this soil this soil is formed because of deccan trap basalts and they got their name from their colour which could be due to the presence of titanium iron and calcium and magnesium carbonates shahid and naseem 2017 table 1 2 4 sample collection and analysis during the wet monsoon and dry non monsoon periods one sample of groundwater was collected every 100 km along indian s coastal line for a total of 90 samples in each period table 1 and all the samples are collected near to the coast just away from 300 to 500 m from the coastal line the sampling includes all the coastal states of india such as west bengal wb odisha od andhra pradesh ap tamil nadu tn

free deionized water and sonicated for 1 h the extracted water was filtered through 0 8 μm polyvinyl carbonate filter papers and silicate extracted into the filtrate was analyzed by the procedure described above ion chromatography metrohm professional switzerland was used to measure chloride cl and bicarbonate hco3 in water samples by using the detailed methodology described in kumar et al

et al 2017 tamil nadu 101 mg l sgwb 2014 groundwater the concentration of silicate in indian coastal groundwater exhibited a linear relationship with soil silicate indicating that leaching processes can be one of the significant sources of silicate to the groundwater moreover silicate in groundwater exhibited linear relations with pco2 figs 4b and 5 b and bacterial respiration rates figs 4a and 5a indicating that weathering processes with carbon dioxide as carbonic acid is also one of the responsible processes for silicate in groundwater during both wet and dry periods respectively according to davil 2018 if geochemical weathering was the prevailing mechanism for providing higher concentrations of silicate in the groundwater in such case bicarbonate ions could also increase and is corroborated with the results of our study during both wet r2 0 53 p 0 05 and dry r2 0 61 p 0 05 periods vandevivere et al 1994 noticed that dissolution of silicate minerals can also happen by bacterial activity at neutral ph so as silicate showed a linear positive relation with bacterial respiration rates this could also one of the possible sources of silicate in the coastal groundwater in addition to this silicate showed significant positive relations with chloride in ap r2 0 52 p 0 05 and tn r2 0 61 p 0 05 states on the east coast and with gj on the west coast r2 0 65 p 0 05 and also chloride have a positive correlation with tds in these states especially in dry period suggesting that salinity instruction soil leaching also another possible source of silicate into study region 4 2 soil and lithology s effect on groundwater chemistry alluvial red and yellow and black soils are abundant along the indian coast fig 1 table 1 bhattacharyya and kumar 2015 except for gj where alluvial soil is prevalent red and yellow soils are the most predominant soil types along the indian s west coast alluvial soils are typical along india s east coast fig 1 many of these soils have diverse minerals organic matter and nutrient composition shahid and naseem 2017 even though both alluvial and red and yellow soils contain large amounts of siliceous content the silica percentage in these two alluvial soils is higher than in red and yellow soil shahid and naseem 2017 alluvial plain dominated the eastern part of coastal india in concurrent with soil profile the state average concentrations of groundwater silicate is high in tn wb and od but poor in ap state groundwater during both the periods table 3 on the west coast the highest groundwater silicate was noticed in gj where the dominant soil type is alluvial fig 1 table 3 in the dry period also higher silicate quantities are noticed in the eastern region of coastal india where all these areas have been covered by alluvial soils this suggests that the silicate concentrations in indian groundwater significantly influenced by the soil structure and composition the most typical types of minerals in india are quartz felspar granite ball clay china clay calcite dolomite pyrite magnetite limestone coal hematite sandstone chromite bauxite fire clay silica sand zircon sillimanite kyanite silica sand bentonite diatomite lignite table 1 in east coast majority of the minerals are enriched with silica than west coast table 1 during the wet period more silicate concentrations were noticed in the east coast region groundwater table 3 which is possible due to the presence of more siliceous type minerals such as quartz granite feldspar china clay pyroxenite ball clay sandstone fire clay which has silica percentage in between 50 and 60 and mh and gj states are also have higher concentrations of silicate during the same period it is also due to more mineral water interaction as these two regions also have the majority of silicate mineral type structure table 1 furthermore bsk kumar personal communication noticed that during the wet period rock water interaction was the dominant process occurring in the east and west coast groundwater in india fig 6 4 3 impact of biogeochemical parameters on silicate concentrations in indian coastal groundwater the variability and distribution of silicate concentrations in groundwater may depend on several processes such as bacterial respiration weathering ion and reverse ion exchange and rock water interaction significant linear positive correlations were noticed to silicate in groundwater with bacterial respiration rates table 4 figs 4a and 5a pco2 table 4 figs 4b and 5b hco3 table 4 figs 4c and 5c and inverse relation with do saturation table 4 figs 4d and 5d during wet and dry periods this suggests that the biological activity of bacteria and dissolution weathering of silicate rocks by carbonic acid also contributed to the silicate concentrations in the groundwater during the wet and dry periods the groundwater silicate concentration was higher in the wet period 93 09 66 85 mg l than dry period 69 06 40 79 mg l along the east and west coast of india and it is consistent with higher bacterial respiration rates during the wet period 3 5 2 mg l h than the dry period 0 85 0 5 mg l h table 2 therefore higher concentrations of silicate during the wet period might have due to higher rock water interaction along with bacterial remineralization and leaching of soil silicate resulting in the release of more silicate into the groundwater the strong correlation of groundwater silicate with bacterial respiration pco2 hco3 and do saturation might have the reasons for the accumulation of silicate in groundwater 4 4 silicate export to neighbouring coastal regions from coastal groundwater the dissolved silicate levels in coastal waters of india vary between 0 06 and 2 4 mg l sarma et al 2013 a b and the silicate levels in coastal groundwater are always higher than coastal waters tables 2 and 3 because of this feature there are more chances of groundwater seepage into the adjacent coastal environment and this seepage can cause significant changes in coastal waters many studies reported that the east coast of india is affected more than the west coast by seawater intrusion bobba 2002 basack et al 2012 in chennai almost 14 of coastal area groundwater are contaminated with seawater intrusion and also reported that around 7 of the coastal area of india is affected by seawater intrusion where groundwater levels are below mean sea level manivannan and elango 2019 around 57 of the coastal area of india has groundwater level higher 0 10 msl than mean sea level where there is an excellent chance for seepage of groundwater into coastal regions manivannan and elango 2019 the sgd fluxes are estimated at several locations along the indian coast using various tracers primarily 228ra 222rn 87sr table 5 the average sgd values ranged from 1 6 104 m3 d on the kerala coast to 1 75 1011 m3 d on the karnataka coast table 5 the estimated sgd rates along the coastal regions of india are concurrent with the sgd rates noticed in various regions of the world table 6 to calculate the amount of silicate discharged into indian coastal waters silicate fluxes were calculated using available sgd data given in table 7 the annual mean export of silicate is observed to be 1 97 0 85 tg 1 tg 1012 g to the coastal bay of bengal east coast of india and 3 22 1 56 tg y to the coastal arabian sea west coast of india the silicate sgd fluxes are concordant with earlier studies in the bay of bengal region by georg et al 2009 found that 2 tg y silicates were being exported to the bay of bengal through sgd the sgd silicate export is higher on the west coast than on the east coast which might be due to lithological structure and soil nature one of the reason for the highest sgd along the west coast is that this region dominated by red and yellow soil which is highly porous table 1 the total annual export through sgd of silicate from coastal groundwater along the indian coast is 3 97 2 15 tg and this flux is very low when compared to the silicate export from other regions of the world table 7 but higher than export from yellow sea korea 2 2 tg y sanya bay china 0 05 tg y jiaozhou bay china 0 042 tg y the total sgd flux of silicate from coastal groundwater of india along the east and west coast contributes 7 of silicate to world oceans the flux of silicate through sgd in the indian coastal region to adjacent coastal waters 3 07 1 15 tg y is three times higher than that of monsoonal riverine flux to the indian coastal waters the bay of bengal and the arabian sea 1 03 0 25 tg y krishna et al 2016 and it is equal if we consider glacial rivers silicate export also 3 58 0 89 tg y krishna et al 2016 laruelle et al 2009 reported that the silicate fluxes to entire world coastal regions through sgd is 55 2 tg y and the amount of silicate exported from indian coastal ground waters contributes 7 to total silicate export from sgd to entire world coastal regions on the other hand because of the strong salinity stratification caused by rivers draining into the bay of bengal which prevents vertical mixing the nutrients supply from bottom waters to the ocean surface along indian s east coast is very limited sarma 2012 sarma 2013a b in contrast to the above in the western indian coastal region weak stratification due to lower river discharge promotes vertical mixing and nutrient supply to the surface de sousa et al 1996 gauns et al 2005 however several authors reported that silicate plays a key role in the alteration or community shift of coastal water phytoplankton yadav et al 2016 prakash et al 2017 officer and ryther 1980 and subsequent studies have noticed that the si n ratio determines the dominant phytoplankton group in coastal waters several research studies in coastal waters noticed that the decrease in the si n ratios led to a decrease in the diatom population and enhance the harmful algal blooms davidson et al 2012 found that shifting of phytoplankton community from diatoms to dinoflagellates with decreasing in si n ratios the mesocosm experiments conducted at trondheim fjord norway reviled the dominance of flagellates over diatoms when fall in the ratios of si and n gilpin et al 2004 in the louisiana shelf also noticed that the potential reduction of diatoms to pseudonitzchia species observed with the decline in the si n ratios rabalais et al 1996 dortch et al 2001 acharya et al 2014 noticed that the seasonal change in the phytoplankton community with change in nutrient composition and ratios during south west monsoon season diatoms are dominant phytoplankton group with si n ratio 5 6 and during northeast monsoon cyanobacteria is the dominant group with si n ratio 3 1 padmakumar et al 2012 noticed that the number of harmful algal blooms are increasing tremendously from 1910 to 2010 in the coastal arabian sea and the most common bloom forming phytoplankton species are pyrophacus steinii dinoflagellate chaetoceros spp thalassiosira spp rhizosolenia spp pseudo nitzschia sp and ceratium spp in addition to this prakash et al 2017 reported that the phytoplankton community was shifted from diatoms to dinoflagellates when there was a silicate limitation in the coastal waters of the arabian sea the above studies are also suggesting that change in variability of phytoplankton groups can also be identified with the help of nutrient ratios in coastal waters though the silicate export is more into the arabian sea than the bay of bengal the phytoplankton blooms including toxic algal blooms habs has been linked to seasonal suboxic in the coastal arabian sea during south west monsoon naqvi et al 1998 and the central west coast of india during winter gomes et al 2014 it could be due to the lack of bioavailability of lithogenic silica in the aquatic environment schutte et al 2019 furthermore recent studies have also concluded that 97 of lithogenic silica at neutral ph of seawater ph 8 is un dissolved and non bio available and only 3 of it could be available for biological uptake at surface seawaters del amo and brezeinski 1999 demarest et al 2009 ehrlich et al 2010 lithogenic silica as well as biogenic silica dissolved at high saline high pressure and acidic ph regions of deep seawaters samuela et al 2012 satyanarayana and sarma 2016 elraies and basbar 2015 loucaides et al 2008 in addition to this the divalent alkaline earth metal ions such as calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 are more effective in screening silicate in marine aquatic systems they also shape metal silicate precipitates through ion exchange processes which is relatively insoluble in water over a broad ph range hamouda et al 2014 ragueneau et al 2000 and krom et al 2005 noticed that the ratios of si ca was increased with increasing water column depth at the arabian sea greenland sea atlantic ocean southern indian ocean suggesting that the increasing the silicate concentration with depth is the reason for increasing high ratios at deeper depths the above reasons could be helpful for better understanding the occurrence of algal blooms hab s in the arabian sea even though the export of silicate is more into this region through sgd further studies are needed for a better understanding of point sources of silicate and its bioavailability nature through silicate isotopic studies 5 conclusion submarine groundwater discharge sgd is one of the important routes for silicate transport to coastal waters where as lack of silicate alters phytoplankton community shift the silicate concentrations in coastal indian groundwaters varied from 9 65 to 284 95 mg l with higher concentrations during the wet period 93 09 66 85 mg l compared to the dry period 69 06 40 79 mg l the mean concentration of silicate in the coastal groundwater of india 80 5 mg l is lower than that observed in several developed nations the concentrations of silicate in groundwater displayed significant positive relations with soil silicate bacterial respiration bicarbonate ions pco2 and inverse relation with dissolved oxygen saturation suggesting that remineralization by bacteria weathering by carbonic acid and leaching of soil silicate are major sources of silicate into the coastal groundwater the silicate export from east coast groundwaters to the bay of bengal 1 97 0 85 tg y is less than that of silicate export from west coast groundwaters to the arabian sea 3 22 1 56 tg y the overall flux of silicate through sgd from indian coastal groundwater 3 07 1 15 tg y is three times higher than riverine fluxes to the indian coast 1 03 0 25 tg y suggesting that a significant amount of silicate is brought to the coastal waters through sgd and it can impact the phytoplankton community structure in coastal waters and can change the ecosystem dynamics which needs further evaluation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

domestic and industrial water supply relies on the available groundwater resources the regular withdrawal of groundwater for irrigation domestic and industrial use has results in lowering of groundwater table in the area to overcome this problem potential recharge zones of groundwater were delineated in the area by applying remote sensing and gis approach supported by field observations gis technology has been used to analyze and integrate various groundwater controlling factors viz geology geomorphology lineaments topography soil drainage density and land use land cover weightage to each parameter was assigned based on the hydrological characteristics of the observed parameter groundwater potential index gpi of the area has been calculated by integration of the various thematic layers by weighted overlay analysis woa method in arcgis the results demonstrated that about 3 58 km2 of the area is designated as excellent groundwater potential zone whereas good moderate low and poor groundwater potential zone covers 51 18 km2 117 36 km2 38 59 km2 and 6 66 km2 area respectively the study reveals most effective groundwater potential zone lies in southernmost part of the area characterized by alluvium formations with gentle slope low and poor groundwater potential zone is present in the northernmost part characterized by steep slope impervious rocks and high drainage

development and ecological diversity nampak et al 2014 prabhu and venkateswaran 2015 naghibi et al 2016 in worldwide groundwater is being used for drinking irrigation industrial and other uses the large scale consumption of groundwater in domestic industrial agricultural sectors improper management and unscientific methods of exploration has put this resource under great stress chen et al 2018 nsiah et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 arabameri et al 2019 singh et al 2019 currently severe water crises are reported in worldwide because of the day by day depletion of the existing groundwater resources adeyeye et al 2019 al ruzouq et al 2019 the occurrence of groundwater is limited in hard rock formations because of the non development of pore spaces and openings in hard rocks and impervious formations groundwater is restricted to fractured zones and secondary porosities as the movement of water is mostly through these fractures and pores thakur et al 2011 ahirwar et al 2019 the identification of groundwater potential recharge zones is one of the key processes for enhancement management and development of groundwater resources of an area agarwal et al 2013 further in order to draw the groundwater potential of an area it is necessary to assess all these parameters that have direct or indirect affect on movement and occurrence of groundwater gaur et al 2011 sternberg and paillou 2015 nanda et al 2017 golla et al 2018 among these the major groundwater controlling factors includes lithology lineament geomorphic landforms topography drainage pattern and density land use land cover lu lc soil type and climate jaiswal et al 2003 lee et al 2012 gumma and pavelic 2013 gou et al 2015 thapa et al 2017 golkarian et al 2018 chen et al 2019 lithology plays a key role in the occurrence movement and distribution of groundwater the type of rocks exposed at the surface significantly affects groundwater recharge shaban et al 2006 lithology controls the percolation rate of water flow thus affect the groundwater recharge el baz and himida 1995 lineaments are the linear structural features represent the underlying geological structures e g fault used to infer the groundwater movement and storage lattman and parizek 1964 high lineament density places are considered as good for groundwater occurrence drainage has also great significance in groundwater recharge the structural analysis of a drainage network helps to assess the characteristics of a groundwater recharge zone a zone with a high drainage density has a high level of groundwater recharge several studies reported employed integrated lineaments and drainage maps to infer a potential groundwater recharge zone shaban et al 2006 topography has negative relationship with groundwater recharge slope gradient directly influences the infiltration of rainfall steep slopes produce a smaller recharge because water flows rapidly down a steep slope during rainfall so it does not have sufficient time to infiltrate the surface and recharge the saturated zone lu lc is an important factor in groundwater recharge lu lc affects evapotranspiration runoff and recharge of the groundwater groundwater is closely associated with the landscape and the land use that it underlies most of the landscape is vulnerable to the anthropogenic activities on the land surface land use affects groundwater resources through changes in recharge and by changing demands for water tetzlaff et al 2007 lerner and harris 2009 fan 2015 soil type and thickness has a significant impact on infiltration of precipitation sandy soils own good permeability properties drains the infiltrated water quickly to the lower layers of soil supports to the groundwater recharge whereas clayey soils impede the percolation rate of water beneath the ground rainfall has direct relationship with recharge and is the chief source of groundwater recharge in both tropic and sub tropic regions high rainfall with favorable topography enhances the recharge practices of groundwater a part of the rainwater may infiltrate into the soil where it may be taken up by the plant roots and is subsequently transpired through the vegetation canopy the remaining water will continue percolating deeper into the soil column eventually becoming groundwater recharge when crossing the water table into the saturated groundwater zone deng et al 2015 geomorphologic landforms also play an important role in occurrence and recharge of groundwater alluvial plain areas favors the groundwater recharge because of thick soil cover and gentle slope while structural hills mountains and dissected plateaus are less supportive for groundwater recharge because of their steep and undulating topography generally in evaluation of the groundwater potential of an area hydro geological field investigations and hydrological modeling approaches supported by soil moisture models were used thorpe and scott 1999 white et al 2003 however in situ measurements and methods are expensive time consuming and not feasible for regional scale investigations thus a fast and cost efficient alternative is the application of remote sensing and gis techniques remote sensing in coordination with geographic information systems gis has been used to map several factors associated with groundwater recharge and potential studies saraf et al 2004 solomon and quiel 2006 chenini et al 2010 hammouri et al 2012 kaliraj et al 2014 patil and mohite 2014 thapa et al 2017 further remote sensing and gis techniques help to enhance the accuracy of the output results of the groundwater potential zone and to reduce the bias on any single method remote sensing and gis has grasped the great potential in improving our ability to explore the groundwater resources on regional scale jasrotia et al 2013 the input parameters defining the potential of groundwater of an area can be evaluated analyzed and integrated within gis environment in order to derive the final output map of groundwater potential zone al abadi and shahid 2015 arabameri et al 2019 in addition the collaboration of field observations with conventional gis based models helps to improve the local results as exemplified by ozdemir 2011 nampak et al 2014 kumar and pandey 2016 rahmati et al 2016 guru et al 2017 naghibi et al 2017 nsiah et al 2018 singh et al 2018 the integration process of these factors proceeds by multiplying the individual values of each raster with its relative weightage the assignment of weights is subjective and based on the relative significance of the parameter in groundwater recharge or taken from the available literature values krishnamurthy et al 1996 patil and mohite 2014 several studies were carried out to demarcate the potential zones of groundwater in order to facilitate the artificial groundwater recharge practices by applying the gis based models sharma and shukla 2014 2015 thilagavathi et al 2015 venkateswaran and ayyandurai 2015 rahmati et al 2016 singh et al 2018 ahirwar et al 2020 although several studies were reported in literature employed remote sensing and gis approaches for evaluation of the various groundwater controlling factors lee et al 2012 gumma and pavelic 2013 gou et al 2015 golkarian et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in order to develop the output groundwater potential map the present study also focus on evaluation of the various groundwater controlling factors and describing the significance of an individual parameter in formation a groundwater potential zone hoshangabad and budhni district of madhya pradesh is characterized of subtropical climate with a hot dry summer april june followed by monsoon rains july september and a cool and relatively dry winter the average rainfall is about 1194 mm the area under study is part of the narmada basin situated along banks of the narmada river in the area groundwater is one of the primary sources used for fulfilling the agriculture industry and domestic water demand taken in consideration the chief controlling factors of groundwater such as lithology slope geomorphic landforms drainage lineaments lu lc soil and climate it has been seen that the area comprises by hard and soft rock formations a wide part of the area is exposed to massive sandstone characterized by steep slope that discouraging the groundwater recharge practices the southern most part is comprised of unconsolidated deposits of silt sand clay gravel which own good hydrological properties is favorable for groundwater recharge slope has an inverse relationship with groundwater recharge in the area uneven topography with rugged terrain characterized by steep to nearly steep slope towards the northern most portions also supports less to groundwater recharge the high slope exhibit the northern part of the area supports to maximum surface runoff and less recharge during rainy season geomorphic landforms also play a crucial role in occurrence and movement of groundwater of an area jaiswal et al 2003 the main geomorphic unit exposed in the area includes the flood plain denudation hill and structural plateau flood plain deposits owe good groundwater properties because of low slope and thick soil cover where as denudation hill and structural plateau are unfavorable for recharge practices because of their steep and irregular topography drainage is also an important parameter which defines the nature of the underlying rock or soil media and nature of slope the suitability of groundwater potential recharge zones is inversely proportional to drainage density lineaments play a good role in groundwater studies because they facilitate the movement and storage of water high lineament density areas are considered good for groundwater prospect mapping drainage network also facilitates the recharge practices of groundwater high drainage density is the signature of impervious soil rock media and high relief and vice versa similarly lu lc pattern also had a significant role in groundwater recharge and storage prabhakar and tiwari 2015 healthy vegetation agriculture lands grasslands forest etc supports to the groundwater recharge via percolation by plant roots however irrigation practices also increases the amount of water applied to the crops which generally enhances groundwater recharge roark and healy 1998 mcmahon 2003 tillage process also affects on recharge of groundwater by changing soil structure leduc et al 2001 urbanization or built up structures impede the percolation of rainwater into the soil and discourage the recharge practices of groundwater increased impervious area has been major factor in contributing to decreased infiltration which results in decreasing groundwater storage the impact of urbanization on groundwater has a major concern to most urban areas over past few decades and in particular to those involved in groundwater quantity and qualitative studies schirmer et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 soil texture and thickness has also great role in recharge of groundwater coarse textured soils sandy soils own good hydrological properties and drain the infiltrated water quick to the recharge zones whereas fine textured soils clay does not allow rapid flow of infiltrated water beneath the soil thus obstruct the recharge of groundwater rainfall is the chief climatic factor and is the main source of groundwater recharge in the area the mean annual precipitation of the area is nearly 1200 mm and is mostly falling during monsoon period in the area maximum recharge also takes place during the rainy season the present study aims to understand the significance of the groundwater controlling parameters viz geology lineaments geomorphology soil drainage density topography and land use land cover analyzed from various primary and secondary data sets in order to create a thematic database of each parameter for defining the groundwater potential of the area further the integrated approach of remote sensing and gis applied to demonstrate their capability in preparation of reliable database in quick time with good accuracy in the area the major part of the irrigation and drinking water is satisfied by pumping of groundwater from dug wells tube wells bore wells which results in decline of the groundwater table therefore to maintain the balance between withdrawal and recharge of groundwater it is necessary to assess the factors that govern groundwater and draw their relative significance in groundwater recharge 1 1 study area narmada river basin is

recharge is the entry of water from the unsaturated zone into the saturated zone below the water table together with the associated flow away from the water table within the saturated zone yeh et al

the expert knowledge and previous literature rahmati et al 2015 yeh et al 2016 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 a numerical rating system ranging from 1 to 10 was assigned to each parameter class of individual themes based on degree of influence of individual categories on groundwater regime of the area the maximum weightage 10 is given to the parameter that plays significant role in groundwater recharge and minimum weightage 1 was assigned to the parameter with least significance in groundwater recharge in geology the assigned weights to various litho units vary from 3 to 9 low weightage 3

domestic and industrial water supply relies on the available groundwater resources the regular withdrawal of groundwater for irrigation domestic and industrial use has results in lowering of groundwater table in the area to overcome this problem potential recharge zones of groundwater were delineated in the area by applying remote sensing and gis approach supported by field observations gis technology has been used to analyze and integrate various groundwater controlling factors viz geology geomorphology lineaments topography soil drainage density and land use land cover weightage to each parameter was assigned based on the hydrological characteristics of the observed parameter groundwater potential index gpi of the area has been calculated by integration of the various thematic

development and ecological diversity nampak et al 2014 prabhu and venkateswaran 2015 naghibi et al 2016 in worldwide groundwater is being used for drinking irrigation industrial and other uses the large scale consumption of groundwater in domestic industrial agricultural sectors improper management and unscientific methods of exploration has put this resource under great stress chen et al 2018 nsiah et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 arabameri et al 2019 singh et al 2019 currently severe water crises are reported in worldwide because of the day by day depletion of the existing groundwater resources adeyeye et al 2019 al ruzouq et al 2019 the occurrence of groundwater is limited in hard rock formations because of the non development of pore spaces and openings in hard rocks and impervious formations groundwater is restricted to fractured zones and secondary porosities as the movement of water is mostly through these fractures and pores thakur et al 2011 ahirwar et al 2019 the identification of groundwater potential recharge zones is one of the key processes for enhancement management and development of groundwater resources of an area agarwal et al 2013 further in order to draw the groundwater potential of an area it is necessary to assess all these parameters that have direct or indirect affect on movement and occurrence of groundwater gaur et al 2011 sternberg and paillou 2015 nanda et al 2017 golla et al 2018 among these the major groundwater controlling factors includes lithology lineament geomorphic landforms topography drainage pattern and density land use land cover lu lc soil type and climate jaiswal et al 2003 lee et al 2012 gumma and pavelic 2013 gou et al 2015 thapa et al 2017 golkarian et al 2018 chen et al 2019 lithology plays a key role in the occurrence movement and distribution of groundwater the type of rocks exposed at the surface significantly affects groundwater recharge shaban et al 2006 lithology controls the percolation rate of water flow thus affect the groundwater recharge el baz and himida 1995 lineaments are the linear structural features represent the underlying geological structures e g fault used to infer the groundwater movement and storage lattman and parizek 1964 high lineament density places are considered as good for groundwater occurrence drainage has also great significance in groundwater recharge the structural analysis of a drainage network helps to assess the characteristics of a groundwater recharge zone a zone with a high drainage density has a high level of groundwater recharge several studies reported employed integrated lineaments and drainage maps to infer a potential groundwater recharge zone shaban et al 2006 topography has negative relationship with groundwater recharge slope gradient directly influences the infiltration of rainfall steep slopes produce a smaller recharge because water flows rapidly down a steep slope during rainfall so it does not have sufficient time to infiltrate the surface and recharge the saturated zone lu lc is an important factor in groundwater recharge lu lc affects evapotranspiration runoff and recharge of the groundwater groundwater is closely associated with the landscape and the land use that it underlies most of the landscape is vulnerable to the anthropogenic activities on the land surface land use affects groundwater resources through changes in recharge and by changing demands for water tetzlaff et al 2007 lerner and harris 2009 fan 2015 soil type and thickness has a significant impact on infiltration of precipitation sandy soils own good permeability properties drains the infiltrated water quickly to the lower layers of soil supports to the groundwater recharge whereas clayey soils impede the percolation rate of water beneath the ground rainfall has direct relationship with recharge and is the chief source of groundwater recharge in both tropic and sub tropic regions high rainfall with favorable topography enhances the recharge practices of groundwater a part of the rainwater may infiltrate into the soil where it may be taken up by the plant roots and is subsequently transpired through the vegetation canopy the remaining water will continue percolating deeper into the soil column eventually becoming groundwater recharge when crossing the water table into the saturated groundwater zone deng et al 2015 geomorphologic landforms also play an important role in occurrence and recharge of groundwater alluvial plain areas favors the groundwater recharge because of thick soil cover and gentle slope while structural hills mountains and dissected plateaus are less supportive for groundwater recharge because of their steep and undulating topography generally in evaluation of the groundwater potential of an area hydro geological field investigations and hydrological modeling approaches supported by soil moisture models were used thorpe and scott 1999 white et al 2003 however in situ measurements and methods are expensive time consuming and not feasible for regional scale investigations thus a fast and cost efficient alternative is the application of remote sensing and gis techniques remote sensing in coordination with geographic information systems gis has been used to map several factors associated with groundwater recharge and potential studies saraf et al 2004 solomon and quiel 2006 chenini et al 2010 hammouri et al 2012 kaliraj et al 2014 patil and mohite 2014 thapa et al 2017 further remote sensing and gis techniques help to enhance the accuracy of the output results of the groundwater potential zone and to reduce the bias on any single method remote sensing and gis has grasped the great potential in improving our ability to explore the groundwater resources on regional scale jasrotia et al 2013 the input parameters defining the potential of groundwater of an area can be evaluated analyzed and integrated within gis environment in order to derive the final output map of groundwater potential zone al abadi and shahid 2015 arabameri et al 2019 in addition the collaboration of field observations with conventional gis based models helps to improve the local results as exemplified by ozdemir 2011 nampak et al 2014 kumar and pandey 2016 rahmati et al 2016 guru et al 2017 naghibi et al 2017 nsiah et al 2018 singh et al 2018 the integration process of these factors proceeds by multiplying the individual values of each raster with its relative weightage the assignment of weights is subjective and based on the relative significance of the parameter in groundwater recharge or taken from the available literature values krishnamurthy et al 1996 patil and mohite 2014 several studies were carried out to demarcate the potential zones of groundwater in order to facilitate the artificial groundwater recharge practices by applying the gis based models sharma and shukla 2014 2015 thilagavathi et al 2015 venkateswaran and ayyandurai 2015 rahmati et al 2016 singh et al 2018 ahirwar et al 2020 although several studies were reported in literature employed remote sensing and gis approaches for evaluation of the various groundwater controlling factors lee et al 2012 gumma and pavelic 2013 gou et al 2015 golkarian et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in order to develop the output groundwater potential map the present study also focus on evaluation of the various groundwater controlling factors and describing the significance of an individual parameter in formation a groundwater potential zone hoshangabad and budhni district of madhya pradesh is characterized of subtropical climate with a hot dry summer april june followed by monsoon rains july september and a cool and relatively dry winter the average rainfall is about 1194 mm the area under study is part of the narmada basin situated along banks of the narmada river in the area groundwater is one of the primary sources used for fulfilling the agriculture industry and domestic water demand taken in consideration the chief controlling factors of groundwater such as lithology slope geomorphic landforms drainage lineaments lu lc soil and climate it has been seen that the area comprises by hard and soft rock formations a wide part of the area is exposed to massive sandstone characterized by steep slope that discouraging the groundwater recharge practices the southern most part is comprised of unconsolidated deposits of silt sand clay gravel which own good hydrological properties is favorable for groundwater recharge slope has an inverse relationship with groundwater recharge in the area uneven topography with rugged terrain characterized by steep to nearly steep slope towards the northern most portions also supports less to groundwater recharge the high slope exhibit the northern part of the area supports to maximum surface runoff and less recharge during rainy season geomorphic landforms also play a crucial role in occurrence and movement of groundwater of an area jaiswal et al 2003 the main geomorphic unit exposed in the area includes the flood plain denudation hill and structural plateau flood plain deposits owe good groundwater properties because of low slope and thick soil cover where as denudation hill and structural plateau are unfavorable for recharge practices because of their steep and irregular topography drainage is also an important parameter which defines the nature of the underlying rock or soil media and nature of slope the suitability of groundwater potential recharge zones is inversely proportional to drainage density lineaments play a good role in groundwater studies because they facilitate the movement and storage of water high lineament density areas are considered good for groundwater prospect mapping drainage network also facilitates the recharge practices of groundwater high drainage density is the signature of impervious soil rock media and high relief and vice versa similarly lu lc pattern also had a significant role in groundwater recharge and storage prabhakar and tiwari 2015 healthy vegetation agriculture lands grasslands forest etc supports to the groundwater recharge via percolation by plant roots however irrigation practices also increases the amount of water applied to the crops which generally enhances groundwater recharge roark and healy 1998 mcmahon 2003 tillage process also affects on recharge of groundwater by changing soil structure leduc et al 2001 urbanization or built up structures impede the percolation of rainwater into the soil and discourage the recharge practices of groundwater increased impervious area has been major factor in contributing to decreased infiltration which results in decreasing groundwater storage the impact of urbanization on groundwater has a major concern to most urban areas over past few decades and in particular to those involved in groundwater quantity and qualitative studies schirmer et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 soil texture and thickness has also great role in recharge of groundwater coarse textured soils sandy soils own good hydrological properties and drain the infiltrated water quick to the recharge zones whereas fine textured soils clay does not allow rapid flow of infiltrated water beneath the soil thus obstruct the recharge of groundwater rainfall is the chief climatic factor and is the main source of groundwater recharge in the area the mean annual precipitation of the area is nearly 1200 mm and is mostly falling during monsoon period in the area maximum recharge also takes place during the rainy season the present study aims to understand the significance of the groundwater controlling parameters viz geology lineaments geomorphology soil drainage density topography and land use land cover analyzed from various primary and secondary data sets in order to create a thematic database of each parameter for defining the groundwater potential of the area further the integrated approach of remote sensing and gis applied to demonstrate their capability in preparation of reliable database in quick time with good accuracy in the area the major part of the irrigation and drinking water is satisfied by pumping of groundwater from dug wells tube wells bore wells which results in decline of the groundwater table therefore to maintain the balance between withdrawal and recharge of groundwater it is necessary to assess the factors that govern groundwater and draw their relative significance in groundwater recharge 1 1 study area narmada river basin is

given the highest weight 9 silt sand clay gravel has assigned weight 7 followed by calcareous sand gravel and conglomerate weight 6 while shale has assigned weightage 5 and sandstone 3 table 1 3 3 lineament lineaments are the linear features that represent the sub surface geological structures such as fault etc these linear features play an important role in the occurrence movement and storage of groundwater nag 2005 lineament density is directly proportional to groundwater potential high lineament density area is considered as excellent groundwater prospect zone nampak et al 2014 yeh et al 2016 naghibi et al 2017 in the study lineaments analysis was carried out by multi software process of liss iii data using arcgis envi pci geomatica and rockworks 16 lineament density map has been prepared which was further classified into five classes i e 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and 4 km km2 fig 4 highest weightage 10 has been given to the lineament class with lineament density 4 km km2 whereas lowest rating 1 was assigned to lineament class with lineament density varies from 0 to 1 km km2 spatial distribution analysis of lineament has shown high lineament density at the periphery and central portion of the area the high lineament density at the fringe and central part of the area is supporting to good groundwater recharge weightage assigned to each lineament density class is given in table 1 spatial distribution of lineament density observed in the area is presented in fig 4 3 4 geomorphology geomorphology is the study of the landscape surface features geomorphological landforms govern the occurrence and movement of groundwater and play a significant role in groundwater potential and prospect mapping of an area geomorphology map of the area has been prepared by processing of the gsi district resource map gsi 2002 in arcgis the various geomorphic units exposed in the area include flood plain denudation hill and structural plateau fig 5 the major part of the area is occupied by flood plain followed by denudation hill and structural plateau flood plain deposits are exposed along the banks of the narmada river covered the southernmost part of the area these flood plain deposits are mostly comprises of sand silt gravel and conglomerate deposits characterized by gentle slope supports to groundwater recharge practices and forms a good groundwater potential zone the structural plateau has covered the northernmost part of the area whereas denudation hill has occupied the central most part of the area structural plateau and denudation hill landforms owe its origin from past tectonic activities and are modified by denudation processes operating in the area these geomorphic landforms have least significance in groundwater recharge because of their steep slope undulating topography and irregular shape further these landforms are comprises of hard rock formations and are mostly impervious in nature weightage assigned to each geomorphic unit is given in table 1 3 5 soil soil texture and thickness play an important role in the infiltration process of water soil mapping was carried out by analyzing the soils of madhya pradesh resource map nbss lup icar 1996 the predominant soil classes present in the area are fine loamy loamy and loamy skeletal fig 6 the major part of the area is covered by loamy soil loamy soil has occupied northern most part intercalated with patches loamy skeletal soil fine sand and fine loamy soils were occupied the southern most part and is found along river banks of narmada these soils are characterized by good hydrological properties that supports to groundwater recharge practices in the area weightage assigned to each soil class is given in table 1 3 6 slope the slope is an important parameter which influences on the groundwater recharge capability of an area the slope gradient directly influences the infiltration of rainfall gentle or plain slope favors to groundwater recharge because low slope areas allow water to retain for a long time then percolate to groundwater steep slope areas is considered unfavorable for groundwater recharge because steep slope favors rainwater to flow as surface runoff which results in less infiltration slope analysis was carried out by processing the srtm dem with resolution of 30 m the slope in the area varies from 0 to 60 slope 15 is found towards the northernmost part of the area slope in southernmost part of area varies from 5 to 10 highest slope 45 was usually found in the central parts of the area weightage to each slope class has been assigned is given in table 1 the highest weightage 6 has been given to the slope class 0 5 whereas as lowest weightage 1 is given to the slope class 45 slope map of the area prepared is presented in fig 7 3 7 drainage density the drainage density has an inverse relationship with the permeability of aquifers and plays a vital role in the runoff distribution and level of infiltration drainage map has been prepared by digitization of drainages from soi toposheets in arcgis further from drainage map drainage density map of the area has been prepared using drainage density tool of arcgis high drainage density is signature of impervious subsurface media characterized by steep slope whereas low drainage density represents porous subsurface media with gentle slope drainage density map fig 8 has been prepared which was further classified into five categories 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and 4 6 km km2 respectively in the study high drainage density 4 6 km km2 was usually observed towards the northernmost part which signifies low recharge in this part of the area low drainage density 0 1 km km2 is found towards the southernmost portion adjacent to the narmada river represents good recharge potential in this portion of the area drainage density was found medium 2 3 km km2 at central and towards the marginal parts of the area 3 8 land use land cover land use means how people are utilizing the available land resources for either development or socio economic activities land cover is the surface material covering the earth such as agricultural grass forests water body built up etc lu lc pattern has significant role in groundwater recharge and storage prabhakar and tiwari 2015 lu lc affects evapotranspiration runoff and recharge of the groundwater land cover such agriculture grass land pasture lands or plantation areas enhances recharge practices of groundwater whereas land cover such as built up pavement roads and other impervious ground covered structures discourages the recharge practices by obstruct the percolation of rain water to groundwater lu lc mapping was carried out by processing of the sential 2 imagery using arcgis visual interpretation and manual digitization process the major lu lc classes extracted from the satellite data analysis present in the area includes agricultural land built up forest sandy area and water body fig 9 the major part of the area is occupied by forest followed by agriculture land built up water body and sand weightage assigned to lu lc classes are given in table 1 the maximum weightage 7 was given to water body followed by agriculture land 6 sandy area 6 forest area 5 and built up 1 lu lc has good significance in defining the recharge potential of an area irrigation practices carried in arable lands increases the amount of water applied to the crops which generally enhances groundwater recharge tillage process also enhances the recharge of groundwater by changing soil structure in the area forest has covered the northernmost portion which is characterized by steep slope and hard rock supports to less groundwater recharge agriculture land is present in patches along both sides of narmada river supports to recharge activities of groundwater by irrigation and porous soil structure built up is sparsely distributed in the area which does not led any significant affect on groundwater recharge while sandy tract is present along banks of narmada river is supporting to recharge in nearby areas narmada river flows through the middle of the area is also supporting to groundwater recharge practices thorough seepage process 3 9 groundwater potential zone mapping finally the output groundwater potential zone map has been prepared by overlay these determinant groundwater contributing thematic layers using weightage overlay analyses tool of arcgis groundwater potential zones were demarcated based on the groundwater potential index gpi calculated by integration of the thematic layers in arcgis environment the estimated groundwater potential index was further used to classify whether an area is excellent good moderate poor or very poor with respect to groundwater potential of the particular zone table 2 the developed groundwater potential zone map was further classified into five zones i e i excellent ii good iii moderate iv low and v poor fig 10 an extensive part of the area is covered by moderate groundwater potential zone which accounts 117 36 km2 53 99 area followed by good groundwater potential zone cover 51 18 km2 23 54 low groundwater potential zone cover 38 59 km2 17 75 poor groundwater potential zone cover 6 66 km2 3 06 and excellent groundwater potential zone cover 3 58 km2 1 64 respectively table 2 excellent groundwater potential zone has covered a small part of the area towards southernmost side which is occupied by alluvium whereas good groundwater potential zone is exposed along the river valley of narmada river however moderate and low groundwater potential zones are lying in the central portion and towards the northeren side of the area poor groundwater potential zone was found at the periphery towards the north eastern part of the area further validation of the delineated groundwater potential zones was done by overlay interpolation of the well inventory dug and bore well data using arcgis in excellent groundwater potential zone depth to water level varies from 43 to 57 feet whereas depth to water level varies from 58 to 71 feet in good groundwater potential zone depth to groundwater level varies from 72 to 86 feet in moderate gw potential zone depth to groundwater level varies from 87 to 100 in low gw potential zone and in poor groundwater potential zone depth to groundwater level is 100 feet bgl table 2 in excellent and good groundwater potential zone number of groundwater productivity wells are functioning for satisfying the drinking and irrigation water demands in the area coordinates of these well locations were taken using gps during the field survey and are plotted in the map fig 10 4 conclusion in the study remote sensing and gis techniques were applied to map the potential zones groundwater in hoshangabad and budhni industrial area which is a subtropical part of narmada basin this was done by superimposing of various input thematic layers viz geology geomorphology lineament density slope soil drainage density and lu lc using weighted overlay analysis woa tool of arcgis the study reveals that a small part 3 58 km2 1 64 of the area is designed as excellent groundwater potential zone good groundwater potential zone has occupied 51 18 km2 23 54 of the total geographical area the major part of the area 117 36 km2 53 99 is falling in moderate groundwater potential zone however an area of 38 59 km2 17 35 is falling in low groundwater potential zone whereas a small part 6 66 km2 3 06 is coming under poor groundwater potential zone further the delineated potential zones of groundwater were validated by overlay of dug well bore well water level data huge difference in groundwater levels were usually observed in these delineated gw potential zones depth to groundwater level varies from 43 to 57 feet in excellent gw potential zone whereas groundwater level varies from 58 to 71 72 86 and 87 100 feet respectively in good moderate and low gw potential zone in poor gw potential zone depth to groundwater exceeds 100 feet below ground surface the spatial distribution of water level reveals the potential of groundwater in different zones in the area further a number of groundwater productive bore tube open wells are functioning in the excellent moderate and good groundwater potential zone to fulfill the drinking and irrigation water demand these identified potential zones of groundwater

11918,it has been widely recognized that groundwater susceptibility to contamination is a function of a complex interplay of factors including land use dynamics pollutant sources hydrogeology climate and biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer spatially targeting the risk levels and coverage of groundwater contamination is a challenging task requiring a spatial multi criteria and integrative approach to account for the various drivers this study applied the original drastic drastic o model where its weightage was further modified using the advanced analytic hierarchical process ahp to develop the drastic ahp approach the groundwater modelling approach included specific vulnerability using pollutant potential impact ppi and incorporation of land use into the drastic model drastic lu a composite groundwater vulnerability model was developed to simultaneously integrate the drastic ahp ppi and drastic lu thus accounting for both natural and human sources of groundwater contamination the approach was illustrated for the wewe oda watershed an urban catchment in the oforikrom municipality of the ashanti region in ghana the findings show that about 34 of the catchment is at high to very high risks of groundwater contamination the developed composite model is shown to address limitations of the drastic o model particularly by incorporating anthropogenic sources of pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water pollution point source pollution non point source pollution drastic ahp 1 introduction water is essential for human existence oestigaard 2009 water covers about 75 of the earth s surface but just 2 5 by volume is fresh water two thirds of this fresh water is captured in glaciers and ice caps which is very difficult to extract just about 0 77 of the earth s water is held in aquifers soil pores lakes swamps rivers and atmosphere gleick 1993 thomas and rösch 2000 with recent developments especially in urban environments coupled with unsustainable population growth improper spatial planning and excessive socioeconomic activities the quality of surface waters in particular have been compromised leading to rapid reduction in the quantity of water available for both domestic and agricultural applications madhavan and subramanian 2007 ternus et al 2011 the business as usual scenario developed by thomas and rösch 2000 showed that water stress in west africa southern africa and south asia is likely to escalate by the year 2025 and this is strongly underpinned by urban and agricultural reconfigurations for instance illegal mining advanced pesticide use and fertilizer applications in ghana have jeopardized the quality of surface water rendering it unsafe for use anim gyampo et al 2019 the resultant effect is over reliance on groundwater which requires little or no pre treatment as compared to surface water it is estimated that about 1 5 billion people across the globe now rely on groundwater for domestic uses adimalla and wu 2019 ghana and especially the oforikrom municipality where the wewe oda watershed is located is heavily dependent on groundwater agbefu et al 2016 groundwater has now become the preferred source of water for various uses in sub saharan africa and other parts of the world as reflected by its contribution to socioeconomic development balasubramani et al 2020 levy and xu 2012 singh et al 2020 having adequate conception of aquifer vulnerability especially modalities of its development has been a central element in groundwater protection policies worldwide for this reason the need to identify and holistically understand the drivers and mechanisms of groundwater contamination has become essential it has been argued that aquifer recharge is the primary mechanistic process for the transport of contaminants into the aquifer through infiltration of precipitation and that understanding groundwater vulnerability to pollution is inextricably connected to the mechanisms of recharge and hydrogeological nature of the recharge environment khosravi et al 2018 yoo et al 2016 also ion exchange is another important mechanism that determines the aquifer vulnerability and groundwater chemistry and has been studied using the chloro alkaline indices proposed by schoeller 1967 and marghade et al 2012 as cited in li et al 2013 the contamination of the aquifer can be further augmented by anthropogenic activities leading to discharge of pollutants and land use changes huang et al 2017 considering the drivers of contamination scenarios in different hydrogeological and human settings such as population density lack of sewage system presence of agricultural fertilizers partially confined nature of aquifers and the amount of annual rainfall modelling groundwater vulnerability to pollution requires the identification and examination of factors that span both anthropogenic and naturally related factors stevenazzi et al 2017 however some studies have focused mostly on the intrinsic nature of the aquifer vulnerability mostly the protective strength of the aquifer while neglecting the nature of pollutant sources such as pit latrines landfills dumpsites cemeteries and gasoline stations which characterize most urban watersheds and thus can complicate pollutant loading and biogeochemical reactions within the unsaturated zone for this reason re et al 2017 emphasized the need to have a critical look at human influence on groundwater contamination especially where pollutant loading cannot be downplayed huang et al 2017 on the other hand emphasized the need to critically evaluate the impact of the vadose zone as it is the final defense against pollutants for further infiltration and dispersion into the aquifer in the vadose zone there are various geochemical reactions such as ion exchange and recharge is the primary carrier of pollutants yoo et al 2016 accordingly the need to examine areas which are highly susceptible to groundwater contamination through a comprehensive evaluation has become important for sustainable water management anornu et al 2012 gad et al 2015 kaliraj et al 2015 remesan and panda 2008 considering the spatial complexities with respect to mechanisms and drivers of groundwater vulnerability to various pollutants it is essential to adequately identify and integrate these factors in a holistic framework groundwater contamination is a function of natural and anthropogenic forces which interact in a fashion that makes it possible to predict spatial vulnerability degree mogaji 2018 several modelling techniques have been devised over the years to aid in spatial vulnerability assessment including drastic aller et al 1987 avi aquifer vulnerability index marjuanto et al 2019 putranto et al 2018 god ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 and sintacs ewusi et al 2017 kumar et al 2013 oroji 2019 the drastic method incorporates seven hydrogeological parameters that drive intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer d depth to groundwater r aquifer net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone and c hydraulic conductivity despite wide application of drastic concerns about the subjectivity in factor weightage and neglect of human land use impact have been raised barbulescu 2020 zhang et al 2013 for this reason several modifications including factor removal weight adjustment and land use integration have been used to achieve an improved model that depicts realistic contamination scenarios in different local settings lad et al 2019 oroji 2019 remesan and panda 2008 for example some researchers have added further parameters to the original model factors such as land use index lineaments aquifer thickness and impact of contaminant kang et al 2017 others have used multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce approach to both remove some factors and adjust the weights zhang et al 2013 other forms of statistical and process based modelling techniques exist but due to their difficulty of integration into geographic information systems gis the overlay and index methods such as drastic have been widely used and achieved considerable success aller et al 1987 shakoor et al 2018 accordingly the objective of this study is to address the subjective weightage in drastic and apply it to account for specific vulnerability through pollutant potential impact and land use changes in the oforikrom municipality of ghana there is the need to adjust the drastic weightage to capture the impact of various hydrogeological factors that drive intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer the human environment such as land use land cover dynamics and the impact of various pollutants released into the environment which comprehensively drive the specific vulnerability of the aquifer to provide an objective weightage of drastic parameters it is worthwhile to adequately apply the widely popular analytical hierarchy process ahp saaty 2001 for an urban catchment adequate geographic mapping is important to identify the impact of various potential pollutant sources including cemeteries dumpsites farmlands pit latrines and gasoline stations and examine them together with different land use classes these potential pollutant sources are primary to the development of the specific vulnerability and its subsequent integration into the drastic intrinsic model towards generating a composite vulnerability model rigorous land use activities such as agriculture industrial activities and escalated frequency of pollutant release have threatened the quality of groundwater aboagye and zume 2019 adimalla and wu 2019 al djazouli et al 2020 anornu et al 2012 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 zhang et al 2013 anthropogenic loading of nitrogen and phosphorous from industrial municipal and agricultural sources in ghana for instance has increased nutrients in many aquifers in assessing the quality and health risk of shallow aquifers in atankwidi basin in the upper east region of ghana anim gyampo et al 2019 noted that 13 out of 26 sample wells boreholes had concentrations of arsenic and lead exceeding the who recommended limit of 0 01 mg l for each constituent these levels of groundwater contamination increase the exposure to diseases such as carcinogenic maladies chattopadhyay et al 2020 for instance ukah et al 2019 found that about 23 of individuals were exposed to high cancer risk due to higher arsenic copper and nickel concentration in groundwater in a densely populated industrial area in lagos nigeria similarly the presence of geothermal fluids agrochemicals such as nitrates and other metallic elements such as manganese in groundwater has led to severe health implications in many countries including kenya and ghana akoto et al 2019 malago 2017 nesta et al 2016 fecal contamination of groundwater has been observed in kamangira zimbabwe due to proximities between groundwater sources and pit latrines dzwairo et al 2006 similarly coliform and enterococci in groundwater in kentinkronu oforikrom municipality has been discovered to be higher than the who recommended level which has been attributed to proximities between these groundwater sources and pit latrines mor et al 2006 discovered that the proximity between landfills dumpsites and groundwater sources has tremendous impact on groundwater quality in terms of higher concentration of faecal coliform fc and total coliform tc in delhi india enterococci and other microbiological pollutants have been examined within the wewe oda watershed agbefu et al 2016 awuah et al 2014 obiri danso et al 2009 where it was observed that microbial pollutant concentrations in wells closer to dumpsites and pit latrines were higher compared to wells boreholes far away in a study conducted by barros et al 2019 in portugal it was discovered that the impact of malignant neoplasms that affect the hematopoietic system and lymphoid tissue was higher in the first 50 m from gasoline stations 54 cases per 100 000 inhabitants for males and 20 per 100 000 for females the oforikrom municipality has received attention in groundwater research due to its high groundwater use and proximity to the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology kumasi for example agbefu et al 2016 discovered high microbial contamination in selected groundwater sources at kotei a peri urban community within oforikrom municipality where the current study is conducted however it was concluded that contaminant presence could not be attributed to onsite sanitation system only but also from other diffuse sources modelling approach which integrates anthropogenic and natural factors for groundwater vulnerability to contamination has not been done within the watershed even though ewusi et al 2016 applied the drastic model to spatially target groundwater vulnerability land use index and impact of contaminants were not included and it was at the regional level entire kumasi metropolis where finer details were not differentiated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wewe oda watershed shown in fig 1 is a medium sized catchment located on the eastern flank of the oforikrom municipality in ashanti region ghana temperature within the catchment ranges from 21 to 31 c with annual mean rainfall of about 1397 mm major soil groups within the watershed are forest ochrosols and lithosols on the basis of hydrologic soil groups ross et al 2018 sandy clay and loamy sand dominates the watershed the catchment is drained by the wewe and oda rivers and is geologically underlain by birimian meta sedimentary units of precambrian origin and batholith which is associated with acid intrusive rocks murray et al 1960 as cited in ewusi et al 2016 the rocks have undergone deformation through foliation jointing fracturing and weathering resulting in relatively high yields of groundwater kesse 1985 the highest groundwater yield was reported to be 900 l per minute l m and the lowest was 8 l m with areas underlain by phyllites associated with higher yields compared to areas underlain by granites ewusi et al 2016 as of 2017 natural forest within oforikrom municipality covers an insignificant amount of about 2 6 ha nero 2017 about 55 percent of the oforikrom municipality is covered by urban areas with the remaining mostly covered by natural vegetation and cropland there is rapid urbanization in oforikrom municipality which has accelerated the conversion of fragile natural environments to human settlements the oforikrom municipality has a population of 303 016 based on the 2010 population and housing census ghana statistical service 2014 2 2 data sources rainfall data were obtained from worldclim 2020 for a period of 30 years soil data including soil bulk density were acquired from soilgrid250m hengl et al 2017 digital elevation model dem was obtained from usgs data portal water table elevation was determined from field work undertaken by this study and net recharge was derived using water balance approach data on actual evapotranspiration were acquired from famine early warning system network fews net database https fews net data on potential pollutant sources were obtained through field mapping using a hand held global positioning system gps unit of about 1 2 m accuracy various software employed in the study included arcgis 10 3 qgis 2 182 soil plant atmosphere water spaw saxton 2017 geoda 1 14 and microsoft excel 2 2 1 mapping of potential pollutant sources the spatial distribution of potential pollutant sources within the catchment varied with the nature of the environment and residential density generally potential pollutant sources such as dumpsites and pit latrines were located in moderate to high density residential areas while most fuel filling stations were found in low density residential areas farmlands on other hand were normally found in low density residential areas the potential pollutant sources were thoroughly assessed by examining their proximities to groundwater sources land use and hydrogeological properties of their locations see fig 2 2 3 the modified drastic index method the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer was modeled using the seven hydrogeological factors including aquifer recharge soil media and impact of the vadose zone aquifer media topography and saturated hydraulic conductivity the traditional weights assigned to the original drastic model were modified through the ahp weighting method to produce the drastic ahp based intrinsic vulnerability model furthermore the pollutants potential impact ppi was determined by characterizing the existing potential pollutant sources within the watershed based on their proximities to groundwater sources distance to hydrologic flow paths the textural and compact nature of the soils where they are found and also whether they are located within a particular land use class such as bare ground farmland or settlement areas finally the ahp based model was integrated into the pollutant risk potential model together with land use dynamics to generate the final groundwater vulnerability model for the catchment the overall composite groundwater vulnerability model was computed using the expression cgvi d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r l u w l u r where cgvi is the composite groundwater vulnerability index w and r refer to weight and rate respectively and the factors d r a s t i and c are as defined previously l u w and l u r which comprise the land use weights and rates were added to the drastic model the pollutants potential impact index is calculated as ppi i 0 p w p r where p r is the cumulative rate assigned to each potential pollutant source based on factors such as soil texture and bulk density land use proximity to groundwater sources hydrologic flow paths and p w is the pollutant type weight assigned through ahp ratings and weights for the original drastic model are presented in table 1 2 4 drastic input parameters 2 4 1 estimation of depth to water table the depth to water table represents the minimum vertical travel distance for contaminants as well as controlling the attenuation of contaminants as they travel vertically into the aquifer lad et al 2019 shakoor et al 2018 this parameter has been weighted 5 according to aller et al 1987 therefore an area with shallow water table is likely to have its aquifer more prone to contamination anornu et al 2012 generally in the absence of data the water table can be inferred from the general directions of groundwater flow which in turn can be estimated from topographic maps or elevation data where flow should be downslope toward perennial streams in this study the elevation data was used in combination with a field survey where gps was used to locate 83 sampled water wells the depth to water table was determined by measuring the depth of each water well using a clean rope tied with a weight to one end having lowered the rope with the weight to touch the bottom of the well a tape measure was used to determine the depth to the water table for each well after obtaining such data the water table elevation was determined by subtracting the depth to the water table in water wells static well level from the dem for all the water wells the results obtained were then interpolated using kriging and combined with the dem to generate the water table surface 2 4 2 estimation of net recharge the net recharge represents the quantity of water that enters the aquifer gad et al 2015 generally places with higher volume of annual recharge are more likely to have the quality of their groundwater compromised this parameter was determined using the water balance method suggested by sachan et al 2008 the annual rainfall from worldclim climatic data repository and actual evapotranspiration data from fews net data portal were used these data sets were resampled to 20 m using the cubic convolution resampling method the runoff data was determined through the expression q p k where q is the annual runoff mm p represents the annual rainfall mm within the watershed and k represents the runoff coefficients determined based on factors such as the hydrologic soil groups of the area the land cover types the residential density and the slope of the area the residential density and land cover types were obtained through digitizing a high resolution satellite image of the watershed obtained from openstreetmap using the dem the slope was computed and soil properties information were obtained from soilgrid250m utilizing the expression r p eta q where r is the annual net recharge p is rainfall eta is actual evapotranspiration and q is the runoff the net recharge was computed for the watershed 2 4 3 estimation of aquifer media properties the attenuation capacity of the aquifer media depends on the size and amount of its grains the finer the grains the higher the attenuation capacity samake et al 2011 it has been weighted 3 according to aller et al 1987 a soil thematic map was produced by obtaining soil data from soilgrid250m the soil data contains proportion of sand silt and clay arranged into levels levels 1 to 7 each level representing its depth below land surface from 0 to 2 m considering the shallow and unconfined nature of the aquifer within the watershed a depth of 2 m was used to characterize the aquifer media the saga tool in qgis 2 18 was used to derive the soil texture for this media after mapping the soil texture it was reclassified based on the porous nature of the soil textural class loamy sand was rated 8 whereas sandy clay was rated 4 2 4 4 estimation of topographical information under similar soil condition steep slopes 18 generally intensify runoff whereas gentle and flatter slopes 0 2 enhance infiltration samake et al 2011 this parameter was computed from the dem obtained from the usgs data portal after mapping the slope within the watershed it was reclassified based on the rating scheme presented in table 1 2 4 5 estimation of soil media properties the soil provides the initial defense against pollutant infiltration shakoor et al 2018 different characteristics such as texture structure and compaction significantly control the infiltration rate data on soil was obtained from soilgrid250m with fractions of sand silt and clay soil textural classes were then derived using the saga tool in qgis 2 18 after mapping the soil textural classes they were then reclassified on the basis of the infiltration rate and porosity by using the rating shown in table 1 2 4 6 estimation of vadose zone properties the geologic makeup of the vadose zone is very important to the regulation of pollutant sorption dispersion and biogeochemical reactions al mallah and al qurnawi 2018 shakoor et al 2018 the perviousness of the vadose zone controls the extent of aquifer pollution lad et al 2019 soil data obtained from soilgrid250m were classified into textural groups in saga environment using qgis 2 18 the soil textural groups within the vadose zone were sandy clay and loamy sand based on the porosity of these soils the map was reclassified based on the rating scheme presented in table 1 2 4 7 estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity determines the rate at which contaminants are transmitted within the aquifer ewusi et al 2016 2017 kaliraj et al 2015 this variable was extracted from the aquifer geologic material type there is limited data available on the hydraulic conductivity in the study area so the soil plant air water spaw software developed by the united states department of agriculture usda was used using spaw the saturated hydraulic conductivity for various aquifer media was computed this computation follows the expression ks 1930 θ s θ 33 3 λ developed by saxton and rawls 2006 where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity θ s is the saturated moisture content 0 kpa θ 33 is the 33 kpa moisture and λ is the slope of logarithmic tension moisture curve the saturated conductivity ranges from 0 0183 to 2 189 m day these soil properties do not exactly match but are the closest to those found in the studied catchment the mapped saturated hydraulic conductivity was reclassified based on the rating scheme in table 1 2 5 ahp modified drastic model one of the most critical weaknesses of the drastic model is the subjectivity of the weight assigned to criteria kang et al 2017 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 considering varied environmental conditions in different geographical areas factors impacting intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer may differ thus necessitating adjustment of weights assigned to the factors generally the original drastic model has been modified using different techniques such as factor weight adjustment and factor map removal kaliraj et al 2015 in this study ahp was applied to weighting each hydrogeological factor with respect to its relative impact on groundwater vulnerability to contamination to reduce the level of subjectivity in the original weighting the allotment of relative importance to individual factors was done by placing criteria both vertically and horizontally to compute a pairwise comparison matrix after which cell values were normalized in order to obtain the relative weight of criteria after the weightages the consistency index ci was computed using the expression varimax λ n n 1 where λ is the varimax and n is the number of criteria investigated finally the ci was combined with the random index ri to obtain the consistency ratio cr the ci was estimated to be 0 0279 and cr was 0 02118 showing the consistency level of the assigned weightages were highly acceptable since cr is less than 0 1 ishizaka and labib 2009 both the original drastic drastic o and drastic ahp were compared with the ppi model to determine the performance level of drastic ahp see table 2 2 6 estimation of aquifer vulnerability based on pollutant risk impact the characterization of contaminant impact levels with respect to groundwater pollution was analyzed with respect to soil bulk density where the pollutant in question is located proximities of pollutants to groundwater sources proximities of contaminant sources to hydrologic flow paths the land use land cover class of the pollutant source and the soil textural class potential pollutant sources identified such as cemeteries dumpsites toilets gasoline stations and farms were weighted using the ahp approach both the ci 0 0207 and cr 0 0185 were less than 0 1 meaning the computed relative weights were consistent lad et al 2019 pramanik 2016 tran et al 2002 2 6 1 pit latrines toilet facilities impact of pit latrines and poor toilet infrastructure and their impact on the quality of groundwater and human health have been evident especially in sub saharan africa graham and polizzotto 2013 table 3 surface runoff can accelerate surficial transport of pollutants before infiltration as observed within the watershed obiri danso et al 2009 in this study the impact of pit latrines on groundwater was comprehensively analyzed using criteria presented in table 4 to build a thematic risk map inverse distance weighting idw interpolation technique was used to interpolate points for predicting areas where these potential pollutant sources were not sampled 2 6 2 dumpsites as potential pollutant sources the impact of leachate percolation on groundwater quality has been obvious in especially less developed areas in areas where waste management is poor groundwater quality is likely to be greatly compromised it has been widely noted that the interaction between local hydrogeological condition and waste management has significant impact on groundwater quality and aquifer vulnerability for instance an environment with high frequency of pollutant loading underlain by porous and less compact soils makes the aquifer very vulnerable to contamination awuah et al 2014 mor et al 2006 in this study the impact of spatial distribution of dumpsites was analyzed with respect to proximity to groundwater sources such as wells boreholes and hydrologic flow paths also soil texture was examined to determine the likelihood of leachate percolation into the aquifer 2 6 3 agricultural fields nitrate concentration in groundwater has been related to agriculture as well as to human sewage sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 the field infiltration capacity of the soils was analyzed through their bulk density and texture proximity of these agricultural lands to groundwater sources was also integrated into the model though the country gives no specific threshold distance to which agricultural lands should be away from groundwater sources the guidelines were extracted from recommendations made by the michigan department of environmental quality 2009 2 6 4 gasoline stations and cemeteries the indiana department of natural resources 2020 has set a maximum distance to which gasoline stations should be from groundwater sources at 500 ft 150 m to prevent benzene impact level on groundwater and risk to human health indiana department of natural resources 2020 this figure is adjustable depending on the local perviousness index according to the who cemeteries constitute another source of threat to groundwater quality and a minimum distance of 100 m was thus set which is adjustable depending on the nature of soils these two potential pollutant sources were characterized using the local land use conditions soil texture proximities to groundwater sources and surface hydrologic flow paths 3 results 3 1 landscape change in the wewe oda catchment the urban expansion and intensification in the wewe oda catchment are indicated by the population densities in 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 presented in fig 3 urban growth in the wewe oda catchment is moving eastward with intensification occurring on both the north and south sides resultant effects include the escalating manner of improper spatial planning as well as the emergence of diverse pollutants generated through anthropogenic activities thereby posing threat to groundwater quality for example the kumasi metropolitan assembly 2017 noted that oforikrom municipality over the past 10 years has lost about 80 of its natural environment to settlement expansion this has necessitated probing into the impact of these changes on natural resources such as groundwater extraction and quality levels nero 2017 noted that the vegetation cover declined fourfold from 2014 to 2017 and that the urban greenspace area per capita was moderately correlated for 2009 r 2 0 50 p 0 049 and 2014 r 2 0 53 p 0 0398 with socioeconomic conditions of sub metropolises of the kumasi metropolitan area including the wewe oda catchment 3 2 drastic model input parameters 3 2 1 depth to water table in the wewe oda catchment the elevation of the water table and its corresponding rating are shown in fig 4 after computing the water table elevation it was interpolated using kriging the water table elevation ranged from 224 6 to 313 6 m generally the middle to the southwestern flank of the catchment had shallow water table elevation 227 8 253 3 m the water table elevation was moderate 253 3 266 1 m in the southeastern to central part of the catchment whereas the northern flank had a water table elevation of 267 313 6 m denoting less susceptibility to groundwater contamination 3 2 2 net recharge in the wewe oda catchment the net recharge and its corresponding rating in the wewe oda watershed are shown in fig 5 the annual recharge ranged between 47 and 268 mm year with higher net recharge occurring along a northeast to southwest alignment and the least recharge along the southeastern flank of the watershed 3 2 3 aquifer media in the wewe oda catchment the aquifer media and its corresponding rating in the wewe oda watershed are shown in fig 6 in this watershed aquifer lithological classes include silty clay silty clay loam sandy clay sandy clay loam and loamy sand the aquifer media in the northern part of the catchment which is dominated by silty clay and sandy clay has higher attenuation capacity than the middle to the southern part which is mainly silty loam 3 2 4 topographical information in the wewe oda catchment the topography of the wewe oda catchment and its rating are shown in fig 7 slope values in the catchment ranged from 0 to 36 as presented in fig 7 left hand side image indicating an undulating surface the topographic impact on groundwater vulnerability scenarios is almost uniform across the watershed 3 2 5 soil media in the wewe oda catchment the hydrologic soil groups and corresponding ratings in the wewe oda catchment are shown in fig 8 the soil groups within the watershed include sandy clay loamy sand and sand the northern and southern parts are underlain by sandy clay which is indicative of less permeable soils whereas central areas have loamy sand and sand which will allow more percolation and can thus transmit leachates quite rapidly 3 2 6 vadose zone in the wewe oda catchment the hydrologic soil groups in the vadose zone and the associated rating in the wewe oda catchment are shown in fig 9 much of the northeastern and west central regions are loamy sand whereas the southern and northwestern regions are mainly sandy clay which has higher attenuation capacity 3 2 7 saturated hydraulic conductivity in the wewe oda catchment the saturated hydraulic conductivity and its associated risk rating in the wewe oda catchment are shown in fig 10 the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the watershed ranged from 0 0183 to 2 189 m day the majority of the catchment has values between 0 15 and 0 35 m day 3 3 original drastic intrinsic groundwater vulnerability all seven hydrogeological parameters were integrated to compute the intrinsic vulnerability zones in the catchment within a gis environment using the weighted sum overlay algorithm in arcgis 10 3 the intrinsic vulnerability based on the drastic o model applied to the wewe oda catchment is shown in fig 11 vulnerability zones were categorized into five classes 62 58 to 86 35 very low 86 35 to 110 12 low 110 12 to 133 89 moderate 133 89 to 157 65 high and 157 65 181 43 very high vulnerability the result indicates that towns like apirade kokoben appiadu and kentinkronu fall into the low to very low vulnerability class whereas kotei domeabra boadi and anwomaso are in the high to very high vulnerability class in terms of area coverage very low low moderate high and very high covered 38 35 1651 20 638 12 1117 71 and 1021 65 ha respectively the implication is that based on the characterization of the aquifer s ability to protect against the impact of contaminants about 62 of the watershed is vulnerable and therefore required serious attention 3 4 drastic ahp intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer using the weighted sum overlay drastic ahp intrinsic vulnerability map was generated as presented in fig 12 the result indicates that there is a significant difference in spatial vulnerability zones demarcated by drastic o and drastic ahp the drastic ahp model correlates more strongly with the ppi model r 2 0 67 than the original model does r 2 0 36 however the southwestern and northeastern regions retained very vulnerable condition as under the drastic o model considering how well the drastic ahp model correlates with the pollutant impact model they were integrated to produce the composite vulnerability of the aquifer in the watershed under the drastic ahp model very low low moderate high and very high categories covered 779 97 748 14 1809 33 896 70 and 143 26 ha respectively 3 5 specific aquifer vulnerability based on potential impact of pollutant sources pollutants that drive groundwater vulnerability are diverse and large in number but are better characterized within the local context broadly they can be categorized into point source and non point source pollutants the study considered four point sources of pollutants dumpsites pit latrines gasoline stations and cemeteries together with one non point source farmlands these pollutants source risk levels were semi quantitatively assessed by relating them to distance to groundwater sources proximity to hydrologic flow paths the bulk densities of local soils local residential density land cover types and the local hydrologic soil group the various pollutant factors used are presented in fig 13 the rating of the various criteria which determined the impact of each potential pollutant source was earlier presented in table 4 the rated maps for different criteria driving the risk level of contaminants were generated separately after which they were added using the raster calculator in arcgis 10 3 to obtain the cumulative rated thematic layers for all five potential pollutant sources relative weights were assigned to each potential pollutant source using the ahp based on their potential impact on groundwater vulnerability the final risk level model was generated using the weighted sum overlay in arcgis 10 3 and zoned into five vulnerability classes the layers were overlaid using the weighted sum overlay to generate potential impact of pollutants on groundwater contamination the resulting specific aquifer vulnerability for the wewe oda catchment is presented in fig 14 the result shows that about 30 of the wewe oda catchment is identified as being at high to very high risk of groundwater vulnerability moderate risk levels cover another 38 of the catchment the towns of boadi anwomaso kotei domeabra deduako and kokoben are high to very high vulnerability whereas apromase apiadu kentinkrono and prabon are in the low to very low vulnerability classes emena and apirade are moderately vulnerable the very low low moderate high to very high vulnerability zones covered 265 34 1130 35 1671 61 1151 55 and 169 81 ha respectively the findings show that the impact of dumpsites on the specific vulnerability of the aquifer was very strong r 2 0 91 and a moderate correlation was discovered between specific vulnerability and farmlands r 2 0 65 from the results of the individual thematic layers it was discovered that the central section of the watershed and the southeast and northeast corners generally ranged from high to very high vulnerability condition with regards to aquifer susceptibility to pollutant impacts 3 6 modified drastic model based on land use drastic lu after weight adjustment to reduce the subjectivity of the original model weightages a separate model was developed to characterize areas based on spatial differentiation of land use activities and their potential impact on groundwater pollution a land use and residential density map was created by digitizing high resolution satellite imagery of the wewe oda catchment different land use land cover classes were digitized to characterize the environment where a particular groundwater source was situated the resulting land use characterization of the wewe oda catchment is presented in fig 15 to determine the drastic model modified based on land use denoted drastic lu the expression l u w l u r which comprises the land use weights and rates was added to the drastic model the weighted sum overlay was used to compute the final drastic lu model which is presented in fig 16 the result shows that north central parts of the region have very high vulnerability with respect to groundwater contamination the northern tip and southern parts on the contrary are relatively safe with very low to low risks of groundwater contamination 3 7 composite groundwater vulnerability integrating the ppi and the drastic based on ahp weighting and land use the composite groundwater vulnerability model cgvm for the watershed was generated the resulting composite groundwater vulnerability in the wewe oda catchment is presented in fig 17 it was found that under both natural and anthropogenic factors the ne to sw parts of the wewe oda catchment are more vulnerable than the southern and northern sections the cgvm shows that about 644 21 ha representing approximately 15 of the catchment is under very high vulnerability condition and 750 99 ha 17 4 is under high vulnerability condition moderate vulnerability covered 891 48 ha 20 7 whereas low and very low covered 1124 2 ha 26 1 and 900 23 ha 20 9 respectively the most vulnerable towns with respect to the aquifer s susceptibility to contamination by pollutants are kotei boadi domeabra and anwomaso fig 18 it is apparent that each model delineates the vulnerable zones somewhat differently however considering a fairly good correlation between the ppi model representing purely anthropogenic pollutant impacts and drastic ahp model r 2 0 67 they were both integrated with drastic lu representing land use dynamics to produce the composite model since the drastic model is partly based on the protective degree of the aquifer with respect to its hydrogeological makeup it does not always depict the holistic situation on the ground especially when anthropogenic influences such as spatial diversity of pollutant loadings and dynamics of pollutant runoff and surficial transport are not considered higher concentrations of pollutants such as nitrates within the groundwater result from extraneous variables such as pollutant spatial distribution land use and importantly the biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer thus this study incorporated the impact of potential pollutant sources and anthropogenic influence to address weaknesses of the original drastic model with the aim of improved geographic targeting of groundwater vulnerability 4 conclusions this study has critically investigated the aquifer susceptibility to contamination in the wewe oda watershed within the oforikrom municipality of ashanti region ghana using the gis based drastic model adjustment of the original drastic weights using ahp improved the correlation with the ppi model from r 2 0 36 to r 2 0 67 pollutant risk and land use impacts were integrated into the drastic ahp model to generate the composite groundwater vulnerability model results indicated that about 34 of the watershed is under high to very high groundwater vulnerability the impact of dumpsites was most strongly correlated with the ppi model r 2 0 91 followed by toilet facilities r 2 0 86 gasoline stations r 2 0 69 and cemeteries r 2 0 76 the weakest correlation was observed with agricultural fields r 2 0 65 the correlations for the ppi factors illustrate higher levels of contamination from potential point sources than non point sources of pollution the potential point sources are mostly located in moderate to high density settlements given that a large portion of the wewe oda catchment is at high risk of groundwater contamination from both natural and human sources it is therefore highly recommended that both structural and non structural e g public education mitigation measures be undertaken to reduce pollutant generation and loading especially in towns like kotei boadi domeabra and deduako secondly greater attention should be given to solid waste management and modality of toilet facilities design since they strongly correlated with the pollutants impact model specific vulnerability model and tend to have greater pollution potential the modelling approach illustrated is integrated and is recommended for groundwater vulnerability assessments in urban watersheds which may have both natural and anthropogenic sources in addition future studies should incorporate field water quality measures particularly from water wells to validate the modelling investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

11918,it has been widely recognized that groundwater susceptibility to contamination is a function of a complex interplay of factors including land use dynamics pollutant sources hydrogeology climate and biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer spatially targeting the risk levels and coverage of groundwater contamination is a challenging task requiring a spatial multi criteria and integrative approach to account for the various drivers this study applied the original drastic drastic o model where its weightage was further modified using the advanced analytic hierarchical process ahp to develop the drastic ahp approach the groundwater modelling approach included specific vulnerability using pollutant potential impact ppi and incorporation of land use into the drastic model drastic lu a composite groundwater vulnerability model was developed to simultaneously integrate the drastic ahp ppi and drastic lu thus accounting for both natural and human sources of groundwater contamination the approach was illustrated for the wewe oda watershed an urban catchment in the oforikrom municipality of the ashanti region in ghana the findings show that about 34 of the catchment is at high to very high risks of groundwater contamination the developed composite model is shown to address limitations of the drastic o model particularly by incorporating anthropogenic sources of pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water pollution point source pollution non point source pollution drastic ahp 1 introduction water is essential for human existence oestigaard 2009 water covers about 75 of the earth s surface but just 2 5 by volume is fresh water two thirds of this fresh water is captured in glaciers and ice caps which is very difficult to extract just about 0 77 of the earth s water is held in aquifers soil pores lakes swamps rivers and atmosphere gleick 1993 thomas and rösch 2000 with recent developments especially in urban environments coupled with unsustainable population growth improper spatial planning and excessive socioeconomic activities the quality of surface waters in particular have been compromised leading to rapid reduction in the quantity of water available for both domestic and agricultural applications madhavan and subramanian 2007 ternus et al 2011 the business as usual scenario developed by thomas and rösch 2000 showed that water stress in west africa southern africa and south asia is likely to escalate by the year 2025 and this is strongly underpinned by urban and agricultural reconfigurations for instance illegal mining advanced pesticide use and fertilizer applications in ghana have jeopardized the quality of surface water rendering it unsafe for use anim gyampo et al 2019 the resultant effect is over reliance on groundwater which requires little or no pre treatment as compared to surface water it is estimated that about 1 5 billion people across the globe now rely on groundwater for domestic uses adimalla and wu 2019 ghana and especially the oforikrom municipality where the wewe oda watershed is located is heavily dependent on groundwater agbefu et al 2016 groundwater has now become the preferred source of water for various uses in sub saharan africa and other parts of the world as reflected by its contribution to socioeconomic development balasubramani et al 2020 levy and xu 2012 singh et al 2020 having adequate conception of aquifer vulnerability especially modalities of its development has been a central element in groundwater protection policies worldwide for this reason the need to identify and holistically understand the drivers and mechanisms of groundwater contamination has become essential it has been argued that aquifer recharge is the primary mechanistic process for the transport of contaminants into the aquifer through infiltration of precipitation and that understanding groundwater vulnerability to pollution is inextricably connected to the mechanisms of recharge and hydrogeological nature of the recharge environment khosravi et al 2018 yoo et al 2016 also ion exchange is another important mechanism that determines the aquifer vulnerability and groundwater chemistry and has been studied using the chloro alkaline indices proposed by schoeller 1967 and marghade et al 2012 as cited in li et al 2013 the contamination of the aquifer can be further augmented by anthropogenic activities leading to discharge of pollutants and land use changes huang et al 2017 considering the drivers of contamination scenarios in different hydrogeological and human settings such as population density lack of sewage system presence of agricultural fertilizers partially confined nature of aquifers and the amount of annual rainfall modelling groundwater vulnerability to pollution requires the identification and examination of factors that span both anthropogenic and naturally related factors stevenazzi et al 2017 however some studies have focused mostly on the intrinsic nature of the aquifer vulnerability mostly the protective strength of the aquifer while neglecting the nature of pollutant sources such as pit latrines landfills dumpsites cemeteries and gasoline stations which characterize most urban watersheds and thus can complicate pollutant loading and biogeochemical reactions within the unsaturated zone for this reason re et al 2017 emphasized the need to have a critical look at human influence on groundwater contamination especially where pollutant loading cannot be downplayed huang et al 2017 on the other hand emphasized the need to critically evaluate the impact of the vadose zone as it is the final defense against pollutants for further infiltration and dispersion into the aquifer in the vadose zone there are various geochemical reactions such as ion exchange and recharge is the primary carrier of pollutants yoo et al 2016 accordingly the need to examine areas which are highly susceptible to groundwater contamination through a comprehensive evaluation has become important for sustainable water management anornu et al 2012 gad et al 2015 kaliraj et al 2015 remesan and panda 2008 considering the spatial complexities with respect to mechanisms and drivers of groundwater vulnerability to various pollutants it is essential to adequately identify and integrate these factors in a holistic framework groundwater contamination is a function of natural and anthropogenic forces which interact in a fashion that makes it possible to predict spatial vulnerability degree mogaji 2018 several modelling techniques have been devised over the years to aid in spatial vulnerability assessment including drastic aller et al 1987 avi aquifer vulnerability index marjuanto et al 2019 putranto et al 2018 god ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 and sintacs ewusi et al 2017 kumar et al 2013 oroji 2019 the drastic method incorporates seven hydrogeological parameters that drive intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer d depth to groundwater r aquifer net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone and c hydraulic conductivity despite wide application of drastic concerns about the subjectivity in factor weightage and neglect of human land use impact have been raised barbulescu 2020 zhang et al 2013 for this reason several modifications including factor removal weight adjustment and land use integration have been used to achieve an improved model that depicts realistic contamination scenarios in different local settings lad et al 2019 oroji 2019 remesan and panda 2008 for example some researchers have added further parameters to the original model factors such as land use index lineaments aquifer thickness and impact of contaminant kang et al 2017 others have used multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce approach to both remove some factors and adjust the weights zhang et al 2013 other forms of statistical and process based modelling techniques exist but due to their difficulty of integration into geographic information systems gis the overlay and index methods such as drastic have been widely used and achieved considerable success aller et al 1987 shakoor et al 2018 accordingly the objective of this study is to address the subjective weightage in drastic and apply it to account for specific vulnerability through pollutant potential impact and land use changes in the oforikrom municipality of ghana there is the need to adjust the drastic weightage to capture the impact of various hydrogeological factors that drive intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer the human environment such as land use land cover dynamics and the impact of various pollutants released into the environment which comprehensively drive the specific vulnerability of the aquifer to provide an objective weightage of drastic parameters it is worthwhile to adequately apply the widely popular analytical hierarchy process ahp saaty 2001 for an urban catchment adequate geographic mapping is important to identify the impact of various potential pollutant sources including cemeteries dumpsites farmlands pit latrines and gasoline stations and examine them together with different land use classes these potential pollutant sources are primary to the development of the specific vulnerability and its subsequent integration into the drastic intrinsic model towards generating a composite vulnerability model rigorous land use activities such as agriculture industrial activities and escalated frequency of pollutant release have threatened the quality of groundwater aboagye and zume 2019 adimalla and wu 2019 al djazouli et al 2020 anornu et al 2012 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 zhang et al 2013 anthropogenic loading of nitrogen and phosphorous from industrial municipal and agricultural sources in ghana for instance has increased nutrients in many aquifers in assessing the quality and health risk of shallow aquifers in atankwidi basin in the upper east region of ghana anim gyampo et al 2019 noted that 13 out of 26 sample wells boreholes had concentrations of arsenic and lead exceeding the who recommended limit of 0 01 mg l for each constituent these levels of groundwater contamination increase the exposure to diseases such as carcinogenic maladies chattopadhyay et al 2020 for instance ukah et al 2019 found that about 23 of individuals were exposed to high cancer risk due to higher arsenic copper and nickel concentration in groundwater in a densely populated industrial area in lagos nigeria similarly the presence of geothermal fluids agrochemicals such as nitrates and other metallic elements such as manganese in groundwater has led to severe health implications in many countries including kenya and ghana akoto et al 2019 malago 2017 nesta et al 2016 fecal contamination of groundwater has been observed in kamangira zimbabwe due to proximities between groundwater sources and pit latrines dzwairo et al 2006 similarly coliform and enterococci in groundwater in kentinkronu oforikrom municipality has been discovered to be higher than the who recommended level which has been attributed to proximities between these groundwater sources and pit latrines mor et al 2006 discovered that the proximity between landfills dumpsites and groundwater sources has tremendous impact on groundwater quality in terms of higher concentration of faecal coliform fc and total coliform tc in delhi india enterococci and other microbiological pollutants have been examined within the wewe oda watershed agbefu et al 2016 awuah et al 2014 obiri danso et al 2009 where it was observed that microbial pollutant concentrations in wells closer to dumpsites and pit latrines were higher compared to wells boreholes far away in a study conducted by barros et al 2019 in portugal it was discovered that the impact of malignant neoplasms that affect the hematopoietic system and lymphoid tissue was higher in the first 50 m from gasoline stations 54 cases per 100 000 inhabitants for males and 20 per 100 000 for females the oforikrom municipality has received attention in groundwater research due to its high groundwater use and proximity to the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology kumasi for example agbefu et al 2016 discovered high microbial contamination in selected groundwater sources at kotei a peri urban community within oforikrom municipality where the current study is conducted however it was concluded that contaminant presence could not be attributed to onsite sanitation system only but also from other diffuse sources modelling approach which integrates anthropogenic and natural factors for groundwater vulnerability to contamination has not been done within the watershed even though ewusi et al 2016 applied the drastic model to spatially target groundwater vulnerability land use index and impact of contaminants were not included and it was at the regional level entire kumasi metropolis where finer details were not differentiated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wewe oda watershed shown in fig 1 is a medium sized catchment located on the eastern flank of the oforikrom municipality in ashanti region ghana temperature within the catchment ranges from 21 to 31 c with annual mean rainfall of about 1397 mm major soil groups within the watershed are forest ochrosols and lithosols on the basis of hydrologic soil groups ross et al 2018 sandy clay and loamy sand dominates the watershed the catchment is drained by the wewe and oda rivers and is geologically underlain by birimian meta sedimentary units of precambrian origin and batholith which is associated with acid intrusive rocks murray et al 1960 as cited in ewusi et al 2016 the rocks have undergone deformation through foliation jointing fracturing and weathering resulting in relatively high yields of groundwater kesse 1985 the highest groundwater yield was reported to be 900 l per minute l m and the lowest was 8 l m with areas underlain by phyllites associated with higher yields compared to areas underlain by granites ewusi et al 2016 as of 2017 natural forest within oforikrom municipality covers an insignificant amount of about 2 6 ha nero 2017 about 55 percent of the oforikrom municipality is covered by urban areas with the remaining mostly covered by natural vegetation and cropland there is rapid urbanization in oforikrom municipality which has accelerated the conversion of fragile natural environments to human settlements the oforikrom municipality has a population of 303 016 based on the 2010 population and housing census ghana statistical service 2014 2 2 data sources rainfall data were obtained from worldclim 2020 for a period of 30 years soil data including soil bulk density were acquired from soilgrid250m hengl et al 2017 digital elevation model dem was obtained from usgs data portal water table elevation was determined from field work undertaken by this study and net recharge was derived using water balance approach data on actual evapotranspiration were acquired from famine early warning system network fews net database https fews net data on potential pollutant sources were obtained through field mapping using a hand held global positioning system gps unit of about 1 2 m accuracy various software employed in the study included arcgis 10 3 qgis 2 182 soil plant atmosphere water spaw saxton 2017 geoda 1 14 and microsoft excel 2 2 1 mapping of potential pollutant sources the spatial distribution of potential pollutant sources within the catchment varied with the nature of the environment and residential density generally potential pollutant sources such as dumpsites and pit latrines were located in moderate to high density residential areas while most fuel filling stations were found in low density residential areas farmlands on other hand were normally found in low density residential areas the potential pollutant sources were thoroughly assessed by examining their proximities to groundwater sources land use and hydrogeological properties of their locations see fig 2 2 3 the modified drastic index method the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer was modeled using the seven hydrogeological factors including aquifer recharge soil media and impact of the vadose zone aquifer media topography and saturated hydraulic conductivity the traditional weights assigned to the original drastic model were modified through the ahp weighting method to produce the drastic ahp based intrinsic vulnerability model furthermore the pollutants potential impact ppi was determined by characterizing the existing potential pollutant sources within the watershed based on their proximities to groundwater sources distance to hydrologic flow paths the textural and compact nature of the soils where they are found and also whether they are located within a particular land use class such as bare ground farmland or settlement areas finally the ahp based model was integrated into the pollutant risk potential model together with land use dynamics to generate the final groundwater vulnerability model for the catchment the overall composite groundwater vulnerability model was computed using the expression cgvi d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r l u w l u r where cgvi is the composite groundwater vulnerability index w and r refer to weight and rate respectively and the factors d r a s t i and c are as defined previously l u w and l u r which comprise the land use weights and rates were added to the drastic model the pollutants potential impact index is calculated as ppi i 0 p w p r where p r is the cumulative rate assigned to each potential pollutant source based on factors such as soil texture and bulk density land use proximity to groundwater sources hydrologic flow paths and p w is the pollutant type weight assigned through ahp ratings and weights for the original drastic model are presented in table 1 2 4 drastic input parameters 2 4 1 estimation of depth to water table the depth to water table represents the minimum vertical travel distance for contaminants as well as controlling the attenuation of contaminants as they travel vertically into the aquifer lad et al 2019 shakoor et al 2018 this parameter has been weighted 5 according to aller et al 1987 therefore an area with shallow water table is likely to have its aquifer more prone to contamination anornu et al 2012 generally in the absence of data the water table can be inferred from the general directions of groundwater flow which in turn can be estimated from topographic maps or elevation data where flow should be downslope toward perennial streams in this study the elevation data was used in combination with a field survey where gps was used to locate 83 sampled water wells the depth to water table was determined by measuring the depth of each water well using a clean rope tied with a weight to one end having lowered the rope with the weight to touch the bottom of the well a tape measure was used to determine the depth to the water table for each well after obtaining such data the water table elevation was determined by subtracting the depth to the water table in water wells static well level from the dem for all the water wells the results obtained were then interpolated using kriging and combined with the dem to generate the water table surface 2 4 2 estimation of net recharge the net recharge represents the quantity of water that enters the aquifer gad et al 2015 generally places with higher volume of annual recharge are more likely to have the quality of their groundwater compromised this parameter was determined using the water balance method suggested by sachan et al 2008 the annual rainfall from worldclim climatic data repository and actual evapotranspiration data from fews net data portal were used these data sets were resampled to 20 m using the cubic convolution resampling method the runoff data was determined through the expression q p k where q is the annual runoff mm p represents the annual rainfall mm within the watershed and k represents the runoff coefficients determined based on factors such as the hydrologic soil groups of the area the land cover types the residential density and the slope of the area the residential density and land cover types were obtained through digitizing a high resolution satellite image of the watershed obtained from openstreetmap using the dem the slope was computed and soil properties information were obtained from soilgrid250m utilizing the expression r p eta q where r is the annual net recharge p is rainfall eta is actual evapotranspiration and q is the runoff the net recharge was computed for the watershed 2 4 3 estimation of aquifer media properties the attenuation capacity of the aquifer media depends on the size and amount of its grains the finer the grains the higher the attenuation capacity samake et al 2011 it has been weighted 3 according to aller et al 1987 a soil thematic map was produced by obtaining soil data from soilgrid250m the soil data contains proportion of sand silt and clay arranged into levels levels 1 to 7 each level representing its depth below land surface from 0 to 2 m considering the shallow and unconfined nature of the aquifer within the watershed a depth of 2 m was used to characterize the aquifer media the saga tool in qgis 2 18 was used to derive the soil texture for this media after mapping the soil texture it was reclassified based on the porous nature of the soil textural class loamy sand was rated 8 whereas sandy clay was rated 4 2 4 4 estimation of topographical information under similar soil condition steep slopes 18 generally intensify runoff whereas gentle and flatter slopes 0 2 enhance infiltration samake et al 2011 this parameter was computed from the dem obtained from the usgs data portal after mapping the slope within the watershed it was reclassified based on the rating scheme presented in table 1 2 4 5 estimation of soil media properties the soil provides the initial defense against pollutant infiltration shakoor et al 2018 different characteristics such as texture structure and compaction significantly control the infiltration rate data on soil was obtained from soilgrid250m with fractions of sand silt and clay soil textural classes were then derived using the saga tool in qgis 2 18 after mapping the soil textural classes they were then reclassified on the basis of the infiltration rate and porosity by using the rating shown in table 1 2 4 6 estimation of vadose zone properties the geologic makeup of the vadose zone is very important to the regulation of pollutant sorption dispersion and biogeochemical reactions al mallah and al qurnawi 2018 shakoor et al 2018 the perviousness of the vadose zone controls the extent of aquifer pollution lad et al 2019 soil data obtained from soilgrid250m were classified into textural groups in saga environment using qgis 2 18 the soil textural groups within the vadose zone were sandy clay and loamy sand based on the porosity of these soils the map was reclassified based on the rating scheme presented in table 1 2 4 7 estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity determines the rate at which contaminants are transmitted within the aquifer ewusi et al 2016 2017 kaliraj et al 2015 this variable was extracted from the aquifer geologic material type there is limited data available on the hydraulic conductivity in the study area so the soil plant air water spaw software developed by the united states department of agriculture usda was used using spaw the saturated hydraulic conductivity for various aquifer media was computed this computation follows the expression ks 1930 θ s θ 33 3 λ developed by saxton and rawls 2006 where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity θ s is the saturated moisture content 0 kpa θ 33 is the 33 kpa moisture and λ is the slope of logarithmic tension moisture curve the saturated conductivity ranges from 0 0183 to 2 189 m day these soil properties do not exactly match but are the closest to those found in the studied catchment the mapped saturated hydraulic conductivity was reclassified based on the rating scheme in table 1 2 5 ahp modified drastic model one of the most critical weaknesses of the drastic model is the subjectivity of the weight assigned to criteria kang et al 2017 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 considering varied environmental conditions in different geographical areas factors impacting intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer may differ thus necessitating adjustment of weights assigned to the factors generally the original drastic model has been modified using different techniques such as factor weight adjustment and factor map removal kaliraj et al 2015 in this study ahp was applied to weighting each hydrogeological factor with respect to its relative impact on groundwater vulnerability to contamination to reduce the level of subjectivity in the original weighting the allotment of relative importance to individual factors was done by placing criteria both vertically and horizontally to compute a pairwise comparison matrix after which cell values were normalized in order to obtain the relative weight of criteria after the weightages the consistency index ci was computed using the expression varimax λ n n 1 where λ is the varimax and n is the number of criteria investigated finally the ci was combined with the random index ri to obtain the consistency ratio cr the ci was estimated to be 0 0279 and cr was 0 02118 showing the consistency level of the assigned weightages were highly acceptable since cr is less than 0 1 ishizaka and labib 2009 both the original drastic drastic o and drastic ahp were compared with the ppi model to determine the performance level of drastic ahp see table 2 2 6 estimation of aquifer vulnerability based on pollutant risk impact the characterization of contaminant impact levels with respect to groundwater pollution was analyzed with respect to soil bulk density where the pollutant in question is located proximities of pollutants to groundwater sources proximities of contaminant sources to hydrologic flow paths the land use land cover class of the pollutant source and the soil textural class potential pollutant sources identified such as cemeteries dumpsites toilets gasoline stations and farms were weighted using the ahp approach both the ci 0 0207 and cr 0 0185 were less than 0 1 meaning the computed relative weights were consistent lad et al 2019 pramanik 2016 tran et al 2002 2 6 1 pit latrines toilet facilities impact of pit latrines and poor toilet infrastructure and their impact on the quality of groundwater and human health have been evident especially in sub saharan africa graham and polizzotto 2013 table 3 surface runoff can accelerate surficial transport of pollutants before infiltration as observed within the watershed obiri danso et al 2009 in this study the impact of pit latrines on groundwater was comprehensively analyzed using criteria presented in table 4 to build a thematic risk map inverse distance weighting idw interpolation technique was used to interpolate points for predicting areas where these potential pollutant sources were not sampled 2 6 2 dumpsites as potential pollutant sources the impact of leachate percolation on groundwater quality has been obvious in especially less developed areas in areas where waste management is poor groundwater quality is likely to be greatly compromised it has been widely noted that the interaction between local hydrogeological condition and waste management has significant impact on groundwater quality and aquifer vulnerability for instance an environment with high frequency of pollutant loading underlain by porous and less compact soils makes the aquifer very vulnerable to contamination awuah et al 2014 mor et al 2006 in this study the impact of spatial distribution of dumpsites was analyzed with respect to proximity to groundwater sources such as wells boreholes and hydrologic flow paths also soil texture was examined to determine the likelihood of leachate percolation into the aquifer 2 6 3 agricultural fields nitrate concentration in groundwater has been related to agriculture as well as to human sewage sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 the field infiltration capacity of the soils was analyzed through their bulk density and texture proximity of these agricultural lands to groundwater sources was also integrated into the model though the country gives no specific threshold distance to which agricultural lands should be away from groundwater sources the guidelines were extracted from recommendations made by the michigan department of environmental quality 2009 2 6 4 gasoline stations and cemeteries the indiana department of natural resources 2020 has set a maximum distance to which gasoline stations should be from groundwater sources at 500 ft 150 m to prevent benzene impact level on groundwater and risk to human health indiana department of natural resources 2020 this figure is adjustable depending on the local perviousness index according to the who cemeteries constitute another source of threat to groundwater quality and a minimum distance of 100 m was thus set which is adjustable depending on the nature of soils these two potential pollutant sources were characterized using the local land use conditions soil texture proximities to groundwater sources and surface hydrologic flow paths 3 results 3 1 landscape change in the wewe oda catchment the urban expansion and intensification in the wewe oda catchment are indicated by the population densities in 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 presented in fig 3 urban growth in the wewe oda catchment is moving eastward with intensification occurring on both the north and south sides resultant effects include the escalating manner of improper spatial planning as well as the emergence of diverse pollutants generated through anthropogenic activities thereby posing threat to groundwater quality for example the kumasi metropolitan assembly 2017 noted that oforikrom municipality over the past 10 years has lost about 80 of its natural environment to settlement expansion this has necessitated probing into the impact of these changes on natural resources such as groundwater extraction and quality levels nero 2017 noted that the vegetation cover declined fourfold from 2014 to 2017 and that the urban greenspace area per capita was moderately correlated for 2009 r 2 0 50 p 0 049 and 2014 r 2 0 53 p 0 0398 with socioeconomic conditions of sub metropolises of the kumasi metropolitan area including the wewe oda catchment 3 2 drastic model input parameters 3 2 1 depth to water table in the wewe oda catchment the elevation of the water table and its corresponding rating are shown in fig 4 after computing the water table elevation it was interpolated using kriging the water table elevation ranged from 224 6 to 313 6 m generally the middle to the southwestern flank of the catchment had shallow water table elevation 227 8 253 3 m the water table elevation was moderate 253 3 266 1 m in the southeastern to central part of the catchment whereas the northern flank had a water table elevation of 267 313 6 m denoting less susceptibility to groundwater contamination 3 2 2 net recharge in the wewe oda catchment the net recharge and its corresponding rating in the wewe oda watershed are shown in fig 5 the annual recharge ranged between 47 and 268 mm year with higher net recharge occurring along a northeast to southwest alignment and the least recharge along the southeastern flank of the watershed 3 2 3 aquifer media in the wewe oda catchment the aquifer media and its corresponding rating in the wewe oda watershed are shown in fig 6 in this watershed aquifer lithological classes include silty clay silty clay loam sandy clay sandy clay loam and loamy sand the aquifer media in the northern part of the catchment which is dominated by silty clay and sandy clay has higher attenuation capacity than the middle to the southern part which is mainly silty loam 3 2 4 topographical information in the wewe oda catchment the topography of the wewe oda catchment and its rating are shown in fig 7 slope values in the catchment ranged from 0 to 36 as presented in fig 7 left hand side image indicating an undulating surface the topographic impact on groundwater vulnerability scenarios is almost uniform across the watershed 3 2 5 soil media in the wewe oda catchment the hydrologic soil groups and corresponding ratings in the wewe oda catchment are shown in fig 8 the soil groups within the watershed include sandy clay loamy sand and sand the northern and southern parts are underlain by sandy clay which is indicative of less permeable soils whereas central areas have loamy sand and sand which will allow more percolation and can thus transmit leachates quite rapidly 3 2 6 vadose zone in the wewe oda catchment the hydrologic soil groups in the vadose zone and the associated rating in the wewe oda catchment are shown in fig 9 much of the northeastern and west central regions are loamy sand whereas the southern and northwestern regions are mainly sandy clay which has higher attenuation capacity 3 2 7 saturated hydraulic conductivity in the wewe oda catchment the saturated hydraulic conductivity and its associated risk rating in the wewe oda catchment are shown in fig 10 the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the watershed ranged from 0 0183 to 2 189 m day the majority of the catchment has values between 0 15 and 0 35 m day 3 3 original drastic intrinsic groundwater vulnerability all seven hydrogeological parameters were integrated to compute the intrinsic vulnerability zones in the catchment within a gis environment using the weighted sum overlay algorithm in arcgis 10 3 the intrinsic vulnerability based on the drastic o model applied to the wewe oda catchment is shown in fig 11 vulnerability zones were categorized into five classes 62 58 to 86 35 very low 86 35 to 110 12 low 110 12 to 133 89 moderate 133 89 to 157 65 high and 157 65 181 43 very high vulnerability the result indicates that towns like apirade kokoben appiadu and kentinkronu fall into the low to very low vulnerability class whereas kotei domeabra boadi and anwomaso are in the high to very high vulnerability class in terms of area coverage very low low moderate high and very high covered 38 35 1651 20 638 12 1117 71 and 1021 65 ha respectively the implication is that based on the characterization of the aquifer s ability to protect against the impact of contaminants about 62 of the watershed is vulnerable and therefore required serious attention 3 4 drastic ahp intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer using the weighted sum overlay drastic ahp intrinsic vulnerability map was generated as presented in fig 12 the result indicates that there is a significant difference in spatial vulnerability zones demarcated by drastic o and drastic ahp the drastic ahp model correlates more strongly with the ppi model r 2 0 67 than the original model does r 2 0 36 however the southwestern and northeastern regions retained very vulnerable condition as under the drastic o model considering how well the drastic ahp model correlates with the pollutant impact model they were integrated to produce the composite vulnerability of the aquifer in the watershed under the drastic ahp model very low low moderate high and very high categories covered 779 97 748 14 1809 33 896 70 and 143 26 ha respectively 3 5 specific aquifer vulnerability based on potential impact of pollutant sources pollutants that drive groundwater vulnerability are diverse and large in number but are better characterized within the local context broadly they can be categorized into point source and non point source pollutants the study considered four point sources of pollutants dumpsites pit latrines gasoline stations and cemeteries together with one non point source farmlands these pollutants source risk levels were semi quantitatively assessed by relating them to distance to groundwater sources proximity to hydrologic flow paths the bulk densities of local soils local residential density land cover types and the local hydrologic soil group the various pollutant factors used are presented in fig 13 the rating of the various criteria which determined the impact of each potential pollutant source was earlier presented in table 4 the rated maps for different criteria driving the risk level of contaminants were generated separately after which they were added using the raster calculator in arcgis 10 3 to obtain the cumulative rated thematic layers for all five potential pollutant sources relative weights were assigned to each potential pollutant source using the ahp based on their potential impact on groundwater vulnerability the final risk level model was generated using the weighted sum overlay in arcgis 10 3 and zoned into five vulnerability classes the layers were overlaid using the weighted sum overlay to generate potential impact of pollutants on groundwater contamination the resulting specific aquifer vulnerability for the wewe oda catchment is presented in fig 14 the result shows that about 30 of the wewe oda catchment is identified as being at high to very high risk of groundwater vulnerability moderate risk levels cover another 38 of the catchment the towns of boadi anwomaso kotei domeabra deduako and kokoben are high to very high vulnerability whereas apromase apiadu kentinkrono and prabon are in the low to very low vulnerability classes emena and apirade are moderately vulnerable the very low low moderate high to very high vulnerability zones covered 265 34 1130 35 1671 61 1151 55 and 169 81 ha respectively the findings show that the impact of dumpsites on the specific vulnerability of the aquifer was very strong r 2 0 91 and a moderate correlation was discovered between specific vulnerability and farmlands r 2 0 65 from the results of the individual thematic layers it was discovered that the central section of the watershed and the southeast and northeast corners generally ranged from high to very high vulnerability condition with regards to aquifer susceptibility to pollutant impacts 3 6 modified drastic model based on land use drastic lu after weight adjustment to reduce the subjectivity of the original model weightages a separate model was developed to characterize areas based on spatial differentiation of land use activities and their potential impact on groundwater pollution a land use and residential density map was created by digitizing high resolution satellite imagery of the wewe oda catchment different land use land cover classes were digitized to characterize the environment where a particular groundwater source was situated the resulting land use characterization of the wewe oda catchment is presented in fig 15 to determine the drastic model modified based on land use denoted drastic lu the expression l u w l u r which comprises the land use weights and rates was added to the drastic model the weighted sum overlay was used to compute the final drastic lu model which is presented in fig 16 the result shows that north central parts of the region have very high vulnerability with respect to groundwater contamination the northern tip and southern parts on the contrary are relatively safe with very low to low risks of groundwater contamination 3 7 composite groundwater vulnerability integrating the ppi and the drastic based on ahp weighting and land use the composite groundwater vulnerability model cgvm for the watershed was generated the resulting composite groundwater vulnerability in the wewe oda catchment is presented in fig 17 it was found that under both natural and anthropogenic factors the ne to sw parts of the wewe oda catchment are more vulnerable than the southern and northern sections the cgvm shows that about 644 21 ha representing approximately 15 of the catchment is under very high vulnerability condition and 750 99 ha 17 4 is under high vulnerability condition moderate vulnerability covered 891 48 ha 20 7 whereas low and very low covered 1124 2 ha 26 1 and 900 23 ha 20 9 respectively the most vulnerable towns with respect to the aquifer s susceptibility to contamination by pollutants are kotei boadi domeabra and anwomaso fig 18 it is apparent that each model delineates the vulnerable zones somewhat differently however considering a fairly good correlation between the ppi model representing purely anthropogenic pollutant impacts and drastic ahp model r 2 0 67 they were both integrated with drastic lu representing land use dynamics to produce the composite model since the drastic model is partly based on the protective degree of the aquifer with respect to its hydrogeological makeup it does not always depict the holistic situation on the ground especially when anthropogenic influences such as spatial diversity of pollutant loadings and dynamics of pollutant runoff and surficial transport are not considered higher concentrations of pollutants such as nitrates within the groundwater result from extraneous variables such as pollutant spatial distribution land use and importantly the biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer thus this study incorporated the impact of potential pollutant sources and anthropogenic influence to address weaknesses of the original drastic model with the aim of improved geographic targeting of groundwater vulnerability 4 conclusions this study has critically investigated the aquifer susceptibility to contamination in the wewe oda watershed within the oforikrom municipality of ashanti region ghana using the gis based drastic model adjustment of the original drastic weights using ahp improved the correlation with the ppi model from r 2 0 36 to r 2 0 67 pollutant risk and land use impacts were integrated into the drastic ahp model to generate the composite groundwater vulnerability model results indicated that about 34 of the watershed is under high to very high groundwater vulnerability the impact of dumpsites was most strongly correlated with the ppi model r 2 0 91 followed by toilet facilities r 2 0 86 gasoline stations r 2 0 69 and cemeteries r 2 0 76 the weakest correlation was observed with agricultural fields r 2 0 65 the correlations for the ppi factors illustrate higher levels of contamination from potential point sources than non point sources of pollution the potential point sources are mostly located in moderate to high density settlements given that a large portion of the wewe oda catchment is at high risk of groundwater contamination from both natural and human sources it is therefore highly recommended that both structural and non structural e g public education mitigation measures be undertaken to reduce pollutant generation and loading especially in towns like kotei boadi domeabra and deduako secondly greater attention should be given to solid waste management and modality of toilet facilities design since they strongly correlated with the pollutants impact model specific vulnerability model and tend to have greater pollution potential the modelling approach illustrated is integrated and is recommended for groundwater vulnerability assessments in urban watersheds which may have both natural and anthropogenic sources in addition future studies should incorporate field water quality

11919,the main objective of this study is to identify the groundwater storage areas in the middle moulouya basin by using geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs methods which are the prominent supports of groundwater modeling five thematic maps of lithology rainfall drainage lineaments and slope which were respectively categorized as they were weighed capaciously they have been used to generate the map of potential groundwater storage zones the results have shown that the area of very low to low potential surfaces represents approximately 10 of the total area indicating that the middle moulouya basin is rich in groundwater where more than 2200 wells and boreholes have been drilled the obtained results have been validated with specific yield of springs in the study area it indicates a clear correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the specific yield this correlation is particularly obvious in light of yield of water points and their locations indeed most of water points with high yield are located in excellent potential zones while poor potential zone includes the majority of water points with low yield graphical abstract image 1 keywords moulouya groundwater modeling remote sensing storage area geographic information system 1 introduction in morocco access to water is a human right and a basic requirement for economic development due to the growing importance of water in the fields of environment health and mainly agriculture 65 of water for irrigation comes from groundwater nouayti et al 2019 mall et al 2006 seibert et al 2010 and therefore the groundwater is strongly needed this has required evolving efficient and economic methods of groundwater exploration assessment and development in this regard integrated geological methods remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis have proven to be interestingly effective khan et al 2020 ferozu et al 2019 magesh et al 2012 interestingly enough remote sensing can sometimes be the unique method providing specific solutions to problems which could not be dealt with using conventional methods owing to the inaccessibility of fields through land means the unavailability and or the scarcity of data meijerink 1996 nonetheless the use of these newer geospatial tools the geographic information system and remote sensing ought to be submitted to preprocessing image processing as well as extraction of field information succeeded by the handling of spatial data nouayti et al 2019 leketa et al 2018 furthermore these two operations are to be backed by field verification to confirm potential groundwater areas identified actually the implementation of these newer tools i e the geographic information system and remote sensing has acquired greater interest thanks to its importance in locating potential sites estimating the degree of water potentiality of groundwater and assessing the risk of pollution in various basins elbeih 2015 kazakis et al 2015 andualem and demeke 2019 hence these tools were used in different researches carried out on various areas throughout the world for delineating the potential groundwater storage zones mashael 2010 and according to singha et al 2021 mpofu et al 2020 these areas are advantageous zones to the siting of high yielding boreholes for hydrogeological investigations some authors used one parameter i e lineaments for determining groundwater owolabi et al 2021 sur and acharya 2020 others integrated two parameters i e lineaments and drainage density ahmed et al 1984 while others combined more than two parameters i e geology geomorphology vegetation lineaments elevation and slope domingos et al 2015 abdul aziz and vanum 2017 indeed mashael a s has adequately recapitulated several studies table 1 in which he indicated the results quality satisfactory or unsatisfactory in accordance with the used parameters mashael 2010 in this context there are no such research s linked to delineating the potential groundwater storage areas in the middle moulouya basin therefore the present study seeks to map these areas by the use of the geographic information system and the remote sensing globally our basin the middle moulouya is marked by a scarcity of water resources associated to the dry climate low rainfall drought as well as high temperatures that leads to high evaporation moreover there is often a scarcity of renewable water resources vis a vis the rising demand for them consequently looking for new water resources has perforce been directed towards deep aquifers because of the rareness of surface water rivers and water tables by making necessary deep boreholes nevertheless numerous boreholes are more likely to be fruitless since their success is strongly linked to a fairly accurate knowledge of the subsurface structure nordine et al 2017 therefore in this article we aim by implementing the geographic information system and remote sensing to map the groundwater storage areas in the middle moulouya basin in order to give particular solutions to the problems created by the rareness of water resources in the district to develop useful maps and to provide efficient database which will be used for hydrogeological decisions such as action plans for groundwater protection or environmental geological practice or for guiding future hydrogeological studies 2 study area the middle moulouya basin is located in the southeast of morocco geographically between x 580000 x 7760 000 and y 220 000 y 370000 utm geographical projection system its surface area is approximately 16800 km2 and its geomorphology has 6 mountains middle and high atlas 55 plateaus rekkam and 39 plains that constitute the valley proper area which is studied here further with respect to the neighboring areas the basin is limited between the ahouli massif on the upstream side and the bouyaakobat paleo high topographic bulge on the downstream side and it is limited towards the east and the northwest by the rekkam plateaus and the middle atlas respectively whereas towards the southeast it is bounded by the eastern high atlas and the guercif plains on the northern side fig 1 geologically according to the previous researches carried out by researchers labbassi 1991 beauchamp et al 1996 el gout et al 2013 bouabdli et al 2005 tahiri et al 2020 ouanaimi et al 2018 the middle moulouya basin includes distinct structural domains that range from the mesozoic to the quaternary and is divided into five periods 1 the upper triassic continental subsidence basins appear owing to the reactivation of late hercynian faults their filling began by coarse red deposits and was followed by saliferous and evaporitic clays containing interlayered basaltic flows commonly an angular unconformity separates the triassic deposits from the paleozoic basement which is structured through various tectonic phases 2 the lower and middle liassic the geological formations of this period rest conformably on the triassic formations and they are represented by carbonate formations i e supratidal to subtidal carbonate platform deposits the upper domerien emersion leads to a sedimentation hiatus 3 the upper liasic p p dogger the dolomitic platform of aalenian bajocian is followed by a carbonate sedimentation which is represented by a new carbonate platform the bathonian regression is responsible of the development of a laguno continental environment 4 the cretaceous the deposits rest unconformably on the different geological formations of the middle and upper jurassic and they draw a complete sedimentary cycle which begins with continental deposits at the base and continues with lagoon facies and ends with marine deposits 5 the cenozoic from the eocene begins the atlas tectogenesis the sea withdraws from the study area and the sediment evolution takes place in a continental environment the environment becomes continental and leads to the succession of different facies basal conglomerates gypsiferous red marls and lacustrine limestones which constitute respectively the three cycles developed during this period from a tectonic point of view the study area is integrated into a ne sw shear zone generally the fault structures show two main directions e w and nw sw these structures could be considered precisely the same as the riedel fractures moreover owing to the variation in the directions of the deformation axes from the upper eocene till actual the structural evolution tends to be complex labbassi 1991 the hydrogeological frame of the basin encompasses seven hydrogeological units table 2 which are subdivided into three types of aquifers deeper tables units of cenomanian turonian middle bathonian callovian aalenian bajocian and domerian nouayti et al 2019 water tables units of plio quaternary and upper miocene as well as alluvial aquifer unit of quaternary the inventory of groundwater withdrawals has identified nearly 2284 points of water exploitation generally the water depth varies from 1 m to 50 m the shallow depths less than 10 m characterize the sectors located along the alluvial plains of moulouya river whereas the deepest water points characterize the boreholes and wells deepened by redrilling in some cases yield can exceed 80 l s in the outlet of the basin borehole x 671000 y 335600 the middle moulouya basin is situated in an arid bioclimatic stage generally the temperature averages show strong variations owing to the remarkable seasonal variations with an extremely cold winter and an extremely hot summer the temperature range exceeds 20 ᵒc whereas the average annual rainfall does not exceed 200 mm per year fig 2 the study area is of hydrogeological interest since it encompasses various water resources groundwater and phreatic water forming the unique sources of water supply for vast population living in the middle moulouya basin who exploits these resources for a specific use industrial irrigation or domestic thus their long term management assessment and protection are of paramount concerns further these resources undergo a high rate of exploitation that leads to a decline in the water level this decline may cause heavy problems viz land subsidence dryness of formerly flowing water points boreholes wells and springs 3 material and methods in order to determine the groundwater storage sites in the middle moulouya basin the proposed methodological approach according to mashael a s 2010 is based on the collection processing and analysis of all the data table 3 related to the following parameters 1 precipitation rainfall snow which is commonly designated as a water source 2 slope is also an influencing parameter that exerts effects on the energy and flow of water 3 rock fracture which play a significant part in increasing the porosity and permeability of rocks which makes the process of infiltration so easier 4 lithology is a factor with conspicuous influence since the storage regime and the flow are largely controlled by the types of rocks within the geological formations 5 drainage characteristics are not only useful in the distribution of the storm water but they are also important from the angle of estimating the infiltration rates these five parameters affect the groundwater storage mashael 2010 their integration in a model will be reflected in an empirical model which will be used to assess groundwater storage potential areas fig 3 depicts the detailed methodology endorsed in this article the overlapping layers should have similar cartographic characteristics viz the same resolution geographical extent length units and projection system because of the fact that calculations are going to be performed on the same matrix i e mesh size the followed methodology depends on making use of data obtained from geological maps topographic maps digital terrain models and satellite images to draw up a thematic mapping of the employed parameters viz drainage slope rock fracturing lithology and rainfall the validation process was based on the yield of 33 water springs 3 1 precipitation rainfall the rainfall intensity is one of the key factors which control the recharge runoff relation the more moderate rainfall intensity is the more effective groundwater recharge is furthermore spells of low rainfall intensity cause greater groundwater recharge fashae et al 2014 in our study area we have concluded that precipitation generally decreases in the southern part of the study area and gradually decreases from north to south the map obtained was classified into five main classes fig 4 120 mm year very low 120 130 mm year low 130 140 mm year medium 140 150 mm year high and over 150 mm year very high 3 2 lineaments surfaces discontinuity known as lineaments i e curvilinear or linear properties of geological structures such as fractures faults joints o leary et al 1976 these lineaments can be used for hydrogeological research and may play a significant role in water resources movement infiltration and storage dhekra et al 2018 sisir 2005 so their extraction and mapping ought to be done judiciously commonly the level of groundwater recharge depends upon the lineament density hence the higher lineament density is the higher potential groundwater recharge is yeh et al 2016 likewise the lineament density has a profound influence on rock mass porosity and permeability therefore high rate of porosity and permeability lies on high lineament density and vice versa tanveer et al 2020 landsat data has been one of the most valuable datasets for mapping the earth surface for more than 40 years topalaglu et al 2016 therefore landsat 8 oli acquired on december 31st 2018 with path row 200 36 is used for automatic lineament extraction the satellite data uploaded from http earthexplorer usgs gov the usgs earth explorer website the results of landsat 8 oli are used to extract lineaments for middle moulouya basin also extraction lineaments have been plotted as rose diagram and lineament density map fig 5 a they show that major direction of lineaments is ene wsw the rose diagram is generated on the basis of the total lengths and frequency of the lineaments sur and acharya 2020 hamdani and baali 2019 3 3 drainage commonly the drainage density is obtained by dividing the total length of all the rivers in a drainage basin by total area of the drainage basin yeh et al 2016 so its role is extremely important in the delineation of the groundwater potential zone adeyeye and ikpokonte 2018 furthermore the drainage density presents the distribution of surface water channels in nature and is widely used as a parameter thematic layer for the assessment of potential recharge areas because seepage from the water channels contributes significantly to subsurface recharge and thereby a rise in groundwater potential arshad et al 2020 nouayti et al 2019 singh et al 2018 hence an area with lower channel density will contribute to a low level of groundwater potential and vice versa in this context in the study area the drainage density was reclassified and categorized as very high 0 5 km km2 high 0 4 0 5 km km2 moderate 0 3 0 4 km km2 low 0 2 0 3 km km2 and very low 0 2 km km2 fig 5b therefore the zones possessing high density 0 5 km km2 are denoted with highest rating i e 5 as seepage could happen with higher rate which promotes groundwater recharge and zones with very low density 0 2 km km2 are denoted with minimum rating i e 1 as fewer water channels could not contribute significantly to the seepage process and therefore underground recharge will be significantly reduced table 6 3 4 topography slope the slope parameter is represented by the percentage slope degrees reflecting the ability of surface water to percolate into the groundwater singh et al 2013 this factor is very significant for the identification of favorable sites to groundwater recharge because it directly affects surface water infiltration de reu et al 2013 interestingly the bigger the slope is the lower the runoff is consequently the water has enough time to infiltrate which makes groundwater recharge easier due to the high retention of rainwater nordine et al 2017 the map obtained was classified into five main classes fig 6 a according to the soter model the european commission soil terrain database 1995 table 4 nouayti et al 2019 3 5 lithology the type of lithology determines the aquifers where groundwater is stored because it impacts potential groundwater storage by monitoring the percolation of water nouayti et al 2019 elewa and qaddah 2011 and it is also associated with permeability and porosity of a formation which defines its quality as an aquifer oikonomidis et al 2015 the geological maps of morocco sheet oujda at 1 500 000 were used for extraction of lithological formations of our study area moreover a supervised classification of these was generated from etm satellite images so a map with five classes of rock formations with similar hydrological properties was generated fig 6b table 5 the lithology map classified into five categories was served as one of the gis layers 4 model and data validation five thematic maps of lithology rainfall drainage lineaments and slope which were respectively categorized as they were weighed based on the weighted overlay method that allows the converting of the relevant parameters into ordinal numbers through the use of ratings and weights table 6 furthermore a rate with weight is assigned to each parameter depending on its importance generally this procedure is carried out in our study area according to the viewpoints of the experts as well as the review of former researches particularly the studies of ghayoumian et al 2007 nordine et al 2017 nouayti et al 2019 bearing in mind the well known hydrogeological properties of the middle moulouya basin capaciously the layers have been used in the geographic information system environment to generate the map of potential groundwater storage zones fig 7 by the addition of the products rate weight of the different layers integrated the model obtained reveals that the area of very low potential is absent in our study area however the zone of the highest recharge potential reaches 2 of the total area 3360 km2 while the area of high potential corresponds to 14 and the area of moderate potential reaches 76 indicating that the middle moulouya basin is generally rich in groundwater furthermore the high number of wells and boreholes 2200 used for domestic and irrigation purposes has corroborated our results the validation process of the model was based on the yield of water points from 33 water springs it was classified into five classes fig 8 very low 0 0

both lower than 5 l s are at the level of the areas with medium to high potential this is because most of them are seasonal as well as they depend on wet season more than that they are relevant to underground streams while the sources with moderate yield are located perfectly at the class of medium potential areas among eight water points with moderate yield seven are located in area of medium groundwater storage potential the results show a coincidence of about fig 9 55 of the springs water with very low yield are located in areas of low groundwater storage potential 86 of the springs with

water with high yield are located in areas of high groundwater storage potential 50 of the springs water with very high yield are located in the areas of high groundwater storage potential based on the validation test by the yield of water springs we have concluded that the model developed is quite satisfactory and operational the obtained results were validated with specific yield of the water points water springs in the study area it indicates a clear correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the specific yield of springs this correlation is particularly obvious in light of yield of water point and their locations actually most of water points with high yield are located in excellent potential zones while poor potential zone includes the majority of water points with low yield fig 10 based on the model and the statistical study between the specific yield and the storage area which are considered appropriate in solving complex problems related to water resources of the middle moulouya district the managers will primarily be able to use these results to determine the recharge areas for the improvement of groundwater condition and they will also have the opportunity to fill the gaps regarding the clever choice of the dam construction site determination of agricultural area and location of irrigation boreholes which are the basis of all socio economic development 5 conclusion groundwater exploration has become in demand more than ever before classical methods for groundwater haven t often been able to identify promising areas for groundwater storage in this regard gis and remote sensing techniques have become of paramount importance to many researchers worldwide the main concern of this study is to identify areas that are favorable for drilling by determining areas favorable to groundwater storage in doing so we used gis and remote sensing techniques which proved to be effective to cover large areas such as the case study 16800 km2 and proven to be less consuming with regard to time and money effectively the current study area where a huge number of citizens continues to utilize water from springs rivers ponds and shallow dug wells illustrates an emblematic example of all the arid and semi arid watersheds of morocco accordingly the research emphasizes the role of integrated gis and remote sensing techniques as geospatial technology to cope with declining levels of groundwater resources thus we infer that the middle moulouya basin is potentially rich in groundwater especially in areas with intense fracture systems nevertheless the role of human intervention as well as urban sprawl which could not be excluded on the main water resources i e springs boreholes wells river canals causes a rise in the rate of groundwater abstraction and consumption so public awareness albeit at the local level has therefore become a necessity since groundwater resources long term management in order to have an appropriate

11919,the main objective of this study is to identify the groundwater storage areas in the middle moulouya basin by using geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs methods which are the prominent supports of groundwater modeling five thematic maps of lithology rainfall drainage lineaments and slope which were respectively categorized as they were weighed capaciously they have been used to generate the map of potential groundwater storage zones the results have shown that the area of very low to low potential surfaces represents approximately 10 of the total area indicating that the middle moulouya basin is rich in groundwater where more than 2200 wells and boreholes have been drilled the obtained results have been validated with specific yield of springs in the study area it indicates a clear correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the specific yield this correlation is particularly obvious in light of yield of water points and their locations indeed most of water points with high yield are located in excellent potential zones while poor potential zone includes the majority of water points with low yield graphical abstract image 1 keywords moulouya groundwater modeling remote sensing storage area geographic information system 1 introduction in morocco access to water is a human right and a basic requirement for economic development due to the growing importance of water in the fields of environment health and mainly agriculture 65 of water for irrigation comes from groundwater nouayti et al 2019 mall et al 2006 seibert et al 2010 and therefore the groundwater is strongly needed this has required evolving efficient and economic methods of groundwater exploration assessment and development in this regard integrated geological methods remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis have proven to be interestingly effective khan et al 2020 ferozu et al 2019 magesh et al 2012 interestingly enough remote sensing can sometimes be the unique method providing specific solutions to problems which could not be dealt with using conventional methods owing to the inaccessibility of fields through land means the unavailability and or the scarcity of data meijerink 1996 nonetheless the use of these newer geospatial tools the geographic information system and remote sensing ought to be submitted to preprocessing image processing as well as extraction of field information succeeded by the handling of spatial data nouayti et al 2019 leketa et al 2018 furthermore these two operations are to be backed by field verification to confirm potential groundwater areas identified actually the implementation of these newer tools i e the geographic information system and remote sensing has acquired greater interest thanks to its importance in locating potential sites estimating the degree of water potentiality of groundwater and assessing the risk of pollution in various basins elbeih 2015 kazakis et al 2015 andualem and demeke 2019 hence these tools were used in different researches carried out on various areas throughout the world for delineating the potential groundwater storage zones mashael 2010 and according to singha et al 2021 mpofu et al 2020 these areas are advantageous zones to the siting of high yielding boreholes for hydrogeological investigations some authors used one parameter i e lineaments for determining groundwater owolabi et al 2021 sur and acharya 2020 others integrated two parameters i e lineaments and drainage density ahmed et al 1984 while others combined more than two parameters i e geology geomorphology vegetation lineaments elevation and slope domingos et al 2015 abdul aziz and vanum 2017 indeed mashael a s has adequately recapitulated several studies table 1 in which he indicated the results quality satisfactory or unsatisfactory in accordance with the used parameters mashael 2010 in this context there are no such research s linked to delineating the potential groundwater storage areas in the middle moulouya basin therefore the present study seeks to map these areas by the use of the geographic information system and the remote sensing globally our basin the middle moulouya is marked by a scarcity of water resources associated to the dry climate low rainfall drought as well as high temperatures that leads to high evaporation moreover there is often a scarcity of renewable water resources vis a vis the rising demand for them consequently looking for new water resources has perforce been directed towards deep aquifers because of the rareness of surface water rivers and water tables by making necessary deep boreholes nevertheless numerous boreholes are more likely to be fruitless since their success is strongly linked to a fairly accurate knowledge of the subsurface structure nordine et al 2017 therefore in this article we aim by implementing the geographic information system and remote sensing to map the groundwater storage areas in the middle moulouya basin in order to give particular solutions to the problems created by the rareness of water resources in the district to develop useful maps and to provide efficient database which will be used for hydrogeological decisions such as action plans for groundwater protection or environmental geological practice or for guiding future hydrogeological studies 2 study area the middle moulouya basin is located in the southeast of morocco geographically between x 580000 x 7760 000 and y 220 000 y 370000 utm geographical projection system its surface area is approximately 16800 km2 and its geomorphology has 6 mountains middle and high atlas 55 plateaus rekkam and 39 plains that constitute the valley proper area which is studied here further with respect to the neighboring areas the basin is limited between the ahouli massif on the upstream side and the bouyaakobat paleo high topographic bulge on the downstream side and it is limited towards the east and the northwest by the rekkam plateaus and the middle atlas respectively whereas towards the southeast it is bounded by the eastern high atlas and the guercif plains on the northern side fig 1 geologically according to the previous researches carried out by researchers labbassi 1991 beauchamp et al 1996 el gout et al 2013 bouabdli et al 2005 tahiri et al 2020 ouanaimi et al 2018 the middle moulouya basin includes distinct structural domains that range from the mesozoic to the quaternary and is divided into five periods 1 the upper triassic continental subsidence basins appear owing to the reactivation of late hercynian faults their filling began by coarse red deposits and was followed by saliferous and evaporitic clays containing interlayered basaltic flows commonly an angular unconformity separates the triassic deposits from the paleozoic basement which is structured through various tectonic phases 2 the lower and middle liassic the geological formations of this period rest conformably on the triassic formations and they are represented by carbonate formations i e supratidal to subtidal carbonate platform deposits the upper domerien emersion leads to a sedimentation hiatus 3 the upper liasic p p dogger the dolomitic platform of aalenian bajocian is followed by a carbonate sedimentation which is represented by a new carbonate platform the bathonian regression is responsible of the development of a laguno continental environment 4 the cretaceous the deposits rest unconformably on the different geological formations of the middle and upper jurassic and they draw a complete sedimentary cycle which begins with continental deposits at the base and continues with lagoon facies and ends with marine deposits 5 the cenozoic from the eocene begins the atlas tectogenesis the sea withdraws from the study area and the sediment evolution takes place in a continental environment the environment becomes continental and leads to the succession of different facies basal conglomerates gypsiferous red marls and lacustrine limestones which constitute respectively the three cycles developed during this period from a tectonic point of view the study area is integrated into a ne sw shear zone generally the fault structures show two main directions e w and nw sw these structures could be considered precisely the same as the riedel fractures moreover owing to the variation in the directions of the deformation axes from the upper eocene till actual the structural evolution tends to be complex labbassi 1991 the hydrogeological frame of the basin encompasses seven hydrogeological units table 2 which are subdivided into three types of aquifers deeper tables units of cenomanian turonian middle bathonian callovian aalenian bajocian and domerian nouayti et al 2019 water tables units of plio quaternary and upper miocene as well as alluvial aquifer unit of quaternary the inventory of groundwater withdrawals has identified nearly 2284 points of water exploitation generally the water depth varies from 1 m to 50 m the shallow depths less than 10 m characterize the sectors located along the alluvial plains of moulouya river whereas the deepest water points characterize the boreholes and wells deepened by redrilling in some cases yield can exceed 80 l s in the outlet of the basin borehole x 671000 y 335600 the middle moulouya basin is situated in an arid bioclimatic stage generally the temperature averages show strong variations owing to the remarkable seasonal variations with an extremely cold winter and an extremely hot summer the temperature range exceeds 20 ᵒc whereas the average annual rainfall does not exceed 200 mm per year fig 2 the study area is of hydrogeological interest since it encompasses various water resources groundwater and phreatic water forming the unique sources of water supply for vast population living in the middle moulouya basin who exploits these resources for a specific use industrial irrigation or domestic thus their long term management assessment and protection are of paramount concerns further these resources undergo a high rate of exploitation that leads to a decline in the water level this decline may cause heavy problems viz land subsidence dryness of formerly flowing water points boreholes wells and springs 3 material and methods in order to determine the groundwater storage sites in the middle moulouya basin the proposed methodological approach according to mashael a s 2010 is based on the collection processing and analysis of all the data table 3 related to the following parameters 1 precipitation rainfall snow which is commonly designated as a water source 2 slope is also an influencing parameter that exerts effects on the energy and flow of water 3 rock fracture which play a significant part in increasing the porosity and permeability of rocks which makes the process of infiltration so easier 4 lithology is a factor with conspicuous influence since the storage regime and the flow are largely controlled by the types of rocks within the geological formations 5 drainage characteristics are not only useful in the distribution of the storm water but they are also important from the angle of estimating the infiltration rates these five parameters affect the groundwater storage mashael 2010 their integration in a model will be reflected in an empirical model which will be used to assess groundwater storage potential areas fig 3 depicts the detailed methodology endorsed in this article the overlapping layers should have similar cartographic characteristics viz the same resolution geographical extent length units and projection system because of the fact that calculations are going to be performed on the same matrix i e mesh size the followed methodology depends on making use of data obtained from geological maps topographic maps digital terrain models and satellite images to draw up a thematic mapping of the employed parameters viz drainage slope rock fracturing lithology and rainfall the validation process was based on the yield of 33 water springs 3 1 precipitation rainfall the rainfall intensity is one of the key factors which control the recharge runoff relation the more moderate rainfall intensity is the more effective groundwater recharge is furthermore spells of low rainfall intensity cause greater groundwater recharge fashae et al 2014 in our study area we have concluded that precipitation generally decreases in the southern part of the study area and gradually decreases from north to south the map obtained was classified into five main classes fig 4 120 mm year very low 120 130 mm year low 130 140 mm year medium 140 150 mm year high and over 150 mm year very high 3 2 lineaments surfaces discontinuity known as lineaments i e curvilinear or linear properties of geological structures such as fractures faults joints o leary et al 1976 these lineaments can be used for hydrogeological research and may play a significant role in water resources movement infiltration and storage dhekra et al 2018 sisir 2005 so their extraction and mapping ought to be done judiciously commonly the level of groundwater recharge depends upon the lineament density hence the higher lineament density is the higher potential groundwater recharge is yeh et al 2016 likewise the lineament density has a profound influence on rock mass porosity and permeability therefore high rate of porosity and permeability lies on high lineament density and vice versa tanveer et al 2020 landsat data has been one of the most valuable datasets for mapping the earth surface for more than 40 years topalaglu et al 2016 therefore landsat 8 oli acquired on december 31st 2018 with path row 200 36 is used for automatic lineament extraction the satellite data uploaded from http earthexplorer usgs gov the usgs earth explorer website the results of landsat 8 oli are used to extract lineaments for middle moulouya basin also extraction lineaments have been plotted as rose diagram and lineament density map fig 5 a they show that major direction of lineaments is ene wsw the rose diagram is generated on the basis of the total lengths and frequency of the lineaments sur and acharya 2020 hamdani and baali 2019 3 3 drainage commonly the drainage density is obtained by dividing the total length of all the rivers in a drainage basin by total area of the drainage basin yeh et al 2016 so its role is extremely important in the delineation of the groundwater potential zone adeyeye and ikpokonte 2018 furthermore the drainage density presents the distribution of surface water channels in nature and is widely used as a parameter thematic layer for the assessment of potential recharge areas because seepage from the water channels contributes significantly to subsurface recharge and thereby a rise in groundwater potential arshad et al 2020 nouayti et al 2019 singh et al 2018 hence an area with lower channel density will contribute to a low level of groundwater potential and vice versa in this context in the study area the drainage density was reclassified and categorized as very high 0 5 km km2 high 0 4 0 5 km km2 moderate 0 3 0 4 km km2 low 0 2 0 3 km km2 and very low 0 2 km km2 fig 5b therefore the zones possessing high density 0 5 km km2 are denoted with highest rating i e 5 as seepage could happen with higher rate which promotes groundwater recharge and zones with very low density 0 2 km km2 are denoted with minimum rating i e 1 as fewer water channels could not contribute significantly to the seepage process and therefore underground recharge will be significantly reduced table 6 3 4 topography slope the slope parameter is represented by the percentage slope degrees reflecting the ability of surface water to percolate into the groundwater singh et al 2013 this factor is very significant for the identification of favorable sites to groundwater recharge because it directly affects surface water infiltration de reu et al 2013 interestingly the bigger the slope is the lower the runoff is consequently the water has enough time to infiltrate which makes groundwater recharge
