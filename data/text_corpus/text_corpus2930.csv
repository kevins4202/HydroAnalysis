14650,the frequent occurrence of epidemics around the world gives rise to increasing concerns of the pollution of pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria in water this study investigated the impacts of virulence factors vfs on the removal of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria from municipal wastewater by ozone free or ozone encapsulated fe iii coagulant modified colloidal microbubbles o3 free ccmbs or o3 ccmbs the highly interface dependent process was initiated with cell capture on the microbubble surface where the as collected cells could be further inactivated with the bubble released ozone and oxidative species if o3 ccmbs were used the microbiome sequencing analyses denote that the o3 free ccmb performance of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria removal was dependent on the virulence phenotypes related to cell surface properties or structures the adhesion related vfs facilitated the effective attachment between cells and the coagulant modified bubble surface which further enhanced cell inactivation by bubble released ozone on the contrary the motility related vfs might help cells to escape from the bubble capture by locomotion however this could be overcome by o3 ccmb induced oxidative demolition of the movement structures besides the microbubble performance was also impacted with the cell membrane structure related to antibiotic resistance i e efflux pumps and the dissolved organic matter through promoting the surface capture and decreasing the oxidation efficacy the ozone encapsulated microbubbles with surface functionalization are robust and promising tools in hampering antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity dissemination from wastewater to surface water environment and awareness should be raised for the influence of virulence signatures on its performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords virulence factors antibiotic resistant bacteria pathogenic bacteria functionalized colloidal

frequent occurrence of public health events antibiotics have been used increasingly in medical therapy to combat with the pathogenic infections an important part of the adopted antibiotics are not metabolized which then enter into environment increase the selective pressure and stimulate the antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens the water environments particularly wastewater have been recognized as microorganism reservoirs and puddles for microbial interaction with consequential public health significance mapipa et al 2021 the pathogenic bacterial persisters are responsible for antibiotic treatment failures and cause a series of relapsing infections personnic et al 2020 obviously the co presence of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity poses more severe threats to ecology and human health compared with the risks resulting from either one effective measures are urgently needed to combat with the water pollution of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria based on their characteristics the behaviors of bacteria in the water environment are determined by virulence factors vfs including motility capsules cell wall lipopolysaccharide biofilm production and nutrient acquisition the pathogenesis in bacterial infections is a typical outcome of vfs which enables the bacteria with specific capacities of attaching to the surface of cells evading immune defenses and or obtaining nutrients which might be otherwise inaccessible lam et al 2014 the vf regulated activities always have high relevance of interface behaviors harding et al 2018 the physical adsorption of lipases to the lipid interface which is followed by the complexation between the enzymes and substrate determines the interfacial activation of cells jaeger et al 1994 the strains can encode and produce a type i chaperone usher pilus system which is crucial for the formation and maintenance of biofilms on the abiotic surfaces and does not require for the association with biotic surfaces the surface associated motility of pathogenic bacteria results from either flagella i e p aeruginosa or quorum sensing i e a baumannii the gram negative bacterial pathogens may secret proteins for the environment adaptation for example to inhibit the blood coagulation for disseminating through the bloodstream the vf directed behaviors not only determine the interface related infection but also may play a significant role in the water treatment processes for bacteria removal by means of impacting the surface interaction between cells and treatment agents those interplay behaviors are importantly affected by properties of cell surface resulting from phenotype and cellular matrix and agent surface santore 2022 flagella have been reported to favor the e coli deposition onto the quartz sands during sand filtration through swimming near and adhering strongly at the sites with high roughness narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts zhang et al 2021 moreover some vfs endow the bacteria with good resistance to the stressful environmental conditions ayoub moubareck and hammoudi halat 2020 being impacted by type ii toxin antitoxin system edwardsiella piscicida form persister cells which present oxidative resistance du et al 2022 in the tertiary wastewater treatment processes oxidants or disinfectants are expected to attack and inactivate the pathogens particularly with antimicrobial resistance and virulence signatures however the relative abundance of total antibiotic resistance genes args in the effluent was found to be increased jia et al 2023 it is of great importance to enhance and improve the process performance of wastewater treatment technologies with sufficient consideration about the influence of vfs the functionalized microbubble technology is a robust treatment method for simultaneously capturing and inactivating cells zhang et al 2022c the colloidal microbubbles surrounded with multilayered surfactant molecules can be surface and or core functionalized which exhibited attractive features of large specific surface area high gas holdup strong mass transfer efficiency and versatile capacity of pollutant removal yap et al 2014 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2022a the treatment process is highly interface dependent on the one hand the attachment stability between bubbles and particulate pollutants i e cells is enhanced due to the functionalization of coagulative components on the bubble surface lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019c on the other hand the cell inactivation with the ozone encapsulated microbubbles becomes targeted when the cells are collected on the bubble surface and ruptured by oxidative species ozone and reactive oxygen species released from the gas core of microbubbles zhang et al 2019b as a compact process combining and integrating coagulation ozonation and flotation in a one step treatment the functionalized microbubble method largely simplifies the regularly used successive physio chemical and oxidation disinfection units i e coagulation sedimentation or flotation ozonation jin et al 2006 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2008 sha arani et al 2019 spit et al 2022 and meanwhile it achieves fast and efficient treatment efficacy as for the removal of bacteria from water by functionalized microbubbles the properties of the targeted cells will influence a series of surface involved processes including cell capture oxidative inactivation and separation it is supposed that the antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria with different virulence signatures such as adhesion motility and membrane components perform distinctively during treatment giving rise to entirely different efficacy this is pivotal to the technical reliability in controlling and eliminating the antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity however relative research has not been reported to the authors knowledge the objective of the present study is to investigate the role of vfs in removing the antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria from municipal wastewater mww by functionalized microbubble technology the removal efficiency of antibiotic resistant bacteria with different vfs was first explored which was followed by high throughput 16s rrna or metagenomic analysis to identify the key vfs impacting the interfacial processes moreover the re activation and dissemination of the residual bacteria in the treated water were evaluated for the reliability of the treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of wastewater polluted by arb with different virulence phenotypes 2 1 1 arb

purchased e coli e coli dh5Î± with capsule and flagella and hafnia alvei h alvei without capsule but with flagella needed to be transformed to obtain the ampicillin resistance for e coli the plasmids puc19 encoded with ampicillin resistance genes were transformed into the competent cells of e coli dh5Î± with the standard chemical transformation procedure lorenz et al 1992 then 100 Âµl of the anabiotic e coli competent cells were plated to the medium of tryptose soya agar with ampicillin 100 Âµg ml and cultured overnight at 37 c the white positive clones were inoculated into the medium of tryptose soya broth with ampicillin 100 Âµg ml for 5 h at 37 c for h alvei the plasmids puc19 encoded with ampicillin resistance genes were transferred into the competent cells of h alvei through the electroporation method mccormac et al 1998 schenk and laddaga 1992 after electroporation the anabiotic competent cells were plated to the tryptose soya agar medium with ampicillin 100 Âµg ml and cultured overnight at 30 c and then the white positive clones were inoculated into the tryptose soya broth medium with ampicillin 100 Âµg ml for 5 h at 30 c after transformation the ampicillin resistant e coli and h alvei were conserved in the tryptose soya broth containing glycerin 20 v v at 80 c prior to use 2 1 2 wastewater polluted by arb with different virulence phenotypes the ampicillin resistant e coli h alvei and a baumannii were spiked individually or in mixture 1 1 1 in concentration into the autoclaved commercial pbs solution 20 diluted by deionized water to prepare the simulated wastewater polluted by arb with different virulence phenotypes the arb concentration was pre determined to be 1 26 1 90 106 cfu ml besides the mww was collected from the inlet and outlet

complexing with the amphiphilic molecule of bs 12 through electrostatic and boding effect li et al 2016 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the functionalized microbubbles of coagulative colloidal microbubbles o3 free ccmbs were then produced from the bs 12 fe iii mixed solution or bubble generation solution through the classical colloidal gas aphron generation method sebba 1985 fiercely

colloidal microbubbles o3 ccmbs were also generated by continuously injecting ozone from the bottom center of bubble generator into the bubble generation solution through an aerator at the gas flow rate of 66 3 ml min during the bubble generation process zhang et al 2021a ozone was produced with a set of ozone generation system beijing tonglin technology co ltd china which has been elaborated previously zhang et al 2022c the experimental setup of bubble generation is shown in fig s1 2 2 2 trials of functionalized microbubble treatment as soon as being generated the functionalized

fig s1 the treatment duration was controlled to be 3 min after which the aliquots of effluent and the floats were collected from the bottom and the surface of the treated water respectively to assess the performance of functionalized microbubbles and the influence of vfs it is noted that the ozone concentration above the surface of the treated wastewater was monitored with a portable gaseous ozone detector ky 2000 kaiyue environmental protection equipment co ltd china when o3 ccmbs were used no escaped ozone was detected in this study all the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 3 evaluation of cell removal efficiency the bacteria concentration was determined with cultivable plat count cpc method ahmed et al 2020 zarei baygi et al 2019 the pristine wastewater and the effluent

cfu per plate were achieved all the quantification was performed in triplicate the bacteria concentration was log10 lg transformed and the lg removal was then calculated through the lg value in the pristine wastewater minus the residual lg value li et al 2017 zhang et al 2022c the dilution effect caused by the injection of microbubble suspension and the as resulted change of wastewater volume

holdup of functionalized microbubble suspension which was obtained by comparing the gas volume with the total suspension volume zhang et al 2022a the significant difference of bacteria removal was analyzed using a one way analysis of variance on statview 5 0 software p 0 05 by comparing the trials between o3 free ccmb and o3 ccmb treatment or between different arb the zeta potential values of

reactivation potential of ampicillin resistant cultivable bacteria and overall cultivable bacteria after the functionalized microbubble treatment was investigated in comparison with those in the pristine wastewater triplicate 40 ml aliquots of the samples were collected in the sterile 100 ml tubes and incubated in the dark at 25 c on an orbital shaker 100 rpm shanghai minquan instrument co ltd china mol 61r for 7 d without nutrient addition drigo et al 2021 then the concentrations of ampicillin resistant cultivable bacteria and the overall cultivable bacteria were determined as described in section 2 2 3 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 scanning electron microscopy sem the bacteria cells in the pristine wastewater and the floats were observed by sem for the morphological change

coverslip 18 mm 18 mm on the top which was observed by clsm lsm 880 nlo carl zeiss jena germany using an oil immersion objective 1 4 oil dic m27 of 63 magnification 2 4 3 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and metagenomic dna sequencing sample treatment mww effluent and floats of the functionalized microbubble treatment were filtrated with 0 22 Î¼m membrane and then analyzed for microbiota profiles and functions by biomarker technology co ltd beijing china the dna molecules were extracted with the powersoil dna isolation kit mp biomedicals co ltd u s a following the manufacturer s instruction the dna concentration and quality were measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop 3000 thermo scientific u s a the dna concentration in the effluent did not satisfy that required for metagenomic analysis whist that in the pristine mww and the floats matched the dna content requirement therefore the samples of o3 free ccmb or o3 ccmb treated effluent went through the 16s rrna gene sequencing and those of floats were measured by metagenomics the untreated mww were analyzed by both of 16s rrna high throughput and metagenomic sequencing 16s rrna high throughput sequencing for the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene were amplified with barcoded pcr primers the forward primer 338f containing 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and the reverse primer 806r containing 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the pcr products were analyzed with the illumina novaseq 6000 platform in paired end mode after further purification quantification and homogenization the bioinformatics processing including a quality filtration trimmomatic version 0 33 and cutadapt version 1 9 1 paired end sequencing analysis usearch 2 version 10 and chimera removal uchime version 4 2 was performed on the raw sequencing read data then the sequence clustering into operational taxonomic units otus was conducted at a sequence identity of 97 the bayes classifier was used to note the characteristic otus based on the database of silva the abundance of otus was calculated by qiime software and the function of microbes was predicted using the software of bugbase metagenomic dna sequencing the metagenomic dna sequencing of pared end library was conducted on the illumina novaseq 6000 platform the quality clipping of adapter sequences from the metagenomic raw reads was performed by fastp and the low quality reads were thus removed the megahit version 1 1 2 was used to assemble the majorizing sequences and the contigs with the length 300 bp were selected for gene prediction and functional annotation the quast software version 2 3 was employed to evaluate the assembled contigs gurevich et al 2013 and the results are presented in table s1 open reading frames from each assembled contig were predicted using metagenemark version 3 26 zhu et al 2010 all the predicted genes with 95 sequence identify 90 coverage were clustered using cd hit version 4 6 6 the longest sequences among the clusters were chosen as representative coding sequences to construct a non redundant gene catalog the taxonomic annotations were obtained by aligning the representative sequences of the non redundant gene catalog with the ncbi nr database nr 2019 03 using the diamond blastp version 0 9 24 the e value threshold of 1e 5 the vfs were annotated by aligning gene sequences against vfdb database seta data 2019 04 with the blast software version 2 2 31 the e value threshold of 1e 5 args were annotated by querying the predicted contigs against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database with resistance gene identifier version 4 2 2 statistical analysis principal component analysis was conducted using the r software version 4 1 3 with the vegan package version 2 6 2 based on the otus identified by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing thus the possible trends and clustering of the microbial community in mww before and after the treatment with o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs could be evaluated the 95 confidence ellipsoids were plotted and the permutation based multivariate analysis of variance was employed to assess significant differences between the microbial communities per treatment level the heatmaps were visualized using the pheatmap r package version 1 0 12 and the relative abundance was normalized with the overall genomic reads or otus network

3 6 for the data visualization different samples were named briefly as shown in abbreviation list 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of typical virulence phenotypes on capture and inactivation of arb by interface dominated functionalized microbubble treatment the impacts of virulence phenotypes on the simultaneous capture and inactivation performance of functionalized microbubbles were investigated through treating the simulated wastewater polluted with arb e coli with flagella and capsule h alvei with flagella but without capsule and a baumannii with capsule but without flagella the surface modified microbubbles o3 free ccmbs achieved as high as 5 9 0 0 log removal of e coli cells at the optimum modifier fe iii dose of 4 0 mmol l in the one step treatment fig s2 and the same removal efficiency of h alvei were reached however at a greater dose of fe iii 5 0 mmol l in contrast the a baumannii cells were more difficult to be captured since the log removal did not exceed 3 1 0 1 when the microbubbles were both surface and core functionalized the as formed o3 ccmbs improved the microbubble performance particularly for the trials with a baumannii and the mixed arb species e coli h alvei and a baumannii o3 ccmbs obtained significant increase of cell removal at the equivalent dose of surface modifier 2 4 mmol l as fe iii compared with o3 free ccmbs fig 1 a the surface charge of cells turned from negative to positive after the treatment and the ozone encapsulation into bubbles did not decrease the charge neutralization potential fig 1 b it indicates that the capture of arb cells by both o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs was initiated from electrostatic attraction which should be triggered with the fe iii coagulant on the bubble surface different separation efficacies of the three arb species by surface modified microbubbles should be attributed to the phenotypic or morphological features of cells in this work e coli h alvei and a baumannii were all rod like fimbrial cells with hydrodynamic diameter ranging in 1 10 2 56 Î¼m table 1 and the cell length followed the order of a baumannii e coli h alvei fig 1 c1 c4 flagellum is considered essential as an adhesin abe et al 2020 and capsule has been reported to associate with the viscous phenotypes zhu et al 2021 both of which could contribute to the cell capture by bubbles here the e coli cells with both of flagella and capsule were the most efficiently removed through attaching on the surface of o3 free ccmbs however each coin has two sides it is also known that flagellum is key to bacterial motility zineba et al 2015 and capsule serves as a physical barrier of self defense zhu et al 2021 which might impede the bubbles from capturing or oxidatively rupturing the bacterial cells respectively the cells of h alvei with flagella but without capsule were less removed than those of e coli the o3 ccmb treatment of a baumannii with capsule but without flagella consumed more ozone to achieve a high treatment efficiency compared with the scenarios with e coli apparently the presence of either flagella or capsule could decline the performance of functionalized microbubbles which was quite different from the scenarios with both virulence phenotypes moreover the way of microbubble functionalization surface and or core modification impacted the arb removal the sem images of arb collected in floats display that o3 ccmbs led to more compact and larger cell aggregates fig 1 e1 e4 than o3 free ccmbs fig 1 d1 d4 in the interface dependent one step process the viable cells of arb were collected on the bubble surface where the ozone and reactive oxygen species released by o3 ccmbs were capable of rupturing the cell membrane and further damaging the dna molecules the broken dna fragments were clearly shown the clsm images of all the three arb species particularly a baumannii with the largest length of cells the molecules stained in red fig 1 f1 f4 ozone increased the concentration of oxygenated functional groups i e carboxylic acids which could complex with coagulant cations herein fe iii coagulant jekel 1994 sadrnourmohamadi and gorczyca 2015 ozone also caused the lysis of cell walls or of the associated organic substances rendering cells to become better coagulatable or floatable jekel 1994 then a coalesce with colloids was allowed resulting in larger particles which continued to solubilize organics bound with larger sized particles mastronardi et al 1993 the abovementioned micro flocculation produced the organic bound ferric colloids in the o3 ccmb treatment in the absence of ozone the ferric hydroxides resulting from the hydrolysis of ferric salt were capable of removing the organic contaminants from the wastewater through adsorption co precipitation and enmeshment cheng et al 2007 the processes dominated by ferric hydroxides could be initiated on the microbubble surface owing to the fe iii modification of microbubble surface for the scenarios with o3 free ccmbs compared with the trials with o3 ccmbs the complexation between fe iii and the degraded organic compounds was much weaker in the o3 free ccmb invovled process consequently the inorganic ferric colloids should be the main species of ferric colloids in the absence of ozone in addition to the fe colloidalization the encapsulation of ozone into the microbubble system impacted the coagulant species as well the dissolved ozone molecules could interact with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of hydrolyzed fe species via electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to form the fe oho3 configurations with an oxygen bridge connection jin et al 2020 the fe3 ions were directly complexed by hydroxide ligands which accelerated the polymerization of iron by hydroxide bridge gao et al 2009 ozonation promoted the polymerization reactions during coagulant hydrolysis in the hybrid ozonation and coagulation processes leading to the improvement of coagulation performance jin et al 2021 thus the content of the transitionally low and high polymeric fe species namely fe b and fe c individually in the o3 ccmb system should be greater than that in the o3 free ccmbs it is also noteworthy that in contrast with a series of related tertiary wastewater treatment processes i e coagulation sedimentation coagulation flotation coagulation ozonation and adsorption the compact technology of functionalized microbubble treatment took the obvious advantages in short retention time implying great treatment capacity and high removal of arb and pathogens at the comparable doses of coagulant and ozone table s3 thereby the proposed novel method could be considered as reliable and robust process in mww treatment 3 2 performance of functionalized microbubbles in removing opportunistic pathogens and potential arb from mww after the feasibility of functionalized microbubbles in removing the arb with typical virulence phenotypes was preliminarily validated the performance of o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs was further examined in treating the mwws influent and effluent of secondary treatment respectively for the treatment of secondary effluent o3 free ccmbs achieved significantly higher removal of both ampicillin resistant cultivable bacteria and overall cultivable bacteria 2 31 log as shown in fig s4 a than o3 ccmbs at the equivalent doses of fe iii 2 4 mmol l and ozone 15 mg l and 12 mg l for the treatment of secondary influent and effluent respectively it should be noted that the residual organic matter in the mww after biochemical treatment was refractory in comparison with that in the secondary influent peng et al 2022 the recalcitrant organic matter competitively consumed ozone and other reactive oxidative species with bacteria which weakened the performance of the ozone modified microbubbles o3 ccmbs as for the surface functionalized microbubbles in the absence of ozone o3 free ccmbs their behaviors depended mainly on the surface capture and flotation separation the organic molecules and particles in the pristine mww might enhance the attachment of bacteria cells through reinforcing the bridging sweeping and enmeshing mechanisms it needs to be pointed out that the concentration of cultivable bacteria only reflected the removal of bacteria to some extent due to the very small proportion of cultivable bacteria relative in total bacteria even as low as 0 2 sumpono et al 2003 therefore the impact of vfs on the removal of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria ought to be further investigated using microbiome sequencing methods the genera of acinetobacter eschereichia shigella allobaculum muribaculaceae lachnospiraceae faecalibacterium clostridia hafnia obsesumbacterium bacteroides streptococcus acrobacter illeibacterium and pseudarcobacter were identified to be the most abundant bacteria in the raw mww used in this work fig 2 a those intestinal and extraintestinal bacteria including the spiked arb were reported to be opportunistic pathogens frequently presenting in mww and causing severe inflammation and infection i e diarrhoea or dysentery kashinskaya et al 2021 mu et al 2020 song et al 2017 wang et al 2019 they could be antimicrobial resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics in wastewater palmieri et al 2011 Å¡varcovÃ¡ et al 2022 the bacterial composition was of high similarity in the raw secondary influent and effluent and the microbubble induced floats which however was significantly distinctive from that in the water post the o3 free ccmb or o3 ccmb treatment fig 2 b the results indicate that the functionalized microbubbles were capable of collecting and removing the bacteria with different virulence signatures for instance the proportion of acinetobacter in the raw secondary influent decreased from 66 to 1 1 and 2 2 after the o3 free ccmb and o3 ccmb process individually and that in the raw secondary effluent decreased from 88 to 6 3 and 17 0 by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs individually the network analysis of taxa carrying vfgs and args as well as bacterial metagenome assembled genome was made on the raw mww as well as the floats the result in fig 2 c shows the potential hosts of harmful genes such as vfgs and args through uncovering their potential relationship with bacteria acinetobacter including a baumannii and firmicutes have been reported to be the hosts of many vfgs and args kroger et al 2017 noman et al 2023 and proteobacteria including clostridium were found to be significantly related with 10 subtypes of vfgs and 8 subtypes of args generally in this work 17 subtypes of args were found to be strongly correlated to 10 subtypes of vfgs particularly the args of adef and adeg which were responsible of the efflux pump for tetracycline and quinolone resistance kaviani et al 2020 could be positively related to 15 subtypes of vfgs since the phenotypes of bacteria were regulated by vfgs even args and the behaviors of o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs were affected by phenotypes the performance of those functionalized microbubbles in removing antibiotic resistant and or pathogenic bacteria from mww must be further assessed for the impacts of virulence determinants 3 3 response of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance to functionalized microbubble treatment 3 3 1 adhesion and motility as predominant virulence factors impacting surface interaction between cells and bubbles as shown in fig 3 a the bacteria with relevance of potential pathogens biofilm formation and stress tolerance were enriched in the floats particularly from the secondary effluent of mww by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs notably the vfgs regulating the relative virulence signatures could be effectively collected by functionalized microbubbles based on the vfdb annotation on the metagenomic data of the floats 564 key vfg subtypes were enriched by functionalized microbubbles from the secondary influent and effluent of mww the results in section 3 1 reveal that the co presence of typical phenotypes relating to flagella motility and adhesion and capsule adhesion and defense was beneficial to the bacteria removal by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs through further investigating the vfgs in the floats derived from the functionalized microbubble treatment the adhesion related vfgs were more frequently detected than the motility related ones in the floats obtained from the secondary influent and effluent fig 3 b and c and to be specific the capsule related vfgs were of significantly greater relative abundance in floats compared with the flagella related ones fig s5 the vfgs responsible of adhesion are crucial for the cell involved interfacial adhesion processes such as biofilm formation and organism infection belas 2014 in the interface dependent treatment with the fe iii modified microbubbles o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs the adhesion related virulence signatures i e capsule type iv pili could tend to attach on the microbubble surface although the vfs of motility contribute to achieving and maintaining the colonization niches of pathogens tercero alburo et al 2014 they also regulate the cells to escape from the harmful stress in the environment typically flagella are extremely effective organelles of locomotion permitting bacteria to achieve speeds exceeding tens of micrometers per second belas 2014 thus the bacteria swimming behaviors might protect the cells from being captured and oxidatively attacked by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs respectively which decreased the microbubble collection efficiency of vfgs relating to motility notably the abundance of motility related vfgs was lower in the floats derived from the mww secondary effluent than from the mww secondary influent fig 3 b and c the organic content in the raw secondary effluent was lower than that in the raw secondary influent table 1 the improved water quality reduced the resistance of locomotion i e flagella driven swimming such that the bacteria were apt to search for appropriate habitats when the functionalized microbubble treatment was adopted nevertheless the ozone and reactive oxygen species released from o3 ccmbs were capable of initiating the oxidative damage of cell structures responsible of motility for instance the hook and helical filament of flagella could be attacked by reactive oxygen species released by o3 ccmbs which importantly declined the motile activities of cells and facilitated the bubble capture and flotation separation performance this helps to explain the reason why flagella the representative vfgs relating to motility were more abundant in the floats obtained from the o3 ccmb treatment than in those derived from the scenarios without ozone functionalization o3 free ccmbs fig s5 the cell membrane rupture and dna damage resulting from o3 ccmbs also related to the removal of colibactin which was responsible of dna damage induction 3 3 2 membrane related antibiotic resistance mechanisms actively participating functionalized microbubble treatment the pathogens confer antibiotic resistance are more problematic to the health of human and other livings allen et al 2010 hence the performance of functionalized microbubbles should be specifically explored with respect to the arg removal in this work the antibiotic resistance annotation of metagenomics shows totally 483 arg subtypes which could be categorized into 15 types before the functionalized microbubble treatment the relative abundance of args in the secondary effluent of mww was higher than that in the secondary influent fig 4 a though the organic content was apparently decreased after the biochemical processes table 1 indeed the high loadings of organic nutrients and microorganisms as well as the great diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the biochemical units particularly the active sludge promoted the vertical and horizontal transfer of args which increased the antimicrobial resistance in the mww nnadozie et al 2017 therefore the advanced tertiary treatment technologies are essential for arg removal from the practical application viewpoint the functionalized microbubble technology could be a promising alternative for the mww secondary effluent treatment particularly the o3 ccmbs the args that were collected by functionalized microbubbles particularly from secondary influent regulated the bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam peptide fluoroquinolone nitroimidazole nitrofuran fosfomycin aminocoumarin elfamycin and multidrug fig 4 a as mentioned above the surface modifier of fe iii coagulant the intrinsic organic matter in the mww as well as the oxidative agent of ozone could be the important contributors of capturing and damaging arb and cell free floating args from the raw secondary influent for the functionalized microbubble treatment of the mww secondary effluent the removal of genes responsible of resistance to macrolide glycopeptide mupirocin and other antibiotics were effective and the performance of o3 ccmbs was also better than that of o3 free ccmbs the leading antibiotic resistance mechanisms include antibiotic efflux reduced permeability to antibiotic antibiotic inactivation as well as alternation protection and replacement of antibiotic targets allen et al 2010 it is worth noting that after the o3 free ccmb and o3 ccmb treatment the args relating to the antibiotic efflux mechanism were well enriched in floats fig 4 b the membrane related antibiotic mechanisms i e antibiotic efflux and reduced permeability to antibiotics ought to be important for the cell membrane involved the interfacial since the relative args in floats were mostly shared compared with other args fig 4 b the functional protein or glycoprotein molecules on the cell membrane could participate in the cell capture by positively charged microbubbles via electrostatic attraction and were thus susceptible to injury caused by ozone and other reactive oxygen species 3 4 dissemination inhibition of harmful bacteria by functionalized microbubbles after being discharged the effluent of tertiary or advanced treatment may go through a long transportation in the surface water system hence the potential of microbial growth in the effluent of functionalized microbubble process should be assessed in terms of microbial proliferation inhibition and the microbial composition the growth of enteric opportunistic pathogens such as e coli enterococcus spp listeria spp and salmonella spp may turn to a viable but non culturable state during the wastewater treatment processes drigo et al 2021 with the low levels of metabolic activity they play the role of seeds in the downstream receiving water of the treated mww and may pose potential ecological risks based on this consideration this study investigated the concentrations of ampicillin resistant cultivable bacteria and overall cultivable bacteria in the microbubble treated water fig 5 a and floats fig 5 b respectively using the 7 day regrowth incubation method drigo et al 2021 day 0 presented the samples prior to the functionalized microbubble treatment the filtrate and the filter residues after the 0 45 Âµm membrane filtration of the raw mww the bi functionalized microbubbles of o3 ccmbs took greater advantages in inactivating bacteria than those only surface modified with fe iii coagulant o3 free ccmbs o3 ccmbs not only captured and separated bacteria but also released ozone and other reactive oxygen species which ruptured the membrane of cells collected on the bubble surface and inhibited their regrowth the higher inactivation efficacy of bacteria including antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria was then achieved compared with the regular flotation oxidation and disinfection processes for the real wastewater the microbiome sequencing deepened the knowledge of residual harmful bacteria i e arb pathogens composition after the functionalized microbubble treatment in the effluent of o3 free ccmb or o3 ccmb treatment the proportions of pathogens and animal parasites or symbionts were largely decreased whereas those of bacteria responsible of aerobic chemoheterotrophy and fermentation were increased fig 5 c it has been reported that the traditional tertiary treatment processes of mww particularly such as uv disinfection were able to reduce the concentrations of some args vfgs and potential pathogens however promoting the relative abundance of total args consequently those traditional methods failed in depleting the potential microbial risks due to the bacterial regrowth and horizontal gene transfer in the receiving water jia et al 2023 to achieve a balance between chemical and microbial risk reduction the functionalized microbubbles particularly the surface and core functionalized o3 ccmbs may be introduced as reliable tertiary treatment means following the mww secondary units for hampering the dissemination of pathogenic bacteria 4 conclusions and environmental implications the fe iii surface modification endowed the microbubbles with robust capacity of capturing and separating the antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria from water and further encapsulating ozone into microbubbles resulted in the effective cell inactivation and dissemination inhibition through rupturing membrane and breaking dna molecules for the highly interface dependent treatment process fig 6 the viscous virulence phenotype responsible of adhesion i e capsule pili and flagella facilitated the attachment onto the surface functionalized microbubbles differently the vfs relating to motility typically flagella probably protected the bacteria from capture and oxidative attack by means of locomotion however once the structure of flagella was damaged by o3 ccmbs flagella would then play the role of adhesin and promote the cell capture the protein or glycoprotein molecules responsible of antibiotic efflux were beneficial to cell collection by positively charged microbubbles via electrostatic attraction and thus were susceptible to injury caused by o3 ccmbs thus the relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms were vulnerable to the functionalized microbubble treatment for the mww treatment the bacteria in the secondary effluent could be more efficiently inactivated by o3 ccmbs than those in the secondary influent since the high organic content in the latter would compete with bacteria for the reactive oxygen species hence o3 ccmbs were recommended as tertiary treatment of mww for removing potential pathogens and arb in the practical application this study provides insights into the virulence signatures including antibiotic resistance relating to surface properties or structures of cell membrane for the significant impact on the interface dependent behaviors of functionalized microbubbles 5 author contributions m z conceived the experiments

14650,the frequent occurrence of epidemics around the world gives rise to increasing concerns of the pollution of pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria in water this study investigated the impacts of virulence factors vfs on the removal of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria from municipal wastewater by ozone free or ozone encapsulated fe iii coagulant modified colloidal microbubbles o3 free ccmbs or o3 ccmbs the highly interface dependent process was initiated with cell capture on the microbubble surface where the as collected cells could be further inactivated with the bubble released ozone and oxidative species if o3 ccmbs were used the microbiome sequencing analyses denote that the o3 free ccmb performance of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria removal was dependent on the virulence phenotypes related to cell surface properties or structures the adhesion related vfs facilitated the effective attachment between cells and the coagulant modified bubble surface which further enhanced cell inactivation by bubble released ozone on the contrary the motility related vfs might help cells to escape from the bubble capture by locomotion however this could be overcome by o3 ccmb induced oxidative demolition of the movement structures besides the microbubble performance was also impacted with the cell membrane structure related to antibiotic resistance i e efflux pumps and the dissolved organic matter through promoting the surface capture and decreasing the oxidation efficacy the ozone encapsulated microbubbles with surface functionalization are robust and promising tools in hampering antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity dissemination from wastewater to surface water environment and awareness should be raised for the

frequent occurrence of public health events antibiotics have been used increasingly in medical therapy to combat with the pathogenic infections an important part of the adopted antibiotics are not metabolized which then enter into environment increase the selective pressure and stimulate the antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens the water environments particularly wastewater have been recognized as microorganism reservoirs and puddles for microbial interaction with consequential public health significance mapipa et al 2021 the pathogenic bacterial persisters are responsible for antibiotic treatment failures and cause a series of relapsing infections personnic et al 2020 obviously the co presence of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity poses more severe threats to ecology and human health compared with the risks resulting from either one effective measures are urgently needed to combat with the water pollution of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria based on their characteristics the behaviors of bacteria in the water environment are determined by virulence factors vfs including motility capsules cell wall lipopolysaccharide biofilm production and nutrient acquisition the pathogenesis in bacterial infections is a typical outcome of vfs which enables the bacteria with specific capacities of attaching to the surface of cells evading immune defenses and or obtaining nutrients which might be otherwise inaccessible lam et al 2014 the vf regulated activities always have high relevance of interface behaviors harding et al 2018 the physical adsorption of lipases to the lipid interface which is followed by the complexation between the enzymes and substrate determines the interfacial activation of cells jaeger et al 1994 the strains can encode and produce a type i chaperone usher pilus system which is crucial for the formation and maintenance of biofilms on the abiotic surfaces and does not require for the association with biotic surfaces the surface associated motility of pathogenic bacteria results from either flagella i e p aeruginosa or quorum sensing i e a baumannii the gram negative bacterial pathogens may secret proteins for the environment adaptation for example to inhibit the blood coagulation for disseminating through the bloodstream the vf directed behaviors not only determine the interface related infection but also may play a significant role in the water treatment processes for bacteria removal by means of impacting the surface interaction between cells and treatment agents those interplay behaviors are importantly affected by properties of cell surface resulting from phenotype and cellular matrix and agent surface santore 2022 flagella have been reported to favor the e coli deposition onto the quartz sands during sand filtration through swimming near and adhering strongly at the sites with high roughness narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts zhang et al 2021 moreover some vfs endow the bacteria with good resistance to the stressful environmental conditions ayoub moubareck and hammoudi halat 2020 being impacted by type ii toxin antitoxin system edwardsiella piscicida form persister cells which present oxidative resistance du et al 2022 in the tertiary wastewater treatment processes oxidants or disinfectants are expected to attack and inactivate the pathogens particularly with antimicrobial resistance and virulence signatures however the relative abundance of total antibiotic resistance genes args in the effluent was found to be increased jia et al 2023 it is of great importance to enhance and improve the process performance of wastewater treatment technologies with sufficient consideration about the influence of vfs the functionalized microbubble technology is a robust treatment method for simultaneously capturing and inactivating cells zhang et al 2022c the colloidal microbubbles surrounded with multilayered surfactant molecules can be surface and or core functionalized which exhibited attractive features of large specific surface area high gas holdup strong mass transfer efficiency and versatile capacity of pollutant removal yap et al 2014 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2022a the treatment process is highly interface dependent on the one hand the attachment stability between bubbles and particulate pollutants i e cells is enhanced due to the functionalization of coagulative components on the bubble surface lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019c on the other hand the cell inactivation with the ozone encapsulated microbubbles becomes targeted when the cells are collected on the bubble surface and ruptured by oxidative species ozone and reactive oxygen species released from the gas core of microbubbles zhang et al 2019b as a compact process combining and integrating coagulation ozonation and flotation in a one step treatment the functionalized microbubble method largely simplifies the regularly used successive physio chemical and oxidation disinfection units i e coagulation sedimentation or flotation ozonation jin et al 2006 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2008 sha arani et al 2019 spit et al 2022 and meanwhile it achieves fast and efficient treatment efficacy as for the removal of bacteria from water by functionalized microbubbles the properties of the targeted cells will influence a series of surface involved processes including cell capture oxidative inactivation and separation it is supposed that the antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria with different virulence signatures such as adhesion motility and membrane components perform distinctively during treatment giving rise to entirely different efficacy this is pivotal to the technical reliability in controlling and eliminating the antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity however relative research has not been reported to the authors knowledge the objective of the present study is to investigate the role of vfs in removing the antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria from municipal wastewater mww by functionalized microbubble technology the removal efficiency of antibiotic resistant bacteria with different vfs was first explored which was followed by high throughput 16s rrna or metagenomic analysis to identify the key vfs impacting the interfacial processes moreover the re activation and dissemination of the residual bacteria in the treated water were evaluated for the reliability of the treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of wastewater polluted by arb with different virulence phenotypes 2 1 1 arb

complexing with the amphiphilic molecule of bs 12 through electrostatic and boding effect li et al 2016 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the functionalized microbubbles of coagulative colloidal

the performance of functionalized microbubbles and the influence of vfs it is noted that the ozone concentration above the surface of the treated wastewater was monitored with a portable gaseous ozone

instruction the dna concentration and quality were measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop 3000 thermo scientific u s a the dna concentration in the effluent did not satisfy that required for metagenomic analysis whist that in the pristine mww and the floats matched the dna content requirement therefore the samples of o3 free ccmb or o3 ccmb treated effluent went through the 16s rrna

sequencing the metagenomic dna sequencing of pared end library was conducted on the illumina novaseq 6000 platform the quality clipping of adapter sequences from the metagenomic raw reads was performed by fastp and the low quality reads were thus removed the megahit version 1 1 2 was used to assemble the majorizing sequences and the contigs with the length 300 bp were selected for gene prediction and functional annotation the quast software version 2 3 was employed to evaluate the assembled contigs gurevich et al 2013 and the results are presented in table s1 open reading frames

arb by interface dominated functionalized microbubble treatment the impacts of virulence phenotypes on the simultaneous capture and inactivation performance of functionalized microbubbles were investigated through treating the simulated wastewater polluted with arb e coli with flagella and capsule h alvei with flagella but without capsule and a baumannii with capsule but without flagella the surface modified microbubbles o3 free ccmbs achieved as high as 5 9 0 0 log removal of e coli cells at the optimum modifier fe iii dose of 4 0 mmol l in the one step treatment fig s2 and the same removal efficiency of h alvei were reached however at a greater dose of fe iii 5 0 mmol l in contrast the a baumannii cells were more difficult to be captured since the log removal did not exceed 3 1 0 1 when the microbubbles were both surface and core functionalized the as formed o3 ccmbs improved the microbubble performance particularly for the trials with a baumannii and the mixed arb species e coli h alvei and a baumannii o3 ccmbs obtained significant increase of cell removal at the equivalent dose of surface modifier 2 4 mmol l as fe iii compared with o3 free ccmbs fig 1 a the surface charge of cells turned from negative to positive after the treatment and the ozone encapsulation into bubbles did not decrease the charge neutralization potential fig 1 b it indicates that the capture of arb cells by both o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs was initiated from electrostatic attraction which should be triggered with the fe iii coagulant on the bubble surface different separation efficacies of the three arb species by surface modified microbubbles should be attributed to the phenotypic or morphological features of cells in this work e coli h alvei and a baumannii were all rod like fimbrial cells with hydrodynamic diameter ranging in 1 10 2 56 Î¼m table 1 and the cell length followed the order of a baumannii e coli h alvei fig 1 c1 c4 flagellum is considered essential as an adhesin abe et al 2020 and capsule has been reported to associate with the viscous phenotypes zhu et al 2021 both of which could contribute to the cell capture by bubbles here the e coli cells with both of flagella and capsule were the most efficiently removed through attaching on the surface of o3 free ccmbs however each coin has two sides it is also known that flagellum is key to bacterial motility zineba et al 2015 and capsule serves as a physical barrier of self defense zhu et al 2021 which might impede the bubbles from capturing or oxidatively rupturing the bacterial cells respectively the cells of h alvei with flagella but without capsule were less removed than those of e coli the o3 ccmb treatment of a baumannii with capsule but without flagella consumed more ozone to achieve a high treatment efficiency compared with the scenarios with e coli apparently the presence of either flagella or capsule could decline the performance of functionalized microbubbles which was quite different from the scenarios with both virulence phenotypes moreover the way of microbubble functionalization surface and or core modification impacted the arb removal the sem images of arb collected in floats display that o3 ccmbs led to more compact and larger cell aggregates fig 1 e1 e4 than o3 free ccmbs fig 1 d1 d4 in the interface dependent one step process the viable cells of arb were collected on the bubble surface where the ozone and reactive oxygen species released by o3 ccmbs were capable of rupturing the cell membrane and further damaging the dna molecules the broken dna fragments were clearly shown the clsm images of all the three arb species particularly a baumannii with the largest length of cells the molecules stained in red fig 1 f1 f4 ozone increased the concentration of oxygenated functional groups i e carboxylic acids which could complex with coagulant cations herein fe iii coagulant jekel 1994 sadrnourmohamadi and gorczyca 2015 ozone also caused the lysis of cell walls or of the associated organic substances rendering cells to become better coagulatable or floatable jekel 1994 then a coalesce with colloids was allowed resulting in larger particles which continued to solubilize organics bound with larger sized particles mastronardi et al 1993 the abovementioned micro flocculation produced the organic bound ferric colloids in the o3 ccmb treatment in the absence of ozone the ferric hydroxides resulting from the hydrolysis of ferric salt were capable of removing the organic contaminants from the wastewater through adsorption co precipitation and enmeshment cheng et al 2007 the processes dominated by ferric hydroxides could be initiated on the microbubble surface owing to the fe iii modification of microbubble surface for the scenarios with o3 free ccmbs compared with the trials with o3 ccmbs the complexation between fe iii and the degraded organic compounds was much weaker in the o3 free ccmb invovled process consequently the inorganic ferric colloids should be the main species of ferric colloids in the absence of ozone in addition to the fe colloidalization the encapsulation of ozone into the microbubble system impacted the coagulant species as well the dissolved ozone molecules could interact with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of hydrolyzed fe species via electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to form the fe oho3 configurations with an oxygen bridge connection jin et al 2020 the fe3 ions were directly complexed by hydroxide ligands which accelerated the polymerization of iron by hydroxide bridge gao et al 2009 ozonation promoted the polymerization reactions during coagulant hydrolysis in the hybrid ozonation and coagulation processes leading to the improvement of coagulation performance jin et al 2021 thus the content of the transitionally low and high polymeric fe species namely fe b and fe c individually in the o3 ccmb system should be greater than that in the o3 free ccmbs it is also noteworthy that in contrast with a series of related tertiary wastewater treatment processes i e coagulation sedimentation coagulation flotation coagulation ozonation and adsorption the compact technology of functionalized microbubble treatment took the obvious advantages in short retention time implying great treatment capacity and high removal of arb and pathogens at the comparable doses of coagulant and ozone table s3 thereby the proposed novel method could be considered as reliable and robust process in mww treatment 3 2 performance of functionalized microbubbles in removing opportunistic pathogens and potential arb from mww after the feasibility of functionalized microbubbles in removing the arb with typical virulence phenotypes was preliminarily validated the performance of o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs was further examined in treating the mwws influent and effluent of secondary treatment respectively for the treatment of secondary effluent o3 free ccmbs achieved significantly higher removal of both ampicillin resistant cultivable bacteria and overall cultivable bacteria 2 31 log as shown in fig s4 a than o3 ccmbs at the equivalent doses of fe iii 2 4 mmol l and ozone 15 mg l and 12 mg l for the treatment of secondary influent and effluent respectively it should be noted that the residual organic matter in the mww after biochemical treatment was refractory in comparison with that in the secondary influent peng et al 2022 the recalcitrant organic matter competitively consumed ozone and other reactive oxidative species with bacteria which weakened the performance of the ozone modified microbubbles o3 ccmbs as for the surface functionalized microbubbles in the absence of ozone o3 free ccmbs their behaviors depended mainly on the surface capture and flotation separation the organic molecules and particles in the pristine mww might enhance the attachment of bacteria cells through reinforcing the bridging sweeping and enmeshing mechanisms it needs to be pointed out that the concentration of cultivable bacteria only reflected the removal of bacteria to some extent due to the very small proportion of cultivable bacteria relative in total bacteria even as low as 0 2 sumpono et al 2003 therefore the impact of vfs on the removal of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria ought to be further investigated using microbiome sequencing methods the genera of acinetobacter eschereichia shigella allobaculum muribaculaceae lachnospiraceae faecalibacterium clostridia hafnia obsesumbacterium bacteroides streptococcus acrobacter illeibacterium and pseudarcobacter were identified to be the most abundant bacteria in the raw mww used in this work fig 2 a those intestinal and extraintestinal bacteria including the spiked arb were reported to be opportunistic pathogens frequently presenting in mww and causing severe inflammation and infection i e diarrhoea or dysentery kashinskaya et al 2021 mu et al 2020 song et al 2017 wang et al 2019 they could be antimicrobial resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics in wastewater palmieri et al 2011 Å¡varcovÃ¡ et al 2022 the bacterial composition was of high similarity in the raw secondary influent and effluent and the microbubble induced floats which however was significantly distinctive from that in the water post the o3 free ccmb or o3 ccmb treatment fig 2 b the results indicate that the functionalized microbubbles were capable of collecting and removing the bacteria with different virulence signatures for instance the proportion of acinetobacter in the raw secondary influent decreased from 66 to 1 1 and 2 2 after the o3 free ccmb and o3 ccmb process individually and that in the raw secondary effluent decreased from 88 to 6 3 and 17 0 by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs individually the network analysis of taxa carrying vfgs and args as well as bacterial metagenome assembled genome was made on the raw mww as well as the floats the result in fig 2 c shows the potential hosts of harmful genes such as vfgs and args through uncovering their potential relationship with bacteria acinetobacter including a baumannii and firmicutes have been reported to be the hosts of many vfgs and args kroger et al 2017 noman et al 2023 and proteobacteria including clostridium were found to be significantly related with 10 subtypes of vfgs and 8 subtypes of args generally in this work 17 subtypes of args were found to be strongly correlated to 10 subtypes of vfgs particularly the args of adef and adeg which were responsible of the efflux pump for tetracycline and quinolone resistance kaviani et al 2020 could be positively related to 15 subtypes of vfgs since the phenotypes of bacteria were regulated by vfgs even args and the behaviors of o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs were affected by phenotypes the performance of those functionalized microbubbles in removing antibiotic resistant and or pathogenic bacteria from mww must be further assessed for the impacts of virulence determinants 3 3 response of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance to functionalized microbubble treatment 3 3 1 adhesion and motility as predominant virulence factors impacting surface interaction between cells and bubbles as shown in fig 3 a the bacteria with relevance of potential pathogens biofilm formation and stress tolerance were enriched in the floats particularly from the secondary effluent of mww by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs notably the vfgs regulating the relative virulence signatures could be effectively collected by functionalized microbubbles based on the vfdb annotation on the metagenomic data of the floats 564 key vfg subtypes were enriched by functionalized microbubbles from the secondary influent and effluent of mww the results in section 3 1 reveal that the co presence of typical phenotypes relating to flagella motility and adhesion and capsule adhesion and defense was beneficial to the bacteria removal by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs through further investigating the vfgs in the floats derived from the functionalized microbubble treatment the adhesion related vfgs were more frequently detected than the motility related ones in the floats obtained from the secondary influent and effluent fig 3 b and c and to be specific the capsule related vfgs were of significantly greater relative abundance in floats compared with the flagella related ones fig s5 the vfgs responsible of adhesion are crucial for the cell involved interfacial adhesion processes such as biofilm formation and organism infection belas 2014 in the interface dependent treatment with the fe iii modified microbubbles o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs the adhesion related virulence signatures i e capsule type iv pili could tend to attach on the microbubble surface although the vfs of motility contribute to achieving and maintaining the colonization niches of pathogens tercero alburo et al 2014 they also regulate the cells to escape from the harmful stress in the environment typically flagella are extremely effective organelles of locomotion permitting bacteria to achieve speeds exceeding tens of micrometers per second belas 2014 thus the bacteria swimming behaviors might protect the cells from being captured and oxidatively attacked by o3 free ccmbs and o3 ccmbs respectively which decreased the microbubble collection efficiency of vfgs relating to motility notably the abundance of motility related vfgs was lower in the floats derived from the mww secondary effluent than from the mww secondary influent fig 3 b and c the organic content in the raw secondary effluent was lower than that in the raw secondary influent table 1 the improved water quality reduced the resistance of locomotion i e flagella driven swimming such that the bacteria were apt to search for appropriate habitats when the functionalized microbubble treatment was adopted nevertheless the ozone and reactive oxygen species released from o3 ccmbs were capable of initiating the oxidative damage of cell structures responsible of motility for instance the hook and helical filament of flagella could be attacked by reactive oxygen species released by o3 ccmbs which importantly declined the motile activities of cells and facilitated the bubble capture and flotation separation performance this helps to explain the reason why flagella the representative vfgs relating to motility were more abundant in the floats obtained from the o3 ccmb treatment than in those derived from the scenarios without ozone functionalization o3 free ccmbs fig s5 the cell membrane rupture and dna damage resulting from o3 ccmbs also related to the removal of colibactin which was responsible of dna damage induction 3 3 2 membrane related antibiotic resistance mechanisms actively participating functionalized microbubble treatment the pathogens confer antibiotic resistance are more problematic to the health of human and other livings allen et al 2010 hence the performance of functionalized microbubbles should be specifically explored with respect to the arg removal in this work the antibiotic resistance annotation of metagenomics shows totally 483 arg subtypes which could be categorized into 15 types before the functionalized microbubble treatment the relative abundance of args in the secondary effluent of mww was higher than that in the secondary influent fig 4 a though the organic content was apparently decreased after the biochemical processes table 1 indeed the high loadings of organic nutrients and microorganisms as well as the great diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the biochemical units particularly the active sludge promoted the vertical and horizontal transfer of args which increased the antimicrobial resistance in the mww nnadozie et al 2017 therefore the advanced tertiary treatment technologies are essential for arg removal from the practical application viewpoint the functionalized microbubble technology could be a promising alternative for the mww secondary effluent treatment particularly the o3 ccmbs the args that were collected by functionalized microbubbles particularly from secondary influent regulated the bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam peptide fluoroquinolone nitroimidazole nitrofuran fosfomycin aminocoumarin elfamycin and multidrug fig 4 a as mentioned above the surface modifier of fe iii coagulant the intrinsic organic matter in the mww as well as the oxidative agent of ozone could be the important contributors of capturing and damaging arb and cell free floating args from the raw secondary influent for the functionalized microbubble treatment of the mww secondary effluent the removal of genes responsible of resistance to macrolide glycopeptide mupirocin and other antibiotics were effective and the performance of o3 ccmbs was also better than that of o3 free ccmbs the leading antibiotic resistance mechanisms include antibiotic efflux reduced permeability to antibiotic antibiotic inactivation as well as alternation protection and replacement of antibiotic targets allen et al 2010 it is worth noting that after the o3 free ccmb and o3 ccmb treatment the args relating to the antibiotic efflux mechanism were well enriched in floats fig 4 b the membrane related antibiotic mechanisms i e antibiotic efflux and reduced permeability to antibiotics ought to be important for the cell membrane involved the interfacial since the relative args in floats were mostly shared compared with other args fig 4 b the functional protein or glycoprotein molecules on the cell membrane could participate in the cell capture by positively charged microbubbles via electrostatic attraction and were thus susceptible to injury caused by ozone and other reactive oxygen species 3 4 dissemination inhibition of harmful bacteria by functionalized microbubbles after being discharged the effluent of tertiary or advanced treatment may go through a long transportation in the surface water system hence the potential of microbial growth in the effluent of functionalized microbubble process should be assessed in terms of microbial proliferation inhibition and the microbial composition the growth of enteric opportunistic pathogens such as e coli enterococcus spp listeria spp and salmonella spp may turn to a viable but non culturable state during the wastewater treatment processes drigo et al 2021 with the low levels of metabolic activity they play the role of seeds in the downstream receiving water of the treated mww and may pose potential ecological risks based on this consideration this study investigated the concentrations of ampicillin resistant cultivable bacteria and overall cultivable bacteria in the microbubble treated water fig 5 a and floats fig 5 b respectively using the 7 day regrowth incubation method drigo et al 2021 day 0 presented the samples prior to the functionalized microbubble treatment the filtrate and the filter residues after the 0 45 Âµm membrane filtration of the raw mww the bi functionalized microbubbles of o3 ccmbs took greater advantages in inactivating bacteria than those only surface modified with fe iii coagulant o3 free ccmbs o3 ccmbs not only captured and separated bacteria but also released ozone and other reactive oxygen species which ruptured the membrane of cells collected on the bubble surface and inhibited their regrowth the higher inactivation efficacy of bacteria including antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria was then achieved compared with the regular flotation oxidation and disinfection processes for the real wastewater the microbiome sequencing deepened the knowledge of residual harmful bacteria i e arb pathogens composition after the functionalized microbubble treatment in the effluent of o3 free ccmb or o3 ccmb treatment the proportions of pathogens and animal parasites or symbionts were largely decreased whereas those of bacteria responsible of aerobic chemoheterotrophy and fermentation were increased fig 5 c it has been reported that the traditional tertiary treatment processes of mww particularly such as uv disinfection were able to reduce the concentrations of some args vfgs and potential pathogens however promoting the relative abundance of total args consequently those traditional methods failed in depleting the potential microbial risks due to the bacterial regrowth and horizontal gene transfer in the receiving water jia et al 2023 to achieve a balance between chemical and microbial risk reduction the functionalized microbubbles particularly the surface and core functionalized o3 ccmbs may be introduced as reliable tertiary treatment means following the mww secondary units for hampering the dissemination of pathogenic bacteria 4 conclusions and environmental implications the fe iii surface modification endowed the microbubbles with robust capacity of capturing and separating the antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria from water and further encapsulating ozone into microbubbles resulted in the effective cell inactivation and dissemination inhibition through rupturing membrane and breaking dna molecules for the highly interface dependent treatment process fig 6 the viscous virulence phenotype responsible of adhesion i e capsule pili and flagella facilitated the attachment onto the surface functionalized microbubbles differently the vfs relating to motility typically flagella probably protected the bacteria from capture and oxidative attack by means of locomotion however once the structure of flagella was damaged by o3 ccmbs flagella would then play the role of adhesin and promote the cell capture the protein or glycoprotein molecules responsible of antibiotic efflux were beneficial to cell collection by positively charged microbubbles via electrostatic attraction and thus were susceptible to injury caused by o3 ccmbs thus the relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms were vulnerable to the functionalized microbubble treatment for the mww treatment the bacteria in the secondary effluent could be more efficiently inactivated by o3 ccmbs than those in the secondary influent since the high organic content in the latter would compete with bacteria for the reactive oxygen species hence o3 ccmbs were recommended as tertiary treatment of mww for removing potential pathogens and arb in the practical application this study provides insights into the virulence signatures including antibiotic resistance relating to surface properties or structures of cell membrane for the significant impact on the interface dependent behaviors of functionalized microbubbles 5 author contributions m z conceived the experiments

14651,the attenuation characteristics of ppcps play an important part in predicting their environmental concentrations however considerable uncertainty remains in reported laboratory data on the attenuation characteristics of ppcps in this analysis we compile information on laboratory observed photodegradation half lives t1 2 biodegradation t1 2 the organic carbon normalized adsorption constant koc and field observed overall attenuation t1 2 for ppcps in water bodies from more than 200 peer reviewed studies to mitigate the effects of such uncertainty we derive representative values rv for ppcp degradability from these records to better compare the characteristics of different ppcps we further examine the influence of experimental conditions and environmental drivers on the determination of t1 2 using difference analysis and correlation analysis the results indicate that for laboratory photodegradation tests different light sources initial concentration and volume significantly affect t1 2 whereas there is no significant difference between values obtained from tests conducted in pure water and natural water for biodegradation laboratory measured t1 2 values in batch flume and column studies gradually decrease marking the controlling role of experimental setup redox condition initial concentration and volume are also recognized as important influencing factors for adsorption water sediment ratio is the primary reaction parameter as two frequently investigated factors however ph and temperature are not significant factors in almost all cases in field observations the persistence of carbamazepine typically used as a tracer is in doubt water depth and latitude are the most correlated drivers of t1 2 indicating the predominant status of photodegradation in the overall attenuation rates these findings call for caution when selecting experimental parameters and environmental drivers in determining ppcp s attenuation rates and establishing ppcp fate models in the field graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ppcps attenuation in water half life data compilation 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps including antibiotics anti inflammatory agents psychotropic drugs antivirals hormones fragrances uv filters etc have emerged as a new threat to the ecology these substances are constantly released into natural water bodies mainly through effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps resulting in concentrations ranging from ng Î¼g l lu et al 2023 kolpin et al 2002 these levels have been shown to be potentially harmful altering the microbial community structures elevating levels of resistance gene and impacting the health of aquatic organisms sengar and vijayanandan 2022 liu et al 2020 khetan and collins 2007 it is therefore necessary to understand the presence and fate of ppcps in the aquatic systems after being discharged ppcps undergo photodegradation biodegradation and adsorption to sediments leading to attenuation in their concentrations making it more complicated to predict their concentrations in field conditions the attenuation process is often assumed to follow the pseudo first order kinetics and the attenuation rates can be expressed using first order rate constants k or more intuitively attenuation half lives t1 2 although this parameter is generally considered less influential than hydrological conditions and emission factors it has been incorporated into predicted environmental concentration models and recognized as a sensitive variable kehrein et al 2015 robinson et al 2007 hanamoto et al 2013 by inquiring into comparisons between measurement data and modeling results robinson et al found that predicted environmental concentrations were significantly reduced with subtle consideration of the attenuation of sunlight intensity robinson et al 2007 alder et al pointed out that the ignorance of indirect photolysis and biodegradation process could result in overestimation of simulated concentrations and suggested that more accurate attenuation coefficients be acquired especially for rivers or lakes with long residence time alder et al 2010 improving the accuracy of predicted concentrations in the water phase requires a better dataset of attenuation characteristics of ppcps which consumes labor and time however there are several challenges when extrapolating the laboratory measured t1 2 to the field one issue is the significant uncertainty associated with laboratory measured t1 2 data data reported from different laboratories can vary over several magnitudes greskowiak et al 2017 which can be attributed to the incompletely standardized experimental procedures while international regulatory frameworks for standardized chemical testing have been developed such as oecd guidelines including no 308 no 309 and no 316 researchers have reported that they still have some defects in theory and practice radke and maier 2014 coll et al 2020 shrestha et al 2016 kowalczyk et al 2015 for example the static batch experiments for suspended sediment tests in no 308 can cause continuous substance exchange between compartments and unintentional anaerobic conditions in the deep layer both leading to uninterpretable fluctuations of the measured dissipation rates honti and fenner 2015 bowmer et al 2004 shrestha et al observed great difference for results derived from oecd 308 tests oecd 309 tests and their modified versions indicating that refinement is demanded to improve the robustness of the test shrestha et al 2016 in addition the regularity of some essential experimental parameters such as initial concentration reaction volume and water sediment ratio is absent and to what degree these parameters influence the experiment outcomes is still not clear another issue is that there are numerous environmental drivers that can significantly impact attenuation rates in the field these drivers vary widely over time and space including seasons weather patterns hydrological parameters and water quality parameters identifying the governing drivers that contribute the most to observed attenuation rates is a complex issue that requires further discussion acuna et al 2015 one approach to dealing with the above questions is to examine the patterns of existing experimental data with these questions in mind we assemble the photodegradation biodegradation adsorption and field attenuation data and their corresponding reaction conditions from more than 200 related studies for the purpose of a visualizing the uncertainty of existing ppcp attenuation t1 2 data and ranking the degradability of ppcps b revealing the significance of environmental laboratory parameters on ppcp attenuation rates and reminding the researchers to be cautious about certain ones c correlating the potential drivers with field observed t1 2 values and figuring out the most important variables when a fate prediction model is being established it is important to note that this study is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental fate of ppcps instead it is focused on analyzing the attenuation characteristics of selected ppcps by compiling data from multiple studies this approach can offer a more comprehensive understanding of how these compounds behave in the environment compared to relying on the results of a single study additionally the study can also provide insights into how to improve testing for the degradability of ppcps in water bodies 2 methods 2 1 literature search and data selection literature search is conducted via google scholar with key words of ppcp degradation fate for field observations ppcp photolysis photodegradation for photolysis ppcp biodegradation river sediment for biodegradation as well as ppcp sorption sediment for adsorption the field observed laboratory measured photodegradation and biodegradation rates are quantified using half lives t1 2 the organic carbon normalized adsorption constants koc l kg 1 are used to describe the adsorption behavior of ppcps which is calculated as the solid water distribution coefficients kd l kg 1 divided by the organic carbon fraction foc martinez hernandez et al 2014 in the cases of field observation data are collected fulfilling the following criteria 1 the paper should be peer reviewed original research 2 the reaction must obey the pseudo first order kinetics and rate constants or t1 2 values are directly provided or can be derived from given information 3 the observation must be targeted at natural water bodies involving rivers including bank filtration lakes estuarine or coastal water wetland water groundwater or wwtp effluent impacted rivers other than high concentration wastewater details of data collection criteria for photodegradation t1 2 biodegradation t1 2 and koc are described in text s1 in the end we collected 421 photodegradation t1 2 records from 96 references 835 biodegradation t1 2 records from 71 references 354 adsorption koc values from 45 references and 271 field observed t1 2 records from 22 field studies the pristine records are presented in appendix b tables s2 s5 2 2 data analysis the kernel density estimation kde method is employed to examine the distribution of data for each ppcp in each process including photodegradation biodegradation adsorption and field attenuation the kde method enables the identification of the maximum probability density in a kde curve for data collections with more than two records this maximum value is called the representative value rv which represents the data collection as a whole for collections with only two records the rv is defined as the mean value of the records if there is only one record the rv is the record itself the reason for defining rv in this study is because it is derived from a comprehensive collection of literature which enables us to gain a more objective and thorough understanding of the fate of a ppcp to determine the significance of experimental conditions or environmental drivers difference analysis and correlation analysis are carried out and the data preprocessing method is described in appendix a text s1 as the data did not align with either normal distribution or lognormal distribution a t test was not applicable for difference analysis instead mann whitney u test is conducted via spss 27 0 1 for continuous variables a scatter plot of p values versus different values as breakpoints of two groups are displayed for correlation analysis pearson correlation coefficient r and spearman rank correlation coefficients Ï accompanied with the corresponding significance levels p are calculated to identify the correlation of attenuation rates with potential drivers 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory measured photodegradation rates for ppcps fig 1 displays the logarithms of all photodegradation t1 2 values through violin plots accompanied by scatters it appears that the measured values can comprise a broad range over several orders of magnitude for instance the half lives for diclofenac are from 0 056 to 24 2 h and for ibuprofen the value even ranged from 3 to 12 000 h since the wide range of laboratory measured data comparing values from only two documents can be misleading when evaluating ppcp s photostability instead the evaluation of photostability based on rv follows a convincing sequence considering the current knowledge of reaction mechanism as illustrated in fig 1 among the 33 ppcps ketoprofen is the most photolabile one with a rv value of 0 017 h following ketoprofen are three fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines which are all known as photosensitive compounds with absorption spectra that largely overlap with the irradiation spectrum of natural sunlight yang et al 2021 wei et al 2019 high direct photolysis quantum yield hauer and lamberti 2017 szabo et al 2011 pereira et al 2007 and the ability to produce reactive species through their triplet states including singlet oxygen and superoxide radical albini and monti 2003 chen et al 2008 ofloxacin compared to other fluoroquinolones is more photo stable due to its 10 times lower quantum yield than norfloxacin and enrofloxacin wammer et al 2013 this is also in accordance with the photostability sequence arranged by rv conversely some ppcps known as photo stable such as carbamazepine trimethoprim and venlafaxine de laurentiis et al 2012 glaser et al 2020 luo et al 2012 are also discerned however we should keep in mind that the rv based on a larger sample size is supposed to be more reliable to represent the degradability of ppcp additionally it is pointless to argue debate on the specific rank of two closely sequenced ppcps initially correlation analysis was conducted to determine the influence of experimental conditions however as shown in appendix a fig s1 none of the selected conditions displayed a strong correlation with t1 2 this is likely an indication that the measured values from various studies are not highly consistent with each other to explore whether discrepant measured t1 2 values can be attributed to different experimental conditions a difference analysis are conducted the resulting findings are presented in fig 2 light source is a considerable influencing factor the t1 2 values measured under natural sunlight are observably longer than under simulated sunlight p 0 001 this distinction implies the possibility of overestimating the photolysis rates under simulated sunlight however the water matrix used does not significantly impact on the measured t1 2 p 0 501 indicating that the effect of water matrix on photodegradation may not have been emphasized in previous studies as an important part of water matrix effect the light absorption of dom can be described by an empirical formula proposed by bodrato and vione 2014 aÎ» 0 45 doc d e 0 015Î» where aÎ» is the absorption of dom at wavelength Î» and d is the depth of water column this formula indicates that the effect of dom is highly dependent on water depth this finding serves as a reminder that laboratory tests conducted with shallow water depths of only a few centimeters may significantly differ from outcomes found in natural surface water where depths can reach several meters the absence of water matrix effect warns us to be take caution when we use laboratory obtained parameters to assess the photolability of molecules in the environment initial concentration is also a crucial factor that affects the determination of photodegradation t1 2 as p values are less than 0 05 for most breakpoints between 10 1000 Î¼g l 1 fig 2c according to oecd guideline no 316 optically dilute solutions absorbance 0 02 for Î» 290 nm usually of concentrations lower than 10 4 mol l 1 is recommended for the test no 316 2008 high concentrations can cause deviations from natural conditions and lead to failure of pseudo first order kinetic assumptions see explanations in appendix a text s2 notably it is observed that reaction solutions with smaller volumes demonstrate higher degradation rates which emphasizes the possibility of an underrated effect of volume on experimental results for example in the case of tetracycline wherein the test is executed in pure water and at an initial concentration of 10 5 m the light irradiance at Î» 300 nm absorbed by the chemical in a 1 cm water column per volume is 50 higher than that in a 5 cm water column and even 1 3 times higher than that in a 10 cm water column as outlined in appendix a text s2 however it is imperative to note that the oecd discipline does not specify the reaction volume no 316 2008 therefore we suggest enhancements in the governing protocols to consider the impact of reaction volume additionally it should be pointed out that when measuring quantum yields the absorption of an actinometer must be calculated while taking water depth into consideration furthermore even if the volume is regulated in the laboratory experiments it remains drastically different from the natural environment giving rise to doubt on the reliability of laboratory tests to assess the photolability of chemicals in natural surface waters unlike the reaction volume ph and temperature which have been substantiated as important factors in specific studies boreen et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 jin et al 2017 actually cause little discrepancy on the experimental results fig 2e f probably because their effects are concealed by other more significant factors 3 2 laboratory measured biodegradation rates for ppcps according to the data compilation and ranking of biodegradability for ppcps fig 3 fluoxetine paracetamol estradiol caffeine venlafaxine ibuprofen and Î² blockers are recognized as the most biodegradable ppcps while triclosan clofibric acid and carbamazepine exhibit highest resistance to biodegradation this sequence is supported by various field observations for instance it has been identified that biodegradation dominates the attenuation process of venlafaxine glaser et al 2020 guillet et al 2019 and metoprolol jasper et al 2014 2019 with their constant enantiomer fraction variation making them ideal for assessing the fraction of biological attenuation kunkel and radke 2012 li et al 2013 for carbamazepine laboratory studies also demonstrate that biodegradation contributes little to its dissipation martinez hernandez et al 2016 structural features such as functional groups have been found to be closely linked to the biodegradability of chemicals mainly through steric electrostatic and polar effects bertelkamp et al 2014 compounds with hydroxyl carboxylic and carbonyl groups tend to be more biodegradable while amines halogens ring structures aliphatic ethers and sulfur will decrease biodegradability bertelkamp et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2016 okey and stensel 1996 however the number of functional groups appendix a table s6 does not always agree with the observed biodegradability trend indicating the need for more thorough structure activity relationship studies the accuracy and validity of biodegradation tests are heavily reliant on the experimental conditions including the experimental setups redox conditions initial concentration volume ph and temperature the experimental setups which may include batch flume and column experiments can significantly affect the results obtained firstly column experiments tend to demonstrate faster biodegradation than batch or flume tanks fig 4 a due to better microbial adaption less accumulation of metabolic waste or faster dissolved oxygen consumption in a column driver et al 2017 de wilt et al 2018 greskowiak et al 2017 secondly biodegradation rates in flumes are significantly higher than in batch experiments because the flume facilitates the potential for exchange of surface and pore water xu et al 2009 kunkel and radke 2008 which is a determining factor for biodegradation rates whereas a quiescent system can trigger anaerobic conditions zhou and broodbank 2014 as a result it is important to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of batch experiments which are currently recommended in oecd guidelines in accurately simulating biodegradation processes in contrast to experimental setups the choice between pelagic test water solely or suspended sediment test a certain proportion of water and sediment does not significantly affect the experimental outcomes fig 4b this finding however contradicts previous research conclusions which have suggested that the mixture of water and sediment greatly facilitates biodegradation compared with isolated surface water bradley et al 2009 jasper et al 2014 the underlying reasons for these conflicting results remain unclear redox condition is also identified as an important influencing factor as demonstrated in previous studies barbieri et al 2011 de wilt et al 2018 in this study all records are simply split into aerobic tests or anaerobic tests to examine the importance of redox conditions and it turns out that the biodegradation t1 2 are significantly longer under anaerobic conditions fig 4c in light of this we recommend periodically checking the oxygen levels of the system to regulate and sustain the desired redox conditions according to oecd 309 guideline no 309 2004 low initial concentration 1 100 Î¼g ml 1 should be used to ensure that the target substance serves as a secondary substrate and the degradation process follows non growth kinetics which approximates to the first order kinetics this also ensures the avoidance of any severe toxic effects li et al 2013 however in contrast to this guideline a considerable amount of studies reports initial concentration exceeding 100 Î¼g ml 1 in fig 4d for most of the breakpoints the consequent two groups are significantly different and lower initial concentration correspond to lower biodegradation rates emphasizing the importance of controlling the applied initial concentration similar with photodegradation the volume of tests the sum of sediment and water has been hugely neglected in previous studies but has been identified as a key factor that leads to division of data into two distinct groups fig 4e a high volume infers a high abundance and diversity of microorganisms as well as more nutrients and carbon source which can significantly enhance the biodegradation process nevertheless ph and temperature do not usually play a role in distinguishing the dataset fig 4f and g although they have been vastly proved as essential factors in biodegradation test goss et al 2020 jasper et al 2014 abdelrady et al 2019 li et al 2021 3 3 laboratory measured adsorption rates for ppcps the rvs for adsorption coefficient koc exhibited a broad range spanning over four orders of magnitude with values ranging from 5 2 to 22 314 2 as indicated in fig 5 fluoxetine is identified as the most retained ppcps in sediments with koc ranging from 80 to 105 670 l kg 1 rv 22 314 l kg 1 which has been observed to attenuate rapidly in river attributed to adsorption writer et al 2013 additionally the four fluoroquinolones showed relatively high koc values which can be ascribed to data from liu et al 2019b and kafaei et al 2018 studies and also agrees with previous studies baginska et al 2015 xu et al 2009 in contrast three sulfonamides exhibit low koc and their attenuation in hyporheic zone was observed to be slow because of weak adsorption liu et al 2019b attempts are made to correlate the adsorption behaviors of ppcps with their octanol water partition coefficient kow or the predicted values p appendix a table s1 unfortunately the rank of logkow or logp displays no correlation with the rank of logkoc Ï 0 19 possibly because electrostatic interactions should also be considered especially for ionized ppcp compounds martinez hernandez et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2009 based on the outcomes of difference analysis it speculatively appears that water sediment ratio can be a controlling factor on the test results as can be observed from fig 6 a a higher content of sediment resulted in higher recorded koc values therefore it is recommended that the water sediment ratio should be explicitly stated and set as close to the real world situation as possible though the adsorption of ionized ppcps is influenced by the ph liu et al 2019a niedbala et al 2013 our difference analysis does not show any notable effect of ph on results fig 6b similarly temperature is not capable of clearly distinguishing the laboratory results fig 6c the lack of significance for ph and temperature in experimental results may be probably due to the fact that these conditions are not strictly controlled during the entire test period 3 4 field observed ppcp attenuation rates for ppcps to visualize the overall degradability of ppcps in the field we assemble 271 pieces of field observed t1 2 data involving 73 ppcps and present them in a violin diagram fig 7 the field observed t1 2 values for ketoprofen ibuprofen naproxen triclosan and paracetamol are ranked as the shortest ones with rv of 0 88 1 70 h conversely the rvs for tramadol sulfadiazine and metformin are over 2 times higher than the rvs for their lower side neighbors 156 173 h rendering them the most recalcitrant compounds nevertheless we must acknowledge that the uneven distribution of sample size for each ppcp might generate significant uncertainty in the ranking results it is worth noting that even though carbamazepine is recognized as persistent and frequently used as a reference compound for tracer studies in natural aquatic systems kunkel and radke 2012 schaper et al 2018 guillet et al 2019 this study has identified it as moderately degradable based on 20 records from 10 field studies this finding underscores the need for extreme caution when carbamazepine is employed as a reference compound in specific conditions the extrapolation of laboratory based knowledge to field investigations is a well known and pervasive challenge in scientific research a significant issue is the spatiotemporal fluctuations of environmental factors including but not limited to river morphology climate weather biotic community and the kaleidoscopic chemical properties of ppcps themselves as thoroughly discussed in literature kunkel and radke 2011 despite these obstacles assembling datasets of current knowledge provides valuable insight into the relative importance of environmental drivers this study conducts a correlation analysis between 31 environmental drivers and the corresponding field observed t1 2 to assess their relationships the results are presented in fig 8 3 4 1 chemical properties of ppcps although the chemical properties of ppcps are known to dictate their attenuation rates few studies have statistically assessed their correlations through our data analysis we find a weak relationship between the observed attenuation rates and only two chemical properties of ppcps logkow and pka2 r or Ï 0 3 which demonstrated that sorption to sediments dominated by polar interactions and electrostatic effects is a vital behavior in the reduction of ppcps along a river this finding however contradicts li et al s field study where no significant relationships are found between attenuation rates and ppcps pka and logdow in four european rivers li et al 2016 one explanation is that these weak correlations are ascribed to data from certain research acuna et al 2015 writer et al 2013 additionally initial concentration has absolutely no correlation with t1 2 as the initial concentrations in field studies are low enough at ng l 1 and the concentration effect is indiscernible 3 4 2 hydraulic parameters the hydrological conditions in different river sites significantly impact the presence and fate of the conveying micropollutants osorio et al 2012 as shown in fig 8 we observe weak positive correlations between travel time as well as river length and t1 2 for which the reason is unknown yet lower flow rate increases the attenuation rates due to longer hydraulic residence time osorio et al 2012 which agrees with the weak positive correlation between flow rate and t1 2 velocity hydraulic radius and cross section area however show no relationships with t1 2 of all the drivers considered water depth is the most statistically significant with a positive pearson coefficient of 0 66 p 0 001 in natural water sunlight is often absorbed by chromophores and reflected by suspended particles before reaching the target chemicals schwarzenbach et al 2016 hence water depth is an essential factor that controls the decay of sunlight bartels and von tumpling 2007 mathon et al observed an average of 75 increase of t1 2 for 23 chemicals in 30 cm water depth than in 10 cm mathon et al 2019 similarly zhou et al recognized that the modeled photodegradation t1 2 for sulfamethoxazole was more than 30 times longer if the variation of time and water depth was taken into consideration zhou et al 2018 the depletion of water resources leads to a thinner water column and may enhance phototransformation processes which warrants attention due to the escalating climate change vione and scozzaro 2019 vione et al 2018 the hyporheic zone is a vibrant bioreactor due to its diverse microflora and large reactive surface areas schaper et al 2018 evidence suggests that even short river segments can benefit from this unique feature of the hyporheic zone which increases the ppcp attenuation rates jaeger et al 2019 kunkel and radke 2012 schaper et al 2018 li et al 2016 rutere et al 2020 however the contribution of hyporheic zone could be less substantial in some cases because of the limited fraction of transient storage in total flow glaser et al 2020 writer et al 2012 in our dataset several studies provide direct information regarding the transit storage zone area and no significant correlations are found it is worth noting that the positive correlation of river width r 0 58 p 0 001 may be linked to the effect of hyporheic exchange since wider rivers present a higher proportion of hyporheic zone flow in the overall flow 3 4 3 seasonality the variation of seasons impacts chemicals attenuation rates by influencing a series of environmental conditions such as temperature solar irradiation vegetation and redox conditions zou et al 2015 many researchers observed higher attenuation rates in warm seasons summer than in cold seasons winter in either rivers or wetlands daneshvar et al 2010 matamoros and rodriguez 2017 nuel et al 2018 mathon et al 2019 rÃ¼hmland et al 2015 zou et al 2015 although the season has been described to significantly affect the monitored attenuation rates the correlation is weak in the assembled data set so is the temperature conversely sunlight irradiation is fairly correlated with t1 2 Ï 0 63 p 0 038 as well as latitude Ï 0 42 p 0 001 this underscores the critical role that photodegradation plays in the overall attenuation rates of chemicals in the field 3 4 4 water quality the water quality parameters including ph dissolved oxygen do conductivity turbidity and contents of nutrients ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen cl tp cod and doc etc show high variability at spatial and temporal scales the results of previous studies suggest that water quality plays an essential role in determining the fate of ppcps for example vione et al modelled the photochemical fate of pharmaceuticals in river water pointing out that the effects of doc water depth and solar irradiance were almost equally important vione et al 2018 based on our assembled dataset ph r 0 21 p 0 003 and do r 0 26 p 0 004 have weak correlations with t1 2 whereas no correlation is found for conductivity ammonia nitrogen and cod nitrate nitrogen is positively correlated with t1 2 with r 0 38 p 0 012 and Ï 0 68 p 0 001 as well as cl r 0 38 p 0 018 while total phosphorus tp is negatively correlated with t1 2 with r 0 60 p 0 001 and Ï 0 46 p 0 008 however this result may not be of good generality because most of the nitrate nitrogen and tp records are from one single research acuna et al 2015 in acuÃ±a et al s study the correlation between 13 water quality parameters in 4 river segments and k was analyzed and it is noteworthy that soluble reactive phosphorus srp was tightly associated with the pharmaceuticals attenuation indicating that p dynamics processes might be involved or correlated acuna et al 2015 remarkably higher doc leads to significantly longer attenuation t1 2 Ï 0 46 p 0 001 probably because of the corresponding higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom which have been observed to drag the attenuation process due to its light screening effect or antioxidant properties yang et al 2017 luo et al 2011 additionally the weak negative correlation of turbidity Ï 0 22 p 0 009 may suggest a higher tendency of adsorption when higher levels of suspended solids are present however further research is necessary to substantiate this supposition 5 conclusions the degradation orders of ppcps determined by rv provide us with more credible information on their attenuation characteristics and confirm the uniqueness of certain ppcps for instance the vulnerability to photodegradation of ketoprofen is supported by multiple sources of data correlating reaction condition parameters with the measured t1 2 values helps us understand how degradation rates are affected by the experimental conditions and environmental drivers some experimental parameters like light source for photodegradation experimental setup and redox condition for biodegradation and water sediment ratio for adsorption are confirmed to have significant influence on the determination of t1 2 whereas the role of initial concentration and reaction volume may have been underestimated when glancing over the results of this study we should keep in mind that the reliability of the above outcomes is restricted by sample size so more degradability tests especially field observations are called for even though significant influencing factors are qualitatively identified the failure of correlation test between t1 2 and most of the parameters demonstrates that there is a huge gap between the present knowledge and quantitative relationships for the prediction of ppcp environmental concentrations it is recommended to use the probabilistic models and consider the input degradation rates as a random range declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

14651,the attenuation characteristics of ppcps play an important part in predicting their environmental concentrations however considerable uncertainty remains in reported laboratory data on the attenuation characteristics of ppcps in this analysis we compile information on laboratory observed photodegradation half lives t1 2 biodegradation t1 2 the organic carbon normalized adsorption constant koc and field observed overall attenuation t1 2 for ppcps in water bodies from more than 200 peer reviewed studies to mitigate the effects of such uncertainty we derive representative values rv for ppcp degradability from these records to better compare the characteristics of different ppcps we further examine the influence of experimental conditions and environmental drivers on the determination of t1 2 using difference analysis and correlation analysis the results indicate that for laboratory photodegradation tests different light sources initial concentration and volume significantly affect t1 2 whereas there is no significant difference between values obtained from tests conducted in pure water and natural water for biodegradation laboratory measured t1 2 values in batch flume and column studies gradually decrease marking the controlling role of experimental setup redox condition initial concentration and volume are also recognized as important influencing factors for adsorption water sediment ratio is the primary reaction parameter as two frequently investigated factors however ph and temperature are not significant factors in almost all cases in field observations the persistence of carbamazepine typically used as a tracer is in doubt water depth and latitude are the most correlated drivers of t1 2 indicating the predominant status of photodegradation in the overall attenuation rates these findings call for caution when selecting experimental parameters and environmental drivers in determining ppcp s attenuation rates and establishing ppcp fate models in the field graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ppcps attenuation in water half life data compilation 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps including antibiotics anti inflammatory agents psychotropic drugs antivirals hormones fragrances uv filters etc have emerged as a new threat to the ecology these substances are constantly released into natural water bodies mainly through effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps resulting in concentrations ranging from ng Î¼g l lu et al 2023 kolpin et al 2002 these levels have been shown to be potentially harmful altering the microbial community structures elevating levels of resistance gene and impacting the health of aquatic organisms sengar and vijayanandan 2022 liu et al 2020 khetan and collins 2007 it is therefore necessary to understand the presence and fate of ppcps in the aquatic systems after being discharged ppcps undergo photodegradation biodegradation and adsorption to sediments leading to attenuation in their concentrations making it more complicated to predict their concentrations in field conditions the attenuation process is often assumed to follow the pseudo first order kinetics and the attenuation rates can be expressed using first order rate constants k or more intuitively attenuation half lives t1 2 although this parameter is generally considered less influential than hydrological conditions and emission factors it has been incorporated into predicted environmental concentration models and recognized as a sensitive variable kehrein et al 2015 robinson et al 2007 hanamoto et al 2013 by inquiring into comparisons between measurement data and modeling results robinson et al found that predicted environmental concentrations were significantly reduced with subtle consideration of the attenuation of sunlight intensity robinson et al 2007 alder et al pointed out that the ignorance of indirect photolysis and biodegradation process could result in overestimation of simulated concentrations and suggested that more accurate attenuation coefficients be acquired especially for rivers or lakes with long residence time alder et al 2010 improving the accuracy of predicted concentrations in the water phase requires a better dataset of attenuation characteristics of ppcps which consumes labor and time however there are several challenges when extrapolating the laboratory measured t1 2 to the field one issue is the significant uncertainty associated with laboratory measured t1 2 data data reported from different laboratories can vary over several magnitudes greskowiak et al 2017 which can be attributed to the incompletely standardized experimental procedures while international regulatory frameworks for standardized chemical testing have been developed such as oecd guidelines including no 308 no 309 and no 316 researchers have reported that they still have some defects in theory and practice radke and maier 2014 coll et al 2020 shrestha et al 2016 kowalczyk et al 2015 for example the static batch experiments for suspended sediment tests in no 308 can cause continuous substance exchange between compartments and unintentional anaerobic conditions in the deep layer both leading to uninterpretable fluctuations of the measured dissipation rates honti and fenner 2015 bowmer et al 2004 shrestha et al observed great difference for results derived from oecd 308 tests oecd 309 tests and their modified versions indicating that refinement is demanded to improve the robustness of the test shrestha et al 2016 in addition the regularity of some essential experimental parameters such as initial concentration reaction volume and water sediment ratio is absent and to what degree these parameters influence the experiment outcomes is still not clear another issue is that there are numerous environmental drivers that can significantly impact attenuation rates in the field these drivers vary widely over time and space including seasons weather patterns hydrological parameters and water quality parameters identifying the governing drivers that contribute the most to observed attenuation rates is a complex issue that requires further discussion acuna et al 2015 one approach to dealing with the above questions is to examine the patterns of existing experimental data with these questions in mind we assemble the photodegradation biodegradation adsorption and field attenuation data and their corresponding reaction conditions from more than 200 related studies for the purpose of a visualizing the uncertainty of existing ppcp attenuation t1 2 data and ranking the degradability of ppcps b revealing the significance of environmental laboratory parameters on ppcp attenuation rates and reminding the researchers to be cautious about certain ones c correlating the potential drivers with field observed t1 2 values and figuring out the most important variables when a fate prediction model is being established it is important to note that this study is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental fate of ppcps instead it is focused on analyzing the attenuation characteristics of selected ppcps by compiling data from multiple studies this approach can offer a more comprehensive understanding of how these compounds behave in the environment compared to relying on the results of a single study additionally the study can also provide insights into how to improve testing for the degradability of ppcps in water bodies 2 methods 2 1 literature search and data selection literature search is conducted via google scholar with key words of ppcp degradation fate for field observations ppcp photolysis photodegradation for photolysis ppcp biodegradation river sediment for biodegradation as well as ppcp sorption sediment for adsorption the field observed laboratory measured photodegradation and biodegradation rates are quantified using half lives t1 2 the organic carbon normalized adsorption constants koc l kg 1 are used to describe the adsorption behavior of ppcps which is calculated as the solid water distribution coefficients kd l kg 1 divided by the organic carbon fraction foc martinez hernandez et al 2014 in the cases of field observation data are collected fulfilling the following criteria 1 the paper should be peer reviewed original research 2 the reaction must obey the pseudo first order kinetics and rate constants or t1 2 values are directly provided or can be derived from given information 3 the observation must be targeted at natural water bodies involving rivers including bank filtration lakes estuarine or coastal water wetland water groundwater or wwtp effluent impacted rivers other than high concentration wastewater details of data collection criteria for photodegradation t1 2 biodegradation t1 2 and koc are described in text s1 in the end we collected 421 photodegradation t1 2 records from 96 references 835 biodegradation t1 2 records from 71 references 354 adsorption koc values from 45 references and 271 field observed t1 2 records from 22 field studies the pristine records are presented in appendix b tables s2 s5 2 2 data analysis the kernel density estimation kde method is employed to examine the distribution of data for each ppcp in each process including photodegradation biodegradation adsorption and field attenuation the kde method enables the identification of the maximum probability density in a kde curve for data collections with more than two records this maximum value is called the representative value rv which represents the data collection as a whole for collections with only two records the rv is defined as the mean value of the records if there is only one record the rv is the record itself the reason for defining rv in this study is because it is derived from a comprehensive collection of literature which enables us to gain a more objective and thorough understanding of the fate of a ppcp to determine the significance of experimental conditions or environmental drivers difference analysis and correlation analysis are carried out and the data preprocessing method is described in appendix a text s1 as the data did not align with either normal distribution or lognormal distribution a t test was not applicable for difference analysis instead mann whitney u test is conducted via spss 27 0 1 for continuous variables a scatter plot of p values versus different values as breakpoints of two groups are displayed for correlation analysis pearson correlation coefficient r and spearman rank correlation coefficients Ï accompanied with the corresponding significance levels p are calculated to identify the correlation of attenuation rates with potential drivers 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory measured photodegradation rates for ppcps fig 1 displays the logarithms of all photodegradation t1 2 values through violin plots accompanied by scatters it appears that the measured values can comprise a broad range over several orders of magnitude for instance the half lives for diclofenac are from 0 056 to 24 2 h and for ibuprofen the value even ranged from 3 to 12 000 h since the wide range of laboratory measured data comparing values from only two documents can be misleading when evaluating ppcp s photostability instead the evaluation of photostability based on rv follows a convincing sequence considering the current knowledge of reaction mechanism as illustrated in fig 1 among the 33 ppcps ketoprofen is the most photolabile one with a rv value of 0 017 h following ketoprofen are three fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines which are all known as photosensitive compounds with absorption spectra that largely overlap with the irradiation spectrum of natural sunlight yang et al 2021 wei et al 2019 high direct photolysis quantum yield hauer and lamberti 2017 szabo et al 2011 pereira et al 2007 and the ability to produce reactive species through their triplet states including singlet oxygen and superoxide radical albini and monti 2003 chen et al 2008 ofloxacin compared to other fluoroquinolones is more photo stable due to its 10 times lower quantum yield than norfloxacin and enrofloxacin wammer et al 2013 this is also in accordance with the photostability sequence arranged by rv conversely some ppcps known as photo stable such as carbamazepine trimethoprim and venlafaxine de laurentiis et al 2012 glaser et al 2020 luo et al 2012 are also discerned however we should keep in mind that the rv based on a larger sample size is supposed to be more reliable to represent the degradability of ppcp additionally it is pointless to argue debate on the specific rank of two closely sequenced ppcps initially correlation analysis was conducted to determine the influence of experimental conditions however as shown in appendix a fig s1 none of the selected conditions displayed a strong correlation with t1 2 this is likely an indication that the measured values from various studies are not highly consistent with each other to explore whether discrepant measured t1 2 values can be attributed to different experimental conditions a difference analysis are conducted the resulting findings are presented in fig 2 light source is a considerable influencing factor the t1 2 values measured under natural sunlight are observably longer than under simulated sunlight p 0 001 this distinction implies the possibility of overestimating the photolysis rates under simulated sunlight however the water matrix used does not significantly impact on the measured t1 2 p 0 501 indicating that the effect of water matrix on photodegradation may not have been emphasized in previous studies as an important part of water matrix effect the light absorption of dom can be described by an empirical formula proposed by bodrato and vione 2014 aÎ» 0 45 doc d e 0 015Î» where aÎ» is the absorption of dom at wavelength Î» and d is the depth of water column this formula indicates that the effect of dom is highly dependent on water depth this finding serves as a reminder that laboratory tests conducted with shallow water depths of only a few centimeters may significantly differ from outcomes found in natural surface water where depths can reach several meters the absence of water matrix effect warns us to be take caution when we use laboratory obtained parameters to assess the photolability of molecules in the environment initial concentration is also a crucial factor that affects the determination of photodegradation t1 2 as p values are less than 0 05 for most breakpoints between 10 1000 Î¼g l 1 fig 2c according to oecd guideline no 316 optically dilute solutions absorbance 0 02 for Î» 290 nm usually of concentrations lower than 10 4 mol l 1 is recommended for the test no 316 2008 high concentrations can cause deviations from natural conditions and lead to failure of pseudo first order kinetic assumptions see explanations in appendix a text s2 notably it is observed that reaction solutions with smaller volumes demonstrate higher degradation rates which emphasizes the possibility of an underrated effect of volume on experimental results for example in the case of tetracycline wherein the test is executed in pure water and at an initial concentration of 10 5 m the light irradiance at Î» 300 nm absorbed by the chemical in a 1 cm water column per volume is 50 higher than that in a 5 cm water column and even 1 3 times higher than that in a 10 cm water column as outlined in appendix a text s2 however it is imperative to note that the oecd discipline does not specify the reaction volume no 316 2008 therefore we suggest enhancements in the governing protocols to consider the impact of reaction volume additionally it should be pointed out that when measuring quantum yields the absorption of an actinometer must be calculated while taking water depth into consideration furthermore even if the volume is regulated in the laboratory experiments it remains drastically different from the natural environment giving rise to doubt on the reliability of laboratory tests to assess the photolability of chemicals in natural surface waters unlike the reaction volume ph and temperature which have been substantiated as important factors in specific studies boreen et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 jin et al 2017 actually cause little discrepancy on the experimental results fig 2e f probably because their effects are concealed by other more significant factors 3 2 laboratory measured biodegradation rates for ppcps according to the data compilation and ranking of biodegradability for ppcps fig 3 fluoxetine paracetamol estradiol caffeine venlafaxine ibuprofen and Î² blockers are recognized as the most biodegradable ppcps while triclosan clofibric acid and carbamazepine exhibit highest resistance to biodegradation this sequence is supported by various field observations for instance it has been identified that biodegradation dominates the attenuation process of venlafaxine glaser et al 2020 guillet et al 2019 and metoprolol jasper et al 2014 2019 with their constant enantiomer fraction variation making them ideal for assessing the fraction of biological attenuation kunkel and radke 2012 li et al 2013 for carbamazepine laboratory studies also demonstrate that biodegradation contributes little to its dissipation martinez hernandez et al 2016 structural features such as functional groups have been found to be closely linked to the biodegradability of chemicals mainly through steric electrostatic and polar effects bertelkamp et al 2014 compounds with hydroxyl carboxylic and carbonyl groups tend to be more biodegradable while amines halogens ring structures aliphatic ethers and sulfur will decrease biodegradability bertelkamp et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2016 okey and stensel 1996 however the number of functional groups appendix a table s6 does not always agree with the observed biodegradability trend indicating the need for more thorough structure activity relationship studies the accuracy and validity of biodegradation tests are heavily reliant on the experimental conditions including the experimental setups redox conditions initial concentration volume ph and temperature the experimental setups which may include batch flume and column experiments can significantly affect the results obtained firstly column experiments tend to demonstrate faster biodegradation than batch or flume tanks fig 4 a due to better microbial adaption less accumulation of metabolic waste or faster dissolved oxygen consumption in a column driver et al 2017 de wilt et al 2018 greskowiak et al 2017 secondly biodegradation rates in flumes are significantly higher than in batch experiments because the flume facilitates the potential for exchange of surface and pore water xu et al 2009 kunkel and radke 2008 which is a determining factor for biodegradation rates whereas a quiescent system can trigger anaerobic conditions zhou and broodbank 2014 as a result it is important to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of batch experiments which are currently recommended in oecd guidelines in accurately simulating biodegradation processes in contrast to experimental setups the choice between pelagic test water solely or suspended sediment test a certain proportion of water and sediment does not significantly affect the experimental outcomes fig 4b this finding however contradicts previous research conclusions which have suggested that the mixture of water and sediment greatly facilitates biodegradation compared with isolated surface water bradley et al 2009 jasper et al 2014 the underlying reasons for these conflicting results remain unclear redox condition is also identified as an important influencing factor as demonstrated in previous studies barbieri et al 2011 de wilt et al 2018 in this study all records are simply split into aerobic tests or anaerobic tests to examine the importance of redox conditions and it turns out that the biodegradation t1 2 are significantly longer under anaerobic conditions fig 4c in light of this we recommend periodically checking the oxygen levels of the system to regulate and sustain the desired redox conditions according to oecd 309 guideline no 309 2004 low initial concentration 1 100 Î¼g ml 1 should be used to ensure that the target substance serves as a secondary substrate and the degradation process follows non growth kinetics which approximates to the first order kinetics this also ensures the avoidance of any severe toxic effects li et al 2013 however in contrast to this guideline a considerable amount of studies reports initial concentration exceeding 100 Î¼g ml 1 in fig 4d for most of the breakpoints the consequent two groups are significantly different and lower initial concentration correspond to lower biodegradation rates emphasizing the importance of controlling the applied initial concentration similar with photodegradation the volume of tests the sum of sediment and water has been hugely neglected in previous studies but has been identified as a key factor that leads to division of data into two distinct groups fig 4e a high volume infers a high abundance and diversity of microorganisms as well as more nutrients and carbon source which can significantly enhance the biodegradation process nevertheless ph and temperature do not usually play a role in distinguishing the dataset fig 4f and g although they have been vastly proved as essential factors in biodegradation test goss et al 2020 jasper et al 2014 abdelrady et al 2019 li et al 2021 3 3 laboratory measured adsorption rates for ppcps the rvs for adsorption coefficient koc exhibited a broad range spanning over four orders of magnitude with values ranging from 5 2 to 22 314 2 as indicated in fig 5 fluoxetine is identified as the most retained ppcps in sediments with koc ranging from 80 to 105 670 l kg 1 rv 22 314 l kg 1 which has been observed to attenuate rapidly in river attributed to adsorption writer et al 2013 additionally the four fluoroquinolones showed relatively high koc values which can be ascribed to data from liu et al 2019b and kafaei et al 2018 studies and also agrees with previous studies baginska et al 2015 xu et al 2009 in contrast three sulfonamides exhibit low koc and their attenuation in hyporheic zone was observed to be slow because of weak adsorption liu et al 2019b attempts are made to correlate the adsorption behaviors of ppcps with their octanol water partition coefficient kow or the predicted values p appendix a table s1 unfortunately the rank of logkow or logp displays no correlation with the rank of logkoc Ï 0 19 possibly because electrostatic interactions should also be considered especially for ionized ppcp compounds martinez hernandez et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2009 based on the outcomes of difference analysis it speculatively appears that water sediment ratio can be a controlling factor on the test results as can be observed from fig 6 a a higher content of sediment resulted in higher recorded koc values therefore it is recommended that the water sediment ratio should be explicitly stated and set as close to the real world situation as possible though the adsorption of ionized ppcps is influenced by the ph liu et al 2019a niedbala et al 2013 our difference analysis does not show any notable effect of ph on results fig 6b similarly temperature is not capable of clearly distinguishing the laboratory results fig 6c the lack of significance for ph and temperature in experimental results may be probably due to the fact that these conditions are not strictly controlled during the entire test period 3 4 field observed ppcp attenuation rates for ppcps to visualize the overall degradability of ppcps in the field we assemble 271 pieces of field observed t1 2 data involving 73 ppcps and present them in a violin diagram fig 7 the field observed t1 2 values for ketoprofen ibuprofen naproxen triclosan and paracetamol are ranked as the shortest ones with rv of 0 88 1 70 h conversely the rvs for tramadol sulfadiazine and metformin are over 2 times higher than the rvs for their lower side neighbors 156 173 h rendering them the most recalcitrant compounds nevertheless we must acknowledge that the uneven distribution of sample size for each ppcp might generate significant uncertainty in the ranking results it is worth noting that even though carbamazepine is recognized as persistent and frequently used as a reference compound for tracer studies in natural aquatic systems kunkel and radke 2012 schaper et al 2018 guillet et al 2019 this study has identified it as moderately degradable based on 20 records from 10 field studies this finding underscores the need for extreme caution when carbamazepine is employed as a reference compound in specific conditions the extrapolation of laboratory based knowledge to field investigations is a well known and pervasive challenge in scientific research a significant issue is the spatiotemporal fluctuations of environmental factors including but not limited to river morphology climate weather biotic community and the kaleidoscopic chemical properties of ppcps themselves as thoroughly discussed in literature kunkel and radke 2011 despite these obstacles assembling datasets of current knowledge provides valuable insight into the relative importance of environmental drivers this study conducts a correlation analysis between 31 environmental drivers and the corresponding field observed t1 2 to assess their relationships the results are presented in fig 8 3 4 1 chemical properties of ppcps although the chemical properties of ppcps are known to dictate their attenuation rates few studies have statistically assessed their correlations through our data analysis we find a weak relationship between the observed attenuation rates and only two chemical properties of ppcps logkow and pka2 r or Ï 0 3 which demonstrated that sorption to sediments dominated by polar interactions and electrostatic effects is a vital behavior in the reduction of ppcps along a river this finding however contradicts li et al s field study where no significant relationships are found between attenuation rates and ppcps pka and logdow in four european rivers li et al 2016 one explanation is that these weak correlations are ascribed to data from certain research acuna et al 2015 writer et al 2013 additionally initial concentration has absolutely no correlation with t1 2 as the initial concentrations in field studies are low enough at ng l 1 and the concentration effect is indiscernible 3 4 2 hydraulic parameters the hydrological conditions in different river sites significantly impact the presence and fate of the conveying micropollutants osorio et al 2012 as shown in fig 8 we observe weak positive correlations between travel time as well as river length and t1 2 for which the reason is unknown yet lower flow rate increases the attenuation rates due to longer hydraulic residence time osorio et al 2012 which agrees with the weak positive correlation between flow rate and t1 2 velocity hydraulic radius and cross section area however show no relationships with t1 2 of all the drivers considered water depth is the most statistically significant with a positive pearson coefficient of 0 66 p 0 001 in natural water sunlight is often absorbed by chromophores and reflected by suspended particles before reaching the target chemicals schwarzenbach et al 2016 hence water depth is an essential factor that controls the decay of sunlight bartels and von tumpling 2007 mathon et al observed an average of 75 increase of t1 2 for 23 chemicals in 30 cm water depth than in 10 cm mathon et al 2019 similarly zhou et al recognized that the modeled photodegradation t1 2 for sulfamethoxazole was more than 30 times longer if the variation of time and water depth was taken into consideration zhou et al 2018 the depletion of water resources leads to a thinner water column and may enhance phototransformation processes which warrants attention due to the escalating climate change vione and scozzaro 2019 vione et al 2018 the hyporheic zone is a vibrant bioreactor due to its diverse microflora and large reactive surface areas schaper et al 2018 evidence suggests that even short river segments can benefit from this unique feature of the hyporheic zone which increases the ppcp attenuation rates jaeger et al 2019 kunkel and radke 2012 schaper et al 2018 li et al 2016 rutere et al 2020 however the contribution of hyporheic zone could be less substantial in some cases because of the limited fraction of transient storage in total flow glaser et al 2020 writer et al 2012 in our dataset several studies provide direct information regarding the transit storage zone area and no significant correlations are found it is worth noting that the positive correlation of river width r 0 58 p 0 001 may be linked to the effect of hyporheic exchange since wider rivers present a higher proportion of hyporheic zone flow in the overall flow 3 4 3 seasonality the variation of seasons impacts chemicals attenuation rates by influencing a series of environmental conditions such as temperature solar irradiation vegetation and redox conditions zou et al 2015 many researchers observed higher attenuation rates in warm seasons summer than in cold seasons winter in either rivers or wetlands daneshvar et al 2010 matamoros and rodriguez 2017 nuel et al 2018 mathon et al 2019 rÃ¼hmland et al 2015 zou et al 2015 although the season has been described to significantly affect the monitored attenuation rates the correlation is weak in the assembled data set so is the temperature conversely sunlight irradiation is fairly correlated with t1 2 Ï 0 63 p 0 038 as well as latitude Ï 0 42 p 0 001 this underscores the critical role that photodegradation plays in the overall attenuation rates of chemicals in the field 3 4 4 water quality the water quality parameters including ph dissolved oxygen do conductivity turbidity and contents of nutrients ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen cl tp cod and doc etc show high variability at spatial and temporal scales the results of previous studies suggest that water quality plays an essential role in determining the fate of ppcps for example vione et al modelled the photochemical fate of pharmaceuticals in river water pointing out that the effects of doc water depth and solar irradiance were almost equally important vione et al 2018 based on our assembled dataset ph r 0 21 p 0 003 and do r 0 26 p 0 004 have weak correlations with t1 2 whereas no correlation is found for conductivity ammonia nitrogen and cod nitrate nitrogen is positively correlated with t1 2 with r 0 38 p 0 012 and Ï 0 68 p 0 001 as well as cl r 0 38 p 0 018 while total phosphorus tp is negatively correlated with t1 2 with r 0 60 p 0 001 and Ï 0 46 p 0 008 however this result may not be of good generality because most of the nitrate nitrogen and tp records are from one single research acuna et al 2015 in acuÃ±a et al s study the correlation between 13 water quality parameters in 4 river segments and k was analyzed and it is noteworthy that soluble reactive phosphorus srp was tightly associated with the pharmaceuticals attenuation indicating that p dynamics processes might be involved or correlated acuna et al 2015 remarkably higher doc leads to significantly longer attenuation t1 2 Ï 0 46 p 0 001 probably because of the corresponding higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom which have been observed to drag the attenuation process due to its light screening effect or antioxidant properties yang et al 2017 luo et al 2011 additionally the weak negative correlation of turbidity Ï 0 22 p 0 009 may suggest a higher tendency of adsorption when higher levels of suspended solids are present however further research is necessary to substantiate this supposition 5 conclusions the degradation orders of ppcps determined by rv provide us with more credible information on their attenuation characteristics and confirm the uniqueness of certain ppcps for instance the vulnerability to photodegradation of ketoprofen is supported by multiple sources of data correlating reaction condition parameters with the measured t1 2 values helps us understand how degradation rates are affected by the experimental conditions and environmental drivers some experimental parameters like light source for photodegradation experimental setup and redox condition for biodegradation and water sediment ratio for adsorption are confirmed to have significant influence on the determination of t1 2 whereas the role of initial concentration and reaction volume may have been underestimated when glancing over the results of this study we should keep in mind that the reliability of the above outcomes is restricted by sample size so more degradability tests especially field observations are called for even though significant influencing factors are qualitatively identified the failure of correlation test between t1 2 and most of the parameters demonstrates that there is a huge gap between the present knowledge and quantitative relationships for the prediction of ppcp environmental concentrations it is recommended to use the probabilistic models and consider the input degradation rates as a random range declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

14652,phthalic acid esters phthalates are an important group of additives plasticizers to ensure the flexibility and stability especially of polyvinyl chloride pvc and to enable its processing however phthalates like di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp are harmful for aquatic organisms due to their endocrine disrupting effects and toxicity for the assessment of exposure concentrations thorough understanding of leaching kinetics of phthalates from pvc micro plastics into aqueous environments is necessary this study investigates how environmental factors influence the leaching of phthalates from pvc microplastics into aquatic systems the leaching of phthalates from pvc microplastics into aqueous media is limited by aqueous boundary layer diffusion abld and thus process specific parameters can be affected by environmental factors such as salinity and the flow conditions we conducted batch leaching experiments to assess the influence of salinity and flow conditions turbulence on the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics into aqueous media dehp is salted out with increasing salinity of the solution and a salting out coefficient for dehp of 0 46 was determined the partitioning coefficient of dehp between pvc and water kpvc w increased with increasing salinity from 108 52 l kg 1 in a 1 mm kcl solution to 108 75 l kg 1 in artificial seawater thereby slowing down leaching increasing flow velocities led to higher leaching rates because the abl thickness decreased from 1315 Âµm at 0 rpm shaking speed no flow conditions to 38 4 Âµm at 125 rpm turbulent conditions compared to salinity turbulence had a more pronounced effect on leaching increasing the flow velocity led to a 35 fold decrease in the leaching rate while increasing salinity led to a 2 fold increase by calculating specific leaching times that is leaching half lives t1 2 time frames for leaching in different aquatic systems such as rivers and the ocean were determined given abld limited leaching dehp is leached faster from pvc microplastics in rivers t1 2 49 years than in the ocean t1 2 398 years in both systems pvc microplastics are a long term source of phthalates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastics additives diffusion process leaching kinetics mass transfer data availability all data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its supplementary material file 1 introduction plastics are versatile low cost materials and can be found everywhere in modern life wang and praetorius 2022 plastics use is projected to triple by 2060 from 460 million tons 2019 to 1231 million tons per year further 44 million tons of plastics are projected to leak into the environment in 2060 oecd 2022 plastics are widespread pollutants and they can accumulate in the environment because of low degradation rates geyer et al 2017 weathering in turn leads to the fragmentation of macroplastics into ever smaller particles such as microplastics jambeck et al 2015 microplastics transport depends on the size and density of the microplastics and is subject to water flow microplastics may remain in the water column beach or settle kooi et al 2018 rivers are important transport pathways for land based microplastics to the marine environment but river sediments can also act as sinks for microplastics he et al 2021 lechner et al 2014 given the high production volume polyvinyl chloride pvc is among the most abundant microplastics found in surface waters and sediments klein et al 2018 kooi et al 2018 plastics europe 2021 wu et al 2018 plastics especially those made of pvc contain high quantities of additives including plasticizers like phthalic acid esters phthalates hahladakis et al 2018 additives can leach from the microplastics into the surrounding media kwon et al 2017 leaching of harmful chemicals like phthalates into the environment is a threat to water resources and thereby to living organisms hartmann et al 2019 kwon et al 2017 the leaching of additives from microplastics into an aqueous solution consists of both internal intraparticle diffusion ipd and external diffusion aqueous boundary layer diffusion abld the slower of both processes limits the overall diffusion of the additive grathwohl 1998 the leaching of phthalates from pvc microplastics is governed by abld as shown in our previous study henkel et al 2022 process specific parameters describing abld are the abl thickness the aqueous diffusion coefficient of phthalates and the partitioning coefficient of phthalates between pvc and water these parameters depend on the polymer and additive properties as well as on the chemical composition of the aqueous medium and the flow conditions grathwohl 1998 the latter can vary in the environment and therefore affect the leaching process and associated leaching times leaching times of phthalates under different environmental conditions are highly relevant for exposure assessment and for water quality assessment for abld limited release processes the leaching of additives can be influenced by the ph value of the solution if the charge of the additive molecule and the surface charge of microplastics are ph sensitive liu et al 2019 schwarzenbach et al 2003 however phthalates are neutral compounds and the influence of ph on leaching from pvc is therefore limited liu et al 2019 yan et al 2021 for a ph value between 3 and 9 no clear trend for the leaching rate of di n butyl phthalate dnbp from pvc was observed yan et al 2021 the aqueous diffusion coefficient of a compound increases with increasing water temperature and thus leaching rates for abld limited leaching processes can increase too worch 1993 however the aqueous diffusion coefficient of di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp only changes by a factor of 2 5 henkel et al 2022 when considering environmentally relevant water temperatures 0 30 c ipcc 2013 van vliet et al 2013 the effect of the water temperature on leaching is therefore expected to be low compared to other environmental factors in accordance with these calculations different water temperatures had little effect on the leaching of dehp from polystyrene or polyethylene in laboratory batch experiments dhavamani et al 2022 gulizia et al 2023 in the aquatic environment the salinity ranges substantially from freshwater 1 to estuarine water 3 5 and seawater 35 geitner et al 2020 united states environmental protection agency 2002 inorganic salts which dissolve into small ions e g nacl or mgcl2 lead to an increase in the cohesive energy of water and thus to an increase in the cavity formation energy of molecules entering the water phase salting out endo et al 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2003 this results in a higher viscosity of water at higher salinities and a shift of the equilibrium partitioning of non polar organic compounds towards the solid non aqueous phase can be observed endo et al 2012 partitioning coefficients for phthalates between plastics and water having different salinities have not yet been determined besides the chemical composition of water flow conditions in surface waters range from slow or barely any water movement in lakes to turbulent conditions in rivers kooi et al 2018 varying flow conditions change the abl thickness grathwohl 1998 which in turn affects the rate of the external mass transfer process thompson et al 2015 in laboratory batch experiments an increase of the flow velocity adjusted by increasing the speed of a shaker or stirring bar could lead to a higher release of phthalates gulizia et al 2023 suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 the influence of salinity and flow conditions on the leaching of phthalates from different polymers has been addressed but no inferences regarding the underlying leaching process have been drawn dhavamani et al 2022 gulizia et al 2023 suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 yan et al 2021 in this study we conducted batch leaching experiments using pvc microplastics containing dehp as model phthalate and measured the leaching of dehp i into three aqueous solutions with different salinities 1 mm kcl freshwater and artificial seawater and ii under three different flow conditions stagnant moderate and turbulent flow results were used to assess the leaching half lives of dehp from pvc microplastics into different aquatic systems like rivers and the ocean and for the first time the effect of salinity and turbulence on leaching rates was quantified we describe the influence of two highly important environmental factors on the leaching of phthalates and provide the corresponding process specific parameters these are required to incorporate environmental effects into leaching models used to predict exposure concentrations for aquatic organisms 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation all glassware was rinsed with ultra pure water elga labwater veolia water technologies celle germany and with acetone anala

range over a continuum of sizes and shapes mitrano et al 2021 to study leaching processes model pvc microplastics of a defined size and shape were used the pvc microplastics had a radius of 2 mm and a density of 1 21 g cm 3 they were approximately spherical and they were purchased from industrie generali spa samarate italy the dehp content was 38 wt the influence of turbulence and salinity on the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics was investigated separately by adjusting the respective parameter for each experiment the influence of turbulence on leaching was investigated at three shaking speeds representing different turbulence intensities using a horizontal shaker sm 30 shaker amplitude 46 mm edmund bÃ¼hler gmbh bodelshausen germany mancilla et al 2015 a shaking speed of 0 rpm was chosen as the lower limit representing no flow conditions slow flow conditions were investigated using a shaking speed of 25 rpm 125 rpm shaking speed was the upper limit representing turbulent conditions a 1 mm kcl solution anala normapur vwr chemicals vienna austria ph 6 69 0 16 was used as the aqueous phase and reference system in order to avoid overlapping effects on the leaching process which may be caused by for example using natural waters with complex background matrices the influence of salinity was investigated using three aqueous solutions with different ionic strengths the solution with the lowest ionic strength was a 1 mm kcl solution standard synthetic freshwaters include very soft to very hard water depending on the hardness and salinity of the solution united states

calcium sulfate magnesium sulfate and sodium hydrogen carbonate vwr chemicals vienna austria artificial seawater with an ionic strength of 500 mm ph 8 51 0 02 was prepared using sea salt purchased from merck darmstadt germany given that dehp is not ph sensitive the ph value of the solutions was not further adjusted liu et al 2019 experiments were conducted at a constant shaking speed of 125 rpm using a horizontal shaker the time dependent leaching curve for dehp from pvc microplastics into 1 mm kcl at 125 rpm has been determined previously henkel et al 2022 2 2 leaching experiments for the batch leaching experiments an infinite sink method was employed details on the method are described elsewhere henkel et al 2019 briefly 10 mg of activated carbon norit sae super cabot norit nederland

317 l 0 35 mm thickness zivipf treuchlingen germany sinks were equilibrated in 40 ml of aqueous solution using a horizontal shaker at 125 rpm overnight to avoid bacterial growth the aqueous solutions contained 50 mg l 1 of sodium azide 99 thermo fisher scientific waltham massachusetts us then 85 0 5 mg of pvc microplastic pellets were added and the vials were placed on a horizontal shaker at 20 c until sampling to avoid any photodegradation samples were kept in the dark at sampling intervals of 1 120 d first the pvc microplastics and then the infinite sink were taken out with tweezers leaching experiments were conducted using three sample replicates for each leaching experiment six blanks consisting of an infinite sink and the respective background solution were used for the quantification of dehp the infinite sinks were spiked with 1 Âµg of deuterated internal dehp d4 standard analytical standard merck darmstadt germany sinks were dried at 40 c and stored in a desiccator until extraction sinks were extracted using an accelerated solvent extractor ase 350 thermo fisher scientific waltham us at 120 c using n hexane 95 pestinorm vwr chemicals vienna austria as solvent the aqueous phase was spiked with 1 Âµg of dehp d4 and extracted using liquid liquid extraction with three times 5 ml of n hexane the extracts were transferred to a 20 ml vial the n hexane extracts of both the infinite sink and the water phase were concentrated to 100 Âµl using a laboratory evaporator barkey vapotherm basic mobil i leopoldshÃ¶he germany under nitrogen aeration the concentrated extracts were stored in 1 5 ml amber brown glass vials at 4 c until measurement 2 3 quantification of dehp the mass of dehp in the extracts of the infinite sink msink and the water phase mw were measured using a gas chromatograph 8890 coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer 7000d both agilent technologies santa clara us and a pal 3 rsi 120 autosampler ctc analytics ag zwingen switzerland two hp 5 ms ultra inert columns 15 m x 250 Âµm x 0 25 Âµm agilent technologies santa clara us were used for the chromatographic separation with helium 5 0 linde gas gmbh stadl paura

using a dehp standard pestanal analytical standard merck darmstadt germany the transition from 149 to 65 was used as a quantifier for dehp and from 153 to 69 was used for dehp d4 additionally two qualifiers 149 to 93 149 to 121 and 153 to 97 153 to 125 were used for each compound conducting the leaching experiments the mass of dehp leached mleach msink mw could be obtained for each sampling time 2 4 leaching processes intraparticle diffusion ipd describes the diffusion of a compound through a plastic particle and depends on the size and shape of the particle for the experimental setup used in this study ipd limited leaching from spherical pvc microplastics can be described by endo et al 2013 1 f desorbed 1 m t m 0 1 6 Ï 2 n 1 1 n 2 e n 2 Ï 2 t d pvc r 2 where fdesorbed is the fraction of phthalates leached at each time t d r m is the pvc particle radius and dpvc m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient of phthalates in pvc to approximate the ipd model a taylor number n 1 10 000 was used the initial phthalate mass contained in the pvc microplastics and the mass at each time are given as m0 Âµg and mt Âµg respectively aqueous boundary layer diffusion abld describes the diffusion of a compound through an abl on the outside of the plastic particle for the given experimental setup abld limited leaching from spherical pvc microplastics can be expressed as follows endo et al 2013 2 f desorbed 1 m t m 0 1 e 3 d aq t r Î´ k pvc w where daq m2 s 1 is the aqueous diffusion coefficient of phthalates and Î´ m is the abl thickness kpvc w l l 1 is the partitioning

at equilibrium using the density of the pvc microplastics kpvc w was converted to l kg 1 table 1 2 5 leaching half lives for abld limited leaching processes given the limiting mass transfer process specific leaching times such as leaching half lives can be calculated the leaching half life indicates how long it takes until 50 of phthalates have leached from the pvc microplastics for abld limited leaching half lives can be calculated as follows endo et al 2013 3 t 1 2 r k pvc w ln 2 3 1 k where the mass transfer coefficient k m s 1 is expressed as the ratio of daq to the abl thickness k daq Î´

calculated as follows 5 k pvc w doc k pvc w 1 k doc w cdoc 2 6 parameter fitting all calculations and the analysis of the obtained time dependent leaching data were done in matlab r2018a the leaching rates slope of the time dependent leaching curves were determined using the basic fitting tool implemented in matlab time dependent leaching curves were fitted using the abld and ipd models and the fitting tool fminsearch the sum of the squared differences between experimentally determined fdesorbed and the diffusion models was used as an objective function as far as the experiments regarding the influence of different flow conditions on leaching are concerned the abl thickness was used as fitting parameter for abl thickness the particle radius curvature of the abl can be neglected endo et al 2013 for kpvc w and daq values determined in an earlier study were used henkel et al 2022 for those experiments using different salinities daq was calculated for the different solutions using the respective dynamic viscosity worch 1993 the value for the abl thickness was determined in an earlier study henkel et al 2022 and kpvc w was used as fitting parameter 2 7 salting out effect the salting out effect correlates positively with the molecular size of the organic compound dissolved in water and negatively with its polarity endo et al 2012 calculating the salting out or setschenow coefficient ks m 1 the chemical properties of the solute and of the salt need to be considered schwarzenbach et al 2003 ks can be predicted based on its relationship with the molar volume of the compound or using different models e g cosmo rs or the poly parameter linear free energy relationship pplfer endo et al 2012 based on its relationship with the saturated concentration of the compound in pure water cw sat and in salt water csw sat ks can be calculated as follows schwarzenbach et al 2003 6 log c w sat c sw sat k s c salt where csalt is the concentration of salt in water in mol l 1 reported cw sat values for nonpolar organic compounds like phthalates are inconsistent often due to variability of experimental methods staples et al 1997 based on its relationship with the partitioning coefficients of a compound between a non aqueous phase here pvc and pure or salt water endo et al 2012 and by rearranging eq 6 ks can be determined as follows 7 k s log k pvc sw k pvc w c salt where kpvc sw l kg 1 is the partitioning coefficients of the compound between pvc and saltwater kpvc sw cs csw the ratio kpvc sw kpvc w is the salting out factor endo et al 2012 2 8 dependence of the abl thickness on the flow conditions the abl thickness depends on the particle size and the flow conditions in the solution and can be described based on its relationship with the sherwood number

up seidensticker 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 at higher salinities the leaching rate of dehp decreases for the duration of the experiments 120 d the time dependent leaching curves were linear for the leaching of dehp into aqueous solutions of different salinity r2 1mm kcl 0 990 r2 freshwater 0 967 r2 art seawater 0 987 fig 1 with increasing salinity leaching rates decreased from 0 122 Âµg d 1 for the 1 mm kcl solution to 0 102 Âµg d 1 and 0 067 Âµg d 1 for freshwater and artificial seawater respectively at higher salt concentrations the aqueous solubility of non polar organic compounds is lower salting out effect schwarzenbach et al 2003 decreasing leaching rates can thus be explained by the lower solubility of dehp at lower salinities 0 0 2 m leaching of dnbp from pvc microplastics into aqueous solutions decreased 15 with increasing salinity yan et al 2021 a comparable decrease 16 4 could be observed in this study when comparing leaching rates of dehp into 1 mm kcl and into freshwater for the leaching of dehp and other phthalates from pvc pond construction foil no clear difference between leaching rates into deionized water and seawater could be observed but the mass of dehp leached was similar to reported blank values and therefore comparing leaching rates at different salinities was difficult suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 lower solubility of dehp has also been observed in natural seawater turner and rawling 2000 in natural waters the presence of dissolved organic matter can further influence the solubility of dehp and the amount and properties of dissolved organic matter e g its aromaticity molecular weight and capability to interact with the inorganic salts need to be considered turner 2003 3 2 higher salinities lead to higher kpvc w and longer leaching half lives to account for the lower solubility and higher partitioning coefficient of dehp in more saline solutions kpvc w was determined using the abld model while the aqueous diffusion coefficients for dehp in 1 mm kcl and freshwater are very similar daq for dehp in seawater is lower due to a slightly higher dynamic viscosity Î· of seawater Î· 1 090 g m 1 s 1 compared to the other two aqueous solutions Î· 1 002 g m 1 s 1 table 1 engineering toolbox 2005 2004 a boundary layer thickness of 38 4 Âµm was determined for this experimental set up in 1 mm kcl solution in an earlier study henkel et al 2022 taking into account the slightly higher kinematic viscosity of seawater Î½ 1 063 10 6 m2 s 1 compared to pure water Î½ 1 004 10 6 m2 s 1 engineering toolbox 2005 2004 the boundary layer thickness can be calculated based on its relationship with the sherwood number grathwohl 1998 in seawater the abl thickness for the given flow conditions decreases to 37 7 Âµm however considering fitting uncertainties for the abl thickness table 1 abl thicknesses in 1 mm kcl in freshwater and in seawater are equal for freshwater daq determined for 1 mm kcl was used because the influence of the salt content was negligible using the respective abl thickness and daq values kpvc w was fitted fval values indicate the goodness of the fit the lower fval the better the fit kpvc w increased with increasing salinity of the aqueous solution from 108 60 l l 1 fval 1 91 10 9 for 1 mm kcl to 108 68 l l 1 fval 4 72 10 9 and 108 83 l l 1 fval 6 58 10 10 for freshwater and artificial seawater respectively fig 1 confidence intervals of kpvc w after fitting are provided in table 1 because kpvc w for phthalates are not available for comparison with literature values ks was calculated using kpvc w 108 60 l l 1 and kpvc sw 108 83 l l 1 to solve eq 7 the salting out coefficient ks for dehp is 0 46 log salting out factors for dehp are 0 08 and 0 23 in freshwater and artificial seawater respectively reported ks for di alkyl phthalates derived using the pplfer range from 0 24 for dimethyl phthalate dmp to 0 57 for di n octyl phthalate dnop they increase with the length of the hydrocarbon chain the corresponding log salting out factors range from 0 036 dmp to 0 084 dnop for less saline solutions csalt 0 15 m and from 0 12 dmp to 0 28 dnop for seawater csalt 0 5 m endo et al 2012 the salting out factors for dehp obtained in this study are slightly lower than those reported for the isomer dnop while dnop has straight hydrocarbon chains dehp is branched thus dnop log ko w 8 31 at 20 c is more hydrophobic than dehp log ko w 7 66 at 20 c archem llc 2023 and more affected by salting out an increase of kpvc w results in longer leaching half lives for the release of dehp from the pvc microplastics henkel et al 2022 the leaching half lives of dehp from the pvc microplastics are 503 years in 1 mm kcl 605 years in freshwater and 913 years in artificial seawater for the calculations stagnant conditions were assumed under environmental conditions leaching could be faster because weathering and fragmentation lead to an increase in the surface area of microplastics ter halle et al 2017 3 3 the leaching rate of dehp increases with increasing shaking speed for the duration of the experiments 120 d the time dependent leaching curves were linear r2 0 rpm 0 918 r2 25 rmp 0 968 r2 125 rmp 0 990 fig 2 the leaching rate increased with increasing shaking speed from 0 0035 Âµg d 1 at 0 rpm to 0 0164 Âµg d 1 and 0 122 Âµg d 1 for 25 rpm and 125 rpm respectively the leaching rate increased by a factor of 5 when increasing the shaking speed from 0 rpm to 25 rpm and by a factor of 35 when increasing the shaking speed from 0 rpm to 125 rpm an about 45 fold increase of the leaching rate has been reported for the release of dehp from pvc foil when increasing the speed of a magnetic stirrer from 0 to 150 rpm suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 the leaching of dehp from polystyrene microplastics increased by a factor of 17 when increasing the speed of a magnetic stirrer from 0 rpm to 90 rpm gulizia et al 2023 the increase of leaching rates with increasing shaking speed observed in this study falls in the range of reported effects 3 4 an increasing flow velocity reduces the abl thickness and leaching half lives using the abld model with kpvc w of 108 60 l l 1 and daq of 4 45 10 10 m2 s 1 the abl thickness was fitted fig 2 the abl thickness decreased with increasing horizontal shaking speed from 1315 Âµm fval 1 51 10 11 at 0 rpm to 284 Âµm fval 1 22 10 10 at 25 rpm and to 38 4 Âµm fval 1 91 10 9 at 125 rpm confidence intervals for the abl thickness after fitting are provided in table 1 the abl thickness decreased by a factor of 5 and by a factor of 35 comparing leaching at 0 rpm to leaching at 25 and 125 rpm respectively although abl thicknesses for phthalate leaching from microplastics are not available and studies systematically addressing leaching at different flow velocities are scarce few reported values of the abl thickness in comparable systems are in accordance with our findings for well mixed systems 120 300 rpm the abl thickness ranges from 10 to 30 Âµm endo et al 2013 kwon et al 2006 lohmann 2012 seidensticker et al 2017 for slow water agitation 40 100 rpm an abl thickness of 58 300 Âµm and at stagnant flow conditions an abl thickness of 1900 5000 Âµm were reported kwon et al 2006 lee et al 2018 the abl thickness determined in this study at stagnant flow conditions might be too low because sample vials were slightly moved during sampling at stagnant and very slow flow conditions the abl thickness is in the order of magnitude of the radius of the pvc microplastics and radial diffusion requires consideration in more complex models endo et al 2013 differences of the abl thickness at comparable flow conditions could be due to different experimental set ups for example abl thicknesses determined from experiments using stirring bars for mixing were slightly lower than for shaking systems lee et al 2018 the abl thickness depends on the particle radius and to a minor degree on daq eqs 8 and 9 resulting in differences when comparing abld processes for particles of different sizes and for different additives using the same flow conditions suspended particles can lead to turbulence at the microplastic water interface and thereby to a lower abl thickness compared to that in a particle free system zhang et al 2006 in a well mixed activated carbon slurry for example abl of 1 5 Âµm and 2 5 Âµm were reported hale et al 2009 thompson et al 2015 an increase of the abl thickness with decreasing flow velocity results in longer leaching half lives for the release of dehp from the pvc microplastics henkel et al 2022 the corresponding leaching half lives are 503 years at 125 rpm 3722 years at 25 rpm and 17 238 years at 0 rpm assuming that only the abl thickness changes and all other parameters remain constant compared to salinity the flow conditions have a stronger influence on the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics 3 5 leaching in aquatic model environments rivers and the ocean in the aquatic environment not only salinity and turbulence but also several other environmental factors influence abld and can lead to changes of the leaching half lives of dehp henkel et al 2022 leaching half lives in natural freshwaters like rivers and in the ocean can be estimated by using representative environmental conditions eq 3 the water temperature in rivers ranges from 4 to 30 c van vliet et al 2013 taking into account the respective dynamic viscosity of water at each temperature s1 daq of dehp in rivers was calculated worch 1993 besides the weather conditions in the catchment area the hydraulic radius bed roughness and slope of the river bed influence the flow velocity and thereby the flow conditions verzano et al 2012 using the abld model the abl thickness representing flow conditions was calculated for daq at each water temperature eqs 8 and 9 the Î± value eq 9 was determined using experimental data s2 the flow velocities at no flow and turbulent flow from our experiments were used as upper and lower limits while doc concentrations of 1 2 mg l 1 are typical for pristine streams the doc concentration of rivers varies between 2 and 10 mg l 1 thurman 1985 doc leads to facilitated transport of phthalates through the abl koelmans et al 2013 the mass transfer coefficient through the abl and kpvc w doc were calculated at each doc concentration eq 4 and eq 5 mott 2002 accounting for the salinity in freshwater systems by including the log salting factor of 0 08 we determined for freshwater kpvc w doc slightly increased nacl is the major salt in seawater given the same salinity in the solution ks values have been shown to be similar in nacl solutions and seawater schwarzenbach et al 2003 temperature has a minor effect on salting in nacl solutions and seawater and was therefore not included in the calculation of ks endo et al 2012 using the respective daq kpvc w doc and the abl thickness for constant flow conditions leaching half lives of dehp in rivers were calculated fig 3 the lowest leaching half life of 49 years was found at the highest temperature turbulent flow conditions and at the highest doc concentration in contrast the highest leaching half life was calculated to be 12 151 years at the lowest temperature no flow conditions and lowest doc concentration assuming an average water temperature for rivers of 17 c and Î· 1 079 g m 1 s 1 engineering toolbox 2004 van vliet et al 2013 daq for dehp of 4 09 10 10 m2 s 1 was calculated worch 1993 rivers are mostly characterized by turbulent flow conditions trinci et al 2017 accounting for the salinity in freshwater systems and assuming a doc concentration of 5 29 mg l 1 reported as the global average in rivers dai et al 2012 log kpvc w doc in a river was 7 99 mott 2002 the corresponding average leaching half life of dehp in a river was calculated to be 122 years calculations could be applied to leaching of dehp in the ocean leading to different leaching half lives due to changes of the water temperature 0 26 c ipcc 2013 and doc concentration 0 5 1 3 mg l 1 guo et al 1995 thomas et al 2005 to account for the higher salinity influencing kpvc w a log salting factor of 0 23 was used while barely any water movement can be expected at the bottom of the sea close to the water surface and at the seacoast turbulent flow conditions can be found calculated leaching half lives in the ocean are higher than in freshwater systems due to lower temperatures and lower doc concentrations and range from 398 to 36 906 years fig 3 water temperature and salinity in freshwater systems clearly affect leaching of dehp from pvc to a minor degree however flow conditions are highly variable in rivers and influence leaching verzano et al 2012 during high flow events the doc concentration and the flow velocity in rivers can increase lee et al 2019 verzano et al 2012 possibly leading to higher leaching rates transport models of nano and microplastics showed that size and density influence the fate of particles in rivers besseling et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016 taking into account the relatively large particle size r 2 mm and that the density of the pvc microplastics 1 21 g cm 3 is higher compared to the density of water river sediments are expected to be an important sink for pvc microplastics and 90 100 of plastic particles 0 2 mm were shown to be retained nizzetto et al 2016 microplastics settled onto the river bed can be buried and remain in the sediments besseling et al 2017 once buried in the sediments the abl thickness will increase and leaching will be slowed down while leached dehp may sorb to the sediments assuming slow flow conditions the average leaching half life in a river is estimated to be 900 years in organic rich sediments in contrast kpvc w would be lower accelerating leaching estuarine sediments have been shown to retain 50 of dehp and they can act as a sink too turner and rawling 2000 while degradation half lives of freely dissolved dehp in natural waters are 2 15 days particle bound dehp is less available for degradation by microorganisms staples et al 1997 turner and rawling 2000 while rivers are an important transport route for plastics to the ocean river sediments are an important sink for dense pvc microplastics our results reveal very long leaching half lives of phthalates and that pvc microplastics can be considered a long lived source of these with potential adverse effects on living organisms 4 conclusion we showed that salinity and turbulence influence the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics by combining experimental data with modeling time dependent leaching experiments into aqueous solutions showed that highly hydrophobic phthalates like dehp are salted out to minor degree in freshwater and to a higher degree in seawater while changing the flow conditions strongly influenced the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics salinity played a minor role using experimental leaching data the influence of salinity and turbulence on abld could be assessed even at high turbulence and low salinity fastest here presented scenario the abld model agreed well with the experimental data and could be identified as the governing diffusion process calculating characteristic leaching times i e leaching half lives key environmental factors influencing leaching were identified specifically we show that salinity turbulence temperature and the concentration of doc strongly influence abld limited leaching process specific parameters for abld were determined including these parameters for environmentally relevant conditions into leaching models time frames for the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics into different aquatic environments were determined leaching processes in rivers and the ocean were compared showing that leaching is expected to be faster in rivers t1 2 49 years than in the ocean t1 2 398 years this study provides a mechanistic understanding of leaching processes in aquatic systems and of the effect of environmental factors on leaching in natural aquatic environments leaching half lives are subject to the variability of environmental conditions accounting for dynamic and site specific conditions leaching models can be adjusted accordingly to predict environmental exposure concentrations of phthalates our study provides new insights how environmental factors such as salinity and turbulence significantly influence the leaching of additives from microplastics and that under environmental relevant conditions

14652,phthalic acid esters phthalates are an important group of additives plasticizers to ensure the flexibility and stability especially of polyvinyl chloride pvc and to enable its processing however phthalates like di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp are harmful for aquatic organisms due to their endocrine disrupting effects and toxicity for the assessment of exposure concentrations thorough understanding of leaching kinetics of phthalates from pvc micro plastics into aqueous environments is necessary this study investigates how environmental factors influence the leaching of phthalates from pvc microplastics into aquatic systems the leaching of phthalates from pvc microplastics into aqueous media is limited by aqueous boundary layer diffusion abld and thus process specific parameters can be affected by environmental factors such as salinity and the flow conditions we conducted batch leaching experiments to assess the influence of salinity and flow conditions turbulence on the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics into aqueous media dehp is salted out with increasing salinity of the solution and a salting out coefficient for dehp of 0 46 was determined the partitioning coefficient of dehp between pvc and water kpvc w increased with increasing salinity from 108 52 l kg 1 in a 1 mm kcl solution to 108 75 l kg 1 in artificial seawater thereby slowing down leaching increasing flow velocities led to higher leaching rates because the abl thickness decreased from 1315 Âµm at 0 rpm shaking speed no flow conditions to 38 4 Âµm at 125 rpm turbulent conditions compared to salinity turbulence had a more pronounced effect on leaching increasing the flow velocity led to a 35 fold decrease in the leaching rate while increasing salinity led to a 2 fold increase by calculating specific leaching times that is leaching half lives t1 2 time frames for leaching in different aquatic systems such as rivers and the ocean were determined given abld limited leaching

article and its supplementary material file 1 introduction plastics are versatile low cost materials and can be found everywhere in modern life wang and praetorius 2022 plastics use is projected to triple by 2060 from 460 million tons 2019 to 1231 million tons per year further 44 million tons of plastics are projected to leak into the environment in 2060 oecd 2022 plastics are widespread pollutants and they can accumulate in the environment because of low degradation rates geyer et al 2017 weathering in turn leads to the fragmentation of macroplastics into ever smaller particles such as microplastics jambeck et al 2015 microplastics transport depends on the size and density of the microplastics and is subject to water flow microplastics may remain in the water column beach or settle kooi et al 2018 rivers are important transport pathways for land based microplastics to the marine environment but river sediments can also act as sinks for microplastics he et al 2021 lechner et al 2014 given the high production volume polyvinyl chloride pvc is among the most abundant microplastics found in surface waters and sediments klein et al 2018 kooi et al 2018 plastics europe 2021 wu et al 2018 plastics especially those made of pvc contain high quantities of additives including plasticizers like phthalic acid esters phthalates hahladakis et al 2018 additives can leach from the microplastics into the surrounding media kwon et al 2017 leaching of harmful chemicals like phthalates into the environment is a threat to water resources and thereby to living organisms hartmann et al 2019 kwon et al 2017 the leaching of additives from microplastics into an aqueous solution consists of both internal intraparticle diffusion ipd and external diffusion aqueous boundary layer diffusion abld the slower of both processes limits the overall diffusion of the additive grathwohl 1998 the leaching of phthalates from pvc microplastics is governed by abld as shown in our previous study henkel et al 2022 process specific parameters describing abld are the abl thickness the aqueous diffusion coefficient of phthalates and the partitioning coefficient of phthalates between pvc and water these parameters depend on the polymer and additive properties as well as on the chemical composition of the aqueous medium and the flow conditions grathwohl 1998 the latter can vary in the environment and therefore affect the leaching process and associated leaching times leaching times of phthalates under different environmental conditions are highly relevant for exposure assessment and for water quality assessment for abld limited release processes the leaching of additives can be influenced by the ph value of the solution if the charge of the additive molecule and the surface charge of microplastics are ph sensitive liu et al 2019 schwarzenbach et al 2003 however phthalates are neutral compounds and the influence of ph on leaching from pvc is therefore limited liu et al 2019 yan et al 2021 for a ph value between 3 and 9 no clear trend for the leaching rate of di n butyl phthalate dnbp from pvc was observed yan et al 2021 the aqueous diffusion coefficient of a compound increases with increasing water temperature and thus leaching rates for abld limited leaching processes can increase too worch 1993 however the aqueous diffusion coefficient of di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp only changes by a factor of 2 5 henkel et al 2022 when considering environmentally relevant water temperatures 0 30 c ipcc 2013 van vliet et al 2013 the effect of the water temperature on leaching is therefore expected to be low compared to other environmental factors in accordance with these calculations different water temperatures had little effect on the leaching of dehp from polystyrene or polyethylene in laboratory batch experiments dhavamani et al 2022 gulizia et al 2023 in the aquatic environment the salinity ranges substantially from freshwater 1 to estuarine water 3 5 and seawater 35 geitner et al 2020 united states environmental protection agency 2002 inorganic salts which dissolve into small ions e g nacl or mgcl2 lead to an increase in the cohesive energy of water and thus to an increase in the cavity formation energy of molecules entering the water phase salting out endo et al 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2003 this results in a higher viscosity of water at higher salinities and a shift of the equilibrium partitioning of non polar organic compounds towards the solid non aqueous phase can be observed endo et al 2012 partitioning coefficients for phthalates between plastics and water having different salinities have not yet been determined besides the chemical composition of water flow conditions in surface waters range from slow or barely any water movement in lakes to turbulent conditions in rivers kooi et al 2018 varying flow conditions change the abl thickness grathwohl 1998 which in turn affects the rate of the external mass transfer process thompson et al 2015 in laboratory batch experiments an increase of the flow velocity adjusted by increasing the speed of a shaker or stirring bar could lead to a higher release of phthalates gulizia et al 2023 suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 the influence of salinity and flow conditions on the leaching of phthalates from different polymers has been addressed but no inferences regarding the underlying leaching process have been drawn dhavamani et al 2022 gulizia et al 2023 suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 yan et al 2021 in this study we conducted batch leaching experiments using pvc microplastics containing dehp as model phthalate and measured the leaching of dehp i into three aqueous solutions with different salinities 1 mm kcl freshwater and artificial seawater and ii under three different flow conditions stagnant moderate and turbulent flow results were used to assess the leaching half lives of dehp from pvc microplastics into different aquatic systems like rivers and the ocean and for the first time the effect of salinity and turbulence on leaching rates was quantified we describe the influence of two highly important environmental factors on the leaching of phthalates and provide the corresponding process specific parameters these are required to incorporate environmental effects into leaching models used to predict exposure concentrations for aquatic organisms 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation all glassware was rinsed with ultra pure water elga labwater veolia water technologies celle germany and with acetone anala

leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics was investigated separately by adjusting the respective parameter for each experiment the influence of turbulence on leaching was investigated at three shaking

conditions a 1 mm kcl solution anala normapur vwr chemicals vienna austria ph 6 69 0 16 was used as the aqueous phase and reference system in order to avoid overlapping effects on the leaching process which may be caused by for example using natural waters with complex background matrices the influence of salinity was investigated using three aqueous solutions with different ionic strengths the

diffusion of a compound through an abl on the outside of the plastic particle for the given experimental setup abld limited leaching from spherical pvc microplastics can be expressed as follows endo

rates slope of the time dependent leaching curves were determined using the basic fitting tool implemented in matlab time dependent leaching curves were fitted using the abld and ipd models and the fitting tool fminsearch the sum of the squared differences between experimentally determined fdesorbed and the diffusion models was used as an objective function as far as the experiments regarding the influence of different flow conditions on leaching are concerned the abl thickness was used as fitting parameter for abl thickness the particle radius curvature of the abl can be neglected endo et al 2013 for kpvc w and daq values determined in an earlier study were used henkel et al 2022 for those experiments using different salinities daq was calculated for the different solutions using the respective dynamic viscosity worch 1993 the value for the abl thickness was determined in an earlier study henkel et al 2022 and kpvc w was used as fitting parameter 2 7 salting out effect the salting out effect correlates positively with the molecular size of the organic compound dissolved in water and negatively with its polarity endo et al 2012 calculating the salting out or setschenow

up seidensticker 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 at higher salinities the leaching rate of dehp decreases for the duration of the experiments 120 d the time dependent leaching curves were linear for the leaching of dehp into aqueous solutions of different salinity r2 1mm kcl 0 990 r2 freshwater 0 967 r2 art seawater 0 987 fig 1 with increasing salinity leaching rates decreased from 0 122 Âµg d 1 for the 1 mm kcl solution to 0 102 Âµg d 1 and 0 067 Âµg d 1 for freshwater and artificial seawater respectively at higher salt concentrations the aqueous solubility of non polar organic compounds is lower salting out effect schwarzenbach et al 2003 decreasing leaching rates can thus be explained by the lower solubility of dehp at lower salinities 0 0 2 m leaching of dnbp from pvc microplastics into aqueous solutions decreased 15 with increasing salinity yan et al 2021 a comparable decrease 16 4 could be observed in this study when comparing leaching rates of dehp into 1 mm kcl and into freshwater for the leaching of dehp and other phthalates from pvc pond construction foil no clear difference between leaching rates into deionized water and seawater could be observed but the mass of dehp leached was similar to reported blank values and therefore comparing leaching rates at different salinities was difficult suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 lower solubility of dehp has also been observed in natural seawater turner and rawling 2000 in natural waters the presence of dissolved organic matter can further influence the solubility of dehp and the amount and properties of dissolved organic matter e g its aromaticity molecular weight and capability to interact with the inorganic salts need to be considered turner 2003 3 2 higher salinities lead to higher kpvc w and longer leaching half lives to account for the lower solubility and higher partitioning coefficient of dehp in more saline solutions kpvc w was determined using the abld model while the aqueous diffusion coefficients for dehp in 1 mm kcl and freshwater are very similar daq for dehp in seawater is lower due to a slightly higher dynamic viscosity Î· of seawater Î· 1 090 g m 1 s 1 compared to the other two aqueous solutions Î· 1 002 g m 1 s 1 table 1 engineering toolbox 2005 2004 a boundary layer thickness of 38 4 Âµm was determined for this experimental set up in 1 mm kcl solution in an earlier study henkel et al 2022 taking into account the slightly higher kinematic viscosity of seawater Î½ 1 063 10 6 m2 s 1 compared to pure water Î½ 1 004 10 6 m2 s 1 engineering toolbox 2005 2004 the boundary layer thickness can be calculated based on its relationship with the sherwood number grathwohl 1998 in seawater the abl thickness for the given flow conditions decreases to 37 7 Âµm however considering fitting uncertainties for the abl thickness table 1 abl thicknesses in 1 mm kcl in freshwater and in seawater are equal for freshwater daq determined for 1 mm kcl was used because the influence of the salt content was negligible using the respective abl thickness and daq values kpvc w was fitted fval values indicate the goodness of the fit the lower fval the better the fit kpvc w increased with increasing salinity of the aqueous solution from 108 60 l l 1 fval 1 91 10 9 for 1 mm kcl to 108 68 l l 1 fval 4 72 10 9 and 108 83 l l 1 fval 6 58 10 10 for freshwater and artificial seawater respectively fig 1 confidence intervals of kpvc w after fitting are provided in table 1 because kpvc w for phthalates are not available for comparison with literature values ks was calculated using kpvc w 108 60 l l 1 and kpvc sw 108 83 l l 1 to solve eq 7 the salting out coefficient ks for dehp is 0 46 log salting out factors for dehp are 0 08 and 0 23 in freshwater and artificial seawater respectively reported ks for di alkyl phthalates derived using the pplfer range from 0 24 for dimethyl phthalate dmp to 0 57 for di n octyl phthalate dnop they increase with the length of the hydrocarbon chain the corresponding log salting out factors range from 0 036 dmp to 0 084 dnop for less saline solutions csalt 0 15 m and from 0 12 dmp to 0 28 dnop for seawater csalt 0 5 m endo et al 2012 the salting out factors for dehp obtained in this study are slightly lower than those reported for the isomer dnop while dnop has straight hydrocarbon chains dehp is branched thus dnop log ko w 8 31 at 20 c is more hydrophobic than dehp log ko w 7 66 at 20 c archem llc 2023 and more affected by salting out an increase of kpvc w results in longer leaching half lives for the release of dehp from the pvc microplastics henkel et al 2022 the leaching half lives of dehp from the pvc microplastics are 503 years in 1 mm kcl 605 years in freshwater and 913 years in artificial seawater for the calculations stagnant conditions were assumed under environmental conditions leaching could be faster because weathering and fragmentation lead to an increase in the surface area of microplastics ter halle et al 2017 3 3 the leaching rate of dehp increases with increasing shaking speed for the duration of the experiments 120 d the time dependent leaching curves were linear r2 0 rpm 0 918 r2 25 rmp 0 968 r2 125 rmp 0 990 fig 2 the leaching rate increased with increasing shaking speed from 0 0035 Âµg d 1 at 0 rpm to 0 0164 Âµg d 1 and 0 122 Âµg d 1 for 25 rpm and 125 rpm respectively the leaching rate increased by a factor of 5 when increasing the shaking speed from 0 rpm to 25 rpm and by a factor of 35 when increasing the shaking speed from 0 rpm to 125 rpm an about 45 fold increase of the leaching rate has been reported for the release of dehp from pvc foil when increasing the speed of a magnetic stirrer from 0 to 150 rpm suhrhoff and scholz bÃ¶ttcher 2016 the leaching of dehp from polystyrene microplastics increased by a factor of 17 when increasing the speed of a magnetic stirrer from 0 rpm to 90 rpm gulizia et al 2023 the increase of leaching rates with increasing shaking speed observed in this study falls in the range of reported effects 3 4 an increasing flow velocity reduces the abl thickness and leaching half lives using the abld model with kpvc w of 108 60 l l 1 and daq of 4 45 10 10 m2 s 1 the abl thickness was fitted fig 2 the abl thickness decreased with increasing horizontal shaking speed from 1315 Âµm fval 1 51 10 11 at 0 rpm to 284 Âµm fval 1 22 10 10 at 25 rpm and to 38 4 Âµm fval 1 91 10 9 at 125 rpm confidence intervals for the abl thickness after fitting are provided in table 1 the abl thickness decreased by a factor of 5 and by a factor of 35 comparing leaching at 0 rpm to leaching at 25 and 125 rpm respectively although abl thicknesses for phthalate leaching from microplastics are not available and studies systematically addressing leaching at different flow velocities are scarce few reported values of the abl thickness in comparable systems are in accordance with our findings for well mixed systems 120 300 rpm the abl thickness ranges from 10 to 30 Âµm endo et al 2013 kwon et al 2006 lohmann 2012 seidensticker et al 2017 for slow water agitation 40 100 rpm an abl thickness of 58 300 Âµm and at stagnant flow conditions an abl thickness of 1900 5000 Âµm were reported kwon et al 2006 lee et al 2018 the abl thickness determined in this study at stagnant flow conditions might be too low because sample vials were slightly moved during sampling at stagnant and very slow flow conditions the abl thickness is in the order of magnitude of the radius of the pvc microplastics and radial diffusion requires consideration in more complex models endo et al 2013 differences of the abl thickness at comparable flow conditions could be due to different experimental set ups for example abl thicknesses determined from experiments using stirring bars for mixing were slightly lower than for shaking systems lee et al 2018 the abl thickness depends on the particle radius and to a minor degree on daq eqs 8 and 9 resulting in differences when comparing abld processes for particles of different sizes and for different additives using the same flow conditions suspended particles can lead to turbulence at the microplastic water interface and thereby to a lower abl thickness compared to that in a particle free system zhang et al 2006 in a well mixed activated carbon slurry for example abl of 1 5 Âµm and 2 5 Âµm were reported hale et al 2009 thompson et al 2015 an increase of the abl thickness with decreasing flow velocity results in longer leaching half lives for the release of dehp from the pvc microplastics henkel et al 2022 the corresponding leaching half lives are 503 years at 125 rpm 3722 years at 25 rpm and 17 238 years at 0 rpm assuming that only the abl thickness changes and all other parameters remain constant compared to salinity the flow conditions have a stronger influence on the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics 3 5 leaching in aquatic model environments rivers and the ocean in the aquatic environment not only salinity and turbulence but also several other environmental factors influence abld and can lead to changes of the leaching half lives of dehp henkel et al 2022 leaching half lives in natural freshwaters like rivers and in the ocean can be estimated by using representative environmental conditions eq 3 the water temperature in rivers ranges from 4 to 30 c van vliet et al 2013 taking into account the respective dynamic viscosity of water at each temperature s1 daq of dehp in rivers was calculated worch 1993 besides the weather conditions in the catchment area the hydraulic radius bed roughness and slope of the river bed influence the flow velocity and thereby the flow conditions verzano et al 2012 using the abld model the abl thickness representing flow conditions was calculated for daq at each water temperature eqs 8 and 9 the Î± value eq 9 was determined using experimental data s2 the flow velocities at no flow and turbulent flow from our experiments were used as upper and lower limits while doc concentrations of 1 2 mg l 1 are typical for pristine streams the doc concentration of rivers varies between 2 and 10 mg l 1 thurman 1985 doc leads to facilitated transport of phthalates through the abl koelmans et al 2013 the mass transfer coefficient through the abl and kpvc w doc were calculated at each doc concentration eq 4 and eq 5 mott 2002 accounting for the salinity in freshwater systems by including the log salting factor of 0 08 we determined for freshwater kpvc w doc slightly increased nacl is the major salt in seawater given the same salinity in the solution ks values have been shown to be similar in nacl solutions and seawater schwarzenbach et al 2003 temperature has a minor effect on salting in nacl solutions and seawater and was therefore not included in the calculation of ks endo et al 2012 using the respective daq kpvc w doc and the abl thickness for constant flow conditions leaching half lives of dehp in rivers were calculated fig 3 the lowest leaching half life of 49 years was found at the highest temperature turbulent flow conditions and at the highest doc concentration in contrast the highest leaching half life was calculated to be 12 151 years at the lowest temperature no flow conditions and lowest doc concentration assuming an average water temperature for rivers of 17 c and Î· 1 079 g m 1 s 1 engineering toolbox 2004 van vliet et al 2013 daq for dehp of 4 09 10 10 m2 s 1 was calculated worch 1993 rivers are mostly characterized by turbulent flow conditions trinci et al 2017 accounting for the salinity in freshwater systems and assuming a doc concentration of 5 29 mg l 1 reported as the global average in rivers dai et al 2012 log kpvc w doc in a river was 7 99 mott 2002 the corresponding average leaching half life of dehp in a river was calculated to be 122 years calculations could be applied to leaching of dehp in the ocean leading to different leaching half lives due to changes of the water temperature 0 26 c ipcc 2013 and doc concentration 0 5 1 3 mg l 1 guo et al 1995 thomas et al 2005 to account for the higher salinity influencing kpvc w a log salting factor of 0 23 was used while barely any water movement can be expected at the bottom of the sea close to the water surface and at the seacoast turbulent flow conditions can be found calculated leaching half lives in the ocean are higher than in freshwater systems due to lower temperatures and lower doc concentrations and range from 398 to 36 906 years fig 3 water temperature and salinity in freshwater systems clearly affect leaching of dehp from pvc to a minor degree however flow conditions are highly variable in rivers and influence leaching verzano et al 2012 during high flow events the doc concentration and the flow velocity in rivers can increase lee et al 2019 verzano et al 2012 possibly leading to higher leaching rates transport models of nano and microplastics showed that size and density influence the fate of particles in rivers besseling et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016 taking into account the relatively large particle size r 2 mm and that the density of the pvc microplastics 1 21 g cm 3 is higher compared to the density of water river sediments are expected to be an important sink for pvc microplastics and 90 100 of plastic particles 0 2 mm were shown to be retained nizzetto et al 2016 microplastics settled onto the river bed can be buried and remain in the sediments besseling et al 2017 once buried in the sediments the abl thickness will increase and leaching will be slowed down while leached dehp may sorb to the sediments assuming slow flow conditions the average leaching half life in a river is estimated to be 900 years in organic rich sediments in contrast kpvc w would be lower accelerating leaching estuarine sediments have been shown to retain 50 of dehp and they can act as a sink too turner and rawling 2000 while degradation half lives of freely dissolved dehp in natural waters are 2 15 days particle bound dehp is less available for degradation by microorganisms staples et al 1997 turner and rawling 2000 while rivers are an important transport route for plastics to the ocean river sediments are an important sink for dense pvc microplastics our results reveal very long leaching half lives of phthalates and that pvc microplastics can be considered a long lived source of these with potential adverse effects on living organisms 4 conclusion we showed that salinity and turbulence influence the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics by combining experimental data with modeling time dependent leaching experiments into aqueous solutions showed that highly hydrophobic phthalates like dehp are salted out to minor degree in freshwater and to a higher degree in seawater while changing the flow conditions strongly influenced the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics salinity played a minor role using experimental leaching data the influence of salinity and turbulence on abld could be assessed even at high turbulence and low salinity fastest here presented scenario the abld model agreed well with the experimental data and could be identified as the governing diffusion process calculating characteristic leaching times i e leaching half lives key environmental factors influencing leaching were identified specifically we show that salinity turbulence temperature and the concentration of doc strongly influence abld limited leaching process specific parameters for abld were determined including these parameters for environmentally relevant conditions into leaching models time frames for the leaching of dehp from pvc microplastics into different aquatic environments were determined leaching processes in rivers and the ocean were compared showing that leaching is expected to be faster in rivers t1 2 49 years than in the ocean t1 2 398 years this study provides a mechanistic understanding of leaching processes in aquatic systems and of the effect of environmental factors on leaching in natural aquatic environments leaching half lives are subject to the variability of environmental conditions accounting for dynamic and site specific conditions leaching models can be adjusted accordingly to predict environmental exposure concentrations of phthalates our study provides new insights how environmental factors such as salinity and turbulence significantly influence the leaching of additives from microplastics and that under environmental relevant conditions

14653,contamination of rivers by nitrate and pesticides poses a risk for aquatic ecosystems in lowland catchments that are often intensively used for agriculture here the hyporheic zone the streambed underneath the stream plays a vital role due to its efficient self purification capacity the present study aims to evaluate the denitrification and transformation potential of 14 pesticides and three transformation products in the hyporheic sediment from a lowland stream with a high n load and by comparing an agricultural straightened section to a natural meandering part of the stream influenced by different groundwater discharges batch experiments were set up to evaluate the denitrification and pesticide transformation potentials in hyporheic sediment from two depths 5 15 cm a and 15 25 cm b our results revealed that i differences between the agricultural and natural sections of the river did not influence pollutant attenuation ii both the nitrate and pesticide attenuation processes were more rapid in the upper a layer compared to the b layer due to higher microbial abundance iii high groundwater discharge reduced the denitrification potential while pesticide transformation was unaffected iv denitrification correlated with denitrifier abundance nirk in the b layer while this correlation was not seen in the a layer and v a microbial community with low diversity can explain limited transformation for the majority of tested pesticides overall our results suggest that high groundwater discharge zones with reduced residence time in the hyporheic zone can be an important source of pesticides and nitrate to surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite the implementation of the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec in 2000 47 of eu surface waters did not reach the goal of good qualitative and quantitative status by 2015 voulvoulis et al 2017 elevated nutrient concentration was a primary reason for this poikane et al 2019 further the latest status report on eu surface water revealed that at least 35 of surface waters failed to have a good chemical status eea report no 7 2018 however the chemical and ecological status of small streams in the wfd monitoring program is not included despite these often being located next to agricultural fields when including small streams and seasonality weisner et al 2022 found that the regulatory acceptable concentrations were exceeded for 39 different pesticides at 81 of monitoring sites lowland catchments are often impacted by intensive agriculture and are generally characterized by a high groundwater table and groundwater abstraction while the lowland river has been regulated and receives artificial drainage to improve the surrounding agriculture peterson and benning 2013 waseem et al 2020 the hyporheic zone is the streambed below the river where river water and groundwater mix this zone is recognized for its natural and efficient self purification capacity boano et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2019 here pollutant attenuation is influenced by the interplay between hydrological flow direction and velocity chemical e g sorption and biological microbial transformation processes krause et al 2017 2011 spatial and temporal heterogeneities are often observed within this zone with varying ph redox conditions nutrient availability salinity and organic matter content boano et al 2014 danczak et al 2016 lewandowski et al 2019 nelson et al 2019 due to the heterogeneity and temporal changes in environmental parameters the bacterial community in the hyporheic zone is highly versatile and typically described by a high diversity bech et al 2022 danczak et al 2016 nelson et al 2019 2020 saup et al 2019 a particularly essential hyporheic reaction is denitrification where microorganisms denitrify nitrate the nitrate may originate from infiltrating water but often coupled nitrification denitrification reactions occur as water infiltrates anaerobic microzones within the aerobic hyporheic zone harvey et al 2013 complete denitrification removes nitrogen from the aquatic system where nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere for example fischer et al 2005 found that the hyporheic zone removed 37 76 of the total nitrogen input to a large lowland river and hence termed this zone the rivers liver denitrification consists of several steps coupled with the oxidation of organic compounds under anaerobic conditions even though a few complete denitrifiers have been isolated e g pseudomonas aeruginosa and paracoccus denitrificans commonly several organisms encode parts of the denitrification process graf et al 2014 zumft 1997 it has been found that overall hyporheic ecosystem respiration correlates positively to denitrification activity mulholland et al 2008 suggesting that these traits are widely distributed within the microbial community in the hyporheic zone it appears challenging to pinpoint specific factors that control denitrification hence merill and tonjes 2014 suggested that often one specific parameter cannot predict changes in nitrogen concentration due to a complicated interplay among different factors common variables that have been reported to influence denitrification include nitrate concentration dissolved organic carbon doc grain size presence of anoxic zones and microbial denitrifiers abundance and residence time alexander et al 2009 battin et al 2016 boano et al 2014 harvey et al 2013 mulholland et al 2008 as described for denitrification solute residence time doc redox conditions and microbial community structure are also key parameters influencing pesticide attenuation in the hyporheic zone while denitrification is widely distributed within the hyporheic zone the transformation of organic pollutants can be more species specific therefore an abundant and diverse microbial community has been linked to organic pollutant transformation bech et al 2022 hÃ¶hne et al 2022 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 2018 often surface water contains more easily degradable dom than recalcitrant dom from upwelling groundwater mueller et al 2021 found a positive correlation to the transformation of 12 out of 17 organic pollutants and easily degradable dom and vice versa for poorly degradable dom therefore dominating water flow directions will influence the transformation potential in the hyporheic zone in addition to easily degradable dom schaper et al 2019 found that the transformation of 28 organic pollutants was highest in the upper 10 cm despite oxic conditions down to 30 cm where the authors concluded the reason being increased microbial activity and chemical turnover rates in the upper sediment unlike denitrification organic pollutants are transformed preferentially under oxic and suboxic conditions schaper et al 2018 porewater velocity and dispersion mostly control water residence times in the hyporheic zone while the pollutant residence time is further influenced by compound specific traits where sorption and desorption processes influence their retardation the transformation of pesticides is further important because the pesticides and the transformation products can have a negative effect on microbial driven ecosystem services e g nutrient cycling and transformation of xenobiotics jacobsen and hjelmsÃ¸ 2014 for example michel et al 2021 found that denitrification was reduced in groundwater when impacted by s metolachlor propiconazole and their respective main metabolites esa metolachlor and 1 2 4 triazole at environmental realistic concentrations 2 10 Âµg l 1 most previous hyporheic studies have investigated transformation of pharmaceuticals downstream from wwtp ma et al 2021 while much less attention has been given to agricultural catchments dominated by diffuse pollution in the form of nitrate used as fertilizers as well as organic contaminants such as pesticides and veterinary pharmaceuticals representing a serious threat to our groundwater resources while the removal of nitrate relies on denitrification under anoxic conditions the transformation of most organic contaminants is favored by aerobic conditions although both pollutant types often occur together the interplay between the processes that lead to their elimination is rarely studied noteworthy an important difference is the environmental load pattern where pharmaceaticals from wwtp are a continuous point source and pesticides originating from agricultural fields are non point diffuse pollutions thus pesticide concentrations are often lower seasonally impacted and may enter the river via polluted groundwater surface runoff or drainage therefore it is important to evaluate the pesticide transformation potential at environmental realistic concentrations further microbial driven ecosystem services such as denitrification and pesticide transformation in the hyporheic zone are influenced by many interlinked parameters hence in order expand our knowledge it is important to question this with a holistic experimental approach the present study evaluated the denitrification and transformation potential of 14 pesticides and three transformation products in a typical agriculturally impacted lowland stream with a high n load we expected that spatially varying environmental conditions would lead to a variation in denitrification and transformation potentials where i the pollution attenuation potential in the hyporheic sediment would differ between an agricultural straightened section and a natural meandering part of the stream ii high groundwater discharge with recalcitrant dom would reduce denitrification and pesticide transformation potential iii denitrification and transformation potentials were highest in the upper hyporheic sediment where microbial diversity and activity are the highest and iv denitrification rates would be related to denitrifier abundance based on quantification of nirk and nosz 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the lowland holtum stream is located in the skjern river catchment denmark with a stream catchment area of 106 km2 characterized by agriculture 50 forest 25 and urban areas 25 jensen et al 2018 poulsen et al 2015 previously groundwater surface water interaction studies have been carried out at four stations along a 12 km stretch of the stream karan et al 2013 poulsen et al 2015 sebok et al 2014 steiness et al 2019 based on the existing knowledge the present work focused on station 1 and 4 station 1 is a straightened part of the stream with drained agricultural land on one side and grassland on the opposite side fig 1 the aquifer is unconfined on the agricultural side and partly confined on the grassland side by a 1 m thick peat layer steiness et al 2019 groundwater flows into the stream from both sides the n load at station 1 to the stream is very high with an estimated yearly discharge of up to 708 kg n year 1 where surface runoff from the grassland or downstream wetland is a significant contributor while the drain on the agricultural side is estimated to only contribute 16 kg n year 1 steiness et al 2021 national monitoring well dgu 96 1981 located 2 km upstream contains 2 1 mg o2 l 49 mg no3 l 48 6 mg so4 l and 1 05 mg doc l based on a 30 year average station 4 is a more natural part of the stream surrounded by wetland on one side and a steep hill with trees on the other side fig 1 land use is agricultural north of the wetland and woodland on the south side of the stream karan et al 2013 water analysis below the hyporheic zone and in the wetland revealed an aerobic shallow groundwater zone 0 3 m with oxygen and nitrate concentrations up to 58 3 mg l while nitrate was not detected in the deeper aquifer karan et al 2013 at both stations groundwater discharge measurements have revealed variations across stream transects whereas at station 1 the mean discharge over 9 months ranged from 0 07 to 1 73 m d 1 jensen and engesgaard 2011 at station 4 the mean discharge over two years ranged from 0 11 to 0 96 m d 1 karan et al 2013 2 2 sediment and water sampling groundwater discharge was tentatively measured in the pipes diameter 5 cm used for sediment core sampling the pipes were pressed into the sediment and the increase in internal pipe water levels relative to the river water level were measured for up to three hours by using this method we could determine the groundwater discharge in the same sediment sampled for further investigations and to compare the discharge between the four sampling sites the sediment cores 30 40 cm were collected in transparent polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes 5 cm Ã¸ and 1 75 mm wall thickness by a direct push method and lifted by applying vacuum to the top of the pipes the bottom of the pipe was immediately sealed before the stream water was decanted and the top was sealed eight columns were collected at each of the four sampling sites and stored on ice until being further processed fig s1 duplicate sediment columns were sliced in an upper a layer 5 15 cm and lower b layer 15 25 cm

relative centrifugal force of 1500 to extract pore water the pore water was analyzed as described above 2 4 denitrification rate determination denitrification rates were determined by the acetylene block method smith et al 1978 briefly 100 g sediment was added to a 116 ml bottle with 20 ml 1 mmol nitrate solution under constant n2 flushing and sealed using a 1 cm thick butyl rubber stopper acetylene gas was added with a syringe to a concentration of 10 in the headspace to inhibit the last step in denitrification conversion of n2o to n2 and n2o production in the headspace was followed for up to 2 weeks denitrification rates mmolno3 yr kgdw were calculated from the rates of n2o development in mmol per kg of incubated sediment per year multiplied by 2 2 n n2o 2 5 chemicals the

10 bioinformatics sequences were processed on the galaxy platform using frogs escudiÃ© et al 2018 based on the galaxy analysis platform afgan et al 2016 sequences were demultiplexed dereplicated sequence quality checked and oligonucleotides linker pads and barcodes were removed from sequences then sequences were filtered on additional criteria sequences were removed from data sets if they exhibited ambiguous bases or did not match expectations in amplicon size remaining sequences were clustered into otus based on the iterative swarm algorithm then chimeras and singletons otus containing only one sequence were removed bacterial double affiliation was performed by blasting otus against the silva database 138 1 quast et al 2013 allowing for 97 similarity to consider two otus as identical otus with affiliation 100 at the phylum level were removed from the data set otus at lower taxonomic ranks than the phylum level were considered as unidentified when the rdp bootstrap value was 0 70 similarity of the diversity in the triplicat dna extractions was checked and further analysis of the data used one extraction for each sample diversity data was normalized at 3911

results 3 1 groundwater discharge and porewater geochemistry different groundwater discharge rates were measured along the holtum stream at the straightened and agriculturally impacted part station 1 groundwater discharge rates of 0 12 0 037 m day 1 s1 a and 0 24 0 091 m day 1 s1 g were measured while larger differences were observed along the natural part of the stream with discharge rates of 0 02 m day 1 s4 l and 1 16 0 165 m day 1 s4 h a negative linear correlation between groundwater discharge and toc for both the a layer r2 0 96 and the b layer r2 0 98 was present a pca of the water chemistry from surface water drainage station 1 and porewater from the a and b layers showed three distinct water chemistry signatures explaining 62 of the variability fig 2 table s2 variables that contributed most to explaining the variability along the second axis were different for the surface water and porewater from the two depths surface waters and the a layer porewater clustered with no3 and doc because the surface water impacts porewater in the upper a layer of the four a layer porewater samples s4 l appears less impacted by the surface water the b layer and drainage water clustered mostly with fe and mn variations between the four b layer porewaters are distributed along the first axis where the two samples from the station 4 cluster the drainage and s1 a cluster and s1 g differ from the other samples defined by parameters such as ba so4 and cl the more distinct differences between the b layer samples suggest that the groundwater with different chemical signatures impacts this porewater to a greater extent 3 2 bacterial community structure analysis similarly to the water chemistry pca plot the mds plot of the bacterial community for each sediment replicate revealed that the four a layer samples clustered together which again suggests an impact from the surface water whereas the b layer sediment contained distinct communities at the two stations fig 3 3 3 bacterial community diversity fig s2 shows the phyla to which the most abundant otu were affiliated while fig 4 shows bacterial and archaea diversity of the otu representing 2 sequences at the genus level or the closest level of identification several otu dominated diversity in the a layers of all four sampling sites two otus representing between 5 and 20 of the relative sequence abundance are affiliated to the gallionellaceae family this family contains one genus and one established species gallionella ferruginea found in groundwater where anaerobic waters meet oxygen indeed this chemolithotrophic bacteria can oxidize iron hallbeck and pedersen 2014 this otu is also found in the b layer of station 1 on the agricultural field side suggesting the presence of oxygen in these samples a second otu common to all a horizon samples is affiliated to the family comamonadaceae this affiliation does not give any insight to the metabolic activity of this otu as this family is very diverse with a phenotypic diversity that includes aerobic organotrophs anaerobic denitrifiers and fe3 reducing bacteria hydrogen oxidizers photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic bacteria and fermentative bacteria willems 2014 next are three otu which are most closely affiliated to the phylum nitrospirota one that is present in all samples but represents the highest relative sequence abundance in the b layer at station 1 up to 19 and two that are only present in samples of the a layer s1 a and s4 h this phylum contains nitrifying taxa which oxidize nitrite to nitrate nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and commamox bacteria although without further analysis we cannot confirm their presence here except through the functional gene abundance measures if we now look at the b horizon diversity at s1 there are similarities with the a horizon although the otu affiliated to the family of comamonadaceae is no longer abundant and an otu identified as an archaea phylogenetically closest to the class bathyarchaeia is present representing up to 12 of the relative sequence abundance this phylum contains global generalists and is widespread with many metabolic capabilities including dissimilatory nitrogen and sulfur reduction zhou et al 2018 also dominant in s1 b is an otu closely related to a sulfate reducing deltaproteobacteria member sva0485 concheri et al 2017 also found in anoxic sediments vuillemin et al 2018 in the s4 h sediment samples three other otus are found at relatively high sequence abundances one is not affiliated further than belonging to bacteria the other two are an otu affiliated to candidatus methylomirabilis and an otu from the order of rokubacteriales the first contains bacteria such as ca methylomirabilis oxyfera lanthanidiphila and limnetica which oxidize methane using a unique pathway of denitrification that tentatively produces n2 and o2 from nitric oxide no graf et al 2018 versantvoort et al 2018 rokubacteriales are attached to the same order as methylomirabilales previously from a candidatus phylum they are now associated to the phylum methylomirabilota they are detected in diverse terrestrial habitats and in fens were positively correlated with ph total nitrogen content and availability of ca and mg ivanova et al 2021 the diversity indexes fig s3 showed a higher number of observed and calculated chao1 otus in the a layer samples compared to the b layers diversity indexes shannon and inv simpsons index appeared generally higher in station 4 than station 1 although these differences were not all statistically significant 3 4 potential denitrification rates denitrification reaction rates mmol no3 yr kgdw were generally fastest in the a compared to the b layers with differences in between fig 5 s4 h with the highest groundwater discharge revealed the slowest denitrification potential in both the a and b layers in contrast s4 l impacted by the slowest discharge revealed the fastest denitrification potential in both the a and b layers when comparing the potential across samples within the same depth the sediments are further characterized by an overall higher bacterial density in the a layer compared to the b layer the gene nirk is found in similar concentrations across all sediment samples suggesting that the nitrite reductase step in denitrification is very abundant in the b layer nirk concentrations higher than 16s quantification should be considered as a high abundance and is most likely explained by an underestimation of the total bacterial abundance by the 16s rrna gene assay a pearson correlation analysis for sediment samples n 16 in the b layer table s4 revealed a positive correlation between denitrification and nirk 0 8 p 0 0002 while no correlation between the two is found in the a layer the nosz gene the last step in denitrification is present in all a layer samples while absent in the b layer at s1 the nosz gene did not correlate to the observed denitrification rates while there is a correlation to 16s aob amoa and toc in the b layer the potential for nitrification within the sediment is evaluated based on archeal aoa amoa and bacterial 16s aob abundances in the a layer aob is present across the four sediments and only detected in the s4 h in the b layer aoa amoa is less abundant at the agricultural impacted s1 compared to s4 further at s4 there is a higher abundance of aoa amoa at s4 h compared to s4 l correlation analysis revealed a lack of correlation for aoa amoa in both depths while for aob correlations to chao1 denitrification rate 16s nirk and nosz is seen in the b layer 3 5 transformation potential the potential for transformation in the holtum stream is limited out of 14 tested pesticides table 1 only prothioconazole metamitrone pyraclostrobin and metolachlor were transformed dt50 values were calculated for metamitrone pyraclostrobin and metolachlor table 3 showing an overall faster transformation in the a layer as compared to the b layer for metolachlor the transformation product moa was detected in higher concentrations in the a layer compared to the b layer while mesa was only detected sporadically fig s4 for prothioconazole the transformation is measured through the formation of prothioconazole desthio and therefore a dt50 value was not estimated fig s5 surprisingly transformation occurred in the b layer at station 1 compared to station 4 and overall less transformation was seen in the a layer the faster degradation in the a layer links to the microbial community fig 5 where the pathways identified using the frogsfunc tool escudiÃ© et al 2018 relates 16s rrna otu diversity to known metabolisms kegg database these data show that a higher percentage of pathways related to xenobiotic degradation was found in the a layer of the sediments independently from the site location 4 discussion no apparent difference in either denitrification potential pesticide transformation or microbial community composition between the two stations revealed an impact from the agricultural field at station 1 steiness et al 2021 found that the n load at station 1 to the stream is very high and amongst the highest recorded in denmark where the drainage from the agricultural field covered 10 of the input and wetlands covered 59 of the input previous studies at the same site have detected nitrate concentration in groundwater up to 60 mg l 1 karan et al 2013 steiness et al 2019 preferential flow plays an essential role in nitrate discharge from aerobic superficial aquifers while deeper anaerobic groundwater often is nitrate free due to denitrification dahl et al 2007 sebok and mÃ¼ller 2019 alexander et al 2009 found reduced in stream nitrate removal by denitrification when nitrate concentrations and discharges are high another essential source of no3 is in situ nitrification by aob and aoa a similar aob concentration was found across the sediment in the a layer and at s4 there was also a higher abundance of aoa amoa also the high presence of iron oxidizing bacteria in many samples suggests presence of oxygen and that the sediment isn t that reductive suggesting nitrification to be an important process in the tested sediments 4 1 potential denitrification rates with the high loads of nitrate to the holtum stream the potential for denitrification in the hyporheic sediment becomes essential to remove nitrogen from the aquatic environment factors influencing denitrification potential differed between the two depths investigated in the present study the upper a layer was characterized by a faster denitrification potential most likely explained by higher bacterial abundance and higher nitrate and doc concentrations fig 5 table s2 when comparing the denitrification potential in the four a layer samples s4 h with the fastest groundwater discharge revealed a reduced denitrification potential in the batch experiments further s4 h sediments and porewater were characterized by less toc and doc fig 5 table s2 quantified denitrifiers abundance nosz or nirk did not correlate with the denitrification rate in the upper a layer which suggests that the abundance of these denitrifiers was not limiting denitrification it is possible that other nitrate reducing processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra may predominate in this layer wherein bioavailable nitrogen is conserved as ammonium indeed schaper et al 2019 found that nitrate removal in the upper 10 cm was primarily driven by biotic assimilation while denitrification occurred in the deeper layer within a hyporheic zone further the nosz and nirk genes are based on actual denitrifiers in the sediment samples influenced by in situ varying aerobic and anaerobic conditions hence it is important to note that quantifying the genes alone does not provide information regarding their expression or activity as these factors can be influenced by e g varying aerobic and anaerobic conditions in situ in contrast the batch experiments conducted in anaerobic conditions capture the potential denitrifying activity nitrate concentrations in the present study in the stream and the a layer porewater is between 5 and 11 mg l suggesting that nitrate is not the limiting factor for denitrification hence the most likely limiting factor in the a layer is easily degradable organic matter availability in the b layer there was a strong correlation between the denitrifiers nirk and the denitrification rate implying that these bacteria have a limiting role in addition a correlation was observed between toc and the denitrification rate except for s1 a porewater in the b layer was characterized by a low nitrate concentration previous studies have found a positive correlations between residence time and denitrification kaushal et al 2008 puckett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 which is in accordance with our observations here we found within the a layers that the denitrification potential was lowest in s4 h where the fastest groundwater discharge occurred concurrently the highest denitrification potential at s4 l correlated with the slowest groundwater discharges hence the combination of fast flow and low denitrification suggests that this preferential groundwater discharge is a significant source of nitrate to the stream water 4 2 transformation potential as described for denitrification solute residence time doc redox conditions and microbial community structure are key parameters influencing pesticide attenuation in the hyporheic zone in addition the natural transformation of pesticides is influenced by sorption and other compound specific properties only four out of the 14 tested pesticides were transformed in the present study comparing stations 1 agriculture and 4 natural no clear trend indicates that agriculturally impacted hyporheic sediment has a higher transformation potential except for prothioconazole here the formation of the transformation product prothioconazole desthio in the b layer at station 1 s5 was seen estimated dt50 values from the a layer for pyraclostrobin and metamitron were in the range of values reported by ppdb database table 1 while dt50 was approximately five times longer for metolachlor while denitrification is widely distributed within the hyporheic zone the transformation of organic pollutants can be more species specific therefore an abundant and diverse microbial community has been linked to organic pollutant transformation in the hyporheic zone bech et al 2022 hÃ¶hne et al 2022 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 2018 the vertical direction of water flow influences the nutrient and organic matter content limiting microbial transformation possibilities battin et al 2016 under gaining conditions where water from the subsurface groundwater system discharges into the surface water body the hyporheic zone is influenced by nutrient rich groundwater e g no3 and so4 and under losing conditions where water from the surface water body infiltrates into the subsurface by oxic surface water with labile organic matter boulton et al 2010 mueller et al 2021 found a positive correlation between the transformation of 12 out of 17 organic pollutants and easily degradable dom and vice versa for poorly degradable dom therefore a higher concentration of dom in the porewater in the a layer may explain faster transformation compared to the b layer in addition to easy degradable dom schaper et al 2019 found that the transformation of 28 organic pollutants was highest in the upper 10 cm despite oxic conditions down to 30 cm the authors concluded this was due to increased microbial activity and chemical turnover rates in the upper sediment a higher microbial abundance most likely explains the faster transformation potential found in the upper a layer than in the b layer in addition several pathways related to xenobiotic degradation were found in the a layer while missing from the b layer suggesting a generally higher xenobiotic transformation potential for example the detection of a pathway for fluorobenzoate pah ethylbenzene and atrazine degradation were either absent from the b layer or significantly reduced compared to the a layer most recent studies have focussed on processes in the hyporheic zone downstream from wwtp where commonly half or more of tested pharmaceuticals are transformed hÃ¶hne et al 2022 mueller et al 2021 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 here wwtp effluent is a continuous point source of pharmaceuticals and organic matter while pesticides originating from agricultural fields are non point diffuse pollutions thus pesticide concentrations are often lower and may enter the river via polluted groundwater and surface runoff or drainage the combination of low microbial diversity and high groundwater discharge may explain the general low pesticide transformation potential in the holtum stream fig 6 5 conclusion the two primary agricultural pollutants nitrate and pesticides are responsible for reduced water quality according to eu water framework directive in the present study the pollutant attenuation potential was assessed in the hyporheic zone in the holtum stream one of denmark s most nitrate polluted streams the stream is characterized by upwelling oxic and anoxic groundwater with high nitrate concentrations our main results revealed i differences between the agricultural straightened part of the stream s1 and the natural meandering part of the stream s4 did not influence pollutant attenuation ii both the nitrate and pesticide attenuation processes were more rapid in the upper a layer compared to the b layer due to higher microbial abundance and doc content iii high groundwater discharge reduced the denitrification potential while pesticide transformation was unaffected iv denitrification correlated with nitrifier abundance nirk in the b layer while this correlation was not seen in the a layer suggesting that another parameter limited the process v in the a layer several pathways related to xenobiotic degradation were identified which may explain the faster transformation and vi the hyporheic sediment revealed a slow and limited transformation for the majority of tested pesticides which a microbial community with low diversity can explain further research is needed to comprehensively assess the influence of small scale spatial heterogeneity in discharge rates on hyporheic zone attenuation of organic and inorganic pollutants the presence of high discharge window with limited microbial diversity can potentially regulate the influx and efflux of pollutants in river systems moreover investigating the dynamic interaction between spatially varying aerobic and anaerobic conditions over short distances and their impact on pollutant attenuation processes is also crucial declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14653,contamination of rivers by nitrate and pesticides poses a risk for aquatic ecosystems in lowland catchments that are often intensively used for agriculture here the hyporheic zone the streambed underneath the stream plays a vital role due to its efficient self purification capacity the present study aims to evaluate the denitrification and transformation potential of 14 pesticides and three transformation products in the hyporheic sediment from a lowland stream with a high n load and by comparing an agricultural straightened section to a natural meandering part of the stream influenced by different groundwater discharges batch experiments were set up to evaluate the denitrification and pesticide transformation potentials in hyporheic sediment from two depths 5 15 cm a and 15 25 cm b our results revealed that i differences between the agricultural and natural sections of the river did not influence pollutant attenuation ii both the nitrate and pesticide attenuation processes were more rapid in the upper a layer compared to the b layer due to higher microbial abundance iii high groundwater discharge reduced the denitrification potential while pesticide transformation was unaffected iv denitrification correlated with denitrifier abundance nirk in the b layer while this correlation was not seen in the a layer and v a microbial community with low diversity can explain limited transformation for the majority of tested pesticides overall our results suggest that high groundwater discharge zones with reduced residence time in the hyporheic zone can be an important source of pesticides and nitrate to surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite the implementation of the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec in 2000 47 of eu surface waters did not reach the goal of good qualitative and quantitative status by 2015 voulvoulis et al 2017 elevated nutrient concentration was a primary reason for this poikane et al 2019 further the latest status report on eu surface water revealed that at least 35 of surface waters failed to have a good chemical status eea report no 7 2018 however the chemical and ecological status of small streams in the wfd monitoring program is not included despite these often being located next to agricultural fields when including small streams and seasonality weisner et al 2022 found that the regulatory acceptable concentrations were exceeded for 39 different pesticides at 81 of monitoring sites lowland catchments are often impacted by intensive agriculture and are generally characterized by a high groundwater table and groundwater abstraction while the lowland river has been regulated and receives artificial drainage to improve the surrounding agriculture peterson and benning 2013 waseem et al 2020 the hyporheic zone is the streambed below the river where river water and groundwater mix this zone is recognized for its natural and efficient self purification capacity boano et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2019 here pollutant attenuation is influenced by the interplay between hydrological flow direction and velocity chemical e g sorption and biological microbial transformation processes krause et al 2017 2011 spatial and temporal heterogeneities are often observed within this zone with varying ph redox conditions nutrient availability salinity and organic matter content boano et al 2014 danczak et al 2016 lewandowski et al 2019 nelson et al 2019 due to the heterogeneity and temporal changes in environmental parameters the bacterial community in the hyporheic zone is highly versatile and typically described by a high diversity bech et al 2022 danczak et al 2016 nelson et al 2019 2020 saup et al 2019 a particularly essential hyporheic reaction is denitrification where microorganisms denitrify nitrate the nitrate may originate from infiltrating water but often coupled nitrification denitrification reactions occur as water infiltrates anaerobic microzones within the aerobic hyporheic zone harvey et al 2013 complete denitrification removes nitrogen from the aquatic system where nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere for example fischer et al 2005 found that the hyporheic zone removed 37 76 of the total nitrogen input to a large lowland river and hence termed this zone the rivers liver denitrification consists of several steps coupled with the oxidation of organic compounds under anaerobic conditions even though a few complete denitrifiers have been isolated e g pseudomonas aeruginosa and paracoccus denitrificans commonly several organisms encode parts of the denitrification process graf et al 2014 zumft 1997 it has been found that overall hyporheic ecosystem respiration correlates positively to denitrification activity mulholland et al 2008 suggesting that these traits are widely distributed within the microbial community in the hyporheic zone it appears challenging to pinpoint specific factors that control denitrification hence merill and tonjes 2014 suggested that often one specific parameter cannot predict changes in nitrogen concentration due to a complicated interplay among different factors common variables that have been reported to influence denitrification include nitrate concentration dissolved organic carbon doc grain size presence of anoxic zones and microbial denitrifiers abundance and residence time alexander et al 2009 battin et al 2016 boano et al 2014 harvey et al 2013 mulholland et al 2008 as described for denitrification solute residence time doc redox conditions and microbial community structure are also key parameters influencing pesticide attenuation in the hyporheic zone while denitrification is widely distributed within the hyporheic zone the transformation of organic pollutants can be more species specific therefore an abundant and diverse microbial community has been linked to organic pollutant transformation bech et al 2022 hÃ¶hne et al 2022 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 2018 often surface water contains more easily degradable dom than recalcitrant dom from upwelling groundwater mueller et al 2021 found a positive correlation to the transformation of 12 out of 17 organic pollutants and easily degradable dom and vice versa for poorly degradable dom therefore dominating water flow directions will influence the transformation potential in the hyporheic zone in addition to easily degradable dom schaper et al 2019 found that the transformation of 28 organic pollutants was highest in the upper 10 cm despite oxic conditions down to 30 cm where the authors concluded the reason being increased microbial activity and chemical turnover rates in the upper sediment unlike denitrification organic pollutants are transformed preferentially under oxic and suboxic conditions schaper et al 2018 porewater velocity and dispersion mostly control water residence times in the hyporheic zone while the pollutant residence time is further influenced by compound specific traits where sorption and desorption processes influence their retardation the transformation of pesticides is further important because the pesticides and the transformation products can have a negative effect on microbial driven ecosystem services e g nutrient cycling and transformation of xenobiotics jacobsen and hjelmsÃ¸ 2014 for example michel et al 2021 found that denitrification was reduced in groundwater when impacted by s metolachlor propiconazole and their respective main metabolites esa metolachlor and 1 2 4 triazole at environmental realistic concentrations 2 10 Âµg l 1 most previous hyporheic studies have investigated transformation of pharmaceuticals downstream from wwtp ma et al 2021 while much less attention has been given to agricultural catchments dominated by diffuse pollution in the form of nitrate used as fertilizers as well as organic contaminants such as pesticides and veterinary pharmaceuticals representing a serious threat to our groundwater resources while the removal of nitrate relies on denitrification under anoxic conditions the transformation of most organic contaminants is favored by aerobic conditions although both pollutant types often occur together the interplay between the processes that lead to their elimination is rarely studied noteworthy an important difference is the environmental load pattern where pharmaceaticals from wwtp are a continuous point source and pesticides originating from agricultural fields are non point diffuse pollutions thus pesticide concentrations are often lower seasonally impacted and may enter the river via polluted groundwater surface runoff or drainage therefore it is important to evaluate the pesticide transformation potential at environmental realistic concentrations further microbial driven ecosystem services such as denitrification and pesticide transformation in the hyporheic zone are influenced by many interlinked parameters hence in order expand our knowledge it is important to question this with a holistic experimental approach the present study evaluated the denitrification and transformation potential of 14 pesticides and three transformation products in a typical agriculturally impacted lowland stream with a high n load we expected that spatially varying environmental conditions would lead to a variation in denitrification and transformation potentials where i the pollution attenuation potential in the hyporheic sediment would differ between an agricultural straightened section and a natural meandering part of the stream ii high groundwater discharge with recalcitrant dom would reduce denitrification and pesticide transformation potential iii denitrification and transformation potentials were highest in the upper hyporheic sediment where microbial diversity and activity are the highest and iv denitrification rates would be related to denitrifier abundance based on quantification of nirk and nosz 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the lowland holtum stream is located in the skjern river catchment denmark with a stream catchment area of 106 km2 characterized by agriculture 50 forest 25 and urban areas 25 jensen et al 2018 poulsen et al 2015 previously groundwater surface water interaction studies have been carried out at four stations along a 12 km stretch of the stream karan et al 2013 poulsen et al 2015 sebok et al 2014 steiness et al 2019 based on the existing knowledge the present work focused on station 1 and 4 station 1 is a straightened part of the stream with drained agricultural land on one side and grassland on the opposite side fig 1 the aquifer is unconfined on the agricultural side and partly confined on the grassland side by a 1 m thick peat layer steiness et al 2019 groundwater flows into the stream from both sides the n load at station 1 to the stream is very high with an estimated yearly discharge of up to 708 kg n year 1 where surface runoff from the grassland or downstream wetland is a significant contributor while the drain on the agricultural side is estimated to only contribute 16 kg n year 1 steiness et al 2021 national monitoring well dgu 96 1981 located 2 km upstream contains 2 1 mg o2 l 49 mg no3 l 48 6 mg so4 l and 1 05 mg doc l based on a 30 year average station 4 is a more natural part of the stream surrounded by wetland on one side and a steep hill with trees on the other side fig 1 land use is agricultural north of the wetland and woodland on the south side of the stream karan et al 2013 water analysis below the hyporheic zone and in the wetland revealed an aerobic shallow groundwater zone 0 3 m with oxygen and nitrate concentrations up to 58 3 mg l while nitrate was not detected in the deeper aquifer karan et al 2013 at both stations groundwater discharge measurements have revealed variations across stream transects whereas at station 1 the mean discharge over 9 months ranged from 0 07 to 1 73 m d 1 jensen and engesgaard 2011 at station 4 the mean discharge over two years ranged from 0 11 to 0 96 m d 1 karan et al 2013 2 2 sediment and water sampling groundwater discharge was tentatively measured in the pipes diameter 5 cm used for sediment core sampling the pipes were pressed into the sediment and the increase in internal pipe water levels relative to the river water level were measured for up to three hours by using this method we could determine the groundwater discharge in the same sediment sampled for further investigations and to compare the discharge between the four sampling sites the sediment cores 30 40 cm were collected in transparent polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes 5 cm Ã¸ and 1 75 mm wall thickness by a direct push method and lifted by applying vacuum to the top of the pipes the bottom of the pipe was immediately sealed before the stream water was decanted and the top was sealed eight columns were collected at each of the four sampling sites and stored on ice until being further processed fig s1 duplicate sediment columns were sliced in an upper a layer 5 15 cm and lower b layer 15 25 cm

relative centrifugal force of 1500 to extract pore water the pore water was analyzed as described above 2 4 denitrification rate determination denitrification rates were determined by the acetylene block method smith et al 1978 briefly 100 g sediment was added to a 116 ml bottle with 20 ml 1 mmol nitrate solution under constant n2 flushing and sealed using a 1 cm thick butyl rubber stopper acetylene gas was added with a syringe to a concentration of 10 in the headspace to inhibit the last step in denitrification conversion of n2o to n2 and n2o production in the headspace was followed for up to 2 weeks denitrification rates mmolno3 yr kgdw were calculated from the rates of n2o development in mmol per kg of incubated sediment per year multiplied by 2 2 n n2o 2 5 chemicals the degradation potential in the hyporheic sediment was studied for a range of organic pollutants for three compounds potential transformation products were included the compounds included in this study

tranformation potential in sediment samples from the two sampling stations s1 and s4 was studied for 14 compounds the formation of transformation products was additionally studied for three compounds chloridazon metolachlor and prothioconazole table 1 the eight sediment columns at two depths a and b from each station were spiked with the 14 compounds listed in table 1 sediment microcosms were

10 bioinformatics sequences were processed on the galaxy platform using frogs escudiÃ© et al 2018 based on the galaxy analysis platform afgan et al 2016 sequences were demultiplexed dereplicated sequence quality checked and oligonucleotides linker pads and barcodes were removed from sequences then sequences were filtered on additional criteria sequences were removed from data sets if they exhibited ambiguous bases or did not match expectations in amplicon size remaining sequences were clustered into otus based on the iterative swarm algorithm then chimeras and singletons otus containing only one sequence were removed bacterial double affiliation was performed by blasting otus against the silva database 138 1 quast et al 2013 allowing for 97 similarity to consider two otus as identical otus with affiliation 100 at the phylum level were removed from the data set otus at lower taxonomic ranks than the phylum level were considered as unidentified when the rdp bootstrap

results 3 1 groundwater discharge and porewater geochemistry different groundwater discharge rates were measured along the holtum stream at the straightened and agriculturally impacted part station 1 groundwater discharge rates of 0 12 0 037 m day 1 s1 a and 0 24 0 091 m day 1 s1 g were measured while larger differences were observed along the natural part of the stream with discharge rates of 0 02 m day 1 s4 l and 1 16 0 165 m day 1 s4 h a negative linear correlation between groundwater discharge and toc for both the a layer r2 0 96 and the b layer r2 0 98 was present a pca of the water chemistry from surface water drainage station 1 and porewater from the a and b layers showed three distinct water chemistry signatures explaining 62 of the variability fig 2 table s2 variables that contributed most to explaining the variability along the second axis were different for the surface water and porewater from the two depths surface waters and the a layer porewater clustered with no3 and doc because the surface water impacts porewater in the upper a layer of the four a layer porewater samples s4 l appears less impacted by the surface water the b layer and drainage water clustered mostly with fe and mn variations between the four b layer porewaters are distributed along the first axis where the two samples from the station 4 cluster the drainage and s1 a cluster and s1 g differ from the other samples defined by parameters such as ba so4 and cl the more distinct differences between the b layer samples suggest that the groundwater with different chemical signatures impacts this porewater to a greater extent 3 2 bacterial community structure analysis similarly to the water chemistry pca plot the mds plot of the bacterial community for each sediment replicate revealed that the four a layer samples clustered together which again suggests an impact from the surface water whereas the b layer sediment contained distinct communities at the two stations fig 3 3 3 bacterial community diversity fig s2 shows the phyla to which the most abundant otu were affiliated while fig 4 shows bacterial and archaea diversity of the otu representing 2 sequences at the genus level or the closest level of identification several otu dominated diversity in the a layers of all four sampling sites two otus representing between 5 and 20 of the relative sequence abundance are affiliated to the gallionellaceae family this family contains one genus and one established species gallionella ferruginea found in groundwater where anaerobic waters meet oxygen indeed this chemolithotrophic bacteria can oxidize iron hallbeck and pedersen 2014 this otu is also found in the b layer of station 1 on the agricultural field side suggesting the presence of oxygen in these samples a second otu common to all a horizon samples is affiliated to the family comamonadaceae this affiliation does not give any insight to the metabolic activity of this otu as this family is very diverse with a phenotypic diversity that includes aerobic organotrophs anaerobic denitrifiers and fe3 reducing bacteria hydrogen oxidizers photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic bacteria and fermentative bacteria willems 2014 next are three otu which are most closely affiliated to the phylum nitrospirota one that is present in all samples but represents the highest relative sequence abundance in the b layer at station 1 up to 19 and two that are only present in samples of the a layer s1 a and s4 h this phylum contains nitrifying taxa which oxidize nitrite to nitrate nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and commamox bacteria although without further analysis we cannot confirm their presence here except through the functional gene abundance measures if we now look at the b horizon diversity at s1 there are similarities with the a horizon although the otu affiliated to the family of comamonadaceae is no longer abundant and an otu identified as an archaea phylogenetically closest to the class bathyarchaeia is present representing up to 12 of the relative sequence abundance this phylum contains global generalists and is widespread with many metabolic capabilities including dissimilatory nitrogen and sulfur reduction zhou et al 2018 also dominant in s1 b is an otu closely related to a sulfate reducing deltaproteobacteria member sva0485 concheri et al 2017 also found in anoxic sediments vuillemin et al 2018 in the s4 h sediment samples three other otus are found at relatively high sequence abundances one is not affiliated further than belonging to bacteria the other two are an otu affiliated to candidatus methylomirabilis and an otu from the order of rokubacteriales the first contains bacteria such as ca methylomirabilis oxyfera lanthanidiphila and limnetica which oxidize methane using a unique pathway of denitrification that tentatively produces n2 and o2 from nitric oxide no graf et al 2018 versantvoort et al 2018 rokubacteriales are attached to the same order as methylomirabilales previously from a candidatus phylum they are now associated to the phylum methylomirabilota they are detected in diverse terrestrial habitats and in fens were positively correlated with ph total nitrogen content and availability of ca and mg ivanova et al 2021 the diversity indexes fig s3 showed a higher number of observed and calculated chao1 otus in the a layer samples compared to the b layers diversity indexes shannon and inv simpsons index appeared generally higher in station 4 than station 1 although these differences were not all statistically significant 3 4 potential denitrification rates denitrification reaction rates mmol no3 yr kgdw were generally fastest in the a compared to the b layers with differences in between fig 5 s4 h with the highest groundwater discharge revealed the slowest denitrification potential in both the a and b layers in contrast s4 l impacted by the slowest discharge revealed the fastest denitrification potential in both the a and b layers when comparing the potential across samples within the same depth the sediments are further characterized by an overall higher bacterial density in the a layer compared to the b layer the gene nirk is found in similar concentrations across all sediment samples suggesting that the nitrite reductase step in denitrification is very abundant in the b layer nirk concentrations higher than 16s quantification should be considered as a high abundance and is most likely explained by an underestimation of the total bacterial abundance by the 16s rrna gene assay a pearson correlation analysis for sediment samples n 16 in the b layer table s4 revealed a positive correlation between denitrification and nirk 0 8 p 0 0002 while no correlation between the two is found in the a layer the nosz gene the last step in denitrification is present in all a layer samples while absent in the b layer at s1 the nosz gene did not correlate to the observed denitrification rates while there is a correlation to 16s aob amoa and toc in the b layer the potential for nitrification within the sediment is evaluated based on archeal aoa amoa and bacterial 16s aob abundances in the a layer aob is present across the four sediments and only detected in the s4 h in the b layer aoa amoa is less abundant at the agricultural impacted s1 compared to s4 further at s4 there is a higher abundance of aoa amoa at s4 h compared to s4 l correlation analysis revealed a lack of correlation for aoa amoa in both depths while for aob correlations to chao1 denitrification rate 16s nirk and nosz is seen in the b layer 3 5 transformation potential the potential for transformation in the holtum stream is limited out of 14 tested pesticides table 1 only prothioconazole metamitrone pyraclostrobin and metolachlor were transformed dt50 values were calculated for metamitrone pyraclostrobin and metolachlor table 3 showing an overall faster transformation in the a layer as compared to the b layer for metolachlor the transformation product moa was detected in higher concentrations in the a layer compared to the b layer while mesa was only detected sporadically fig s4 for prothioconazole the transformation is measured through the formation of prothioconazole desthio and therefore a dt50 value was not estimated fig s5 surprisingly transformation occurred in the b layer at station 1 compared to station 4 and overall less transformation was seen in the a layer the faster degradation in the a layer links to the microbial community fig 5 where the pathways identified using the frogsfunc tool escudiÃ© et al 2018 relates 16s rrna otu diversity to known metabolisms kegg database these data show that a higher percentage of pathways related to xenobiotic degradation was found in the a layer of the sediments independently from the site location 4 discussion no apparent difference in either denitrification potential pesticide transformation or microbial community composition between the two stations revealed an impact from the agricultural field at station 1 steiness et al 2021 found that the n load at station 1 to the stream is very high and amongst the highest recorded in denmark where the drainage from the agricultural field covered 10 of the input and wetlands covered 59 of the input previous studies at the same site have detected nitrate concentration in groundwater up to 60 mg l 1 karan et al 2013 steiness et al 2019 preferential flow plays an essential role in nitrate discharge from aerobic superficial aquifers while deeper anaerobic groundwater often is nitrate free due to denitrification dahl et al 2007 sebok and mÃ¼ller 2019 alexander et al 2009 found reduced in stream nitrate removal by denitrification when nitrate concentrations and discharges are high another essential source of no3 is in situ nitrification by aob and aoa a similar aob concentration was found across the sediment in the a layer and at s4 there was also a higher abundance of aoa amoa also the high presence of iron oxidizing bacteria in many samples suggests presence of oxygen and that the sediment isn t that reductive suggesting nitrification to be an important process in the tested sediments 4 1 potential denitrification rates with the high loads of nitrate to the holtum stream the potential for denitrification in the hyporheic sediment becomes essential to remove nitrogen from the aquatic environment factors influencing denitrification potential differed between the two depths investigated in the present study the upper a layer was characterized by a faster denitrification potential most likely explained by higher bacterial abundance and higher nitrate and doc concentrations fig 5 table s2 when comparing the denitrification potential in the four a layer samples s4 h with the fastest groundwater discharge revealed a reduced denitrification potential in the batch experiments further s4 h sediments and porewater were characterized by less toc and doc fig 5 table s2 quantified denitrifiers abundance nosz or nirk did not correlate with the denitrification rate in the upper a layer which suggests that the abundance of these denitrifiers was not limiting denitrification it is possible that other nitrate reducing processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra may predominate in this layer wherein bioavailable nitrogen is conserved as ammonium indeed schaper et al 2019 found that nitrate removal in the upper 10 cm was primarily driven by biotic assimilation while denitrification occurred in the deeper layer within a hyporheic zone further the nosz and nirk genes are based on actual denitrifiers in the sediment samples influenced by in situ varying aerobic and anaerobic conditions hence it is important to note that quantifying the genes alone does not provide information regarding their expression or activity as these factors can be influenced by e g varying aerobic and anaerobic conditions in situ in contrast the batch experiments conducted in anaerobic conditions capture the potential denitrifying activity nitrate concentrations in the present study in the stream and the a layer porewater is between 5 and 11 mg l suggesting that nitrate is not the limiting factor for denitrification hence the most likely limiting factor in the a layer is easily degradable organic matter availability in the b layer there was a strong correlation between the denitrifiers nirk and the denitrification rate implying that these bacteria have a limiting role in addition a correlation was observed between toc and the denitrification rate except for s1 a porewater in the b layer was characterized by a low nitrate concentration previous studies have found a positive correlations between residence time and denitrification kaushal et al 2008 puckett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 which is in accordance with our observations here we found within the a layers that the denitrification potential was lowest in s4 h where the fastest groundwater discharge occurred concurrently the highest denitrification potential at s4 l correlated with the slowest groundwater discharges hence the combination of fast flow and low denitrification suggests that this preferential groundwater discharge is a significant source of nitrate to the stream water 4 2 transformation potential as described for denitrification solute residence time doc redox conditions and microbial community structure are key parameters influencing pesticide attenuation in the hyporheic zone in addition the natural transformation of pesticides is influenced by sorption and other compound specific properties only four out of the 14 tested pesticides were transformed in the present study comparing stations 1 agriculture and 4 natural no clear trend indicates that agriculturally impacted hyporheic sediment has a higher transformation potential except for prothioconazole here the formation of the transformation product prothioconazole desthio in the b layer at station 1 s5 was seen estimated dt50 values from the a layer for pyraclostrobin and metamitron were in the range of values reported by ppdb database table 1 while dt50 was approximately five times longer for metolachlor while denitrification is widely distributed within the hyporheic zone the transformation of organic pollutants can be more species specific therefore an abundant and diverse microbial community has been linked to organic pollutant transformation in the hyporheic zone bech et al 2022 hÃ¶hne et al 2022 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 2018 the vertical direction of water flow influences the nutrient and organic matter content limiting microbial transformation possibilities battin et al 2016 under gaining conditions where water from the subsurface groundwater system discharges into the surface water body the hyporheic zone is influenced by nutrient rich groundwater e g no3 and so4 and under losing conditions where water from the surface water body infiltrates into the subsurface by oxic surface water with labile organic matter boulton et al 2010 mueller et al 2021 found a positive correlation between the transformation of 12 out of 17 organic pollutants and easily degradable dom and vice versa for poorly degradable dom therefore a higher concentration of dom in the porewater in the a layer may explain faster transformation compared to the b layer in addition to easy degradable dom schaper et al 2019 found that the transformation of 28 organic pollutants was highest in the upper 10 cm despite oxic conditions down to 30 cm the authors concluded this was due to increased microbial activity and chemical turnover rates in the upper sediment a higher microbial abundance most likely explains the faster transformation potential found in the upper a layer than in the b layer in addition several pathways related to xenobiotic degradation were found in the a layer while missing from the b layer suggesting a generally higher xenobiotic transformation potential for example the detection of a pathway for fluorobenzoate pah ethylbenzene and atrazine degradation were either absent from the b layer or significantly reduced compared to the a layer most recent studies have focussed on processes in the hyporheic zone downstream from wwtp where commonly half or more of tested pharmaceuticals are transformed hÃ¶hne et al 2022 mueller et al 2021 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 here wwtp effluent is a continuous point source of pharmaceuticals and organic matter while pesticides originating from agricultural fields are non point diffuse pollutions thus pesticide concentrations are often lower and may enter the river via polluted groundwater and surface runoff or drainage the combination of low microbial diversity and high groundwater discharge may explain the general low pesticide transformation potential in the holtum stream fig 6 5 conclusion the two primary agricultural pollutants nitrate and pesticides are responsible for reduced water quality according to eu water framework directive in the present study the pollutant attenuation potential was assessed in the hyporheic zone in the holtum stream one of denmark s most nitrate polluted streams the stream is characterized by upwelling oxic and anoxic groundwater with high nitrate concentrations our main results revealed i differences between the agricultural straightened part of the stream s1 and the natural meandering part of the stream s4 did not influence pollutant attenuation ii both the nitrate and pesticide attenuation processes were more rapid in the upper a layer compared to the b layer due to higher microbial abundance and doc content iii high groundwater discharge reduced the denitrification potential while pesticide transformation was unaffected iv denitrification correlated with nitrifier abundance nirk in the b layer while this correlation was not seen in the a layer suggesting that another parameter limited the process v in the a layer several pathways related to xenobiotic degradation were identified which may explain the faster transformation and vi the hyporheic sediment revealed a slow and limited transformation for the majority of tested pesticides which a microbial community with low diversity can explain further research is needed to comprehensively assess the influence of small scale spatial heterogeneity in discharge rates on hyporheic zone attenuation of organic and inorganic pollutants the presence of high discharge window with limited microbial diversity can potentially regulate the influx and efflux of pollutants in river systems moreover investigating the dynamic interaction between spatially varying aerobic and anaerobic conditions over short distances and their impact on pollutant attenuation processes is also crucial declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14654,anode fouling is one of the key limiting factors to the widespread application of electrocoagulation ec for treatment of different types of contaminated water promising mitigation strategy to fouling is to operate the process under polarity reversal pr instead of direct current dc however the pr operation comes at the cost of process complexity due to the alternation of electrochemical and chemical reactions in this study we systematically investigated the link between evolving fouling layer during dc and pr close to iron and aluminum electrodes and morphological and rheological properties of the formed sludge by operando visualization of ec process we demonstrate that during pr operation precipitation of the iron and aluminum species occurs close to the anode interface resulting in flocs with higher porosity and lower density than those formed under dc conditions however rheological investigation revealed that the pr conditions resulted in a sludge with more pronounced solid like signature but this enhancement in its viscoelastic properties is closely related to a period of the current s polarity reversal we attribute this unexpected result to higher shear rate and collision of particles during pr conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation electrode fouling operando monitoring of electrochemical reactions polarity reversal produced water 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec process has been widely used to treat water and wastewater streams moussa et al 2017 sahu et al 2014 shokri and fard 2022 the key advantage ec offers over conventional chemical coagulation is the in situ generation of coagulants by metal dissolution using an electric current metal cations undergo hydrolysis to form oxy hydr oxides with a high positive surface charge the oxy hydr oxide structure can remove different types of contaminants from water such as silica hardness and dyes ingelsson et al 2020 double layer compression charge neutralization and sweep coagulation are the primary contaminant removal mechanisms from water or wastewater solutions hakizimana et al 2017 a conventional ec system consists of a cathode and an anode or a series of cathode and anode electrodes connected to a dc power supply dc ec the formation of an impermeable oxide layer and insoluble complexes e g alpo4 on the cathode and anode electrodes as well as precipitation of ca2 and mg2 on cathode electrodes are significant drawbacks of the ec process when using a dc power source bian et al 2019 dutta et al 2021 mansouri et al 2011 polarity reversal electrocoagulation pr ec aggressive ion e g cl addition and mechanical cleaning of electrodes have been proposed to solve electrode passivation and fouling issues in conventional ec ingelsson et al 2020 pr ec can reduce the fouling of electrodes and extend the lifetime of electrodes by enabling the dissolution of both electrodes eyvaz et al 2009 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 mao et al 2008 while pr ec in the treatment of produced water has been reported chow and pham 2021 gobbi et al 2018 ingelsson et al 2020 lobo et al 2016 madhavan and antony 2021 the reduced fouling comes at the expense of more complex operation the complexity of pr ec is most evident in ph evolution which is an essential factor influencing the ec process gomes et al 2007 mollah et al 2001 in dc ec ph at the anode decreases due to the hydrolysis of metal cations and cathode ph increases due to the reduction of water fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 the ph distribution close to the electrode interfaces is governed by the current density the rate of metal dissolution and the rate of gas evolution including both faradaic and non faradaic however in pr ec the current s polarity is reversed periodically which causes changes in the chemical and electrochemical reactions the dynamic behavior of the ph in the electrode boundary layer during pr ec can influence the speciation and precipitation of metal cations and consequently properties of the formed ec sludge the structure of ec sludge has been investigated using standard characterization techniques e g xrd sem dls and zeta potential analysis in dc ec chow and pham 2019 dubrawski and mohseni 2013 kim et al 2014 panikulam et al 2018 and pr ec betancor abreu et al 2019 haldar and gupta 2020 the polarity reversal frequency influences the crystal size of the precipitates as well as the structure and size of the particles formed during the ec process donneys victoria et al 2020 the floc growth is mainly affected by the physical and chemical factors such as intensity and duration of shear ph and solution species ayyala et al 1993 it has been reported that gas evolution in the ec process can improve the removal of flocculated particles by flotation and sedimentation ezechi et al 2020 gobbi et al 2018 paulista et al 2018 in a recent study authors used a turbulent two phase model to investigate the bubble formation and transport in a continuous dc ec sandoval et al 2021 hydrogen bubbles were found to increase the velocity and void fraction of electrolyte close to the cathode interface due to the complex environment the sludge produced in the pr ec process can differ in terms of floc morphology size porosity and network strength the majority of studies available in the literature have focused on the amount of contaminant removal achieved by ec treatment gobbi et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 mÃ¼ller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 the mechanism of contaminant removal in pr ec has not been thoroughly investigated given the complexity of the pr ec system considering the periodic changes in the chemical and electrochemical reactions in the electrode boundary layer the effect of operating parameters on the process mechanism needs further investigation recent developments in the use of confocal microscopy for operando visualization of chemical and electrochemical reactions enable the investigation of the reaction mechanisms and transport phenomena dubrawski and mohseni 2013 fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 monteiro and koper 2020 wu and liu 2018 here we take advantage of lscm s dual fluorescence reflectance mode for non invasive operando visualization of electrode interfaces during the ec process during dc and pr operation this technique allows visualization of the dynamics of ph evolution by capturing fluorescence response of ph sensitive dye formation of flocs gas evolution and wet sludge morphology during the ec process scanning electron microscopy sem gravimetry elemental analysis and rheological characterization were used to shed light on the effect of dc and pr operation on the ec sludge properties and deepen our mechanistic understanding of reactions occurring in two different modes of operation we link the evolution of floc formation resulting sludge microstructure to its rheological properties for the first time this approach offers valuable insights into the effect of operating conditions on the sludge properties and provides a framework to tune the reactor design and operating conditions for improved removal of contaminants and sludge

using a makergear m2 3d printer with an internal size of 16 mm w 25 mm d 70 mm h where the water flows upwards between two parallel electrodes fig 1 a polycarbonate filament was used for 3d printing of the reactors the reactor s front wall was covered with a 24 60 mm borosilicate glass coverslip 170 Âµm thickness fisherscientific to enable visualization a pair of identical electrodes either iron or aluminum with an effective area of 1 cm2 and a spacing of 16 mm were used as the working and counter electrodes the electrodes were rotated 15 around a vertical axis as shown in fig 1 so that they were not perpendicular to the glass window this rotation improved the image quality enabling imaging at the electrode s center without electrode edge interfering with the light path when the electrodes in the reactor were rotated by 15 the effective area of the electrodes remained unchanged this means that the overall surface area available for current flow between the electrodes remains the same however there might be a slight change in the local current density at the back edge of the electrodes which is not a region of primary interest in the visualization experiments the lscm

and a hybrid leica hyd detector high speed scanning of 5 7 frames per second was achieved 512 512 pixels resolution a field of view of about 580 580 Î¼m line averaging of 4 in this study two scanning modes were used fluorescence mode for capturing the fluorescence response of ph sensitive dye and reflection mode for detecting solid phase and gas liquid or solid liquid interfaces to image the morphology of wet sludge a higher magnification objective hc pl apo cs2 63x 1 40 oil was used a methodology similar to that used in our previous study fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 was used to obtain calibration curves for 1 ppm pyranine in authentic produced water in the range of ph 5 5 to ph 8 5 figure s1 the response of pyranine was collected in a wavelength window of 485 nm to 550 nm after sequential excitation at 405 nm and 470 nm the emission ratio during excitation at the two wavelengths was sensitive to ph changes in the range of ph 5 5 to ph 8 5 this ratio was used as the calibration curve to convert the fluorescence response of the dye to the local ph during the ec experiments the image processing procedure method for the conversion of the fluorescence response to ph maps was explained in previous work fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 briefly the lscm images were smoothed using a 2d spline smoothing method for each fluorescence channel for each pixel in the images the ph value was determined by comparing the ratio of fluorescence intensity of pyranine in a wavelength window of 485 nm to 550 nm for excitation at 405 nm and 470 nm and using the calibration curve to determine interface ph the average ph of 8 pixels close to the electrode interface was used in the reflectance mode the monochromic light is focused on the scanning region and the reflected light is collected by overlapping the detection window with the monochromic light confocal reflection microscopy can be used to resolve the solid phases as well as solid liquid and gas liquid interfaces detection of the solid phase and interfaces were achieved by the detection of the 668 nm light reflected from the surfaces and interfaces the detection window was set to a narrow region of 665 nm to 670 nm this wavelength was chosen due to less interference with autofluorescent species of authentic produced water to image the ec sludge in wet condition after ec experiments the sludge was kept in ec reactor for settlement then 3d images were acquired using reflectance mode after 4 h the collected images were imported in matlab software and the void fraction of sludge was determined after image enhancement and thresholding due to variations in the contrast distribution of background and foreground adaptive thresholding adaptthresh function in matlab was used to determine the local thresholding values then images from ten different samples of the sludges were binarized based on the local thresholding values the volume fraction of solid phase was calculated by taking the average of the area fractions corresponding to the solid phase in the 2d images the images of wet sludges were reconstructed using avizo 3d software 2 6 electrocoagulation tests the ec experiments were performed in an electrochemical cell while the water was pumped at a constant flow rate of 10 ml min 1 corresponding to a reynolds number of about 16 5 no external stirring was used a constant current of 16 ma cm 2 was applied for dc ec and pr ec experiments while the current s polarity was reversed every 5 s or 60 s using a parstat 3000 princeton applied research oak ridge tn usa potentiostat and versastudio software the range of current density used in electrocoagulation for produced water treatment can vary between 0 1 ma cm 2 to 200 ma cm 2 depending on several factors including the specific contaminants present in the water the desired treatment efficiency and the electrode materials and configuration used the current density of 16 ma cm 2 was chosen based on our previous study fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 which suggested this current density can reduce the formation of large pits for both iron and aluminum electrodes in the same study we have shown that the timescale of changes in the boundary layer ph is of order 60 s fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 in order to observe the effect of the boundary layer composition changes during pr ec polarity reversal time of 5 s and 60 s were used the cell potential and working electrode potential were recorded using the potentiostat for each operating condition a high framerate 5 7 frames per second video of the electrode interface was captured using lscm a volume of 1 l of produced water was treated by circulating the solution through the cell at a range of operating conditions the treated water for each experiment was collected in a graduated cylinder and allowed to settle for 24 h the height of sludge in the graduated cylinder was recorded to determine the sludge volume a portion of the settled sludge was transferred to the ec reactor for lscm imaging of the formed sludge the wet sludge was imaged inside the cell using reflectance mode after additional settling for 1 h to determine the faradaic efficiency a separate set of experiments were performed and the entire volume of treated water was digested using concentrated hcl 4 hcl in the final solution the digested solution was mixed and elemental analysis was carried out using icp oes all experiments were conducted at room temperature 23 2 c in triplicate to test the reproducibility of the results the experimental conditions for the ec tests are listed in table 1 2 7 sludge rheology to ensure microstructural consistency the sludge suspension was allowed to settle for at least 24 h after ec treatment prior to performing rheological characterization although the majority of sludge settled in 1 h a longer settling time 24 h allows sufficient duration for the sludge particles to separate from the liquid phase and settle to the bottom aiding in the determination of the rheological properties of the sludges a broad mouth transfer pipette was used to carefully load the sludge phase on the rheometer oscillatory amplitude sweeps 0 01 100 on a stress controlled rotational rheometer anton paar mcr 302 were conducted rheometric measurements were carried out using a 50 mm parallel plate geometry at an angular frequency of 10 rad s each measurement was performed at least three times for each experiment the linear viscoelastic storage modulus g l v e was determined as the average value of storage modulus for 0 1 Î³ 0 0 4 where Î³ 0 denotes the oscillation amplitude the yield stress was defined as the shear stress at which the storage g and the loss g modulus cross mansfeld et al 1988 shih et al 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 interfacial ph distribution during ec the ph at the electrode surface differs from the bulk ph due to the reactions at anode and cathode interfaces by tracking the fluorescent intensity of pyranine dye in the produced water via lscm we were able to produce interfacial maps during dc and pr operation figs 2 and s2 in the supporting information when iron electrodes were used in dc mode ph close to the anode interface dropped slightly ph 6 6 7 due to the hydrolysis of iron kinetics and electrode potential increased at the beginning of ec figs 2 s2 and s3 in the supporting information at the cathode interface hydrogen evolution elevates the interfacial ph to 8 5 similar trends were observed for ec treatment with aluminum electrodes except the ph gradient is steeper ph 6 2 6 6 as aluminum is prone to chemical non faradaic corrosion at the electrode interface figs 2 and s4 in the supporting information and has faster hydrolysis kinetics the cathode potential for iron electrode is below the dissolution potential fig s4 and therefore no chemical dissolution of iron is expected comparison of the interfacial ph in dc ec and pr ec mode for 60 s ec pr60 and 5 s ec pr5 with aluminum and iron electrodes demonstrates the striking difference between dc and pr mode of operation as well as a significant effect of the duration of polarity reversal interval for both aluminum and iron electrodes at 5 s intervals ec pr5 the ph range is narrower 0 6 unit of ph and close to the ph range of cathode during dc operation as there is not enough time for ph boundary layer growth however at 60 s ec pr60 the ph spans a larger range more than one unit and in the case of iron this crosses into the ph obtained at both the cathodic and anodic interface ph during dc operation figs 2 and s4 these results can be explained by the fact that after the polarity reverses the electrochemical reactions follow the reversal often leading to additional side reactions chow and pham 2021 for iron electrodes the possible side reactions in cathodic cycles are the reduction of iron cations produced in preceding anodic cycles and reduction of magnetite to ferrous iron resulting in a decrease in the efficiency of iron dissolution and the performance of the ec process ingelsson et al 2020 according to lscm data and pourbaix diagrams fig s4 the reduction of iron is possible in fe pr60 and fe pr5 modes in anodic cycles dissolved or adsorbed hydrogen from the previous cathodic cycle can be oxidized to h along with the primary reaction of metal dissolution fig s4 oxygen evolution and oxidation of ferrous iron species can occur if the potential of the electrode is higher than the equilibrium potential of the corresponding reactions fig s4 however once the cathodic cycles start the interfacial ph is still lower than the bulk electrolyte due to iron hydrolysis in the previous anodic cycle it is important to note that pr ec exhibits different ph behavior compared to dc ec the change in the electrolyte ph profile can have a significant impact on the mechanisms involved in the electrocoagulation process including compression of the double layer charge neutralization and sweep coagulation the ph of the water plays a crucial role in the dissociation and speciation of metal cations present in the electrolyte this in turn influences the compression of the double layer during electrocoagulation changes in ph can affect the availability and concentration of metal cations subsequently altering the electrostatic interactions and the compression of the double layer furthermore ph influences surface charge of particles which impact repulsive or attractive forces between particles ultimately affecting their aggregation and the subsequent process of charge neutralization 3 2 in operando observation of solid phase formation fig 3 shows lscm images of the surface of the iron electrodes under dc and pr conditions before applying the current no precipitation or gas evolution occurred near the electrodes see fig s5 in the supporting information after applying dc to iron electrodes fe dc a precipitation layer 200 Âµm was observed on the surface of the cathode electrode fig 3a the elevated ph close to the cathode interface 8 8 5 due to hydroxide generation can destabilize ca and mg cations to form insoluble calcium and magnesium carbonate precipitates as predicted from a thermodynamic model fig s6 in the supporting information the hydrogen evolution is also evident by the presence of oval circular features in fe dc fig 3a which are detached from the electrode hydrogen evolution follows four stages nucleation growth coalesce and detachment as described elsewhere zhao et al 2019 and shown in movie s1 under anodic dc conditions the iron electrode is expected to dissolve in the form of ferrous ions fe2 several factors such as ph dissolved oxygen and anode potential can influence iron speciation dubrawski and mohseni 2013 the formation of flocs during fe dc is evident by the presence of large reflective features throughout the field of view in fig 3b the flocs also form a porous network like structure which extends up to half a millimeter into the bulk of the electrolyte gas hydrogen or oxygen evolution was not observed during the anodic dc conditions fig 3b this is consistent with chronopotentiometry data and pourbaix diagram figs s3 and s4 in the supporting information which shows that the anode potential was lower than the oxygen evolution potential and higher than the hydrogen evolution potential and gas evolution is not expected to occur in the absence of hydrogen evolution and operating at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 corresponding to a reynolds number of about 16 5 no vigorous stirring in the vicinity of the anode interface was observed which can explain the large floc formation the pr conditions resulted in different gas evolution and floc formation largely affected by the duration of the polarity reversal period in fe pr60 gas evolution in cathodic cycles creates vigorous stirring close to the electrode interface and can clean the fouling layer on the electrode fig 3c and transfer the ferrous ferric ions produced in the anodic cycle to the bulk solution hydrogen bubbles that are attached to the electrode during the cathodic cycle remain there when the switch to the anodic cycle occurs fig 3d in addition the shear generated by hydrogen evolution during the cathodic cycle is still present at the beginning of the anodic cycle consequently the generated flocs are significantly smaller in size fig 3e compared to the fe dc operation during the 5 s reversal intervals fe pr5 large gas bubbles attached to the electrode surface were observed fig 3f we attribute the presence of large gas bubbles to the fact that 5 s is insufficient to complete the four stages of hydrogen evolution instead the nucleated hydrogen bubbles keep on growing and coalescing without entering the detachment stage while the formation of gas bubbles can help reduce fouling layer formation in fe pr60 the measured interfacial ph range 8 8 5 fig 2 is insufficient to completely dissolve the fouling layer on the electrodes in fe pr5 the generated fouling layer during fe pr5 operation also affects the growth and coalescence of hydrogen bubbles fig 3f microstructural evolution of complex formation and precipitation along with gas evolution when aluminum electrodes were utilized is shown in figs 4 and s7 in the supporting information in al dc hydrogen evolution is observed at the cathode fig 4a and based on previous studies it is believed that the chemical dissolution of aluminum also occurs at the cathode leading to excess hydrogen evolution mansouri et al 2011 the cathode interfacial ph in al dc can reach to 8 5 which is sufficient for the chemical dissolution of aluminum fig s4 the formation of precipitates close to the cathode interface was also observed in al dc fig 4a due to the fast hydrolysis of aluminum the fouling layer is much thicker than when iron electrodes were used in al dc aluminum dissolution is expected and evident by the presence of a larger number of reflective features precipitates which extend into the bulk of the electrolyte fig 4b however hydrogen evolution is also observed at the anode but at a much lower rate indicating that some excess aluminum dissolution may occur fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 similar to fe pr hydrogen evolution during cathodic cycles can remove some of the electrode fouling in al pr fig 4c in al pr60 case the electrodes have less fouling compared to iron electrodes due to hydrogen evolution in anodic cycles fig 4d and e however in the case of al pr5 the fouling layer is evident fig 4f which may be due to the fact that ph range 7 7 8 2 remains relatively high during which higher precipitation rate of calcium and magnesium is expected according to the thermodynamic model prediction fig s6 in the supporting information the fouling layer formed in pr cases using aluminum electrodes is thinner compared to iron electrodes used the thickness of the fouling layer more likely depends on transport processes ph boundary layer and kinetic factors yasri et al 2022 the potentiometry data fig s3 in the supporting information show that after the switch to anodic current fig s3e and f the potential drops rapidly to a steady value with no evidence of side reactions on the switch to cathodic potentials the potential initially overshoots before reaching a steady potential after 2 to 3 s this overshoot is likely associated with removing the passivation layer on the electrode surface in anodic cycles if the electrode potential is lower than the hydrogen evolution potential at the interfacial ph hydrogen evolution can occur according to the interfacial ph shown in fig 2 and the pourbaix diagrams in figure s4 when aluminum electrodes were used the electrode potential is below the hydrogen evolution reaction potential therefore in the case of aluminum electrodes hydrogen evolution occurs during both anodic and cathodic cycles however in case of iron electrodes the electrode potential remained above hydrogen evolution potential and no hydrogen evolution was observed during anodic cycles 3 3 in situ characterization of ec sludge to analyze the morphology of the flocs collected sludge from the ec process was aged for 24 h and imaged in situ with lscm to avoid the change of the morphology and structure of flocs during the drying process fig 5 shows sample lscm images of flocs obtained after 30 mins of ec corresponding to charge loading of 1000 c l 1 of dc pr60 and pr5 conditions for iron electrodes the lscm images show that the flocs formed during fe dc treatment are on average smaller in size and isolated while the ones obtained with fe pr60 and fe pr5 are more interconnected the flocs formed at the anode during fe dc operation were inherently more porous and as such they did not form a well compacted sludge fig 5a on the other hand the flocs formed during fe pr cycles were significantly smaller in size fig 3e enabling them to pack better due to the alternation between hydrogen evolution during cathodic cycles and metal dissolution it is expected that more hydrogen bubbles are trapped in the sludge formed with polarity reversal fe pr60 and fe pr5 consequently the sludge appears as interconnected aggregates with large void spaces in between them fig 5b and c as seen in fig 3 in fe dc nucleation growth and coalescence of sludge occur far from the cathode interface and incorporation of hydrogen bubbles would likely only occur during mixing in the bulk solution also hydrogen bubbles in the anodic precipitate layer were observed for fe pr not fe dc al dc sludge fig 5d is considerably more compact in comparison to that of fe dc fig 5a we attribute this difference to the hydrogen evolution at both anode and cathode which results in significantly smaller precipitates no large flocs were observed during al dc operation which pack into more compacted sludge the sludge formed in al pr5 and al pr60 cases is more porous compared to the al dc case but also compared to the fe pr5 and fe pr60 cases the differences in the microstructure of sludge obtained using iron and aluminum electrodes can be attributed to differences in the surface charge and hydrolysis kinetics as well as differences in anodic hydrogen evolution during the ec treatment with aluminum hydrogen evolution was observed ruing both anodic and cathodic cycles which may lead to a greater amount of hydrogen bubbles trapped in between the aggregates these structural features are in line with sem images of air dried sludges fig s7 in the supporting information sem images confirm the presence of large pores likely formed by the gas bubbles for pr60 and pr5 samples for both aluminum and iron generated sludges no evidence of gas bubbles trapped in the fe dc sludge structure was observed which is expected due to the absence of hydrogen evolution in the anode however in al dc presence of pores generated by gas bubbles at the anode was evident the floc volume including entrained water in the total settled sludge is an important factor in water recovery about 200 lscm images were captured for each test to quantify the volume occupied by flocs a matlab code was used to calculate the floc volume fraction see table s2 in the supporting information it should be noted that the size of individual particles is below the resolution limits of an optical microscope and the smaller pores 5 Âµm filled with water would appear as solid phase this can artificially increase the volume fraction of the solid phase fig 6 a and b show the volume fraction occupied by flocs and their weight normalized with the amount of electrical charge passed respectively comparison of the weight and volume occupied by the solids in the sludge can provide insights into the packing of the flocs a striking and surprising difference is observed between fe dc and al dc sludge while lscm images reveal more porous fe dc sludge with isolated flocs those flocs evidently contain more solids as the sludge occupies less volume per normalized solids weight the situation is quite the opposite for the al dc sludge indicating that the resolved flocs by lscm are more porous and that the porosity level is below the resolution limit under the applied imaging parameters a similar scenario was observed for fe pr60 and al pr60 it is important that the opposing trend seen for fe pr5 and al pr5 may be an artifact due to the low amount of sludge produced with fe pr icp oes analysis of the digested sludge shows similar si ca and mg removed from treated water for fe dc and fe pr60 per unit of charge loading figs 6c and s8 in the supporting information with fepr 60 reversal the faradaic efficiency is about 80 of fe dc for similar removal efficiency fig 6d therefore the removal of contaminants was achieved with a smaller consumption of electrode material this can be attributed to the higher surface area of precipitate formed in fe pr60 see fig s7 for ec treatment with rapid polarity reversal using iron electrodes fe pr5 the low faradaic efficiency fig 6d resulted in less sludge formation this is in agreement with the chronopotentiometry results fig s3 in the supporting information for the fe pr60 and fe pr5 cases the results indicate that after switching from anodic to cathodic current flow a gradual decrease of potential after the initial sharp decrease just after the polarity switch was observed until the potential reached a pseudo steady state 1 36 v vs sce the gradual decrease of potential takes about 20 s since the hydrolysis of iron is sluggish some of the ferrous ferric species produced during the anodic cycle can be reduced to iron or ferrous ions at the beginning of the cathodic cycle chow and pham 2021 and decrease the overall faradaic efficiency at short pr intervals 20 s the reversible reactions of iron can be substantial and reduce the overall rate of iron dissolution when aluminum electrodes were used the faradaic efficiencies observed in al dc al pr60 and al pr5 samples were above 100 fig 6d the superfaradaic yield of aluminum electrodissolution has been attributed to chemical dissolution at the cathode jiang et al 2002 mechelhoff et al 2013 sari and chellam 2017 as well as non faradaic dissolution at the anode fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 3 4 rheological behavior of ec sludge macroscopic flow properties of sludge obtained after the produced water treatment with aluminum and iron electrodes were analyzed by plotting their viscoelastic moduli g and g as a function of strain amplitude fig 7 a and b for all of the sludge samples it was found that g g in the linear viscoelastic lve region indicating gel like structure formation a weak strain overshoot in g the distinct peak in g before decreasing at a larger amplitude was also observed in all the sludges indicating the breakdown of the networks into smaller clusters prior to complete yielding hyun et al 2011 and is a common occurrence in other complex fluids miyazaki et al 2006 pandey et al 2018 such rheological response indicated a continuous breakdown of the solid like viscoelastic network into a plastic fluid like material donley et al 2020 note that it was not possible to obtain rheological data for the fe pr5 sludge as the amount of sludge formed in this case was insufficient the g l v e and yield stress data extracted from these curves are plotted on fig 7c and d respectively as seen in fig 7c the g l v e for iron hydroxide sludges were higher than for aluminum hydroxide indicating that the sludge forms a stiffer gel this observation is consistent with the lscm and sem images figs 5 and s7 in the supporting information respectively which revealed a formation of more compact smaller aggregates structures which gives rise to a solid like behavior in fe electrodes for ec treatment with iron electrodes the g l v e was similar for fe dc and fe pr60 even though the solid content and solid weight of the fe pr60 sludge were significantly lower this could be associated with the formation of a more interconnected network in fe pr60 due to differences in the kinetics of hydrolysis and floc growth at the higher ph near the electrode under polarity reversal conditions fig 2 this finding has an important practical implication as stronger particle particle interaction present in fe dc and fe pr60 can prevent breakage of sludge to smaller particles and clogging the filter during the subsequent filtration steps cross over strain Î³ g g fig 7d dependent on the connecting points in the network indicates the fragility of networks and denotes a complete transition of materials into fluid like behavior although ec sludges for both aluminum and iron have a weak solid like signature the aluminum hydroxide gives more resistance to strain indicating that the aluminum hydroxide sludge networks are less brittle than iron hydroxide sludges likely due to the difference in surface charge and lower electrostatic repulsion between the aluminum hydroxide flocs as seen in fig 5 it is also likely that the larger flocs in aluminum hydroxide were broken down into smaller flocs before eventually disintegrating into fluid like flow regime for al pr5 case the interfacial ph range is higher than al rp60 cases due to short intervals between polarity switches thus the aluminum hydroxide flocs would be expected to have formed more rapidly at the higher ph observed with al pr5 than for dc and pr60 conditions for aluminum hydroxide sludges the trends in g l v e agree with the lscm and sem images as such finer connected domains are formed in al pr60 in contrast larger and denser flocs were observed for al dc which resulted in a weaker network the more significant number of large bubbles in al pr5 makes the network poorly connected which reduces the stiffness in the linear viscoelastic region 4 conclusion in this study we have investigated the effect of polarity reversal on ph evolution at the electrode precipitate formation gas evolution and the formed sludge microstructural and rheological properties in the presence of aluminum and iron electrodes monitoring of the electrode interface at different operating conditions revealed that the interfacial ph significantly depends on the electrode material chemistry operational mode and duration of the polarity reversal interval in pr floc formation occurs closer to the electrode interface due to higher interfacial ph which can lead to the accumulation of a fouling layer at a high frequency of pr the hydrogen evolution during cathodic cycles in pr can clean the fouling layer by creating shear during bubble detachment and rise hydrogen bubbles and dissolved hydrogen gas formed during the cathodic cycles can interact with the flocs formed by metal dissolution during anodic cycles the hydrophobic surface of metal oxy hydroxide can cause the nucleation of hydrogen bubbles inside the flocs the presence of hydrogen bubbles in the floc structure can increase the porosity and reduce the density of flocs which can be helpful for the separation of flocs by flotation another benefit of cycling between hydrogen evolution and metal dissolution is the formation of flocs at higher ph higher than for dc along with the collisions caused by hydrogen bubble rise this leads to a more robust network and better mechanical properties of the formed sludge shorter pr periods reduced the faradaic and removal efficiencies for fe pr but al pr was less affected by the frequency of pr in summary pr ec was found to be beneficial for removing the fouling layer from the electrode surface and enhancing the mechanical properties of the sludge when the duration of polarity reversal was 60 s however our findings indicate that the frequency of pr should be chosen carefully based on the solution chemistry e g type of contaminants and buffer capacity to strike the balance between gas evolution complex formation and the resulting sludge network integrity the complexity and variability of water compositions necessitate a case by case evaluation to determine the optimal conditions for each application in general for low concentrations of contaminants and buffering agents shorter pr intervals are suitable facilitating effective alteration of interfacial ph and manipulation of sludge properties in contrast higher concentrations of buffering agents require longer pr intervals to fully harness the benefits of ph alteration and sludge property manipulation considering the interplay between polarity reversal frequency and water characteristics as well as type of post separation process are crucial for choosing electrode material the impact of pr interval on the faradaic efficiency should also be considered since this can affect the contaminant removal performance short pr intervals can lead to a reduction in faradaic efficiency and performance particularly with iron electrodes chow et al 2021 in this study we demonstrated the polarity reversal is effective for reducing the fouling on the electrode and tuning the properties of ec sludge however due to the wide range of compositions of produced water and wastewater the operating conditions have to be tuned for each application the frequency of pr should be chosen based on the contaminant type and buffer capacity of the water the sludge properties in particular the morphology and mechanical strength of networks are crucial for solid liquid separation for example compact and high density flocs are advantageous for filtration

14654,anode fouling is one of the key limiting factors to the widespread application of electrocoagulation ec for treatment of different types of contaminated water promising mitigation strategy to fouling is to operate the process under polarity reversal pr instead of direct current dc however the pr operation comes at the cost of process complexity due to the alternation of electrochemical and chemical reactions in this study we systematically investigated the link between evolving fouling layer during dc and pr close to iron and aluminum electrodes and morphological and rheological properties of the formed sludge by operando visualization of ec process we demonstrate that during pr operation precipitation of the iron and aluminum species occurs close to the anode interface resulting in flocs with higher porosity and lower density than those formed under dc conditions however rheological investigation revealed that the pr conditions resulted in a sludge with more pronounced solid like signature but this enhancement in its viscoelastic properties is closely related to a period of the current s polarity reversal we attribute this unexpected result to higher shear rate and collision of particles during pr conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation electrode fouling operando monitoring of electrochemical reactions polarity reversal produced water 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec process has been widely used to treat water and wastewater streams moussa et al 2017 sahu et al 2014 shokri and fard 2022 the key advantage ec offers over conventional chemical coagulation is the in situ generation of coagulants by metal dissolution using an electric current metal cations undergo hydrolysis to form oxy hydr oxides with a high positive surface charge the oxy hydr oxide structure can remove different types of contaminants from water such as silica hardness and dyes ingelsson et al 2020 double layer compression charge neutralization and sweep coagulation are the primary contaminant removal mechanisms from water or wastewater solutions hakizimana et al 2017 a conventional ec system consists of a cathode and an anode or a series of cathode and anode electrodes connected to a dc power supply dc ec the formation of an impermeable oxide layer and insoluble complexes e g alpo4 on the cathode and

al 2011 mao et al 2008 while pr ec in the treatment of produced water has been reported chow and pham 2021 gobbi et al 2018 ingelsson et al 2020 lobo et al 2016 madhavan and antony 2021 the reduced fouling comes at the expense of more complex operation the complexity of pr ec is most evident in ph evolution which is an essential factor influencing the ec process gomes et al 2007 mollah et al 2001 in dc ec ph at the anode decreases due to the hydrolysis of metal cations and cathode ph increases due to the reduction of water fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 the ph distribution close to the electrode interfaces is governed by the current density the rate of metal dissolution and the rate of gas evolution including both faradaic and non faradaic however in pr ec the current s polarity is reversed periodically which causes changes in the chemical and electrochemical reactions the dynamic behavior of the ph in the electrode boundary layer during pr ec can influence the speciation and precipitation of metal cations and consequently properties of the formed ec sludge the structure of ec sludge has been investigated using standard characterization techniques e g xrd sem dls and zeta

influences the crystal size of the precipitates as well as the structure and size of the particles formed during the ec process donneys victoria et al 2020 the floc growth is mainly affected by the

formation and transport in a continuous dc ec sandoval et al 2021 hydrogen bubbles were found to increase the velocity and void fraction of electrolyte close to the cathode interface due to the complex environment the sludge produced in the pr ec process can differ in terms of floc morphology size porosity and network strength the majority of studies available in the literature have focused on the amount of contaminant removal achieved by ec treatment gobbi et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 mÃ¼ller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 the mechanism of contaminant removal in pr ec has not been thoroughly investigated given the complexity of the pr ec system considering the periodic changes in the chemical and electrochemical reactions in the electrode boundary layer the effect of operating

investigation of the reaction mechanisms and transport phenomena dubrawski and mohseni 2013 fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 monteiro and koper 2020 wu and liu 2018 here we take advantage of lscm s dual fluorescence reflectance mode for non invasive operando visualization of electrode interfaces during the ec process during dc and pr operation this technique allows visualization of the dynamics of ph evolution by capturing fluorescence response of ph sensitive dye formation of flocs gas evolution and wet sludge morphology during the ec process scanning electron microscopy sem gravimetry elemental analysis and rheological characterization were used to shed light on the effect of dc and pr operation on the ec sludge properties and deepen our mechanistic understanding of reactions occurring in two different modes of operation we link the evolution of floc formation resulting sludge microstructure to its rheological properties for the first time this approach offers valuable insights into the effect of operating conditions on the sludge properties and provides a framework to tune the reactor design and operating conditions for improved removal of contaminants and sludge

using a makergear m2 3d printer with an internal size of 16 mm w 25 mm d 70 mm h where the water flows upwards between two parallel electrodes fig 1 a polycarbonate filament was used for 3d printing of the reactors the reactor s front wall was covered with a 24 60 mm borosilicate glass coverslip 170 Âµm thickness fisherscientific to enable visualization a pair of identical electrodes either iron or aluminum with an effective area of 1 cm2 and a spacing of 16 mm were used as the working and counter electrodes the electrodes were rotated 15 around a vertical axis as shown in fig 1 so that they were not perpendicular to the glass window this rotation improved the image quality enabling imaging at the electrode s center without electrode edge interfering with the light path when the electrodes in the reactor were rotated by 15 the effective area of the electrodes remained unchanged this means that the overall surface area available for current flow between the electrodes remains the same however there might be a slight change in the local current density at the back edge of the electrodes which is not a region of primary interest in the visualization experiments the lscm imaging of a side view of the cell was performed by attaching a periscope arm to a leica tcs sp8 x inverted confocal microscope 2 4 electrode preparation aluminum grade 1100 mcmaster carr inc atlanta ga and iron low carbon steel astm a109 mcmaster carr inc atlanta ga sheets were used to prepare the electrodes all electrodes were polished with silicon carbide paper grit p400 to p1500 followed by polishing with alumina slurry 0 3 Âµm particle size pine research instrumentation inc usa the electrodes were rinsed with acetone and milli q water and used immediately adhesive kapton tape an insulating polyimide ueetek supplied by amazon inc was used to insulate the unused parts of the electrode surfaces 2 5 lscm imaging to observe the interfacial ph formation of sludge and fouling and morphology of sludge during and after the ec process an lscm leica tcs sp8 x leica microsystems germany equipped with a pulsed white light laser source in the visible light range 470 670 nm at 80 mhz was used a dry objective hc pl apo cs2 10x 0 40 dry attached to a periscope arm allowed imaging through the glass coverslip fig 1 by using an acousto optical beam splitter aobs 12 khz resonant scanner and a hybrid leica hyd detector high speed scanning of 5 7 frames per second was achieved 512 512 pixels resolution a field of view of about 580 580 Î¼m line averaging of 4 in this study two scanning modes were used fluorescence mode for capturing the fluorescence response of ph sensitive dye and reflection mode for detecting solid phase and gas liquid or solid liquid interfaces to image the morphology of wet sludge a higher magnification objective hc pl apo cs2 63x 1 40 oil was used a methodology similar to that used in our previous study fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 was used to obtain calibration curves for 1 ppm pyranine in authentic produced water in the range of ph 5 5 to ph 8 5 figure s1 the response of pyranine was collected in a wavelength window of 485 nm to 550 nm after sequential excitation at 405 nm and 470 nm the emission ratio during excitation at the two wavelengths was sensitive to ph changes in the range of ph 5 5 to ph 8 5 this ratio was used as the calibration curve to convert the fluorescence response of the dye to the local ph during the ec experiments the image processing procedure method for the conversion of the fluorescence response to ph maps was explained in previous work fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 briefly the lscm images were smoothed using a 2d spline smoothing method for each fluorescence channel for each pixel in the images the ph value was determined by comparing the ratio of fluorescence intensity of pyranine in a wavelength window of 485 nm to 550 nm for excitation at 405 nm and 470 nm and using the calibration curve to determine interface ph the average ph of 8 pixels close to the electrode interface was used in the reflectance mode the monochromic light is focused on the scanning region and the reflected light is collected by overlapping the detection window with the monochromic light confocal reflection microscopy can be used to resolve the solid phases as well as solid liquid and gas liquid interfaces detection of the solid phase and interfaces were achieved by the detection of the 668 nm light reflected from the surfaces and interfaces the detection window was set to a narrow region of 665 nm to 670 nm this wavelength was chosen due to less interference with autofluorescent species of authentic produced water to image the ec sludge in wet condition after ec experiments the sludge was kept in ec reactor for settlement then 3d images were acquired using reflectance mode after 4 h the collected images were imported in matlab software and the void fraction of sludge was determined after image enhancement and thresholding due to variations in the contrast distribution of background and foreground adaptive thresholding adaptthresh function in matlab was used to determine the local thresholding values then images from ten different samples of the sludges were binarized based on the local thresholding values the volume fraction of solid phase was calculated by taking the average of the area fractions corresponding to the solid phase in the 2d images the images of wet sludges were reconstructed using avizo 3d software 2 6 electrocoagulation tests the ec experiments were performed in an electrochemical cell while the water was pumped at a constant flow rate of 10 ml min 1 corresponding to a reynolds number of about 16 5 no external stirring was used a constant current of 16 ma cm 2 was applied for dc ec and pr ec experiments while the current s polarity was reversed every 5 s or 60 s using a parstat 3000 princeton applied research oak ridge tn usa potentiostat and versastudio software the range of current density used in electrocoagulation for produced water treatment can vary between 0 1 ma cm 2 to 200 ma cm 2 depending on several factors including the specific contaminants present in the water the desired treatment efficiency and the electrode materials and configuration used the current density of 16 ma cm 2 was chosen based on our previous study fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 which suggested this current density can reduce the formation of large pits for both iron and aluminum electrodes in the same study we have shown that the timescale of changes in the boundary layer ph is of order 60 s fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 in order to observe the effect of the boundary layer composition changes during pr ec polarity reversal time of 5 s and 60 s were used the cell potential and working electrode potential were recorded using the potentiostat for each operating condition a high framerate 5 7 frames per second video of the electrode interface was captured using lscm a volume of 1 l of produced water was treated by circulating the solution through the cell at a range of operating conditions the treated water for each experiment was collected in a graduated cylinder and allowed to settle for 24 h the height of sludge in the graduated cylinder was recorded to determine the sludge volume a portion of the settled sludge was transferred to the ec reactor for lscm imaging of the formed sludge the wet sludge was imaged inside the cell using reflectance mode after additional settling for 1 h to determine the faradaic efficiency a separate set of experiments were performed and the entire volume of treated water was digested using concentrated hcl 4 hcl in the final solution the digested solution was mixed and elemental analysis was carried out using icp oes all experiments were conducted at room temperature 23 2 c in triplicate to test the reproducibility of the results the experimental conditions for the ec tests are listed in table 1 2 7 sludge rheology to ensure microstructural consistency the sludge suspension was allowed to settle for at least 24 h after ec treatment prior to performing rheological characterization although the majority of sludge settled in 1 h a longer settling time 24 h allows sufficient duration for the sludge particles to separate from the liquid phase and settle to the bottom aiding in the determination of the rheological properties of the sludges a broad mouth transfer pipette was used to carefully load the sludge phase on the rheometer oscillatory amplitude sweeps 0 01 100 on a stress controlled rotational rheometer anton paar mcr 302 were conducted rheometric measurements were carried out using a 50 mm parallel plate geometry at an angular frequency of 10 rad s each measurement was performed at least three times for each experiment the linear viscoelastic storage modulus g l v e was determined as the average value of storage modulus for 0 1 Î³ 0 0 4 where Î³ 0 denotes the oscillation amplitude the yield stress was defined as the shear stress at which the storage g and the loss g modulus cross mansfeld et al 1988 shih et al 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 interfacial ph distribution during ec the ph at the electrode surface differs from the bulk ph due to the reactions at anode and cathode interfaces by tracking the fluorescent intensity of pyranine dye in the produced water via lscm we were able to produce interfacial maps during dc and pr operation figs 2 and s2 in the supporting information when iron electrodes were used in dc mode ph close to the anode interface dropped slightly ph 6 6 7 due to the hydrolysis of iron kinetics and electrode potential increased at the beginning of ec figs 2 s2 and s3 in the supporting information at the cathode interface hydrogen evolution elevates the interfacial ph to 8 5 similar trends were observed for ec treatment with aluminum electrodes except the ph gradient is steeper ph 6 2 6 6 as aluminum is prone to chemical non faradaic corrosion at the electrode interface figs 2 and s4 in the supporting information and has faster hydrolysis kinetics the cathode potential for iron electrode is below the dissolution potential fig s4 and therefore no chemical dissolution of iron is expected comparison of the interfacial ph in dc ec and pr ec mode for 60 s ec pr60 and 5 s ec pr5 with aluminum and iron electrodes demonstrates the striking difference between dc and pr mode of operation as well as a significant effect of the duration of polarity reversal interval for both aluminum and iron electrodes at 5 s intervals ec pr5 the ph range is narrower 0 6 unit of ph and close to the ph range of cathode during dc operation as there is not enough time for ph boundary layer growth however at 60 s ec pr60 the ph spans a larger range more than one unit and in the case of iron this crosses into the ph obtained at both the cathodic and anodic interface ph during dc operation figs 2 and s4 these results can be explained by the fact that after the polarity reverses the electrochemical reactions follow the reversal often leading to additional side reactions chow and pham 2021 for iron electrodes the possible side reactions in cathodic cycles are the reduction of iron cations produced in preceding anodic cycles and reduction of magnetite to ferrous iron resulting in a decrease in the efficiency of iron dissolution and the performance of the ec process ingelsson et al 2020 according to lscm data and pourbaix diagrams fig s4 the reduction of iron is possible in fe pr60 and fe pr5 modes in anodic cycles dissolved or adsorbed hydrogen from the previous cathodic cycle can be oxidized to h along with the primary reaction of metal dissolution fig s4 oxygen evolution and oxidation of ferrous iron species can occur if the potential of the electrode is higher than the equilibrium potential of the corresponding reactions fig s4 however once the cathodic cycles start the interfacial ph is still lower than the bulk electrolyte due to iron hydrolysis in the previous anodic cycle it is important to note that pr ec exhibits different ph behavior compared to dc ec the change in the electrolyte ph profile can have a significant impact on the mechanisms involved in the electrocoagulation process including compression of the double layer charge neutralization and sweep coagulation the ph of the water plays a crucial role in the dissociation and speciation of metal cations present in the electrolyte this in turn influences the compression of the double layer during electrocoagulation changes in ph can affect the availability and concentration of metal cations subsequently altering the electrostatic interactions and the compression of the double layer furthermore ph influences surface charge of particles which impact repulsive or attractive forces between particles ultimately affecting their aggregation and the subsequent process of charge neutralization 3 2 in operando observation of solid phase formation fig 3 shows lscm images of the surface of the iron electrodes under dc and pr conditions before applying the current no precipitation or gas evolution occurred near the electrodes see fig s5 in the supporting information after applying dc to iron electrodes fe dc a precipitation layer 200 Âµm was observed on the surface of the cathode electrode fig 3a the elevated ph close to the cathode interface 8 8 5 due to hydroxide generation can destabilize ca and mg cations to form insoluble calcium and magnesium carbonate precipitates as predicted from a thermodynamic model fig s6 in the supporting information the hydrogen evolution is also evident by the presence of oval circular features in fe dc fig 3a which are detached from the electrode hydrogen evolution follows four stages nucleation growth coalesce and detachment as described elsewhere zhao et al 2019 and shown in movie s1 under anodic dc conditions the iron electrode is expected to dissolve in the form of ferrous ions fe2 several factors such as ph dissolved oxygen and anode potential can influence iron speciation dubrawski and mohseni 2013 the formation of flocs during fe dc is evident by the presence of large reflective features throughout the field of view in fig 3b the flocs also form a porous network like structure which extends up to half a millimeter into the bulk of the electrolyte gas hydrogen or oxygen evolution was not observed during the anodic dc conditions fig 3b this is consistent with chronopotentiometry data and pourbaix diagram figs s3 and s4 in the supporting information which shows that the anode potential was lower than the oxygen evolution potential and higher than the hydrogen evolution potential and gas evolution is not expected to occur in the absence of hydrogen evolution and operating at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 corresponding to a reynolds number of about 16 5 no vigorous stirring in the vicinity of the anode interface was observed which can explain the large floc formation the pr conditions resulted in different gas evolution and floc formation largely affected by the duration of the polarity reversal period in fe pr60 gas evolution in cathodic cycles creates vigorous stirring close to the electrode interface and can clean the fouling layer on the electrode fig 3c and transfer the ferrous ferric ions produced in the anodic cycle to the bulk solution hydrogen bubbles that are attached to the electrode during the cathodic cycle remain there when the switch to the anodic cycle occurs fig 3d in addition the shear generated by hydrogen evolution during the cathodic cycle is still present at the beginning of the anodic cycle consequently the generated flocs are significantly smaller in size fig 3e compared to the fe dc operation during the 5 s reversal intervals fe pr5 large gas bubbles attached to the electrode surface were observed fig 3f we attribute the presence of large gas bubbles to the fact that 5 s is insufficient to complete the four stages of hydrogen evolution instead the nucleated hydrogen bubbles keep on growing and coalescing without entering the detachment stage while the formation of gas bubbles can help reduce fouling layer formation in fe pr60 the measured interfacial ph range 8 8 5 fig 2 is insufficient to completely dissolve the fouling layer on the electrodes in fe pr5 the generated fouling layer during fe pr5 operation also affects the growth and coalescence of hydrogen bubbles fig 3f microstructural evolution of complex formation and precipitation along with gas evolution when aluminum electrodes were utilized is shown in figs 4 and s7 in the supporting information in al dc hydrogen evolution is observed at the cathode fig 4a and based on previous studies it is believed that the chemical dissolution of aluminum also occurs at the cathode leading to excess hydrogen evolution mansouri et al 2011 the cathode interfacial ph in al dc can reach to 8 5 which is sufficient for the chemical dissolution of aluminum fig s4 the formation of precipitates close to the cathode interface was also observed in al dc fig 4a due to the fast hydrolysis of aluminum the fouling layer is much thicker than when iron electrodes were used in al dc aluminum dissolution is expected and evident by the presence of a larger number of reflective features precipitates which extend into the bulk of the electrolyte fig 4b however hydrogen evolution is also observed at the anode but at a much lower rate indicating that some excess aluminum dissolution may occur fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 similar to fe pr hydrogen evolution during cathodic cycles can remove some of the electrode fouling in al pr fig 4c in al pr60 case the electrodes have less fouling compared to iron electrodes due to hydrogen evolution in anodic cycles fig 4d and e however in the case of al pr5 the fouling layer is evident fig 4f which may be due to the fact that ph range 7 7 8 2 remains relatively high during which higher precipitation rate of calcium and magnesium is expected according to the thermodynamic model prediction fig s6 in the supporting information the fouling layer formed in pr cases using aluminum electrodes is thinner compared to iron electrodes used the thickness of the fouling layer more likely depends on transport processes ph boundary layer and kinetic factors yasri et al 2022 the potentiometry data fig s3 in the supporting information show that after the switch to anodic current fig s3e and f the potential drops rapidly to a steady value with no evidence of side reactions on the switch to cathodic potentials the potential initially overshoots before reaching a steady potential after 2 to 3 s this overshoot is likely associated with removing the passivation layer on the electrode surface in anodic cycles if the electrode potential is lower than the hydrogen evolution potential at the interfacial ph hydrogen evolution can occur according to the interfacial ph shown in fig 2 and the pourbaix diagrams in figure s4 when aluminum electrodes were used the electrode potential is below the hydrogen evolution reaction potential therefore in the case of aluminum electrodes hydrogen evolution occurs during both anodic and cathodic cycles however in case of iron electrodes the electrode potential remained above hydrogen evolution potential and no hydrogen evolution was observed during anodic cycles 3 3 in situ characterization of ec sludge to analyze the morphology of the flocs collected sludge from the ec process was aged for 24 h and imaged in situ with lscm to avoid the change of the morphology and structure of flocs during the drying process fig 5 shows sample lscm images of flocs obtained after 30 mins of ec corresponding to charge loading of 1000 c l 1 of dc pr60 and pr5 conditions for iron electrodes the lscm images show that the flocs formed during fe dc treatment are on average smaller in size and isolated while the ones obtained with fe pr60 and fe pr5 are more interconnected the flocs formed at the anode during fe dc operation were inherently more porous and as such they did not form a well compacted sludge fig 5a on the other hand the flocs formed during fe pr cycles were significantly smaller in size fig 3e enabling them to pack better due to the alternation between hydrogen evolution during cathodic cycles and metal dissolution it is expected that more hydrogen bubbles are trapped in the sludge formed with polarity reversal fe pr60 and fe pr5 consequently the sludge appears as interconnected aggregates with large void spaces in between them fig 5b and c as seen in fig 3 in fe dc nucleation growth and coalescence of sludge occur far from the cathode interface and incorporation of hydrogen bubbles would likely only occur during mixing in the bulk solution also hydrogen bubbles in the anodic precipitate layer were observed for fe pr not fe dc al dc sludge fig 5d is considerably more compact in comparison to that of fe dc fig 5a we attribute this difference to the hydrogen evolution at both anode and cathode which results in significantly smaller precipitates no large flocs were observed during al dc operation which pack into more compacted sludge the sludge formed in al pr5 and al pr60 cases is more porous compared to the al dc case but also compared to the fe pr5 and fe pr60 cases the differences in the microstructure of sludge obtained using iron and aluminum electrodes can be attributed to differences in the surface charge and hydrolysis kinetics as well as differences in anodic hydrogen evolution during the ec treatment with aluminum hydrogen evolution was observed ruing both anodic and cathodic cycles which may lead to a greater amount of hydrogen bubbles trapped in between the aggregates these structural features are in line with sem images of air dried sludges fig s7 in the supporting information sem images confirm the presence of large pores likely formed by the gas bubbles for pr60 and pr5 samples for both aluminum and iron generated sludges no evidence of gas bubbles trapped in the fe dc sludge structure was observed which is expected due to the absence of hydrogen evolution in the anode however in al dc presence of pores generated by gas bubbles at the anode was evident the floc volume including entrained water in the total settled sludge is an important factor in water recovery about 200 lscm images were captured for each test to quantify the volume occupied by flocs a matlab code was used to calculate the floc volume fraction see table s2 in the supporting information it should be noted that the size of individual particles is below the resolution limits of an optical microscope and the smaller pores 5 Âµm filled with water would appear as solid phase this can artificially increase the volume fraction of the solid phase fig 6 a and b show the volume fraction occupied by flocs and their weight normalized with the amount of electrical charge passed respectively comparison of the weight and volume occupied by the solids in the sludge can provide insights into the packing of the flocs a striking and surprising difference is observed between fe dc and al dc sludge while lscm images reveal more porous fe dc sludge with isolated flocs those flocs evidently contain more solids as the sludge occupies less volume per normalized solids weight the situation is quite the opposite for the al dc sludge indicating that the resolved flocs by lscm are more porous and that the porosity level is below the resolution limit under the applied imaging parameters a similar scenario was observed for fe pr60 and al pr60 it is important that the opposing trend seen for fe pr5 and al pr5 may be an artifact due to the low amount of sludge produced with fe pr icp oes analysis of the digested sludge shows similar si ca and mg removed from treated water for fe dc and fe pr60 per unit of charge loading figs 6c and s8 in the supporting information with fepr 60 reversal the faradaic efficiency is about 80 of fe dc for similar removal efficiency fig 6d therefore the removal of contaminants was achieved with a smaller consumption of electrode material this can be attributed to the higher surface area of precipitate formed in fe pr60 see fig s7 for ec treatment with rapid polarity reversal using iron electrodes fe pr5 the low faradaic efficiency fig 6d resulted in less sludge formation this is in agreement with the chronopotentiometry results fig s3 in the supporting information for the fe pr60 and fe pr5 cases the results indicate that after switching from anodic to cathodic current flow a gradual decrease of potential after the initial sharp decrease just after the polarity switch was observed until the potential reached a pseudo steady state 1 36 v vs sce the gradual decrease of potential takes about 20 s since the hydrolysis of iron is sluggish some of the ferrous ferric species produced during the anodic cycle can be reduced to iron or ferrous ions at the beginning of the cathodic cycle chow and pham 2021 and decrease the overall faradaic efficiency at short pr intervals 20 s the reversible reactions of iron can be substantial and reduce the overall rate of iron dissolution when aluminum electrodes were used the faradaic efficiencies observed in al dc al pr60 and al pr5 samples were above 100 fig 6d the superfaradaic yield of aluminum electrodissolution has been attributed to chemical dissolution at the cathode jiang et al 2002 mechelhoff et al 2013 sari and chellam 2017 as well as non faradaic dissolution at the anode fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 3 4 rheological behavior of ec sludge macroscopic flow properties of sludge obtained after the produced water treatment with aluminum and iron electrodes were analyzed by plotting their viscoelastic moduli g and g as a function of strain amplitude fig 7 a and b for all of the sludge samples it was found that g g in the linear viscoelastic lve region indicating gel like structure formation a weak strain overshoot in g the distinct peak in g before decreasing at a larger amplitude was also observed in all the sludges indicating the breakdown of the networks into smaller clusters prior to complete yielding hyun et al 2011 and is a common occurrence in other complex fluids miyazaki et al 2006 pandey et al 2018 such rheological response indicated a continuous breakdown of the solid like viscoelastic network into a plastic fluid like material donley et al 2020 note that it was not possible to obtain rheological data for the fe pr5 sludge as the amount of sludge formed in this case was insufficient the g l v e and yield stress data extracted from these curves are plotted on fig 7c and d respectively as seen in fig 7c the g l v e for iron hydroxide sludges were higher than for aluminum hydroxide indicating that the sludge forms a stiffer gel this observation is consistent with the lscm and sem images figs 5 and s7 in the supporting information respectively which revealed a formation of more compact smaller aggregates structures which gives rise to a solid like behavior in fe electrodes for ec treatment with iron electrodes the g l v e was similar for fe dc and fe pr60 even though the solid content and solid weight of the fe pr60 sludge were significantly lower this could be associated with the formation of a more interconnected network in fe pr60 due to differences in the kinetics of hydrolysis and floc growth at the higher ph near the electrode under polarity reversal conditions fig 2 this finding has an important practical implication as stronger particle particle interaction present in fe dc and fe pr60 can prevent breakage of sludge to smaller particles and clogging the filter during the subsequent filtration steps cross over strain Î³ g g fig 7d dependent on the connecting points in the network indicates the fragility of networks and denotes a complete transition of materials into fluid like behavior although ec sludges for both aluminum and iron have a weak solid like signature the aluminum hydroxide gives more resistance to strain indicating that the aluminum hydroxide sludge networks are less brittle than iron hydroxide sludges likely due to the difference in surface charge and lower electrostatic repulsion between the aluminum hydroxide flocs as seen in fig 5 it is also likely that the larger flocs in aluminum hydroxide were broken down into smaller flocs before eventually disintegrating into fluid like flow regime for al pr5 case the interfacial ph range is higher than al rp60 cases due to short intervals between polarity switches thus the aluminum hydroxide flocs would be expected to have formed more rapidly at the higher ph observed with al pr5 than for dc and pr60 conditions for aluminum hydroxide sludges the trends in g l v e agree with the lscm and sem images as such finer connected domains are formed in al pr60 in contrast larger and denser flocs were observed for al dc which resulted in a weaker network the more significant number of large bubbles in al pr5 makes the network poorly connected which reduces the stiffness in the linear viscoelastic region 4 conclusion in this study we have investigated the effect of polarity reversal on ph evolution at the electrode precipitate formation gas evolution and the formed sludge microstructural and rheological properties in the presence of aluminum and iron electrodes monitoring of the electrode interface at different operating conditions revealed that the interfacial ph significantly depends on the electrode material chemistry operational mode and duration of the polarity reversal interval in pr floc formation occurs closer to the electrode interface due to higher interfacial ph which can lead to the accumulation of a fouling layer at a high frequency of pr the hydrogen evolution during cathodic cycles in pr can clean the fouling layer by creating shear during bubble detachment and rise hydrogen bubbles and dissolved hydrogen gas formed during the cathodic cycles can interact with the flocs formed by metal dissolution during anodic cycles the hydrophobic surface of metal oxy hydroxide can cause the nucleation of hydrogen bubbles inside the flocs the presence of hydrogen bubbles in the floc structure can increase the porosity and reduce the density of flocs which can be helpful for the separation of flocs by flotation another benefit of cycling between hydrogen evolution and metal dissolution is the formation of flocs at higher ph higher than for dc along with the collisions caused by hydrogen bubble rise this leads to a more robust network and better mechanical properties of the formed sludge shorter pr periods reduced the faradaic and removal efficiencies for fe pr but al pr was less affected by the frequency of pr in summary pr ec was found to be beneficial for removing the fouling layer from the electrode surface and enhancing the mechanical properties of the sludge when the duration of polarity reversal was 60 s however our findings indicate that the frequency of pr should be chosen carefully based on the solution chemistry e g type of contaminants and buffer capacity to strike the balance between gas evolution complex formation and the resulting sludge network integrity the complexity and variability of water compositions necessitate a case by case evaluation to determine the optimal conditions for each application in general for low concentrations of contaminants and buffering agents shorter pr intervals are suitable facilitating effective alteration of interfacial ph and manipulation of sludge properties in contrast higher concentrations of buffering agents require longer pr intervals to fully harness the benefits of ph alteration and sludge property manipulation considering the interplay between polarity reversal frequency and water characteristics as well as type of post separation process are crucial for choosing electrode material the impact of pr interval on the faradaic efficiency should also be considered since this can affect the contaminant removal performance short pr intervals can lead to a reduction in faradaic efficiency and performance particularly with iron electrodes chow et al 2021 in this study we demonstrated the polarity reversal is effective for reducing the fouling on the electrode and tuning the properties of ec sludge however due to the wide range of compositions of produced water and wastewater the operating conditions have to be tuned for each application the frequency of pr should be chosen based on the contaminant type and buffer capacity of the water the sludge properties in particular the morphology and mechanical strength of networks are crucial for solid liquid separation for example compact and high density flocs are advantageous for filtration
