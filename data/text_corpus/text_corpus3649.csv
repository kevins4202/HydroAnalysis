18245,halogenated aromatic disinfection byproducts dbps are a new group of emerging dbps identified recently they have been detected in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluents recreational water and oil gas produced water at concentrations of ng l to μg l in general previously studies have demonstrated that most of them can induce developmental toxicity and growth inhibition in aquatic organisms based on in vivo bioassays in this study to further understand the adverse effects of aromatic dbps to human health the comparative cytotoxicity of 15 halogenated aromatic dbps belonging to four subgroups i e halophenols halonitrophenols halohydroxybenzaldehydes and halohydroxybenzoic acids was evaluated with mammalian chinese hamster ovary cells the results indicated that the selected aromatic dbps exhibited an in vitro toxicity rank order of halonitrophenols halophenols halohydroxybenzaldehydes halohydroxybenzoic acids the potential toxicity mechanisms involved with the antioxidant system were investigated by using molecular docking analysis between key antioxidant enzymes i e catalase superoxide dismutase and glutathione s transferase and aromatic dbps based on the observed cytotoxicity data and screening the candidate descriptors including binding energies between the aromatic dbps and key antioxidant enzymes as well as physical chemical quantum chemical topological descriptors a qsar model was developed as log lc50 1 1 050e cat 0 300e homo 0 238e lumo 0 164 indicating the importance of the interactions of aromatic dbps towards catalase and the electrophilic nucleophilic reactivity of aromatic dbps in the toxicity mechanisms in addition the occurrence of the aromatic dbps in tap water and finished water was studied in a mega city shenzhen located in south china results showed that halogenated aromatic dbps commonly existed in shenzhen drinking water at ng l levels and three nitrogenous aromatic dbps were detected in real drinking water for the first time the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps were identified through the integration of the measured concentrations and observed cytotoxicity notably dbps with the highest concentrations may not contribute the highest proportions of overall toxicity graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products aromatic dbps toxicity evaluation qsar drinking water 1 introduction disinfection is an essential procedure for preventing waterborne diseases during drinking water treatment however the reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter or even environmental contaminants derived from anthropogenic activities in the source water can lead to the formation of unintended disinfection byproducts dbps chu et al 2015 richardson and ternes 2018 yang et al 2019a up to now more than 800 dbps have been identified with the efforts of researchers since the first dbp trichloromethane was reported in 1974 rook 1974 yang and zhang 2016 previous studies based on various types of bioassays suggested that many dbps may possess cytotoxicity genotoxicity mutagenicity and or teratogenicity manasfi et al 2017 richardson and ternes 2018 besides epidemiological studies have illustrated that dbp exposure potentially raises health risks e g colorectal bladder cancer and adverse birth outcomes villanueva et al 2014 grellier et al 2015 therefore dbp exposure is of increasing concern to both researchers and the general public with the aid of a novel precursor ion scan pis method using ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry uplc esi tqms zhang s group reported more than 150 previously unknown dbps over the past decade many of them belong to halogenated aromatic dbps e g 2 4 6 tribromophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 5 dibromohydroquinone and tetrabromopyrrole yang et al 2019a those aromatic dbps have been detected in chlorinated chloraminated simulated drinking water real tap water wastewater effluents and swimming pool water with concentration levels ranging from ng l to μg l xiao et al 2012 yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019a moreover li s group reported the identification formation and occurrence of another important class of aromatic dbps halobenzoquinones wang et al 2015 2016 notably the comparative toxicity of new emerging aromatic dbps and frequently regulated aliphatic dbps trihalomethanes thms and or haloacetic acids haas was assessed by using in vivo toxicity bioassays with aquatic organisms and the results showed that the former group of dbps generally exhibited tens to hundreds times higher toxicity than the latter group in terms of growth inhibition and developmental toxicity potencies yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wang et al 2018 for example 2 4 6 tribromophenol was approximately 125 and 72 times more toxic than bromoacetic acid to autotrophic algae tetraselmis marina and embryos of a heterotrophic polychaete species platynereis dumerilii respectively halobenzoquinones were found to possess up to 200 times higher toxic potency than haas towards zebrafish embryos based on an in vitro bioassay liberatore et al 2017 comparatively evaluated the cytotoxicity of four iodinated phenolic dbps which were detected and identified in chloraminated oil and gas wastewaters all of them were cytotoxic and the most toxic one 2 4 6 triiodophenol showed a higher toxic potency than all thms and most haas by using mammalian chinese hamster ovary cho cells plewa s group have evaluated the toxicity of over a hundred dbps covering many types of compounds e g haloacids haloacetamides haloacetonitriles etc wagner and plewa 2017 although halogenated aromatic dbps are toxicologically important on the basis of in vivo bioassays only several iodinated phenolic dbps were evaluated by the in vitro mammalian cell cytotoxicity bioassay to study whether aromatic dbps present a similar toxicity order in mammalian cells as that in aquatic organisms the toxicity of 15 aromatic dbps belonging to four subgroups halophenols hps halonitrophenols hnps halohydroxybenzaldehydes hbads and halohydroxybenzoic acids hbacs was evaluated by using the mammalian cho cells in this study moreover oxidative stress is considered as an important mechanism responsible for halobenzoquinones induced cytotoxicity and halobenzoquinones could inhibit activities of cellular antioxidant enzymes li et al 2015 2018 wang et al 2018 quantitative structure activity relationship qsar methods have been successfully applied in chemical substances behavior studies involving the formation property and toxicity of those compounds deng et al 2012 chen et al 2015 accordingly mainly based on the observed cytotoxicity data and the binding affinity of aromatic dbps towards key antioxidant enzymes catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione s transferase gst obtained from molecular docking analyses the second objective of this study was to develop a qsar model for interpreting toxicity mechanisms of the selected aromatic dbps and for predicting toxicity of new identified aromatic dbps next we collected tap water and finished water from drinking water treatment plants dwtps in shenzhen a mega city located in southern china with a population of over 12 million and investigated the occurrence of the selected aromatic dbps as well as evaluated the overall toxicity of the drinking water samples by using a recently reported method for estimating the toxicity contribution of individual dbps according to dbp relative concentrations and toxic potencies plewa et al 2017 the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps were

published literature wagner and plewa 2017 with some modifications and the details are shown in the supplementary information si 2 3 molecular docking analysis of dbps binding with antioxidant enzymes the in silico method molecular docking is a powerful tool to predict and explore the predominant binding mode and binding affinity between a receptor biomacromolecule and a ligand li et al 2010 liu et al 2018 thus the binding interactions between the 15 aromatic dbps and the selected antioxidant enzymes were investigated by the docking method using autodock 4 2 morris et al 2009 the structures of 15 aromatic dbps were initially obtained with chemoffice 2010 cambridge soft based on density functional theory dft method at the b3lyp 6 311 g d p level theoretical calculations were performed in gaussian 09 frisch et al 2009 to further obtain the structures with optimized energy and geometry the three dimensional structures of the three antioxidant enzymes were retrieved from the rcsb protein data bank pdb codes of cat sod and gst are 1tgu 1cb4 and 1r5a respectively water molecules were removed at first and polar hydrogens were added prior to docking for the macromolecule the torsion bonds of each of 15 aromatic dbps as ligands were set as default a grid box of 126 126 126 å with 0 600 å spacing was selected and grid maps for blind docking were generated using autogrid 4 2 lamarckian genetic algorithm lga was chosen to implement molecular docking and perform ligand conformational searching due to its effectiveness and reliability morris et al 1998 the docking parameters were set as follows docking trials 50 population size 150 energy evaluations 2500000 the order of receptor binding potency as well as interaction strength can be obtained by comparing the predicted binding energy zhang et al 2019a to further understand the interaction mechanisms for cat dbp complex the conformation with the lowest binding energy was further visualized and analyzed by using pymol 1 7 among the 50 docking trials 2 4 development of qsar model the stepwise multiple linear regression mlr method herrig et al 2015 was applied for the development of qsar model based on the lc50 values of measured cytotoxicity for the descriptors binding energies of the 15 aromatic dbps with cat e cat sod e sod and gst e gst were gained from molecular docking the values of e lumo and e homo were calculated with gaussian 09 the log p values were estimated using the kowwin program version 4 1 the pka values were gained from chemspider other descriptors were calculated using the chemoffice 2010 cambridge soft the most appropriate variables were selected from the 18 descriptors by the stepwise elimination of independent variables by using spss 22 0 software the details regarding statistical metrics for validation of the developed qsar model are shown in the si 2 5 sampling of drinking water samples chlorinated tap water samples were collected at two different points within one water distribution system location 1 is adjacent 50 m to a local dwtp and location 2 is about 5 km away from the dwtp fig s1 finished water samples were acquired from two different dwtps sharing the same raw water by using conventional treatment ozone biological activated carbon o3 bac treatment and the details for the treatment process are listed in fig s1 as well all the drinking water samples were collected in teflon capped glass bottles and immediately transported to the lab upon collection the chlorine residuals in the tap water samples were measured using a water test kit hach and eliminated by dosing 105 of the required amount of na2s2o3 all the drinking water samples were analyzed immediately within 2 h for parameters including dissolved organic carbon doc ammonia ph and uv absorbance

characteristics of the collected tap water and finished water samples 2 6 uplc esi tqms mrm analysis of aromatic dbps in drinking water samples for the detection and quantification of 15 aromatic dbps in each drinking water sample as well as evaluation of overall cytotoxicity the collected samples were pretreated by using liquid liquid extraction and concentrated with rotary evaporation according to previously reported literature pan et al 2017 plewa et al 2011 with some modifications and the details are shown in the si the quantification analysis of the dbps was performed with a triple quad 4500 uplc esi tqms system ab sciex under the mrm mode the sample injection volume was 5 μl in each run the chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 100 mm 1 8 mm waters and the details for the mrm analysis are shown in the si the optimized mrm conditions including ion transitions declustering potential dp entrance potential ep collision energy ce and collision cell exit potential cxp adopted for analysis of the 15 aromatic dbps are listed in table s2 the instrumental limits of detection and quantitation for those dbps were estimated as the concentrations when the signal to noise ratios equal to 3 and 10 respectively under the optimized mrm conditions trace amounts of those dbps were expected to be detected in disinfected drinking water samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative cytotoxicity of 15 aromatic dbps to mammalian cells in vitro by using the mammalian cho k1 cells the selected 15 aromatic dbps fig s2 were assessed for their comparative cytotoxicity the corresponding concentration response curves are illustrated in fig 1 a regression analyses for each curve figs s3 s6 were conducted to generate the lc50 values as shown in fig 1b and table 1 all tested aromatic dbps were cytotoxic with the lc50 values ranging from 5 07 10 5 mol l for 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol to 2 16 10 3 mol l for 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid a smaller lc50 value indicated a higher toxic potency on the basis of the lc50 values the cytotoxicity rank order of the 15 aromatic dbps was 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 bromo 4 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 6 dibromo 4 chlorophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 bromophenol 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 bromo 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 bromo 5 chloro 2 hyroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid based on the lc50 values of the aromatic dbps table 1 some important notes could be drawn first the four subgroups of aromatic dbps exhibited different in vitro toxicity levels with a rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs fig 1b this order was in agreement with that observed in the previous study using the polychaete embryos yang and zhang 2013 however the toxicity order was not fully coincident with that in the bioassay with autotrophic algae e g 2 4 6 tribromophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 5 bromosalicylic acid liu and zhang 2014 the reason for the disparity between the two previous in vivo bioassays was reported that the heterotrophic organism may not be able to metabolize hnps but autotrophic algae were found to present a higher metabolic rate for hnps than hps liu and zhang 2014 besides with the in vitro bioassay another series of previous studies focused on haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles found that those nitrogenous dbps are much more toxic than their carbonaceous analogs muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 based on both previous current in vivo and in vitro studies with heterotrophic species the observed higher toxic potency of hnps than other carbonaceous aromatic dbps further emphasized the importance of controlling nitrogenous dbps as humans are also heterotrophic epidemiological studies regarding nitrogenous aromatic dbps are needed in the future for better understanding of their effects on human health second the cytotoxicity of the aromatic dbps is related with their halogenation type and the position of substitution groups on the benzene ring for all the four subgroups of aromatic dbps brominated dbps presented higher cytotoxicity than their chlorinated analogs for example hps followed the cytotoxicity order of 2 4 6 tribromophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 chlorophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 bromophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol notably the lc50 value of 2 4 6 tribromophenol in this study is higher than that of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 4 37 10 5 mol l previously evaluated with cho cells liberatore et al 2017 combined with the data observed in other toxicity studies yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wagner and plewa 2017 we can believe that the cytotoxicity of aromatic dbps also follow the general toxicity order of iodinated dbps brominated analogs chlorinated analogs as they performed in in vivo bioassays and as other types of dbps e g thms haas haloacetamides performed in in vitro bioassays with different positions of substitution groups on the benzene ring isomers of aromatic dbps showed different cytotoxicity potencies 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzoic acid was 8 9 times more toxic than 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzoic acid was 4 5 times more toxic than 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid for hnps although 2 bromo 4 chloro 6 nitrophenol contains one bromine and one chlorine atoms and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol only contains two chlorine atoms the former is less cytotoxic than the latter dbp table 1 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the difference in substitution position of halogen and nitro groups previous studies also found that 2 4 dihalophenols possessed considerably higher toxicity approximately 7 9 16 6 times than the corresponding 2 6 dihalophenols in terms of in vivo developmental toxicity and growth inhibition yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 besides the e isomer of 3 bromo 3 iodopropenoic acid was reported to be 1 43 times more toxic than its z isomer in cho cell cytotoxicity analysis richardson et al 2008 third although the cytotoxicity of the two commonly known aliphatic dbps tribromomethane and bromoacetic acid has been evaluated with cho cells previously wagner and plewa 2017 to better compare the toxicity of aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps the cytotoxicity of the two aliphatic dbps was also assessed with cho cells in this study as variations of lc50 values may occur even for the same compound due to modifications of experimental procedures as mentioned in section 2 2 the lc50 values of tribromomethane and bromoacetic acid tested in this study were 2 17 10 3 and 1 74 10 5 mol l respectively fig s7 and the previously reported values were 3 96 10 3 and 9 60 10 6 mol l correspondingly wagner and plewa 2017 the close results indicated that the data obtained with in this study can be compared on the same scale with those evaluated with cho cells reported previously interestingly the lc50 values of 15 aromatic dbps were all lower than that of the regulated aliphatic dbp tribromomethane these results agreed well with previous studies focusing on iodinated phenolics and halobenzoquinones with in vitro bioassays liberatore et al 2017 li et al 2015 also such a trend was consistent with the recent in vivo studies evaluated with aquatic organisms yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wang et al 2018 in addition all the 15 aromatic dbps exhibited lower cytotoxic potencies than bromoacetic acid in the present study this phenomenon is completely different to the trends shown in in vivo bioassays i e halogenated aromatic dbps except halogenated hydroxybenzoic acids generally presented significantly higher toxicity than aliphatic haas possible reasons could be different toxic mechanisms for bromoacetic acid being as strongest inhibitors of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh for cho cell which could greatly reduce cellular atp levels as recently revealed by dad et al 2018 considering that both in vitro and in vivo bioassays are important toxicity metrics and they have been widely used to evaluate toxicity of contaminants and pinpoint the toxicologically important species of compounds leusch et al 2014 jia et al 2015 attentions should be paid in future to the reasons for the disparity in dbp comparative toxicity between in vivo and in vitro bioassays 3 2 development of mechanism based qsar model involving binding affinity between aromatic dbps and antioxidant enzymes in order to further understand the toxicity mechanisms of aromatic dbps towards mammalian cells a qsar model was developed in the present study based on the obtained cytotoxicity data li et al 2015 proved that the antioxidant enzyme gst was involved in the toxic mechanisms of the emerging group of dbps halobenzoquinones towards human urinary bladder epithelial carcinoma t24 cells the exposure of halobenzoquinones significantly increased the activity of gst which was believed to be critical for protecting cells from the toxic effects of those dbps also cytotoxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls was demonstrated to be associated with cellular oxidative stress and their existence affects the activities of antioxidant enzymes cat sod and gst in human hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 cells liu et al 2012 yang et al 2019b reported that different antioxidant enzymes can work together to constitute a defense system against cellular oxidative stress if toxicants induce or inhibit the activity of these enzymes the antioxidant defense system could change in response to the interactions between toxicants and antioxidant enzymes thus investigation on the binding interactions between antioxidant enzymes and aromatic dbps may help to deepen the understanding of toxicity mechanisms of those dbps accordingly to testify whether activities of antioxidant enzymes are associated with the toxic effects of aromatic dbps towards the mammalian cells e cat e sod and e gst gained from the in silico method were adopted as candidate descriptors during developing the qsar model table 1 and fig s8 showed the predicted binding energies of the aromatic dbps with the three antioxidant enzymes besides physical chemical quantum chemical and topological properties are frequently used descriptors in qsar analyses chen et al 2015 thus two physical chemical descriptors i e octanol water partition coefficient log p and acid dissociation constant pka six quantum chemical descriptors e g the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo and seven topological descriptors e g total valence connectivity and wiener index were also selected as candidate descriptors for developing the qsar model table s3 their values corresponding to the 15 aromatic dbps are listed in table s4 our data set contains 15 aromatic dbps and the ratio between the number of cases and variables in models should be higher than 5 1 to avoid chance correlation pérez garrido et al 2008 thus the maximum number of variables should be limited to three in the developed model for the selection of the most appropriate descriptors among the 18 candidates table s3 the elimination selection stepwise regression es swr afantitis et al 2006 algorithm was carried out for descriptor internal filtration to develop the qsar model stepwise multiple regression based on the es swr algorithm was performed by spss 22 0 software the resulting optimum qsar model is shown in equation 1 1 log lc50 1 1 050e cat 0 300e homo 0 238e lumo 0 164 n 15 r 2 0 844 q 2 loo 0 719 r 2 ys 0 271 q 2 ys 0 277 rmse 0 212 mae 0 137 f 19 8 p 0 0001 where n is the number of compounds in the data set r 2 is the determination coefficient q 2 loo is the leave one out cross validation coefficient r 2 ys and q 2 ys are y scrambling technique parameters rmse and mae are the root mean square error and the mean absolute error for the data set respectively p is the significant level both r 2 and q 2 loo are larger than 0 700 and the p value was lower than 0 0001 showing the model with high goodness of fit and robustness according to the acceptable criteria r 2 0 700 q 2 loo 0 600 p 0 05 chen et al 2015 the rmse and mae values were relatively small meanwhile the f values were relatively greater in certain degrees of freedom the applicability domain which indicated the area of reliable predictions of the model was characterized using the williams plot chen et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 a all the compounds in the data set are in the domain indicating that the data set has great representativeness according to the y scrambling test criteria the obtained random models have significantly lower prediction accuracies than the model based on the real data indicating no accidental correlation in the qsar model fig 2b karabulut et al 2016 also as shown in table s5 the variance inflation factors vifs of the three variables are all lower than 10 indicating that there is no serious multi collinearity among the variables and the established model is stable and acceptable hou et al 2019 the plot of observed versus predicted log lc50 1 values is shown in fig 2c further demonstrating that the lc50 values predicted from the developed model are generally coincident with the observed values to further check the performance of the qsar model cytotoxicity data of another subgroup of aromatic dbps i e halobenzoquinones from li et al 2015 was adopted here to compare with the predicted toxicity calculated by using the established qsar model the descriptor values of those dbps were calculated and shown in table s6 as displayed in fig s9 the predicted toxicity values of 8 halobenzoquinones were evenly distributed near the red dashed diagonal line indicating that the established qsar model could also be used to predict toxicity values of other species of aromatic dbps apart from hps hnps hbads and hbacs 3 3 implications of the developed qsar model to toxicity mechanisms of the aromatic dbps as mentioned above the optimum qsar model involves three descriptors e cat e lumo and e homo thus toxicity mechanisms of the aromatic dbps can be revealed to some extent according to the implications of the three descriptors cat is the primary antioxidant that participates in decomposition of excess ros and protects the tissue cells from oxidative damage zhang et al 2019b and the involvement of the e cat descriptor confirmed the anticipated importance of the interactions of aromatic dbps towards cat in the toxicity mechanisms to further understand the potential mechanism of the cytotoxicity of aromatic dbps from perspective of cat binding interactions binding mode of each aromatic dbp with cat was further analyzed here by building structures of receptor ligand i e cat dbp complexes through molecular docking cat is a tetrameric protein and consists of four similar subunits each with a porphyrin heme group in ligand binding site xu et al 2018 one subunit of cat secondary structure shown in fig s10a was selected to simulate possible binding sites of 15 aromatic dbps with cat for each aromatic dbp the binding site with the lowest binding energy was considered as the most possible binding site among the 50 positions obtained from molecular docking simulation and the results are shown in figs s11 s14 generally the binding sites of the 15 aromatic dbps could be classified into three different types fig 3 most of the 15 aromatic dbps were located in the area beside β barrel except that two hnps 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol were located in the area between the helical domain and the wrapping domain and two hbacs 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid were located in the area between β barrel and the wrapping domain cat is negatively charged in total but with positive and negative charges distributed in different localized regions of the macromolecule qin and liu 2013 fig s10b and fig 4 showed the electrostatic potential surfaces of cat and the 15 aromatic dbps respectively electrostatic potentials of 15 aromatic dbps differed with different types and sites of substitution groups fig 4 thus all 15 aromatic dbps could interact with the positively and negatively charged amino acid residues of cat through electrostatic interactions which determined their binding sites as well as binding energy this could explain the three different favorable binding sites for 15 aromatic dbps for example all the four hps shared the same binding site since their electrostatic potential distribution was almost uniform for 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol the strong negatively charged zone by two o atoms attached to n atom made them favorably bind to the highly positively charged surface of cat fig s12 the active center of cat is the heme moiety chelikani et al 2004 since the heme group is deeply embedded in each subunit of cat substrates e g ros need to diffuse to the active center through some channels to be scavenged focusing on the potential toxicity of fluoroquinolones qin and liu 2013 and sarafloxacin cao et al 2013 as well as their interactions towards cat the previous studies suggested that although no direct binding of toxicants to the active center could be found the steric hindrance effect of toxicants outside the active center heme could result in the reduced cat activity accordingly although all 15 aromatic dbps were not bind closely to the heme group the 15 aromatic dbps in the three above binding sites may block or impede substrates approaching the active center to some extent leading to the inhibition of the cat activity for the binding energy analysis a lower binding energy indicated that the corresponding dbp possesses a higher binding potency towards the enzymes the binding potency of the 15 aromatic dbps followed the rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs such an order agreed well with the aforementioned cytotoxicity order in each subgroup owing to the electrostatic interactions between the aromatic dbps and the receptor cat mentioned above brominated dbps presented higher binding affinity than their chlorinated analogs which is also consistent with the observed cytotoxicity order in addition descriptors of e lumo and e homo show that the cytotoxicity is related with the reactivity of the compound which closely links to its frontier molecular orbitals e lumo is related to the relative electrophilicity and a lower value suggests that the corresponding molecule tends to accept electrons while e homo corresponds to more reactive reactions with electrophiles morell et al 2005 yang and zhang 2013 thus the toxicity of an electrophilic dbp to a nucleophile site or a nucleophilic dbp to an electrophile site may increase with decreasing e lumo and increasing e homo these results could also explain the highest cytotoxicity of hnps compared to hps hbads and hbacs due to their strong electron withdrawing effect by the existence of a nitro substituent on an aromatic ring which could lead to a number of potential electrophilic reactions 3 4 identification of the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps and comparative overall toxicity of shenzhen drinking water table s1 shows the characteristics of the collected tap water and finished water samples the chlorine residual concentrations in tap water collected from the location 1 and the location 2 were 1 16 and 0 81 mg l as cl2 respectively implying the decay of chlorine residual along pipelines the chlorine residual concentrations in the collected finished water with conventional treatment and o3 bac treatment were 0 59 and 0 76 mg l as cl2 respectively indicating a good performance in maintaining a relatively higher level of chlorine residual by using o3 bac treatment the concentrations of the 15 halogenated aromatic dbps in chlorinated drinking water samples are shown in fig 5 a and b except for 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenaldehyde all of the aromatic dbps were detected with concentrations of 1 0 9 8 ng l in tap water samples and their concentrations in the sample collected at the location adjacent to the dwtp location 1 1 0 7 7 ng l were generally lower than that collected at the location relatively far from the plant location 2 1 2 9 8 ng l among the detected dbps 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid respectively showed the lowest and highest concentrations in both of the two tap water samples it should be noted that three hnps i e 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 bromo 4 chloro 6 nitrophenol were detected in real chlorinated drinking water for the first time with concentrations of 4 9 8 3 ng l for the finished drinking water nine of the 15 dbps could be detected at concentrations of 2 4 21 7 ng l in the water sample using the conventional treatment while only four can be detected with concentrations of 2 7 31 6 ng l in the drinking water treated with o3 bac treatment fig 5b indicating the superiority of o3 bac treatment in removing the precursors of aromatic dbps compared to the conventional treatment it can also be observed that doc value of finished water treated with o3 bac 1 54 mg l was slightly higher than that of conventional treatment 1 22 mg l according to the treatment process of the water treatment plant fig s1 the reason for this phenomenon could be the microbial leakage from bac filtration without the post filtration process which as a result increased doc level chu et al 2015 interestingly compared with the water sample with conventional treatment no significant reduction of the formation of the four hps in the sample with o3 bac treatment can be observed the concentration of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol even increased by one third this may be partially due to the leakage of biofilm through bac filtration besides huang et al 2018 reported the effect of ozone granular activated carbon o3 gac treatment on the formation of halogenated aromatic dpbs in simulated drinking water compared with the non treated drinking water sample the formation of the halogenated aromatic dbps in the sample with o3 gac treatment was decreased by 97 3 and the specific reduction rates of hbads hbacs halosalicylic acids and hps were 99 9 99 9 96 2 and 94 7 respectively hps exhibited the lowest reduction rate among the four tested subgroups in the previous study therefore hps in the sample with o3 bac treatment showed a comparable or even higher level than those compounds in the sample with conventional treatment should be reasonable in addition pan et al 2017 investigated the occurrence of 13 aromatic dbps in eight major cities in east china 12 dbps were the same as the target dbps in the present study and 12 of them could be detected with concentrations ranging from 1 1 for 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde to 215 0 ng l 2 4 6 trichlorophenol moreover zhang et al 2019c reported the occurrence of an emerging class of aromatic nitrogeneous dbps chlorophenylacetonitriles eight of which were detected at concentrations of 0 8 155 ng l in chlorinated drinking water samples compared with the two previously reported studies the formation of the 15 aromatic dbps in shenzhen drinking water showed a low to medium level interestingly bei et al 2016 investigated the occurrence of another important class of dbps nitrosamines in drinking water from different geographical regions in china and demonstrated that drinking water in east china show a wider concentration range than that in south china both of which are two developed areas in china for example the highest concentrations of ndma in finished drinking water and tap water in east china yangtze river delta region achieved to 163 and 189 ng l respectively which are significantly higher than their counterparts 38 and 98 ng l respectively in south china pearl river delta region based on these studies the relatively lower concentrations of halogenated aromatic dbps observed in shenzhen belongs to pearl river delta region drinking water than those in east china yangtze river delta region were probably due to heavier contamination of aromatic dbp precursors in source water in east china than that in the city shenzhen located in south china the next step after gaining the concentrations of each dbp and their lc50 values is to identify the forcing agents among the 15 halogenated aromatic dbps in disinfected drinking water the total calculated drinking water toxicity which is based on measured concentrations and cytotoxicity as the total concentration toxicity index value is calculated fig 6 a according to the tic tox method suggested by plewa et al 2017 details are shown in si in addition the concentration percentage contributions of the four subgroups of dbps as well as concentration toxicity percentages contributions were calculated for comparison fig 7 since only hps were detected in the finished water sample using o3 bac treatment comparison for this sample was omitted here for the two tap water samples hbacs accounted for the highest proportion of the total concentration 37 3 for location 1 and 39 1 for location 2 while contributed the lowest proportion of the total calculated toxicity 9 7 for location 1 and 9 9 for location 2 in contrast although hnps only respectively constituted 32 0 and 30 6 of the measured total concentration in tap water from location 1 and location 2 their calculated concentration toxicity percentages achieved to 65 3 and 64 6 respectively clearly showing them existed as toxicity drivers in the tap water samples for the finished water sample using the conventional treatment the same trend could be observed as the concentration percentage of hps 64 5 decreased to the concentration toxicity percentage of 44 3 while the concentration percentage of hnps 25 7 increased to concentration toxicity percentage of 48 5 in general the toxicity contributions among the four subgroups of aromatic dbps followed the rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs among the 15 aromatic dbps 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol was the toxicity driver in tap water from location 1 and location 2 and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol were the toxicity drivers in finished water using the conventional treatment and the o3 bac treatment respectively figs s15 and s16 in addition we also compared the overall cytotoxicity of chlorinated drinking water and the total calculated toxicity of aromatic dbps in drinking water the overall cytotoxicity of the two tap water samples and the two finished water samples are shown in fig 5c and d the lc50 values for tap water samples collected at location 1 and location 2 were 209 and 110 as concentration factor while for finished water samples using conventional treatment and o3 bac treatment were 232 and 336 as concentration factor respectively to directly compare the cytotoxicity for each drinking water sample a cytotoxicity index value was calculated by multiplying the reciprocal of lc50 value by 1000 and a higher value represented a greater cytotoxic potency plewa et al 2011 the overall cytotoxicity index values for the four drinking water samples are shown in fig 6b following a decreasing order as tap water location 2 tap water location 1 finished water conventional treatment finished water o3 bac treatment which is consistent with the order of the total concentration toxicity index values of the four drinking water samples in general the coincidence of the order based on the two types of index values indicated that tic tox method could also be used as an effective tool to estimate the comparative overall toxicity for disinfected water samples 4 conclusions the comparative cytotoxicity of 15 halogenated dbps was evaluated by using the mammalian cho k1 cells in general the selected aromatic dbps exhibited an in vitro toxicity rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs based on the observed cytotoxicity data and screening the candidate descriptors including binding energies between the aromatic dbps and key antioxidant enzymes as well as physical chemical quantum chemical topological descriptors a qsar model was developed and indicated the importance of the interactions of aromatic dbps towards cat and the electrophilic nucleophilic reactivity of aromatic dbps in the toxicity mechanisms in addition the occurrence of the aromatic dbps in shenzhen tap water and finished water was studied the results showed that halogenated aromatic dbps commonly existed in drinking water in the mega city at ng l levels and three nitrogenous aromatic dbps were detected in real drinking water for the first time in general o3 bac treatment was superior to the conventional treatment in controlling the formation of halogenated aromatic dbps except hps by using the tic tox method the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps can be identified notably dbps with the highest concentrations may not contribute the highest proportions of overall toxicity i e although hbacs were found to be prevailing species than the other three subgroups of aromatic dbps in the tap water samples they showed the least toxicity contribution percentages and the toxicity forcing agents were calculated to be hnps with the advancement of modern analytical techniques and the on going research on dbp identification and formation more new aromatic dbps are likely to be detected and identified in disinfected water thus the developed qsar model in this study can provide a useful tool to predict the cytotoxicity of new identified aromatic dbps and pinpointing toxicity forcing agents in disinfected water in future studies in addition plewa et al 2017 recently reported that nitrogenous aliphatic dbps mainly including haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides tended to be major toxicity drivers in drinking water samples from three cities in general dbp composition in real drinking water samples is complex and variable therefore to better understand the role of aromatic dbps in overall toxicity and better control the overall toxicity of drinking water further systematic and comprehensive dbp studies involving the simultaneous occurrence of aromatic dbps and other different

18245,halogenated aromatic disinfection byproducts dbps are a new group of emerging dbps identified recently they have been detected in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluents recreational water and oil gas produced water at concentrations of ng l to μg l in general previously studies have demonstrated that most of them can induce developmental toxicity and growth inhibition in aquatic organisms based on in vivo bioassays in this study to further understand the adverse effects of aromatic dbps to human health the comparative cytotoxicity of 15 halogenated aromatic dbps belonging to four subgroups i e halophenols halonitrophenols halohydroxybenzaldehydes and halohydroxybenzoic acids was evaluated with mammalian chinese hamster ovary cells the results indicated that the selected aromatic dbps exhibited an in vitro toxicity rank order of halonitrophenols halophenols halohydroxybenzaldehydes halohydroxybenzoic acids the potential toxicity mechanisms involved with the antioxidant system were investigated by using molecular docking analysis between key antioxidant enzymes i e catalase superoxide dismutase and glutathione s transferase and aromatic dbps based on the observed cytotoxicity data and screening the candidate descriptors including binding energies between the aromatic dbps and key antioxidant enzymes as well as physical chemical quantum chemical topological descriptors a qsar model was developed as log lc50 1 1 050e cat 0 300e homo 0 238e lumo 0 164 indicating the importance of the interactions of aromatic dbps towards catalase and the electrophilic nucleophilic reactivity of aromatic dbps in the toxicity mechanisms in addition the occurrence of the aromatic dbps in tap water and finished water was studied in a mega city shenzhen located in south china results showed that halogenated aromatic dbps commonly existed in shenzhen drinking water at ng l levels and three nitrogenous aromatic dbps were detected in real drinking water for the first time the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps were identified through the integration of the measured concentrations and observed cytotoxicity notably dbps with the highest concentrations may not contribute the highest proportions of overall toxicity graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products aromatic dbps toxicity evaluation qsar drinking water 1 introduction disinfection is an essential procedure for preventing waterborne diseases during drinking water treatment however the reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter or even environmental contaminants derived from anthropogenic activities in the source water can lead to the formation of unintended disinfection byproducts dbps chu et al 2015 richardson and ternes 2018 yang et al 2019a up to now more than 800 dbps have been identified with the efforts of researchers since the first dbp trichloromethane was reported in 1974 rook 1974 yang and zhang 2016 previous studies based on various types of bioassays suggested that many dbps may possess cytotoxicity genotoxicity mutagenicity and or teratogenicity manasfi et al 2017 richardson and ternes 2018 besides epidemiological studies have illustrated that dbp exposure potentially raises health risks e g colorectal bladder cancer and adverse birth outcomes villanueva et al 2014 grellier et al 2015 therefore dbp exposure is of increasing concern to both researchers and the general public with the aid of a novel precursor ion scan pis method using ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry uplc esi tqms zhang s group reported more than 150 previously unknown dbps over the past decade many of them belong to halogenated aromatic dbps e g 2 4 6 tribromophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 5 dibromohydroquinone and tetrabromopyrrole yang et al 2019a those aromatic dbps have been detected in chlorinated chloraminated simulated drinking water real tap water wastewater effluents and swimming pool water with concentration levels ranging from ng l to μg l xiao et al 2012 yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019a moreover li s group reported the identification formation and occurrence of another important class of aromatic dbps halobenzoquinones wang et al 2015 2016 notably the comparative toxicity of new emerging aromatic dbps and frequently regulated aliphatic dbps trihalomethanes thms and or haloacetic acids haas was assessed by using in vivo toxicity bioassays with aquatic organisms and the results showed that the former group of dbps generally exhibited tens to hundreds times higher toxicity than the latter group in terms of growth inhibition and developmental toxicity potencies yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wang et al 2018 for example 2 4 6 tribromophenol was approximately 125 and 72 times more toxic than bromoacetic acid to autotrophic algae tetraselmis marina and embryos of a heterotrophic polychaete species platynereis dumerilii respectively halobenzoquinones were found to possess up to 200 times higher toxic potency than haas towards zebrafish embryos based on an in vitro bioassay liberatore et al 2017 comparatively evaluated the cytotoxicity of four iodinated phenolic dbps which were detected and identified in chloraminated oil and gas wastewaters all of them were cytotoxic and the most toxic one 2 4 6 triiodophenol showed a higher toxic potency than all thms and most haas by using mammalian chinese hamster ovary cho cells plewa s group have evaluated the toxicity of over a hundred dbps covering many types of compounds e g haloacids haloacetamides haloacetonitriles etc wagner and plewa 2017 although halogenated aromatic dbps are toxicologically important on the basis of in vivo bioassays only several iodinated phenolic dbps were evaluated by the in vitro mammalian cell cytotoxicity bioassay to study whether aromatic dbps present a similar toxicity order in mammalian cells as that in aquatic organisms the toxicity of 15 aromatic dbps belonging to four subgroups halophenols hps halonitrophenols hnps halohydroxybenzaldehydes hbads and halohydroxybenzoic acids hbacs was evaluated by using the mammalian cho cells in this study moreover oxidative stress is considered as an important mechanism responsible for halobenzoquinones induced cytotoxicity and halobenzoquinones could inhibit activities of cellular antioxidant enzymes li et al 2015 2018 wang et al 2018 quantitative structure activity relationship qsar methods have been successfully applied in chemical substances behavior studies involving the formation property and toxicity of those compounds deng et al 2012 chen et al 2015 accordingly mainly based on the observed cytotoxicity data and the binding affinity of aromatic dbps towards key antioxidant enzymes catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione s transferase gst obtained from molecular docking analyses the second objective of this study was to develop a qsar model for interpreting toxicity mechanisms of the selected aromatic dbps and for predicting toxicity of new identified aromatic dbps next we collected tap water and finished water from drinking water treatment plants dwtps in shenzhen a mega city located in southern china with a population of over 12 million and investigated the occurrence of the selected aromatic dbps as well as evaluated the overall toxicity of the drinking water samples by using a recently reported method for estimating the toxicity contribution of individual dbps according to dbp relative concentrations and toxic potencies plewa et al 2017 the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps were

density as a function of dbp concentration with exposure time of 72 h a period of around three cell divisions plewa et al 2008 the experimental procedures for the bioassay were according to a published literature wagner and plewa 2017 with some modifications and the details are shown in the supplementary information si 2 3 molecular docking analysis of dbps binding with antioxidant enzymes the in silico method molecular docking is a powerful tool to predict and explore the predominant binding mode and binding affinity between a receptor biomacromolecule and a ligand li et al 2010 liu et al 2018 thus the binding interactions between the 15 aromatic dbps and the selected antioxidant enzymes were investigated by the docking method using autodock 4 2 morris et al 2009 the structures of 15 aromatic dbps were initially obtained with chemoffice 2010 cambridge soft based on density functional theory dft method at the b3lyp 6 311 g d p level theoretical calculations were performed in gaussian 09 frisch et al 2009 to further obtain the structures with optimized energy and geometry the three dimensional structures of the three antioxidant enzymes were retrieved from the rcsb protein data bank pdb codes of cat sod and gst are 1tgu 1cb4 and 1r5a respectively water molecules were removed at first and polar hydrogens were added prior to docking for the macromolecule the torsion bonds of each of 15 aromatic dbps as ligands were set as default a grid box of 126 126 126 å with 0 600 å spacing was selected and grid maps for blind docking were generated using autogrid 4 2 lamarckian genetic algorithm lga was chosen to implement molecular docking and perform ligand conformational searching due to its effectiveness and reliability morris et al 1998 the docking parameters were set as follows docking trials 50 population size 150 energy evaluations 2500000 the order of receptor binding potency as well as interaction strength can be obtained by comparing the predicted binding energy zhang et al 2019a to further understand the interaction mechanisms for cat dbp complex the conformation with the lowest binding energy was further visualized and analyzed by using pymol 1 7 among the 50 docking trials 2 4 development of qsar model the stepwise multiple linear regression mlr method herrig et al 2015 was applied for the development of qsar model based on the lc50 values of measured cytotoxicity for the descriptors binding energies of the 15 aromatic dbps with cat e cat sod e sod and gst e gst were gained from molecular docking the values of e lumo and e homo were calculated with gaussian 09 the log p values were estimated using the kowwin program version 4 1 the pka values were gained from chemspider other descriptors were calculated using the chemoffice 2010 cambridge soft the most appropriate variables were selected from the 18 descriptors by the stepwise elimination of independent variables by using spss 22 0 software the details regarding statistical metrics for validation of the developed qsar model are shown in the si 2 5 sampling of drinking water samples chlorinated tap water samples were collected at two different points within one water distribution system location 1 is adjacent 50 m to a local dwtp and location 2 is about 5 km away from the dwtp fig s1 finished water samples were acquired from two different dwtps sharing the same raw water by using conventional treatment ozone biological activated carbon o3 bac treatment and the details for the treatment process are listed in fig s1 as well all the drinking water samples were collected in teflon capped glass bottles and immediately transported to the lab upon collection the chlorine residuals in the tap water samples were measured using a water test kit hach and eliminated by dosing 105 of the required amount of na2s2o3 all the drinking water samples were analyzed immediately within 2 h for parameters including dissolved organic carbon doc ammonia ph and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 with a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu a water test kit hach a ph meter ohaus and a uv visible spectrophotometer mapada uv 3200 respectively table s1 shows the characteristics of the collected tap water and finished water samples 2 6 uplc esi tqms mrm analysis of aromatic dbps in drinking water samples for the detection and quantification of 15 aromatic dbps in each drinking water sample as well as evaluation of overall cytotoxicity the collected samples were pretreated by using liquid liquid extraction and concentrated with rotary evaporation according to previously reported literature pan et al 2017 plewa et al 2011 with some modifications and the details are shown in the si the quantification analysis of the dbps was performed with a triple quad 4500 uplc esi tqms system ab sciex under the mrm mode the sample injection volume was 5 μl in each run the chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 100 mm 1 8 mm waters and the details for the mrm analysis are shown in the si the optimized mrm conditions including ion transitions declustering potential dp entrance potential ep collision energy ce and collision cell exit potential cxp adopted for analysis of the 15 aromatic dbps are listed in table s2 the instrumental limits of detection and quantitation for those dbps were estimated as the concentrations when the signal to noise ratios equal to 3 and 10 respectively under the optimized mrm conditions trace amounts of those dbps were expected to be detected in disinfected drinking water samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative cytotoxicity of 15 aromatic dbps to mammalian cells in vitro by using the mammalian cho k1 cells the selected 15 aromatic dbps fig s2 were assessed for their comparative cytotoxicity the corresponding concentration response curves are illustrated in fig 1 a regression analyses for each curve figs s3 s6 were conducted to generate the lc50 values as shown in fig 1b and table 1 all tested aromatic dbps were cytotoxic with the lc50 values ranging from 5 07 10 5 mol l for 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol to 2 16 10 3 mol l for 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid a smaller lc50 value indicated a higher toxic potency on the basis of the lc50 values the cytotoxicity rank order of the 15 aromatic dbps was 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 bromo 4 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 6 dibromo 4 chlorophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 bromophenol 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 bromo 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 bromo 5 chloro 2 hyroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid based on the lc50 values of the aromatic dbps table 1 some important notes could be drawn first the four subgroups of aromatic dbps exhibited different in vitro toxicity levels with a rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs fig 1b this order was in agreement with that observed in the previous study using the polychaete embryos yang and zhang 2013 however the toxicity order was not fully coincident with that in the bioassay with autotrophic algae e g 2 4 6 tribromophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 5 bromosalicylic acid liu and zhang 2014 the reason for the disparity between the two previous in vivo bioassays was reported that the heterotrophic organism may not be able to metabolize hnps but autotrophic algae were found to present a higher metabolic rate for hnps than hps liu and zhang 2014 besides with the in vitro bioassay another series of previous studies focused on haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles found that those nitrogenous dbps are much more toxic than their carbonaceous analogs muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 based on both previous current in vivo and in vitro studies with heterotrophic species the observed higher toxic potency of hnps than other carbonaceous aromatic dbps further emphasized the importance of controlling nitrogenous dbps as humans are also heterotrophic epidemiological studies regarding nitrogenous aromatic dbps are needed in the future for better understanding of their effects on human health second the cytotoxicity of the aromatic dbps is related with their halogenation type and the position of substitution groups on the benzene ring for all the four subgroups of aromatic dbps brominated dbps presented higher cytotoxicity than their chlorinated analogs for example hps followed the cytotoxicity order of 2 4 6 tribromophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 chlorophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 bromophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol notably the lc50 value of 2 4 6 tribromophenol in this study is higher than that of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 4 37 10 5 mol l previously evaluated with cho cells liberatore et al 2017 combined with the data observed in other toxicity studies yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wagner and plewa 2017 we can believe that the cytotoxicity of aromatic dbps also follow the general toxicity order of iodinated dbps brominated analogs chlorinated analogs as they performed in in vivo bioassays and as other types of dbps e g thms haas haloacetamides performed in in vitro bioassays with different positions of substitution groups on the benzene ring isomers of aromatic dbps showed different cytotoxicity potencies 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzoic acid was 8 9 times more toxic than 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzoic acid was 4 5 times more toxic than 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid for hnps although 2 bromo 4 chloro 6 nitrophenol contains one bromine and one chlorine atoms and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol only contains two chlorine atoms the former is less cytotoxic than the latter dbp table 1 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the difference in substitution position of halogen and nitro groups previous studies also found that 2 4 dihalophenols possessed considerably higher toxicity approximately 7 9 16 6 times than the corresponding 2 6 dihalophenols in terms of in vivo developmental toxicity and growth inhibition yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 besides the e isomer of 3 bromo 3 iodopropenoic acid was reported to be 1 43 times more toxic than its z isomer in cho cell cytotoxicity analysis richardson et al 2008 third although the cytotoxicity of the two commonly known aliphatic dbps tribromomethane and bromoacetic acid has been evaluated with cho cells previously wagner and plewa 2017 to better compare the toxicity of aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps the cytotoxicity of the two aliphatic dbps was also assessed with cho cells in this study as variations of lc50 values may occur even for the same compound due to modifications of experimental procedures as mentioned in section 2 2 the lc50 values of tribromomethane and bromoacetic acid tested in this study were 2 17 10 3 and 1 74 10 5 mol l respectively fig s7 and the previously reported values were 3 96 10 3 and 9 60 10 6 mol l correspondingly wagner and plewa 2017 the close results indicated that the data obtained with in this study can be compared on the same scale with those evaluated with cho cells reported previously interestingly the lc50 values of 15 aromatic dbps were all lower than that of the regulated aliphatic dbp tribromomethane these results agreed well with previous studies focusing on iodinated phenolics and halobenzoquinones with in vitro bioassays liberatore et al 2017 li et al 2015 also such a trend was consistent with the recent in vivo studies evaluated with aquatic organisms yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wang et al 2018 in addition all the 15 aromatic dbps exhibited lower cytotoxic potencies than bromoacetic acid in the present study this phenomenon is completely different to the trends shown in in vivo bioassays i e halogenated aromatic dbps except halogenated hydroxybenzoic acids generally presented significantly higher toxicity than aliphatic haas possible reasons could be different toxic mechanisms for bromoacetic acid being as strongest inhibitors of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh for cho cell which could greatly reduce cellular atp levels as recently revealed by dad et al 2018 considering that both in vitro and in vivo bioassays are important toxicity metrics and they have been widely used to evaluate toxicity of contaminants and pinpoint the toxicologically important species of compounds leusch et al 2014 jia et al 2015 attentions should be paid in future to the reasons for the disparity in dbp comparative toxicity between in vivo and in vitro bioassays 3 2 development of mechanism based qsar model involving binding affinity between aromatic dbps and antioxidant enzymes in order to further understand the toxicity mechanisms of aromatic dbps towards mammalian cells a qsar model was developed in the present study based on the obtained cytotoxicity data li et al 2015 proved that the antioxidant enzyme gst was involved in the toxic mechanisms of the emerging group of dbps halobenzoquinones towards human urinary bladder epithelial carcinoma t24 cells the exposure of halobenzoquinones significantly increased the activity of gst which was believed to be critical for protecting cells from the toxic effects of those dbps also cytotoxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls was demonstrated to be associated with cellular oxidative stress and their existence affects the activities of antioxidant enzymes cat sod and gst in human hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 cells liu et al 2012 yang et al 2019b reported that different antioxidant enzymes can work together to constitute a defense system against cellular oxidative stress if toxicants induce or inhibit the activity of these enzymes the antioxidant defense system could change in response to the interactions between toxicants and antioxidant enzymes thus investigation on the binding interactions between antioxidant enzymes and aromatic dbps may help to deepen the understanding of toxicity mechanisms of those dbps accordingly to testify whether activities of antioxidant enzymes are associated with the toxic effects of aromatic dbps towards the mammalian cells e cat e sod and e gst gained from the in silico method were adopted as candidate descriptors during developing the qsar model table 1 and fig s8 showed the predicted binding energies of the aromatic dbps with the three antioxidant enzymes besides physical chemical quantum chemical and topological properties are frequently used descriptors in qsar analyses chen et al 2015 thus two physical chemical descriptors i e octanol water partition coefficient log p and acid dissociation constant pka six quantum chemical descriptors e g the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo and seven topological descriptors e g total valence connectivity and wiener index were also selected as candidate descriptors for developing the qsar model table s3 their values corresponding to the 15 aromatic dbps are listed in table s4 our data set contains 15 aromatic dbps and the ratio between the number of cases and variables in models should be higher than 5 1 to avoid chance correlation pérez garrido et al 2008 thus the maximum number of variables should be limited to three in the developed model for the selection of the most appropriate descriptors among the 18 candidates table s3 the elimination selection stepwise regression es swr afantitis et al 2006 algorithm was carried out for descriptor internal filtration to develop the qsar model stepwise multiple regression based on the es swr algorithm was performed by spss 22 0 software the resulting optimum qsar model is shown in equation 1 1 log lc50 1 1 050e cat 0 300e homo 0 238e lumo 0 164 n 15 r 2 0 844 q 2 loo 0 719 r 2 ys 0 271 q

2015 the rmse and mae values were relatively small meanwhile the f values were relatively greater in certain degrees of freedom the applicability domain which indicated the area of reliable predictions of the model was characterized using the williams plot chen et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 a all the compounds in the data set are in the domain indicating that the data set has great representativeness according to the y scrambling test criteria the obtained random models have significantly lower prediction accuracies than the model based on the real data indicating no accidental correlation in the qsar model fig 2b karabulut et al 2016 also as shown in table s5 the variance inflation factors vifs of the three variables are all lower than 10 indicating that there is no serious multi collinearity among the variables and the established model is stable and acceptable hou et al 2019 the plot of observed versus predicted log lc50 1 values is shown in fig 2c further demonstrating that the lc50 values predicted from the developed model are generally coincident with the observed values to further check the performance of the qsar model cytotoxicity data of another subgroup of aromatic dbps i e halobenzoquinones from li et al 2015 was adopted here to compare with the predicted toxicity calculated by using the established qsar model the descriptor values of those dbps were calculated and shown in table s6 as displayed in fig s9 the predicted toxicity values of 8 halobenzoquinones were evenly distributed near the red dashed diagonal line indicating that the established qsar model could also be used to predict toxicity values of other species of aromatic dbps apart from hps hnps hbads and hbacs 3 3 implications of the developed qsar model to toxicity mechanisms of the aromatic dbps as mentioned above the optimum qsar model involves three descriptors e cat e lumo and e homo thus toxicity mechanisms of the aromatic dbps can be revealed to some extent according to the implications of the three descriptors cat is the primary antioxidant that participates in decomposition of excess ros and protects the tissue cells from oxidative damage zhang et al 2019b and the involvement of the e cat descriptor confirmed the anticipated importance of the interactions of aromatic dbps towards cat in the toxicity mechanisms to further understand the potential mechanism of the cytotoxicity of aromatic dbps from perspective of cat binding interactions binding mode of each aromatic dbp with cat was further analyzed here by building structures of receptor ligand i e cat dbp complexes through molecular docking cat is a tetrameric protein and consists of four similar subunits each with a porphyrin heme group in ligand binding site xu et al 2018 one subunit of cat secondary structure shown in fig s10a was selected to simulate possible binding sites of 15 aromatic dbps with cat for each aromatic dbp the binding site with the lowest binding energy was considered as the most possible binding site among the 50 positions obtained from molecular docking simulation and the results are shown in figs s11 s14 generally the binding sites of the 15 aromatic dbps could be classified into three different types fig 3 most of the 15 aromatic dbps were located in the area beside β barrel except that two hnps 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol were located in the area between the helical domain and the wrapping domain and two hbacs 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid were located in the area between β barrel and the wrapping domain cat is negatively charged in total but with positive and negative charges distributed in different localized regions of the macromolecule qin and liu 2013 fig s10b and fig 4 showed the electrostatic potential surfaces of cat and the 15 aromatic dbps respectively electrostatic potentials of 15 aromatic dbps differed with different types and sites of substitution groups fig 4 thus all 15 aromatic dbps could interact with the positively and negatively charged amino acid residues of cat through electrostatic interactions which determined their binding sites as well as binding energy this could explain the three different favorable binding sites for 15 aromatic dbps for example all the four hps shared the same binding site since their electrostatic potential distribution was almost uniform for 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol the strong negatively charged zone by two o atoms attached to n atom made them favorably bind to the highly positively charged surface of cat fig s12 the active center of cat is the heme moiety chelikani et al 2004 since the heme group is deeply embedded in each subunit of cat substrates e g ros need to diffuse to the active center through some channels to be scavenged focusing on the potential toxicity of fluoroquinolones qin and liu 2013 and sarafloxacin cao et al 2013 as well as their interactions towards cat the previous studies suggested that although no direct binding of toxicants to the active center could be found the steric hindrance effect of toxicants outside the active center heme could result in the reduced cat activity accordingly although all 15 aromatic dbps were not bind closely to the heme group the 15 aromatic dbps in the three above binding sites may block or impede substrates approaching the active center to some extent leading to the inhibition of the cat activity for the binding energy analysis a lower binding energy indicated that the corresponding dbp possesses a higher binding potency towards the enzymes the binding potency of the 15 aromatic dbps followed the rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs such an order agreed well with the aforementioned cytotoxicity order in each subgroup owing to the electrostatic interactions between the aromatic dbps and the receptor cat mentioned above brominated dbps presented higher binding affinity than their chlorinated analogs which is also consistent with the observed cytotoxicity order in addition descriptors of e lumo and e homo show that the cytotoxicity is related with the reactivity of the compound which closely links to its frontier molecular orbitals e lumo is related to the relative electrophilicity and a lower value suggests that the corresponding molecule tends to accept electrons while e homo corresponds to more reactive reactions with electrophiles morell et al 2005 yang and zhang 2013 thus the toxicity of an electrophilic dbp to a nucleophile site or a nucleophilic dbp to an electrophile site may increase with decreasing e lumo and increasing e homo these results could also explain the highest cytotoxicity of hnps compared to hps hbads and hbacs due to their strong electron withdrawing effect by the existence of a nitro substituent on an aromatic ring which could lead to a number of potential electrophilic reactions 3 4 identification of the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps and comparative overall toxicity of shenzhen drinking water table s1 shows the characteristics of the collected tap water and finished water samples the chlorine residual concentrations in tap water collected from the location 1 and the location 2 were 1 16 and 0 81 mg l as cl2 respectively implying the decay of chlorine residual along pipelines the chlorine residual concentrations in the collected finished water with conventional treatment and o3 bac treatment were 0 59 and 0 76 mg l as cl2 respectively indicating a good performance in maintaining a relatively higher level of chlorine residual by using o3 bac treatment the concentrations of the 15 halogenated aromatic dbps in chlorinated drinking water samples are shown in fig 5 a and b except for 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenaldehyde all of the aromatic dbps were detected with concentrations of 1 0 9 8 ng l in tap water samples and their concentrations in the sample collected at the location adjacent to the dwtp location 1 1 0 7 7 ng l were generally lower than that collected at the location relatively far from the plant location 2 1 2 9 8 ng l among the detected dbps 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid respectively showed the lowest and highest concentrations in both of the two tap water samples it should be noted that three hnps i e 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 bromo 4 chloro 6 nitrophenol were detected in real chlorinated drinking water for the first time with concentrations of 4 9 8 3 ng l for the finished drinking water nine of the 15 dbps could be detected at concentrations of 2 4 21 7 ng l in the water sample using the conventional treatment while only four can be detected with concentrations of 2 7 31 6 ng l in the drinking water treated with o3 bac treatment fig 5b indicating the superiority of o3 bac treatment in removing the precursors of aromatic dbps compared to the conventional treatment it can also be observed that doc value of finished water treated with o3 bac 1 54 mg l was slightly higher than that of conventional treatment 1 22 mg l according to the treatment process of the water treatment plant fig s1 the reason for this phenomenon could be the microbial leakage from bac filtration without the post filtration process which as a result increased doc level chu et al 2015 interestingly compared with the water sample with conventional treatment no significant reduction of the formation of the four hps in the sample with o3 bac treatment can be observed the concentration of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol even increased by one third this may be partially due to the leakage of biofilm through bac filtration besides huang et al 2018 reported the effect of ozone granular activated carbon o3 gac treatment on the formation of halogenated aromatic dpbs in simulated drinking water compared with the non treated drinking water sample the formation of the halogenated aromatic dbps in the sample with o3 gac treatment was decreased by 97 3 and the specific reduction rates of hbads hbacs halosalicylic acids and hps were 99 9 99 9 96 2 and 94 7 respectively hps exhibited the lowest reduction rate among the four tested subgroups in the previous study therefore hps in the sample with o3 bac treatment showed a comparable or even higher level than those compounds in the sample with conventional treatment should be reasonable in addition pan et al 2017 investigated the occurrence of 13 aromatic dbps in eight major cities in east china 12 dbps were the same as the target dbps in the present study and 12 of them could be detected with concentrations ranging from 1 1 for 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde to 215 0 ng l 2 4 6 trichlorophenol moreover zhang et al 2019c reported the occurrence of an emerging class of aromatic nitrogeneous dbps chlorophenylacetonitriles eight of which were detected at concentrations of 0 8 155 ng l in chlorinated drinking water samples compared with the two previously reported studies the formation of the 15 aromatic dbps in shenzhen drinking water showed a low to medium level interestingly bei et al 2016 investigated the occurrence of another important class of dbps nitrosamines in drinking water from different geographical regions in china and demonstrated that drinking water in east china show a wider concentration range than that in south china both of which are two developed areas in china for example the highest concentrations of ndma in finished drinking water and tap water in east china yangtze river delta region achieved to 163 and 189 ng l respectively which are significantly higher than their counterparts 38 and 98 ng l respectively in south china pearl river delta region based on these studies the relatively lower concentrations of halogenated aromatic dbps observed in shenzhen belongs to pearl river delta region drinking water than those in east china yangtze river delta region were probably due to heavier contamination of aromatic dbp precursors in source water in east china than that in the city shenzhen located in south china the next step after gaining the concentrations of each dbp and their lc50 values is to identify the forcing agents among the 15 halogenated aromatic dbps in disinfected drinking water the total calculated drinking water toxicity which is based on measured concentrations and cytotoxicity as the total concentration toxicity index value is calculated fig 6 a according to the tic tox method suggested by plewa et al 2017 details are shown in si in addition the concentration percentage contributions of the four subgroups of dbps as well as concentration toxicity percentages contributions were calculated for comparison fig 7 since only hps were detected in the finished water sample using o3 bac treatment comparison for this sample was omitted here for the two tap water samples hbacs accounted for the highest proportion of the total concentration 37 3 for location 1 and 39 1 for location 2 while contributed the lowest proportion of the total calculated toxicity 9 7 for location 1 and 9 9 for location 2 in contrast although hnps only respectively constituted 32 0 and 30 6 of the measured total concentration in tap water from location 1 and location 2 their calculated concentration toxicity percentages achieved to 65 3 and 64 6 respectively clearly showing them existed as toxicity drivers in the tap water samples for the finished water sample using the conventional treatment the same trend could be observed as the concentration percentage of hps 64 5 decreased to the concentration toxicity percentage of 44 3 while the concentration percentage of hnps 25 7 increased to concentration toxicity percentage of 48 5 in general the toxicity contributions among the four subgroups of aromatic dbps followed the rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs among the 15 aromatic dbps 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol was the toxicity driver in tap water from location 1 and location 2 and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol were the toxicity drivers in finished water using the conventional treatment and the o3 bac treatment respectively figs s15 and s16 in addition we also compared the overall cytotoxicity of chlorinated drinking water and the total calculated toxicity of aromatic dbps in drinking water the overall cytotoxicity of the two tap water samples and the two finished water samples are shown in fig 5c and d the lc50 values for tap water samples collected at location 1 and location 2 were 209 and 110 as concentration factor while for finished water samples using conventional treatment and o3 bac treatment were 232 and 336 as concentration factor respectively to directly compare the cytotoxicity for each drinking water sample a cytotoxicity index value was calculated by multiplying the reciprocal of lc50 value by 1000 and a higher value represented a greater cytotoxic potency plewa et al 2011 the overall cytotoxicity index values for the four drinking water samples are shown in fig 6b following a decreasing order as tap water location 2 tap water location 1 finished water conventional treatment finished water o3 bac treatment which is consistent with the order of the total concentration toxicity index values of the four drinking water samples in general the coincidence of the order based on the two types of index values indicated that tic tox method could also be used as an effective tool to estimate the comparative overall toxicity for disinfected water samples 4 conclusions the comparative cytotoxicity of 15 halogenated dbps was evaluated by using the mammalian cho k1 cells in general the selected aromatic dbps exhibited an in vitro toxicity rank order of hnps hps hbads hbacs based on the observed cytotoxicity data and screening the candidate descriptors including binding energies between the aromatic dbps and key antioxidant enzymes as well as physical chemical quantum chemical topological descriptors a qsar model was developed and indicated the importance of the interactions of aromatic dbps towards cat and the electrophilic nucleophilic reactivity of aromatic dbps in the toxicity mechanisms in addition the occurrence of the aromatic dbps in shenzhen tap water and finished water was studied the results showed that halogenated aromatic dbps commonly existed in drinking water in the mega city at ng l levels and three nitrogenous aromatic dbps were detected in real drinking water for the first time in general o3 bac treatment was superior to the conventional treatment in controlling the formation of halogenated aromatic dbps except hps by using the tic tox method the major toxicity drivers among the target aromatic dbps can be identified notably dbps with the highest concentrations may not contribute the highest proportions of overall toxicity i e although hbacs were found to be prevailing species than the other three subgroups of aromatic dbps in the tap water samples they showed the least toxicity contribution percentages and the toxicity forcing agents were calculated to be hnps with the advancement of modern analytical techniques and the on going research on dbp identification and formation more new aromatic dbps are likely to be detected and identified in disinfected water thus the developed qsar model in this study can provide a useful tool to predict the cytotoxicity of new identified aromatic dbps and pinpointing toxicity forcing agents in disinfected water in future studies in addition plewa et al 2017 recently reported that nitrogenous aliphatic dbps mainly including haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides tended to be major toxicity drivers in drinking water samples from three cities in general dbp composition in real drinking water samples is complex and variable therefore to better understand the role of aromatic dbps in overall toxicity and better control the overall toxicity of drinking water further systematic and comprehensive dbp studies involving the simultaneous occurrence of aromatic dbps and other different types of major dbps e g thms haas haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides and forcing agent identification are warranted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18246,due to their persistence polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs represent a group of important environmental pollutants but conventional physicochemical decontamination techniques for their removal are usually expensive the main aim of this work was to develop a cost effective method for pcb bioremediation focusing on contaminated water and utilizing the well known degradation capability of pleurotus ostreatus the oyster mushroom for this purpose the conditions of several laboratory scale reactors working volume 1 l were optimized spent oyster mushroom substrate obtained from a commercial farm was used as a fungal inoculum and growth substrate the highest degradation efficiency 87 was recorded with a continuous low flow setup which was subsequently scaled up working volume 500 l and used for the treatment of 4000 l of real contaminated groundwater containing 0 1 1 μg l of pcbs this trickle bed pilot scale bioreactor was able to remove 82 80 65 and 30 50 of di tri tetra and pentachlorinated pcb congeners respectively no degradation was observed for hexa or heptachlorinated congeners multiple mono and dichlorobenzoic acids cbas were identified as transformation products by mass spectrometry confirming the role of biodegradation in pcb removal a vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test revealed slight ecotoxicity of the primary reactor effluent sampling after 24 h which was quickly suppressed once the effluent passed through the reactor for the second time moreover no other effluent exhibited toxicity for the rest of the experiment 71 days in total microbial analyses phospholipid fatty acid analysis and next generation sequencing showed that p ostreatus was able to degrade pcbs in the presence of an abundance of other fungal species as well as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria overall this study proved the suitability of the use of spent oyster mushroom substrate in a bioremediation practice even for pollutants as recalcitrant as pcbs graphical abstract image 1 keywords polychlorinated biphenyls bioremediation pleurotus ostreatus oyster mushroom groundwater bioreactor 1 introduction polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are a group of chlorinated aromatic compounds categorized within legacy persistent organic pollutants individual pcb congeners differ in the number and positions of chlorine substituents as well as in their specific physicochemical properties the stability and lipophilic nature of pcbs predetermine their tendency for bioaccumulation and biomagnification in food chains burreau et al 2006 in addition pcbs and their corresponding metabolites exhibit various toxic effects including mutagenicity carcinogenicity and hormonal disruption lauby secretan et al 2013 the total global production of pcb mixtures was estimated at 1 3 million tons breivik et al 2007 a considerable amount of which has been released into the environment despite the low water solubility of pcbs the hydrosphere represents an important reservoir as well as a means of long range transport and accumulation in sediments and biota the production of pcbs was banned in most countries by 1990 however they can still be detected e g in urban areas zgheib et al 2011 and they continue to pose an environmental threat to wildlife due to their recalcitrance jepson et al 2016 windsor et al 2019 moreover individual localities highly polluted by pcbs can still be found mainly at sites of former pcb manufacturing or use siracusa et al 2017 stella et al 2015 local contamination could negatively impact groundwater as an important drinking water resource overall the remediation of pcb contaminated water matrices is less common than the remediation of soils or sediments for groundwater the pump and treat approach is usually employed consisting of trapping the pcbs onto a sorbent that then has to be dealt with further either incinerated or deposited in a landfill apart from widely used physicochemical methods bioremediation is also viewed as an advantageous approach for pcb removal while bacterial aerobic and anaerobic pcb degradation is the most explored pieper and seeger 2008 it has not been adopted into bioremediation practice furthermore other less examined microorganisms such as fungi have shown promising results as well cajthaml 2015 the degradation potential of white rot also referred to as ligninolytic fungi has been demonstrated with a broad range of recalcitrant compounds including pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pesticides pharmaceuticals brominated and nitro compounds synthetic dyes and others cajthaml 2015 covino et al 2010 tortella et al 2015 regarding pcbs in particular the degradation ability of the white rot fungus pleurotus ostreatus commonly known as the oyster mushroom has already been well established in the literature čvančarová et al 2012 moeder et al 2005 stella et al 2017 several transformation products of pcb degradation by white rot fungi such as hydroxylated pcbs methoxylated pcbs and chlorobenzoic acids cbas were identified in several studies čvančarová et al 2012 kamei et al 2006 stella et al 2017 nevertheless the exact mechanism of biodegradation of pcbs and their metabolites by white rot fungi has not been fully elucidated cajthaml 2015 in particular the enzyme providing the initial attack on the pcb molecule has not been confirmed although most authors ascribe it to intracellular hydroxylation mediated by cytochrome p450 hydroxylated pcbs can then be transformed by laccase a phenol oxidase keum and li 2004 cbas undergo hydroxylation by cytochrome p450 as the initial step stella et al 2013 other cba metabolites detected in vivo include methyl esters of cbas chlorobenzaldehydes and chlorobenzyl alcohols muzikář et al 2011 in addition to the degradation ability fungi belonging to the pleurotus genus are one of the most cultivated edible mushrooms in the world along with agaricus bisporus and lentinula edodes after harvesting mushroom farms generate a large amount of spent mushroom substrate sms a waste material which still contains viable mycelium and can serve as inoculum for biodegradation applications sms from the production of p ostreatus has been successfully employed for laboratory or pilot scale remediation of soils contaminated by pcbs ddt and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons di gregorio et al 2016 gąsecka et al 2015 purnomo et al 2010 siracusa et al 2017 the potential of sms application in treating contaminated water was also studied by křesinová et al 2018 where edcs were removed from wastewater under nonsterile conditions the main objective of this study was to develop a method for the bioremediation of pcb contaminated water based on the utilization of spent oyster mushroom substrate bioreactors to test the feasibility of the fungus for possible practical application it was necessary to perform several biodegradation pretests under nonsterile conditions pcb biodegradation was initially tested with artificially contaminated tap water at the laboratory scale employing batch cultures or a continuous flow tube bioreactor afterwards the setup was scaled up and used for the treatment of real contaminated groundwater apart from pcb removal other parameters that helped to characterize the process were also monitored the formation of cbas as pcb metabolites ecotoxicity of the effluent vibrio fischeri bioluminescence test and ligninolytic enzyme activities attention was also paid to the changes in microbial populations via phospholipid fatty acid analysis

sequencing of fungal and bacterial amplicons was performed on an illumina miseq sequencer illumina usa the amplicon sequencing data were processed using the seed 2 1 3 pipeline větrovský et al 2018 2 3 10 statistics all statistical analyses were processed in the software r version 3 5 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 solid phase extraction optimization to determine the pcb content in real contaminated water we tested the protocol according to us epa method 525 2 however due to unsatisfactory results the conditions were changed and a new spe method was developed see 2 3 1 the recovery was substantially improved by mixing the sample with more methanol 40 ml of methanol to 500 ml of the sample prior to extraction the use of envi 18 dsk spe disks resulted in the highest recoveries and was therefore chosen for influent sample extraction the recoveries for individual pcb congeners ranged between 70 and 110 and are provided in suppl fig 1 however spe was found to be inapplicable for the analysis of reactor effluents due to clogging of the sorbent by nonspecific compounds leached from the substrate lle by etoac 2 3 2 was used for effluent samples instead 3 2 batch degradation experiment to determine the ability of p ostreatus to degrade pcbs in nonsterile water when grown on commercial wheat straw pellets a laboratory scale batch experiment was carried out in erlenmeyer flasks with artificially contaminated water degradation efficiency was determined in relation to corresponding heat killed controls from the initial amount of pcbs 49 μg of delor 103 per flask p ostreatus was able to remove approximately 40 after 28 days see table 2 the highest degradation was detected for pcb congeners 4 19 25 80 and 6 27 24 45 46 and 56 60 50 data not shown a similar pattern was recorded by moeder et al 2005 with p ostreatus strain 3004 grown on straw for 44 days 3 3 laboratory scale bioreactor optimization based on the batch experiment a continuous flow cylindrical reactor was tested under various conditions the conditions of the individual reactors are shown in table 1 and results are shown in table 3 the use of a higher flow was found to be disadvantageous reactors r1 and r2 we hypothesize that the high flow does not favor rapid mycelial development because from the control sample analyses straw substrate with heat killed fungus we found that more than 90 of pcbs were always adsorbed on the solid material therefore retention in the reactor did not play any substantial role however when using low flow the reactor was efficient even when treating highly contaminated water r4 50 μg l of delor 103 5 l in total this setup r4 was then used for the treatment of real contaminated water r5 9 7 μg l 10 l in total where 63 degradation was achieved the lower efficiency could have been caused by a different congener composition of the real water delor 103 which was used for preliminary biodegradation experiments is a commercial mixture predominantly consisting of trichlorinated pcbs kubátová et al 1996 in the real contaminated water the percentage of congeners with 4 and more chlorine atoms pcb 40 180 was higher suppl fig 2 and as a general rule the higher the chlorination of the pcb the more recalcitrant it is the unique capability of p ostreatus to degrade pcbs has been proven both under model liquid culture laboratory conditions čvančarová et al 2012 and in real contaminated soils after combination with a fungal colonized lignocellulose substrate siracusa et al 2017 stella et al 2017 the addition of lignocellulose substrate is necessary to provide the fungus with conditions closer to its natural habitat wood the advantage of the utilization of sms also referred to as spent mushroom compost for bioremediation purposes lies in its extensive availability because sms has already produced the vast majority of fruit bodies commercial mushroom farms dispose of this organic waste usually by composting the use of sms has been studied in a few instances for the remediation of soil and wastewater contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons edcs ddt and even pcbs di gregorio et al 2016 gąsecka et al 2015 křesinová et al 2018 purnomo et al 2010 siracusa et al 2017 extracellular enzyme containing extracts of sms from various fungi were also tested in the biodegradation of phenolic compounds acetaminophen sulfonamides or tetrabromobisphenol a chang et al 2018 trejo hernandez et al 2001 yang et al 2017 3 4 pcb degradation in the pilot scale reactor the concentration of pcbs as a sum of selected congeners in the real contaminated water varied between 0 1 and 1 μg l the typical congener composition is provided in suppl fig 2 the results of biodegradation are shown in fig 2 biodegradation efficiency generally decreased with increasing chlorination level monochlorinated pcbs present at a very low concentration were removed completely the efficiencies for di tri tetra and pentachlorinated congeners were approximately 82 80 65 and 30 50 respectively pcbs with six and seven chlorine atoms were not degraded the mean removal of pcbs from the contaminated water influent effluent ratio throughout the course of the experiment was 89 9 as a sum of all detected congeners groundwater is an important source of drinking water worldwide in the czech republic approximately 50 of all drinking water comes from aquifers the us epa has set a maximum contaminant level for the concentration of pcbs in drinking water at 0 5 μg l as a part of the national primary drinking water regulations 40 cfr 141 61 maximum contaminant levels for organic contaminants us epa 1991 the influent water treated within this study exceeded the limit however the reactor effluent was consistently below this value 3 5 transformation products several cbas were detected in both the effluent and the substrate of the laboratory scale and the pilot scale bioreactors suppl table 1 the highest concentration was always that of 2 4 and 2 5 dicba which share the same retention time under the gc method used 2 3 5 the contents of 2 4 and 2 5 dicba did not correlate with degradation efficiency other detected cbas were 2 cba 3 cba 4 cba and 3 4 dicba but their respective concentrations in the effluent did not exceed 4 μg l cbas were also one of the metabolites detected in the degradation of pcbs in soil by p ostreatus stella et al 2017 the formation of cbas during pcb degradation is of concern because of their toxicity lee and chen 2009 svobodová et al 2009 these compounds are typically generated during aerobic pcb degradation via co metabolism by bacterial enzymes encoded in the bph gene cluster pieper and seeger 2008 the accumulation of cbas during bacterial pcb degradation can impede further biotransformation adebusoye et al 2008 in contrast the biodegradation of pcbs by ligninolytic fungi was thought to avoid the accumulation of cbas as dead end metabolites čvančarová et al 2012 several ligninolytic fungi including p ostreatus were shown to be able to degrade cbas in liquid media while simultaneously suppressing acute toxicity nevertheless 2 5 dicba was found to be one of the more recalcitrant cbas muzikář et al 2011 the high residual concentrations of 2 4 and 2 5 dicba in this work could also be explained by their higher solubility in water compared to pcbs unlike pcbs cbas will most likely stay in the liquid phase rather than be retained by the lignocellulose substrate extracellular enzymes laccase and manganese dependent peroxidase present in the water phase are however incapable of initial cba transformation since the first degradation step is provided by cytochrome p450 and the presence of the whole living mycelium is therefore needed stella et al 2013 no other known pcb metabolites such as hydroxylated pcbs methoxylated pcbs chlorobenzaldehydes or chlorobenzyl alcohols čvančarová et al 2012 stella et al 2017 were detected by targeted and non targeted screening of the extracts 3 6 acute toxicity acute toxicity was measured in the influents and effluents of the tested laboratory scale reactors and in the pilot scale bioreactor by assessing bioluminescence inhibition of bacterium v fischeri no toxicity was detected in either of the artificially contaminated tap water or real water influents which was not surprising given the relatively low acute toxicity of pcbs which is connected to their low water solubility nakari and huhtala 2008 in addition none of the effluents of the laboratory scale reactors were found to exhibit toxicity in the pilot scale bioreactor a 15 luminescence inhibition was detected in one sampling of the effluent first sampling after 24 h however no other sample was found to be acutely toxic for the rest of the experiment including the same water toxic at first recirculated through the reactor for the second time additional toxicity tests with only water extracts of the straw substrate no pcbs that exhibited toxicity as well as tests with pure cba standards that did not show any toxicity suggested there may be other causes of the slight luminescence inhibition other than the formation of toxic metabolites e g the nonspecific compounds originating from the straw substrate čvančarová et al 2012 used the same test to evaluate in vivo pcb degradation by p ostreatus grown in liquid media and found that the fungus was able to decrease the acute toxicity under model liquid culture conditions 3 7 ligninolytic enzyme determination during all degradation experiments the enzyme activities of phenol oxidase laccase and manganese dependent mnp and manganese independent mip peroxidases were measured within the laboratory scale bioreactors 3 4 mnp activity was detected only sporadically and did not exceed 0 3 u l in the effluent of the pilot bioreactor 3 5 the highest mnp activity was 2 5 u l no mnp activity was detected from day 10 onwards no mip activity was detected in any of the experiments laccase is the dominant enzyme produced by p ostreatus more et al 2011 during the batch degradation experiment 3 3 laccase activity fluctuated between 500 and 2500 u l and did not differ significantly between the samples containing pcbs and the pcb free biotic controls within the continuous flow laboratory scale bioreactors the highest laccase activity at a unit of u l level was detected at the beginning and then dropped as the enzymes became washed out by the flow of water no relationship was found between the initial enzyme activity and degradation efficiency in the pilot scale experiment laccase activity was 110 u l at the beginning and 27 u l after 8 days after day 22 the activity was consistently below 0 5 u l křesinová et al 2018 detected similar laccase levels in a bioreactor with p ostreatus hk35 and wastewater fortified with edcs čvančarová et al 2012 found no correlation between ligninolytic enzyme activities of various fungi and their degradation efficiency however p ostreatus 3004 laccase activity was suppressed by pcb addition 10 μg l when it was grown in malt extract glucose meg medium this was not the case in the batch experiment in this work in contrast laccase activity of trametes versicolor was found to increase both in meg and in nitrogen limited media with added pcbs plačková et al 2012 3 8 microbial analyses the analysis of characteristic plfa present in cell membranes was chosen to monitor microbial biomass in the substrate of the laboratory scale reactors fungal biomass was highest for r3 and r4 suppl fig 3 the highest bacterial biomass was detected in r1 most likely due to aeration and r5 which treated real contaminated water nevertheless the plfa results did not show any other interpretable results even if the present microbial groups data not shown were divided using more specific fatty acid markers lhotský et al 2017 therefore for a more detailed insight into the microbial background during the process both plfa analysis and fungal and bacterial dna sequencing were chosen to characterize changes in biota over the course of the pilot bioreactor experiment both methods confirmed the presence of living fungal biomass throughout the experiment fig 3a c overall fungi preferred the top and middle parts of the reactor substrate fig 3a anova p 0 05 interestingly pleurotus was not the single dominant fungal genus in the substrate at the beginning day 0 fig 3c other fungi including mycosphaerella alternaria and monographella were also present mycosphaerella is a plant parasite and might have originated from the wheat straw nevertheless by week 2 pleurotus prevailed in the top and middle parts along with pleurotus the genus trichoderma well known for causing losses in oyster mushroom production komoń zelazowska et al 2007 also appeared despite its presence the oyster mushroom produced multiple fruit bodies on the top surface of the reactor during the experiment peziza a saprotrophic genus often found on rotting organic materials is noticeable after 35 days it is noteworthy that the results are not in agreement with our previous finding in a contaminated soil where p ostreatus 3004 ccbas 278 exhibited a certain tolerance to bacteria however it did not tolerate other fungal genera as shown in fig 3b bacterial biomass grew rapidly during the first month regardless of the layer anova p 0 05 the predominant genus in the substrate at the beginning was the thermophilic bacterium geobacillus fig 3d which was later suppressed by other genera aerobic bacteria acinetobacter flavobacterium pseudomonas and pedobacter dominated after 14 days pseudomonas is a bacterium capable of aerobic pcb biodegradation field and sierra alvarez 2008 and was also found to be present in the real contaminated water in spite of aeration some anaerobic bacteria e g clostridium and bacteroides could also be found especially at the bottom of the reactor indicating local anaerobic conditions these genera were also found in the influent genera that were the most abundant in the contaminated water 5 in at least one parallel were flavobacterium arcicella acidovorax bdellovibrio cytophaga polynucleobacter sulfuricurvum and gallionella 4 conclusions given its nature world wide production and cost effectiveness spent oyster mushroom substrate is an ideal candidate for use in bioremediation the results of the present work document that this material can be used as a substrate in a trickle bed bioreactor for the treatment of groundwater contaminated by pcbs pcb degradation has been shown to be dependent on the chlorination level of the congeners as the amount of di and trichlorinated pcbs decreased by 80 and tetrachlorinated by 65 whereas only approximately 30 50 of pentachlorinated pcbs were removed and no degradation was recorded for pcbs with six or more chlorine substituents several cbas were identified by gc ms analysis as degradation products with 2 4 and 2 5 dicba reaching the highest concentrations microbial analyses plfa analysis next generation sequencing have shown fungal preference for the upper layers of the substrate as well as the ability of p ostreatus to coexist with a number of other species of fungi and bacteria although less likely the possible involvement of these microorganisms in the degradation process cannot be ruled out the degradation experiment was further evaluated by a standard ecotoxicology test with bacterium v fischeri which revealed slight acute toxicity in the first sampling of the reactor effluent this effect could not be attributed solely to the formation of the detected degradation products therefore further research regarding ecotoxicity evaluation on trophic levels other than bacteria is needed

18246,due to their persistence polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs represent a group of important environmental pollutants but conventional physicochemical decontamination techniques for their removal are usually expensive the main aim of this work was to develop a cost effective method for pcb bioremediation focusing on contaminated water and utilizing the well known degradation capability of pleurotus ostreatus the oyster mushroom for this purpose the conditions of several laboratory scale reactors working volume 1 l were optimized spent oyster mushroom substrate obtained from a commercial farm was used as a fungal inoculum and growth substrate the highest degradation efficiency 87 was recorded with a continuous low flow setup which was subsequently scaled up working volume 500 l and used for the treatment of 4000 l of real contaminated groundwater containing 0 1 1 μg l of pcbs this trickle bed pilot scale bioreactor was able to remove 82 80 65 and 30 50 of di tri tetra and pentachlorinated pcb congeners respectively no degradation was observed for hexa or heptachlorinated congeners multiple mono and dichlorobenzoic acids cbas were identified as transformation products by mass spectrometry confirming the role of biodegradation in pcb removal a vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test revealed slight ecotoxicity of the primary reactor effluent sampling after 24 h which was quickly suppressed once the effluent passed through the reactor for the second time moreover no other effluent exhibited toxicity for the rest of the experiment 71 days in total microbial analyses phospholipid fatty acid analysis and next generation sequencing showed that p ostreatus was able to degrade pcbs in the presence of an abundance of other fungal species as well as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria overall this study proved the suitability of the use of spent oyster mushroom substrate in a bioremediation practice even for pollutants as recalcitrant as pcbs graphical abstract image 1 keywords polychlorinated biphenyls bioremediation pleurotus ostreatus oyster mushroom groundwater bioreactor 1 introduction polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are a group of chlorinated aromatic compounds categorized within legacy persistent organic pollutants individual pcb congeners differ in the number and positions of chlorine substituents as well as in their specific physicochemical properties the stability and lipophilic nature of pcbs predetermine their tendency for bioaccumulation and biomagnification in food chains burreau et al 2006 in addition pcbs and their corresponding metabolites exhibit various toxic effects including mutagenicity carcinogenicity and hormonal disruption lauby secretan et al 2013 the total global production of pcb mixtures was estimated at 1 3 million tons breivik et al 2007 a considerable amount of which has been released into the environment despite the low water solubility of pcbs the hydrosphere represents an important reservoir as well as a means of long range transport and accumulation in sediments and biota the production of pcbs was banned in most countries by 1990 however they can still be detected e g in urban areas zgheib et al 2011 and they continue to pose an environmental threat to wildlife due to their recalcitrance jepson et al 2016 windsor et al 2019 moreover individual localities highly polluted by pcbs can still be found mainly at sites of former pcb manufacturing or use siracusa et al 2017 stella et al 2015 local contamination could negatively impact groundwater as an important drinking water resource overall the remediation of pcb contaminated water matrices is less common than the remediation of soils or sediments for groundwater the pump and treat approach is usually employed consisting of trapping the pcbs onto a sorbent that then has to be dealt with further either incinerated or deposited in a landfill apart from widely used physicochemical methods bioremediation is also viewed as an advantageous approach for pcb removal while bacterial aerobic and anaerobic pcb degradation is the most explored pieper and seeger 2008 it has not been adopted into bioremediation practice furthermore other less examined microorganisms such as fungi have shown promising results as well cajthaml 2015 the degradation potential of white rot also referred to as ligninolytic fungi has been demonstrated with a broad range of recalcitrant compounds including pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pesticides pharmaceuticals brominated and nitro compounds synthetic dyes and others cajthaml 2015 covino et al 2010 tortella et al 2015 regarding pcbs in particular the degradation ability of the white rot fungus pleurotus ostreatus commonly known as the oyster mushroom has already been well established in the literature čvančarová et al 2012 moeder et al 2005 stella et al 2017 several transformation products of pcb degradation by white rot fungi such as hydroxylated pcbs methoxylated pcbs and chlorobenzoic acids cbas were identified in several studies čvančarová et al 2012 kamei et al 2006 stella et al 2017 nevertheless the exact mechanism of biodegradation of pcbs and their metabolites by white rot fungi has not been fully elucidated cajthaml 2015 in particular the enzyme providing the initial attack on the pcb molecule has not been confirmed although most authors ascribe it to intracellular hydroxylation mediated by cytochrome p450 hydroxylated pcbs can then be transformed by laccase a phenol oxidase keum and li 2004 cbas undergo hydroxylation by cytochrome p450 as the initial step stella et al 2013 other cba metabolites detected in vivo include methyl esters of cbas chlorobenzaldehydes and chlorobenzyl alcohols muzikář et al 2011 in addition to the degradation ability fungi belonging to the pleurotus genus are one of the most cultivated edible mushrooms in the world along with agaricus bisporus and lentinula edodes after harvesting mushroom farms generate a large amount of spent mushroom substrate sms a waste material which still contains viable mycelium and can serve as inoculum for biodegradation applications sms from the production of p ostreatus has been successfully employed for laboratory or pilot scale remediation of soils contaminated by pcbs ddt and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons di gregorio et al 2016 gąsecka et al 2015 purnomo et al 2010 siracusa et al 2017 the potential of sms application in treating contaminated water was also studied by křesinová et al 2018 where edcs were removed from wastewater under nonsterile conditions the main objective of this study was to develop a method for the bioremediation of pcb contaminated water based on the utilization of spent oyster mushroom substrate bioreactors to test the feasibility of the fungus for possible practical application it was necessary to perform several biodegradation pretests under nonsterile conditions pcb biodegradation was initially tested with artificially contaminated tap water at the laboratory scale employing batch cultures or a continuous flow tube bioreactor afterwards the setup was scaled up and used for the treatment of real contaminated groundwater apart from pcb removal other parameters that helped to characterize the process were also monitored the formation of cbas as pcb metabolites ecotoxicity of the effluent vibrio fischeri bioluminescence test and ligninolytic enzyme activities attention was also paid to the changes in microbial populations via phospholipid fatty acid analysis plfa and next generation sequencing which enabled to assess the viability of the fungus 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals sms of p ostreatus strain kryos was obtained from a

sequencing of fungal and bacterial amplicons was performed on an illumina miseq sequencer illumina usa the amplicon sequencing data were processed using the seed 2 1 3 pipeline větrovský et al 2018 2 3 10 statistics all statistical analyses were processed in the software r version 3 5 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 solid phase extraction optimization to determine the pcb content in real contaminated water we tested the protocol according to us epa method 525 2 however due to unsatisfactory results the conditions were changed and a new spe method was developed see 2 3 1 the recovery was substantially improved by mixing the sample with more methanol 40 ml of methanol to 500 ml of the sample prior to extraction the use of envi 18 dsk spe disks resulted in the highest recoveries and was therefore chosen for influent sample extraction the recoveries for individual pcb congeners ranged between 70 and 110 and are provided in suppl fig 1 however spe was found to be inapplicable for the analysis of reactor effluents due to clogging of the sorbent by nonspecific compounds leached from the substrate lle by etoac 2 3 2 was used for effluent samples instead 3 2 batch degradation experiment to determine the ability of p ostreatus to degrade pcbs in nonsterile water when grown on commercial wheat straw pellets a laboratory scale batch experiment was carried out in erlenmeyer flasks with artificially contaminated water degradation efficiency was determined in relation to corresponding heat killed controls from the initial amount of pcbs 49 μg of delor 103 per flask p ostreatus was able to remove approximately 40 after 28 days see table 2 the highest degradation was detected for pcb congeners 4 19 25 80 and 6 27 24 45 46 and 56 60 50 data not shown a similar pattern was recorded by moeder et al 2005 with p ostreatus strain 3004 grown on straw for 44 days 3 3 laboratory scale bioreactor optimization based on the batch experiment a continuous flow cylindrical reactor was tested under various conditions the conditions of the individual reactors are shown in table 1 and results are shown in table 3 the use of a higher flow was found to be disadvantageous reactors r1 and r2 we hypothesize that the high flow does not favor rapid mycelial development because from the control sample analyses straw substrate with heat killed fungus we found that more than 90 of pcbs were always adsorbed on the solid material therefore retention in the reactor did not play any substantial role however when using low flow the reactor was efficient even when treating highly contaminated water r4 50 μg l of delor 103 5 l in total this setup r4 was then used for the treatment of real contaminated water r5 9 7 μg l 10 l in total where 63 degradation was achieved the lower efficiency could have been caused by a different congener composition of the real water delor 103 which was used for preliminary biodegradation experiments is a commercial mixture predominantly consisting of trichlorinated pcbs kubátová et al 1996 in the real contaminated water the percentage of congeners with 4 and more chlorine atoms pcb 40 180 was higher suppl fig 2 and as a general rule the higher the chlorination of the pcb the more recalcitrant it is the unique capability of p ostreatus to degrade pcbs has been proven both under model liquid culture laboratory conditions čvančarová et al 2012 and in real contaminated soils after combination with a fungal colonized lignocellulose substrate siracusa et al 2017 stella et al 2017 the addition of lignocellulose substrate is necessary to provide the fungus with conditions closer to its natural habitat wood the advantage of the utilization of sms also referred to as spent mushroom compost for bioremediation purposes lies in its extensive availability because sms has already produced the vast majority of fruit bodies commercial mushroom farms dispose of this organic waste usually by composting the use of sms has been studied in a few instances for the remediation of soil and wastewater contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons edcs ddt and even pcbs di gregorio et al 2016 gąsecka et al 2015 křesinová et al 2018 purnomo et al 2010 siracusa et al 2017 extracellular enzyme containing extracts of sms from various fungi were also tested in the biodegradation of phenolic compounds acetaminophen sulfonamides or tetrabromobisphenol a chang et al 2018 trejo hernandez et al 2001 yang et al 2017 3 4 pcb degradation in the pilot scale reactor the concentration of pcbs as a sum of selected congeners in the real contaminated water varied between 0 1 and 1 μg l the typical congener composition is provided in suppl fig 2 the results of biodegradation are shown in fig 2 biodegradation efficiency generally decreased with increasing chlorination level monochlorinated pcbs present at a very low concentration were removed completely the efficiencies for di tri tetra and pentachlorinated congeners were approximately 82 80 65 and 30 50 respectively pcbs with six and seven chlorine atoms were not degraded the mean removal of pcbs from the contaminated water influent effluent ratio throughout the course of the experiment was 89 9 as a sum of all detected congeners groundwater is an important source of drinking water worldwide in the czech republic approximately 50 of all drinking water comes from aquifers the us epa has set a maximum contaminant level for the concentration of pcbs in drinking water at 0 5 μg l as a part of the national primary drinking water regulations 40 cfr 141 61 maximum contaminant levels for organic contaminants us epa 1991 the influent water treated within this study exceeded the limit however the reactor effluent was consistently below this value 3 5 transformation products several cbas were detected in both the effluent and the substrate of the laboratory scale and the pilot scale bioreactors suppl table 1 the highest concentration was always that of 2 4 and 2 5 dicba which share the same retention time under the gc method used 2 3 5 the contents of 2 4 and 2 5 dicba did not correlate with degradation efficiency other detected cbas were 2 cba 3 cba 4 cba and 3 4 dicba but their respective concentrations in the effluent did not exceed 4 μg l cbas were also one of the metabolites detected in the degradation of pcbs in soil by p ostreatus stella et al 2017 the formation of cbas during pcb degradation is of concern because of their toxicity lee and chen 2009 svobodová et al 2009 these compounds are typically generated during aerobic pcb degradation via co metabolism by bacterial enzymes encoded in the bph gene cluster pieper and seeger 2008 the accumulation of cbas during bacterial pcb degradation can impede further biotransformation adebusoye et al 2008 in contrast the biodegradation of pcbs by ligninolytic fungi was thought to avoid the accumulation of cbas as dead end metabolites čvančarová et al 2012 several ligninolytic fungi including p ostreatus were shown to be able to degrade cbas in liquid media while simultaneously suppressing acute toxicity nevertheless 2 5 dicba was found to be one of the more recalcitrant cbas muzikář et al 2011 the high residual concentrations of 2 4 and 2 5 dicba in this work could also be explained by their higher solubility in water compared to pcbs unlike pcbs cbas will most likely stay in the liquid phase rather than be retained by the lignocellulose substrate extracellular enzymes laccase and manganese dependent peroxidase present in the water phase are however incapable of initial cba transformation since the first degradation step is provided by cytochrome p450 and the presence of the whole living mycelium is therefore needed stella et al 2013 no other known pcb metabolites such as hydroxylated pcbs methoxylated pcbs chlorobenzaldehydes or chlorobenzyl alcohols čvančarová et al 2012 stella et al 2017 were detected by targeted and non targeted screening of the extracts 3 6 acute toxicity acute toxicity was measured in the influents and effluents of the tested laboratory scale reactors and in the pilot scale bioreactor by assessing bioluminescence inhibition of bacterium v fischeri no toxicity was detected in either of the artificially contaminated tap water or real water influents which was not surprising given the relatively low acute toxicity of pcbs which is connected to their low water solubility nakari and huhtala 2008 in addition none of the effluents of the laboratory scale reactors were found to exhibit toxicity in the pilot scale bioreactor a 15 luminescence inhibition was detected in one sampling of the effluent first sampling after 24 h however no other sample was found to be acutely toxic for the rest of the experiment including the same water toxic at first recirculated through the reactor for the second time additional toxicity tests with only water extracts of the straw substrate no pcbs that exhibited toxicity as well as tests with pure cba standards that did not show any toxicity suggested there may be other causes of the slight luminescence inhibition other than the formation of toxic metabolites e g the nonspecific compounds originating from the straw substrate čvančarová et al 2012 used the same test to evaluate in vivo pcb degradation by p ostreatus grown in liquid media and found that the fungus was able to decrease the acute toxicity under model liquid culture conditions 3 7 ligninolytic enzyme determination during all degradation experiments the enzyme activities of phenol oxidase laccase and manganese dependent mnp and manganese independent mip peroxidases were measured within the laboratory scale bioreactors 3 4 mnp activity was detected only sporadically and did not exceed 0 3 u l in the effluent of the pilot bioreactor 3 5 the highest mnp activity was 2 5 u l no mnp activity was detected from day 10 onwards no mip activity was detected in any of the experiments laccase is the dominant enzyme produced by p ostreatus more et al 2011 during the batch degradation experiment 3 3 laccase activity fluctuated between 500 and 2500 u l and did not differ significantly between the samples containing pcbs and the pcb free biotic controls within the continuous flow laboratory scale bioreactors the highest laccase activity at a unit of u l level was detected at the beginning and then dropped as the enzymes became washed out by the flow of water no relationship was found between the initial enzyme activity and degradation efficiency in the pilot scale experiment laccase activity was 110 u l at the beginning and 27 u l after 8 days after day 22 the activity was consistently below 0 5 u l křesinová et al 2018 detected similar laccase levels in a bioreactor with p ostreatus hk35 and wastewater fortified with edcs čvančarová et al 2012 found no correlation between ligninolytic enzyme activities of various fungi and their degradation efficiency however p ostreatus 3004 laccase activity was suppressed by pcb addition 10 μg l when it was grown in malt extract glucose meg medium this was not the case in the batch experiment in this work in contrast laccase activity of trametes versicolor was found to increase both in meg and in nitrogen limited media with added pcbs plačková et al 2012 3 8 microbial analyses the analysis of characteristic plfa present in cell membranes was chosen to monitor microbial biomass in the substrate of the laboratory scale reactors fungal biomass was highest for r3 and r4 suppl fig 3 the highest bacterial biomass was detected in r1 most likely due to aeration and r5 which treated real contaminated water nevertheless the plfa results did not show any other interpretable results even if the present microbial groups data not shown were divided using more specific fatty acid markers lhotský et al 2017 therefore for a more detailed insight into the microbial background during the process both plfa analysis and fungal and bacterial dna sequencing were chosen to characterize changes in biota over the course of the pilot bioreactor experiment both methods confirmed the presence of living fungal biomass throughout the experiment fig 3a c overall fungi preferred the top and middle parts of the reactor substrate fig 3a anova p 0 05 interestingly pleurotus was not the single dominant fungal genus in the substrate at the beginning day 0 fig 3c other fungi including mycosphaerella alternaria and monographella were also present mycosphaerella is a plant parasite and might have originated from the wheat straw nevertheless by week 2 pleurotus prevailed in the top and middle parts along with pleurotus the genus trichoderma well known for causing losses in oyster mushroom production komoń zelazowska et al 2007 also appeared despite its presence the oyster mushroom produced multiple fruit bodies on the top surface of the reactor during the experiment peziza a saprotrophic genus often found on rotting organic materials is noticeable after 35 days it is noteworthy that the results are not in agreement with our previous finding in a contaminated soil where p ostreatus 3004 ccbas 278 exhibited a certain tolerance to bacteria however it did not tolerate other fungal genera as shown in fig 3b bacterial biomass grew rapidly during the first month regardless of the layer anova p 0 05 the predominant genus in the substrate at the beginning was the thermophilic bacterium geobacillus fig 3d which was later suppressed by other genera aerobic bacteria acinetobacter flavobacterium pseudomonas and pedobacter dominated after 14 days pseudomonas is a bacterium capable of aerobic pcb biodegradation field and sierra alvarez 2008 and was also found to be present in the real contaminated water in spite of aeration some anaerobic bacteria e g clostridium and bacteroides could also be found especially at the bottom of the reactor indicating local anaerobic conditions these genera were also found in the influent genera that were the most abundant in the contaminated water 5 in at least one parallel were flavobacterium arcicella acidovorax bdellovibrio cytophaga polynucleobacter sulfuricurvum and gallionella 4 conclusions given its nature world wide production and cost effectiveness spent oyster mushroom substrate is an ideal candidate for use in bioremediation the results of the present work document that this material can be used as a substrate in a trickle bed bioreactor for the treatment of groundwater contaminated by pcbs pcb degradation has been shown to be dependent on the chlorination level of the congeners as the amount of di and trichlorinated pcbs decreased by 80 and tetrachlorinated by 65 whereas only approximately 30 50 of pentachlorinated pcbs were removed and no degradation was recorded for pcbs with six or more chlorine substituents several cbas were identified by gc ms analysis as degradation products with 2 4 and 2 5 dicba reaching the highest concentrations microbial analyses plfa analysis next generation sequencing have shown fungal preference for the upper layers of the substrate as well as the ability of p ostreatus to coexist with a number of other species of fungi and bacteria although less likely the possible involvement of these microorganisms in the degradation process cannot be ruled out the degradation experiment was further evaluated by a standard ecotoxicology test with bacterium v fischeri which revealed slight acute toxicity in the first sampling of the reactor effluent this effect could not be attributed solely to the formation of the detected degradation products therefore further research regarding ecotoxicity evaluation on trophic levels other than bacteria is needed

18247,ibuprofen ibu a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid is widely used by humans for controlling fever and pain and is frequently detected in the influent of wastewater treatment plants and different aquatic environments in this study the biotransformation of ibu in activated sludge as anaerobic methanogenic sludge anms and sulfate reducing bacteria srb enriched sludge systems was investigated at three different concentrations of 100 500 and 1000 μg l via a series of batch and continuous studies ibu at concentration of 100 μg l was effectively biodegraded by as whereas anms and srb enriched sludge were less effective in ibu biodegradation at all concentrations tested however at higher ibu concentrations of 500 and 1000 μg l as showed poor ibu biodegradation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal due to inhibition of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria i e candidatus competibacter by ibu and or ibu biotransformation products the microbial analyses showed that ibu addition shifted the microbial community structure in as anms and srb enriched sludge systems however the removals of cod nitrogen and sulfur in both anaerobic sludge systems were not affected significantly p 0 05 the findings of this study provided a new insight into biotransformation of ibu in three important biological sludge systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment pharmaceutical wastewater ibuprofen removal biotransformation 1 introduction ibuprofen ibu a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid is largely used by humans for the treatment of pain inflammation and fever petrie et al 2015 and it is the safest and the most effective drug for children according to the world health organization who model list of essential medicines myers 2007 ibu ranks second in the drug production with a global production of 15000 metric tons year after aspirin who model list of essential medicines 2015 importantly up to 85 of the ingested ibu is excreted via urine and feces without being metabolized rainsford 2009 therefore ibu has been frequently detected in the influent of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and various water bodies at concentration ranging up to 990 0 μg l soulet et al 2002 lin et al 2008 santos et al 2009 sim et al 2010 studies have shown that ibu at ng l level in the environment could affect some aquatic species prud homme et al 2018 veldhoen et al 2014 and could even be deleterious for cell proliferation in human embryonic cells leverrier penna et al 2018 thus there has been a growing research interest on biotransformation of ibu during biological wastewater treatment processes luo et al 2014 li et al 2016 several studies examined the fate of ibu in wwtps especially in activated sludge as process kruglova et al 2014 suarez et al 2010 kimura et al 2007 although biodegradation was the primary removal route of ibu in as process alvarino et al 2014 2016 small amount of ibu was also removed via adsorption onto the biological sludge carballa et al 2008 anaerobic process is widely adopted for high strength wastewater treatment and sewage sludge digestion but the process was less effective in ibu removal alvarino et al 2014 gonzalez gil et al 2016 conversely samaras et al 2014 reported near complete removal of ibu at concentration of 2 83 μg g total solids ts during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge besides there are very limited comparative studies on ibu biotransformation mechanisms in as and anaerobic methanogenic sludge anms systems in recent years sulfur mediated biological process such as sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process integrating sulfur carbon and nitrogen removal has drawn significant attention lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in the process sulfate reducing bacteria srb can use sulfate as an electron acceptor for removal of organics under anaerobic condition recently srb enriched sludge system has been examined to treat sulfate laden pharmaceutical wastewater chelliapan and sallis 2015 and synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater containing sulfamethoxazole smx and ciprofloxacin cip respectively jia et al 2017 2018 thus these studies show the potential of srb enriched sludge system for the removal of ibu to the best of our knowledge there are no reported studies on ibu removal pathways and biotransformation mechanisms in srb enriched sludge system and the comparative studies examining the biotransformation of ibu in three biological sludge systems e g as anms and srb enriched sludge thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the biotransformation of ibu in as anms and srb enriched sludge systems through a long term operation of three parallel bench scale reactors followed by a series of batch experiments for three different sludge systems the potential ibu biotransformation mechanisms via microbial community analysis functional enzymes involved and biotransformation intermediates and pathways were also investigated using a series of batch experiments the findings of this study provided better insights into ibu biotransformation mechanisms in three sludge systems namely as anms and srb enriched sludge systems and thus opens up a new opportunity in employing an appropriate biological process for treating ibu containing wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors setup and operation three sludges namely as anms and srb enriched sludge were used in three different reactors setup i e sequencing batch reactor sbr up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor respectively see fig s1 in supplementary information si for reactors setup these reactors were operated in parallel for 110 days using as and 220 days using anms and srb enriched sludge in different stages to examine ibu removal details of inocula source and operating conditions for each reactor are presented in pages s5 s6 in si in order to minimize the variation in wastewater characteristics and to accurately identify the biotransformation mechanisms the reactors were fed with synthetic wastewaters see tables s1 s2 and s3 in si for their characteristics at different influent ibu concentrations in different stages ibu of 0 μg l control in stage 1 ibu of 100 μg l in stage 2 ibu of 500 μg l in stage 3 and ibu of 1000 μg l in stage 4 these concentration ranges were selected based on ibu concentrations detected in the influent of wwtps and various water bodies soulet et al 2002 lin et al 2008 santos et al 2009 sim et al 2010 the ibu loading rate μg mg suspended solids ss d in each stage in three reactors was kept the same see page s6 in si for details the ibu removal efficiency and specific removal rate were also determined in different stages of operation of three reactors see page s6 in si for details 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 ibu removal by as anms and srb enriched sludge ibu removal pathways e g via adsorption and biodegradation by as anms and srb enriched sludge were examined via a series of batch experiments at different initial ibu concentrations of 100 500 and 1000 μg l the sludge samples were taken on day 110 from sbr and on day 220 from uasb and srusb reactors operated under steady state conditions washed three times with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 and then added into a series of identical serum bottles working volume of 500 ml with average volatile suspended solids vss concentration of 1 0 0 2 g l in each bottle see pages s7 s8 in si for more details the batch experiments were classified into three groups see table s4 in si for the experimental design group i designated as a control without sludge was conducted for 5 days to examine the possible hydrolysis and volatilization of ibu the ibu removal by hydrolysis and volatilization was negligible in this study see fig s2 in si in group ii 0 1 w v sodium azide nan3 to inhibit the microbial activity li and zhang 2010 was added into each serum bottle to examine the adsorption of ibu by three different sludges and the adsorption experiments were conducted for 24 h in group iii the batch experiments were conducted for 5 days to investigate the biodegradation of ibu by three different sludges during the experiments 2 ml of uniformly mixed sample was regularly withdrawn from each serum bottle and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was used for ibu analysis in aqueous phase after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the residual sludge in the tube was used for ibu analysis in solid phase after frozen lyophilized ultrasonic and solid phase extraction see pages s9 s10 in si for details the removal efficiency and specific removal rate of ibu were examined see page s7 in si for details all the batch experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 2 ibu biotransformation in as system based on the results detailed discussion is given in section 3 2 as system was more effective in ibu biodegradation compared to anms and srb enriched sludge systems thus a series of batch experiments were conducted to examine the ibu biotransformation mechanisms in as system as system is a complex biological process in which organics degradation is carried out by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb whereas nitrification is carried out by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrification is carried out by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb peng et al 2019 in this study we examined the roles of ahb and aob in ibu biotransformation by inhibiting ammonia monooxygenase amo see page s8 and table s5 for details meanwhile the roles of nob and hdb in ibu biotransformation were examined via a series of batch experiments with nitrite or nitrate addition when amo was inhibited see pages s8 and table s5 in si for details since cytochrome p450 cyp450 enzymes are commonly present in bacteria and have been reported to play important roles in biotransformation of pharmaceutical compounds shaik et al 2010 srinivas et al 2017 a series of batch experiments were also conducted to evaluate their roles in ibu biotransformation by as in this study see table s5 in si for details ibu biotransformation intermediates in as system were also determined see pages s9 s11 in si for more details 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical analyses the influent effluent and

flame ionization detector fid agilent ca usa see page s9 in si for more details 2 3 2 microbial community analyses biomass samples triplicate were collected from sbr uasb and srusb reactors at the end of each stage of operation to analyze microbial community response to ibu addition using 16s rrna gene targeted high throughput illumina sequencing the raw sequence data were deposited in genbank see table s6 in si for accession number dna was extracted from biomass samples using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories ga usa as per the manufacturer s protocols dna extracts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using the primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 for the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene xu et al 2016 and then the

analyzed using the mothur software package v 1 25 1 see page s11 in si for details schloss et al 2009 alpha diversity was determined as bacterial richness and diversity beta diversity was assessed with bray curtis distance matrix and visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa adonis analysis was used to describe the variation in bray curtis distance by each phenotype using 999 permutations and the r2 value schloss et al 2009 which was further visualized by heatmap based on the relative abundances of the genera schloss et al 2009 2 3 3 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out to examine the significant difference between the experimental results multiple comparisons were based on one way analysis of variance anova in spss 16 0 ibm ny usa least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was used for comparisons between the treatment means and to find the significant difference statistically between the experimental results the limits of detection and quantification of ibu and intermediates are presented in si see pages s9 and s11 in si respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of different biological sludge systems the cod removal efficiency in as system decreased significantly p 0 05 with increase in influent ibu concentration removal efficiency of 99 2 2 1 in stage 1 without ibu addition 93 3 2 8 in stage 2 at influent ibu of 100 μg l 70 8 1 4 in stage 3 at influent ibu of 500 μg l and 48 8 1 6 in stage 4 at influent ibu of 1000 μg l reactors performance data are summarized in table s7 in si which could be due to inhibitory effect of ibu and or ibu biotransformation products tps on microbes ernest et al 2009 in as system this finding was in close agreement with that of londoño and peñuela 2015 who also reported a decline in organics removal in as system with increasing influent ibu concentration from 300 to 1000 μg l however the nitrogen removal was not affected since no nitrite or nitrate accumulation was observed by ibu during the operation of sbr in all four stages see table s7 in si in anms system both the cod removal efficiency 84 6 2 5 and methane yield 187 6 3 1 nml g codremoved methane yield normalized n to the standard temperature and pressure stp were not affected by ibu in all operation stages of uasb reactor see table s7 in si in srb enriched sludge system cod removal efficiency was over 80 0 and about 60 0 of the influent sulfate was reduced to dissolved sulfide in all four operational stages of srusb reactor see table s7 in si suggesting that srb were also not inhibited by ibu throughout the srusb reactor operation this was further confirmed by the results of the microbial community analysis which apparently showed that ibu had no detrimental effect on genus desulfobacter the most abundant sulfate reducer in all srb enriched sludge samples thus the cod removal efficiency under anaerobic methanogenic and sulfate reducing conditions was not affected by the presence of ibu these results clearly indicate that the anaerobes in both anms and srb enriched sludge systems showed higher tolerance to the pharmaceutical compounds especially ibu than the aerobes in as system thus this study for the first time provides the comparative performance of three different biological sludge systems in presence of ibu at various concentrations as shown in fig 1 a over 94 0 of the influent ibu in stage 2 was removed in as system and the specific removal rate was 34 9 0 8 μg g ss d fig 1 b the removal efficiency and specific removal rate of ibu in as system however reduced significantly p 0 05 by 88 9 2 0 and 14 9 0 8 μg g ss d respectively when the influent ibu concentrations increased from 100 μg l stage 2 to 1000 μg l stage 4 fig 1 b thus ibu and or ibu tps showed an inhibitory effect on aerobes in as system at all ibu concentrations tested in this study which was subsequently confirmed by the results of microbial community analysis as discussed in section 3 4 however ibu was poorly removed 10 0 at all concentrations tested in anms and srb enriched sludge systems fig 1 which could be attributed to the differences in microbial populations and functional enzymes involved in different biological sludge systems for instance ibu is more easily hydroxylated and oxidized by aerobes than anaerobes methanogenic process collado et al 2012 thus the ibu removal was higher in as system than in two anaerobic sludge systems gonzalez gil et al 2016 musson et al 2010 3 2 ibu removal pathways in as anms srb enriched sludge systems ibu adsorption onto all three sludges was less than 10 0 of total removal at initial concentration of 100 μg l fig 2 and similar adsorption patterns were observed at initial ibu concentrations of 500 and 1000 μg l figures s3 a and s4 a respectively in si the results apparently show that adsorption was not the primary removal route of ibu in all the three biological sludge systems tested in this study several studies reported poor adsorption of ibu onto as and anms joss et al 2005 stevens garmon et al 2011 which is primarily due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ibu molecule and the negatively charged surface of biological sludge at neutral ph ph 7 5 0 3 in this study estevez et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 b and c ibu was poorly degraded biodegradation efficiency 15 0 and the specific biodegradation rate 3 0 μg g vss d in two anaerobic sludge anms and srb enriched sludge systems at initial ibu concentration of 100 μg l similar trends were also observed at higher initial ibu concentrations of 500 fig s3 b and c in si and 1000 μg l fig s4 b and c in si thereby indicating poor biodegradation of ibu under anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2014 2016 ibu however was degraded effectively in as system at initial concentration of 100 μg l fig 2 b in this study ibu was nearly completely removed with the biodegradation efficiency of 94 4 4 5 and specific biodegradation rate of 63 7 1 1 μg g vss d for the first 36 h in as system ibu biodegradation in as system however showed a decreasing trend with increasing ibu concentration fig s3 b and c and fig s4 b and c in si the cod removal efficiency in as system declined with increasing ibu concentration fig s5 a in si which was in consistent with the performance of sbr reactor and apparently showed the inhibitory effect of ibu and or ibu tps on aerobes in as system this was further substantiated by sour test results sour is the measure of microbial activity of aerobes of as which decreased significantly p 0 05 with increasing ibu concentration see fig s6 in si in order to further examine the biodegradation mechanism of ibu in as system especially at ibu concentration of 100 μg l ibu biotransformation products and possible pathways associated with functional enzymes involved were investigated and discussed in the following section 3 3 ibu biotransformation in as system since effective ibu degradation was achieved in as system at ibu concentration of 100 μg l no significant biodegradation in anaerobic sludge systems ibu biotransformation in as system was further examined using a series of batch experiments details are given in section 2 2 2 for as system the possible roles of ahb aob nob and hdb in ibu biotransformation were examined via a series of batch experiments see table s5 in si for details in presence of allylthiourea atu the amo inhibitor xu et al 2018 ammonia oxidation was completely inhibited as the ammonia concentration did not change during 36 h of experiment see fig s7 in si indicating that the nitrification and denitrification did not proceed thus the role of nitrogen removal on ibu biotransformation in as system could be evaluated as shown in fig 3 a ibu biodegradation was not affected when the nitrogen removal process was inhibited by atu addition the ibu biodegradation rates were 66 8 1 6 and 65 9 0 8 μg g vss d respectively with and without atu addition fig 3 b additionally ibu biodegradation rate did not change significantly p 0 05 following the addition of nitrite and nitrate in presence of atu fig 3 indicating that neither nob nor hdb were involved in ibu biotransformation this finding apparently suggests that ibu biotransformation was not associated with nitrogen removal and ahb were likely responsible for ibu biotransformation rather than aob nob and hdb several studies reported that aob were mainly involved in biotransformation of some pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac carbamazepine 17α ethinylestradiol trimethoprim etc via oxidation catalyzed by amo tran et al 2009 khunjar et al 2011 in this study aob however were not involved in ibu biotransformation in as system which was in close agreement with other studies roh et al 2009 men et al 2017 since cyp450 enzymes are commonly present in bacteria e g ahb shaik et al 2005 and may play an important role in the biotransformation of pharmaceuticals ji et al 2018 golan rozen et al 2011 inhibition test for cyp450 enzymes was conducted with 1 aminobenzotriazole 1 abt as an inhibitor prieto et al 2011 in this study the results show that cyp450 enzymes were not involved in ibu biotransformation in as system since the ibu biodegradation trends were similar with and without 1 abt inhibitor fig 3 a it is important to point out that even though cyp450 enzymes were not involved in ibu biodegradation the exact functional enzymes catalyzing ibu biotransformation in ahb could not be identified in this study since the ahb metabolism involves complex biological enzyme systems further studies are needed to examine the metabolic pathways of ibu biotransformation by ahb at the gene and the enzymatic levels in order to gain better insights into ibu biotransformation in as system the intermediates formed during the batch tests were analyzed ibu was found to be transformed into three intermediates via three pathways in as system fig s8 in si two tps were identified as two isomers of hydroxy ibuprofen tp1 1 oh ibu and tp2 2 oh ibu by their molecular anion m z 221 and the product ion spectra table s8 and fig s8 in si indicating that ibu biotransformation was initiated via hydroxylation quintana et al 2005 and both the intermediates tp1 and tp2 could be further decomposed m z 177 via decarboxylation fig s8 in si another intermediate carboxy ibuprofen tp3 ca ibu was also produced via carboxylation of ibu zwiener et al 2002 followed by further decomposition via decarboxylation m z 191 these three intermediates were also detected in the effluent of other as systems and the aquatic environments ferrando climent et al 2012 boix et al 2016 in as system tp1 was the main isomer with concentration ranging from 1 5 to 4 9 μg l in the first 24 h ibu tp1 and tp2 were completely biodegraded within 36 h tp3 however was present at very low concentration 4 1 μg l at the end of 36 h of batch tests fig 3 c 3 4 effects of ibuprofen on microbial populations in as anms and srb enriched sludge systems we employed 16s rrna gene targeted high throughput illumina sequencing to evaluate the microbial community structures in as anms and srb enriched sludge samples when exposed to different ibu concentrations during long term operation of three reactors diversity and richness are shown in table s9 and discussed in pages s11 s12 in si and the changes in microbial populations at phylum level are shown in fig s9 and discussed in pages s12 13 in si the microbial community structures changed significantly p 0 05 based on the principal coordinate analysis pcoa and adonis analysis see fig s10 in si at different ibu concentrations the changes in relative abundance of microbial populations at the genus level top 25 genera with relative abundance 0 1 in as system were visualized via a heatmap as shown in fig 4 a the relative abundance of genus candidatus competibacter mainly responsible for accumulating glycogen and degrading organics mcilroy et al 2014 in as system decreased from 9 2 at ibu concentration of 0 μg l stage 1 to 0 9 at ibu concentration of 1000 μg l stage 4 which also explains the deterioration in cod removal efficiency in this study although the genus nitrospira a well known nitrite oxidizing bacterium and complete ammonia oxidizer comammox daims et al 2015 liu et al 2017 was inhibited significantly p 0 05 by ibu at all concentrations in as system see fig 4 a the nitrogen removal throughout the sbr operation was not affected at all see table s7 in si this could be due to the presence of some other genera such as pseudomonas and thermomonas relative abundances are shown in table s10 in si which have also been reported capable of denitrifying nitrate nitrite into n2 gas li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 kostrytsia et al 2018 interestingly the genus thiothrix was also found in as samples in high relative abundance e g 7 5 in the four operational stages table s10 in si the genus thiothrix has been reported as a metabolically diverse genus facultative chemoorganotroph odintsova et al 1993 autotroph and mixotroph howarth et al 1999 with detection in a wide range of environments including as system nielsen et al 2000 in this study genus thiothrix a filamentous bacterium wu et al 2019 contributed to sludge bulking in as system since sludge volume index svi of sludge sample increased from 87 8 3 5 stage 1 to 195 7 6 5 ml g ss stage 4 table s7 in si the microbial populations phylum and genus levels are shown in fig s9 and fig 4 b and c respectively in anms and srb enriched sludge samples were markedly changed based on the pcoa and adonis analysis fig s10 b and c after a long term 180 days continuous ibu exposure from stage 1 to stage 4 in anms system the major microbial groups were mainly represented by bacteroidetes and chloroflexi phyla especially bacteroidetes vadinha17 groups phylum bacteroidetes anaerolineaceae groups phylum chloroflexi and chloroflexi unclassfied groups phylum chloroflexi fig s9 b which play important roles in organic degradation pan et al 2015 anne et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 groups decreased with increasing ibu concentration however opposite trends were observed with anaerolineaceae groups and chloroflexi unclassfied groups fig 4 b suggesting that anaerolineaceae groups and chloroflexi unclassfied groups showed higher tolerance to ibu than bacteroidetes vadinha17 groups in srb enriched sludge system the genus desulfobacter belonging to proteobacteria phylum was the most abundant in all srb enriched sludge samples relative abundance of 17 1 1 2 stage 1 and 25 0 0 8 from stage 4 suggesting that ibu apparently had no negative effect on desulfobacter fig 4 c and table s11 these findings conformed well with reactor performance data such as cod and sulfate removals which were not affected by ibu addition as shown in table s7 in si our previous study also showed that cip had no negative effects on desulfobacter kovacik et al 2010 suggesting that desulfobacter had high tolerance to pharmaceuticals e g ibu and cip 4 conclusions this study investigated ibu removal in three important biological sludge systems i e as anms and srb enriched sludge systems our results showed that ibu removal via adsorption was less effective in all three sludge systems and the biodegradation was the main removal pathway especially in as system at lower ibu concentration 100 μg l additionally we found that as system was superior to anaerobic sludge systems anms and srb enriched sludge in ibu biodegradation thus the low ibu concentration 100 μg l in municipal wastewater could be effectively removed in as process via biodegradation 94 0 by ahb with high relative abundance of genus candidatus competibacter 9 2 however higher ibu concentration i e 500 and 1000 μg l imposed significant inhibition of ahb activity coupled with poor settling of sludge due to proliferation of genus thiothrix a filamentous bacterium thus conventional as process may be less effective to treat ibu laden wastewater at high concentration in such cases a hybrid process integrating physical chemical process i e neutral photo fenton process granular media filtration membrane microfiltration granular activated carbon gac adsorption and ozonation dong et al 2019 yang et al 2011 to lower the ibu concentration followed by as process could be applied this study provides a better insight into fate and biotransformation mechanism of ibu in three biological sludge systems via microbial community

18247,ibuprofen ibu a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid is widely used by humans for controlling fever and pain and is frequently detected in the influent of wastewater treatment plants and different aquatic environments in this study the biotransformation of ibu in activated sludge as anaerobic methanogenic sludge anms and sulfate reducing bacteria srb enriched sludge systems was investigated at three different concentrations of 100 500 and 1000 μg l via a series of batch and continuous studies ibu at concentration of 100 μg l was effectively biodegraded by as whereas anms and srb enriched sludge were less effective in ibu biodegradation at all concentrations tested however at higher ibu concentrations of 500 and 1000 μg l as showed poor ibu biodegradation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal due to inhibition of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria i e candidatus competibacter by ibu and or ibu biotransformation products the microbial analyses showed that ibu addition shifted the microbial community structure in as anms and srb enriched sludge systems however the removals of cod nitrogen and sulfur in both anaerobic sludge systems were not affected significantly p 0 05 the findings of this study provided a new insight into biotransformation of ibu in three important biological sludge systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment pharmaceutical wastewater ibuprofen removal biotransformation 1 introduction ibuprofen ibu a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid is largely used by humans for the treatment of pain inflammation and fever petrie et al 2015 and it is the safest and the most effective drug for children according to the world health organization who model list of essential medicines myers 2007 ibu ranks second in the drug production with a global production of 15000 metric tons year after aspirin who model list of essential medicines 2015 importantly up to 85 of the ingested ibu is excreted via urine and feces without being metabolized rainsford 2009 therefore ibu has been frequently detected in the influent of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and various water bodies at concentration ranging up to 990 0 μg l soulet et al 2002 lin et al 2008 santos et al 2009 sim et al 2010 studies have shown that ibu at ng l level in the environment could affect some aquatic species prud homme et al 2018 veldhoen et al 2014 and could even be deleterious for cell proliferation in human embryonic cells leverrier penna et al 2018 thus there has been a growing research interest on biotransformation of ibu during biological wastewater treatment processes luo et al 2014 li et al 2016 several studies examined the fate of ibu in wwtps especially in activated sludge as process kruglova et al 2014 suarez et al 2010 kimura et al 2007 although biodegradation was the primary removal route of ibu in as process alvarino et al 2014 2016 small amount of ibu was also removed via adsorption onto the biological sludge carballa et al 2008 anaerobic process is widely adopted for high strength wastewater treatment and sewage sludge digestion but the process was less effective in ibu removal alvarino et al 2014 gonzalez gil et al 2016 conversely samaras et al 2014 reported near complete removal of ibu at concentration of 2 83 μg g total solids ts during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge besides there are very limited comparative studies on ibu biotransformation mechanisms in as and anaerobic methanogenic sludge anms systems in recent years sulfur mediated biological process such as sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process integrating sulfur carbon and nitrogen removal has drawn significant attention lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in the process sulfate reducing bacteria srb can use sulfate as an electron acceptor for removal of organics under anaerobic condition recently srb enriched sludge system has been examined to treat sulfate laden pharmaceutical wastewater chelliapan and sallis 2015 and synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater containing sulfamethoxazole smx and ciprofloxacin cip respectively jia et al 2017 2018 thus these studies show the potential of srb enriched sludge system for the removal of ibu to the best of our knowledge there are no reported studies on ibu removal pathways and biotransformation mechanisms in srb enriched sludge system and the comparative studies examining the biotransformation of ibu in three biological sludge systems e g as anms and srb enriched sludge thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the biotransformation of ibu in as anms and srb enriched sludge systems through a long term operation of three parallel bench scale reactors followed by a series of batch experiments for three different sludge systems the potential ibu biotransformation mechanisms via microbial community analysis functional enzymes involved and biotransformation intermediates and pathways were also investigated using a series of batch experiments the findings of this study provided better insights into ibu biotransformation mechanisms in three sludge systems namely as anms and srb enriched sludge systems and thus opens up a new opportunity in employing an appropriate biological process for treating ibu containing wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors setup and operation three sludges namely as anms and srb enriched sludge were used in three different reactors setup i e sequencing batch reactor sbr up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor respectively see fig s1 in supplementary information si for reactors setup these reactors were operated in parallel for 110 days using as and 220 days using anms and srb enriched sludge in different stages to examine ibu removal details of inocula source and operating conditions for each reactor are presented in pages s5 s6 in si in order to minimize the variation in wastewater characteristics and to accurately identify the biotransformation mechanisms the reactors were fed with synthetic wastewaters see tables s1 s2 and s3 in si for their characteristics at different influent ibu concentrations in different stages ibu of 0 μg l control in stage 1 ibu of 100 μg l in stage 2 ibu of 500 μg l in stage 3 and ibu of 1000 μg l in stage 4 these concentration ranges were selected based on ibu concentrations detected in the influent of wwtps and various water bodies soulet et al 2002 lin et al 2008 santos et al 2009 sim et al 2010 the ibu loading rate μg mg suspended solids ss d in each stage in three reactors was kept the same see page s6 in si for details the ibu removal efficiency and specific removal rate were also determined in different stages of operation of three reactors see page s6 in si for details 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 ibu removal by as anms and srb enriched sludge ibu removal pathways e g via adsorption and biodegradation by as anms and srb enriched sludge were examined via a series of batch experiments at different initial ibu concentrations of 100 500 and 1000 μg l the sludge samples were taken on day 110 from sbr and on day 220 from uasb and srusb reactors operated under steady state conditions washed three times with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 and then added into a series of identical serum bottles working volume of 500 ml with average volatile suspended solids vss concentration of 1 0 0 2 g l in each bottle see pages s7 s8 in si for more details the batch experiments were classified into three groups see table s4 in si for the experimental design group i designated as a control without sludge was conducted for 5 days to examine the possible hydrolysis and volatilization of ibu the ibu removal by hydrolysis and volatilization was negligible in this study see fig s2 in si in group ii 0 1 w v sodium azide nan3 to inhibit the microbial activity li and zhang 2010 was added into each serum bottle to examine the adsorption of ibu by three different sludges and the adsorption experiments were conducted for 24 h in group iii the batch experiments were conducted for 5 days to investigate the biodegradation of ibu by three different sludges during the experiments 2 ml of uniformly mixed sample was regularly withdrawn from each serum bottle and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was used for ibu analysis in aqueous phase after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the residual sludge in the tube was used for ibu analysis in solid phase after frozen lyophilized ultrasonic and solid phase extraction see pages s9 s10 in si for details the removal efficiency and specific removal rate of ibu were examined see page s7 in si for details all the batch experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 2 ibu biotransformation in as system based on the results detailed discussion is given in section 3 2 as system was more effective in ibu biodegradation compared to anms and srb enriched sludge systems thus a series of batch experiments were conducted to examine the ibu biotransformation mechanisms in as system as system is a complex biological process in which organics degradation is carried out by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb whereas nitrification is carried out by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrification is carried out by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb peng et al 2019 in this study we examined the roles of ahb and aob in ibu biotransformation by inhibiting ammonia monooxygenase amo see page s8 and table s5 for details meanwhile the roles of nob and hdb in ibu biotransformation were examined via a series of batch experiments with nitrite or nitrate addition when amo was inhibited see pages s8 and table s5 in si for details since cytochrome p450 cyp450 enzymes are commonly present in bacteria and have been reported to play important roles in biotransformation of pharmaceutical compounds shaik et al 2010 srinivas et al 2017 a series of batch experiments were also conducted to evaluate their roles in ibu biotransformation by as in this study see table s5 in si for details ibu biotransformation intermediates in as system were also determined see pages s9 s11 in si for more details 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical analyses the influent effluent and sludge samples from sbr uasb and srusb reactors were regularly collected for routine chemical analyses i e chemical oxygen demand cod sulfate thiosulfate sulfite nitrite nitrate ammonia ss and vss as per the standard methods apha 2005 see pages s8 s9 in si for details the specific oxygen uptake rate sour of biomass from sbr was determined as per the standard methods apha 2005 ibu concentrations in influent effluent and sludge samples were determined by an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc dionex ultimate 3000 ca usa with a diode array detector dad dionex ca usa see page s9 in si for

flame ionization detector fid agilent ca usa see page s9 in si for more details 2 3 2 microbial community analyses biomass samples triplicate were collected from sbr uasb and srusb reactors at the end of each stage of operation to analyze microbial community response to ibu addition using 16s rrna gene targeted high throughput illumina sequencing the raw sequence data were deposited in genbank see table s6 in si for accession number dna was extracted from biomass samples using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories ga usa as per the manufacturer s protocols dna extracts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using the primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 for the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene xu et al 2016 and then the pcr products were sequenced by illumina miseq pe300 platform illumina inc ca usa by guangdong magigene biotechnology guangzhou china raw miseq sequencing data 30 000 sequences were processed and analyzed using the mothur software package v 1 25 1 see page s11 in si for details schloss et al 2009 alpha diversity was determined as bacterial richness and diversity beta diversity was assessed with bray curtis distance matrix and visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa adonis analysis was used to describe the variation in bray curtis distance by each phenotype using 999 permutations and the r2 value schloss et al 2009 which was further visualized by heatmap based on the relative abundances of the genera schloss et al 2009 2 3 3 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out to examine the significant difference between the experimental results multiple comparisons were based on one way analysis of variance anova in spss 16 0 ibm ny usa least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was used for comparisons between the treatment means and to find the significant difference statistically between the experimental results the limits of detection and quantification of ibu and intermediates are presented in si see pages s9 and s11 in si respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of different biological sludge systems the cod removal efficiency in as system decreased significantly p 0 05 with increase in influent ibu concentration removal efficiency of 99 2 2 1 in stage 1 without ibu addition 93 3 2 8 in stage 2 at influent ibu of 100 μg l 70 8 1 4 in stage 3 at influent ibu of 500 μg l and 48 8 1 6 in stage 4 at influent ibu of 1000 μg l reactors performance data are summarized in table s7 in si which could be due to inhibitory effect of ibu and or ibu biotransformation products tps on microbes ernest et al 2009 in as system this finding was in close agreement with that of londoño and peñuela 2015 who also reported a decline in organics removal in as system with increasing influent ibu concentration from 300 to 1000 μg l however the nitrogen removal was not affected since no nitrite or nitrate accumulation was observed by ibu during the operation of sbr in all four stages see table s7 in si in anms system both the cod removal efficiency 84 6 2 5 and methane yield 187 6 3 1 nml g codremoved methane yield normalized n to the standard temperature and pressure stp were not affected by ibu in all operation stages of uasb reactor see table s7 in si in srb enriched sludge system cod removal efficiency was over 80 0 and about 60 0 of the influent sulfate was reduced to dissolved sulfide in all four operational stages of srusb reactor see table s7 in si suggesting that srb were also not inhibited by ibu throughout the srusb reactor operation this was further confirmed by the results of the microbial community analysis which apparently showed that ibu had no detrimental effect on genus desulfobacter the most abundant sulfate reducer in all srb enriched sludge samples thus the cod removal efficiency under anaerobic methanogenic and sulfate reducing conditions was not affected by the presence of ibu these results clearly indicate that the anaerobes in both anms and srb enriched sludge systems showed higher tolerance to the pharmaceutical compounds especially ibu than the aerobes in as system thus this study for the first time provides the comparative performance of three different biological sludge systems in presence of ibu at various concentrations as shown in fig 1 a over 94 0 of the influent ibu in stage 2 was removed in as system and the specific removal rate was 34 9 0 8 μg g ss d fig 1 b the removal efficiency and specific removal rate of ibu in as system however reduced significantly p 0 05 by 88 9 2 0 and 14 9 0 8 μg g ss d respectively when the influent ibu concentrations increased from 100 μg l stage 2 to 1000 μg l stage 4 fig 1 b thus ibu and or ibu tps showed an inhibitory effect on aerobes in as system at all ibu concentrations tested in this study which was subsequently confirmed by the results of microbial community analysis as discussed in section 3 4 however ibu was poorly removed 10 0 at all concentrations tested in anms and srb enriched sludge systems fig 1 which could be attributed to the differences in microbial populations and functional enzymes involved in different biological sludge systems for instance ibu is more easily hydroxylated and oxidized by aerobes than anaerobes methanogenic process collado et al 2012 thus the ibu removal was higher in as system than in two anaerobic sludge systems gonzalez gil et al 2016 musson et al 2010 3 2 ibu removal pathways in as anms srb enriched sludge systems ibu adsorption onto all three sludges was less than 10 0 of total removal at initial concentration of 100 μg l fig 2 and similar adsorption patterns were observed at initial ibu concentrations of 500 and 1000 μg l figures s3 a and s4 a respectively in si the results apparently show that adsorption was not the primary removal route of ibu in all the three biological sludge systems tested in this study several studies reported poor adsorption of ibu onto as and anms joss et al 2005 stevens garmon et al 2011 which is primarily due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ibu molecule and the negatively charged surface of biological sludge at neutral ph ph 7 5 0 3 in this study estevez et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 b and c ibu was poorly degraded biodegradation efficiency 15 0 and the specific biodegradation rate 3 0 μg g vss d in two anaerobic sludge anms and srb enriched sludge systems at initial ibu concentration of 100 μg l similar trends were also observed at higher initial ibu concentrations of 500 fig s3 b and c in si and 1000 μg l fig s4 b and c in si thereby indicating poor biodegradation of ibu under anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2014 2016 ibu however was degraded effectively in as system at initial concentration of 100 μg l fig 2 b in this study ibu was nearly completely removed with the biodegradation efficiency of 94 4 4 5 and specific biodegradation rate of 63 7 1 1 μg g vss d for the first 36 h in as system ibu biodegradation in as system however showed a decreasing trend with increasing ibu concentration fig s3 b and c and fig s4 b and c in si the cod removal efficiency in as system declined with increasing ibu concentration fig s5 a in si which was in consistent with the performance of sbr reactor and apparently showed the inhibitory effect of ibu and or ibu tps on aerobes in as system this was further substantiated by sour test results sour is the measure of microbial activity of aerobes of as which decreased significantly p 0 05 with increasing ibu concentration see fig s6 in si in order to further examine the biodegradation mechanism of ibu in as system especially at ibu concentration of 100 μg l ibu biotransformation products and possible pathways associated with functional enzymes involved were investigated and discussed in the following section 3 3 ibu biotransformation in as system since effective ibu degradation was achieved in as system at ibu concentration of 100 μg l no significant biodegradation in anaerobic sludge systems ibu biotransformation in as system was further examined using a series of batch experiments details are given in section 2 2 2 for as system the possible roles of ahb aob nob and hdb in ibu biotransformation were examined via a series of batch experiments see table s5 in si for details in presence of allylthiourea atu the amo inhibitor xu et al 2018 ammonia oxidation was completely inhibited as the ammonia concentration did not change during 36 h of experiment see fig s7 in si indicating that the nitrification and denitrification did not proceed thus the role of nitrogen removal on ibu biotransformation in as system could be evaluated as shown in fig 3 a ibu biodegradation was not affected when the nitrogen removal process was inhibited by atu addition the ibu biodegradation rates were 66 8 1 6 and 65 9 0 8 μg g vss d respectively with and without atu addition fig 3 b additionally ibu biodegradation rate did not change significantly p 0 05 following the addition of nitrite and nitrate in presence of atu fig 3 indicating that neither nob nor hdb were involved in ibu biotransformation this finding apparently suggests that ibu biotransformation was not associated with nitrogen removal and ahb were likely responsible for ibu biotransformation rather than aob nob and hdb several studies reported that aob were mainly involved in biotransformation of some pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac carbamazepine 17α ethinylestradiol trimethoprim etc via oxidation catalyzed by amo tran et al 2009 khunjar et al 2011 in this study aob however were not involved in ibu biotransformation in as system which was in close agreement with other studies roh et al 2009 men et al 2017 since cyp450 enzymes are commonly present in bacteria e g ahb shaik et al 2005 and may play an important role in the biotransformation of pharmaceuticals ji et al 2018 golan rozen et al 2011 inhibition test for cyp450 enzymes was conducted with 1 aminobenzotriazole 1 abt as an inhibitor prieto et al 2011 in this study the results show that cyp450 enzymes were not involved in ibu biotransformation in as system since the ibu biodegradation trends were similar with and without 1 abt inhibitor fig 3 a it is important to point out that even though cyp450 enzymes were not involved in ibu biodegradation the exact functional enzymes catalyzing ibu biotransformation in ahb could not be identified in this study since the ahb metabolism involves complex biological enzyme systems further studies are needed to examine the metabolic pathways of ibu biotransformation by ahb at the gene and the enzymatic levels in order to gain better insights into ibu biotransformation in as system the intermediates formed during the batch tests were analyzed ibu was found to be transformed into three intermediates via three pathways in as system fig s8 in si two tps were identified as two isomers of hydroxy ibuprofen tp1 1 oh ibu and tp2 2 oh ibu by their molecular anion m z 221 and the product ion spectra table s8 and fig s8 in si indicating that ibu biotransformation was initiated via hydroxylation quintana et al 2005 and both the intermediates tp1 and tp2 could be further decomposed m z 177 via decarboxylation fig s8 in si another intermediate carboxy ibuprofen tp3 ca ibu was also produced via carboxylation of ibu zwiener et al 2002 followed by further decomposition via decarboxylation m z 191 these three intermediates were also detected in the effluent of other as systems and the aquatic environments ferrando climent et al 2012 boix et al 2016 in as system tp1 was the main isomer with concentration ranging from 1 5 to 4 9 μg l in the first 24 h ibu tp1 and tp2 were completely biodegraded within 36 h tp3 however was present at very low concentration 4 1 μg l at the end of 36 h of batch tests fig 3 c 3 4 effects of ibuprofen on microbial populations in as anms and srb enriched sludge systems we employed 16s rrna gene targeted high throughput illumina sequencing to evaluate the microbial community structures in as anms and srb enriched sludge samples when exposed to different ibu concentrations during long term operation of three reactors diversity and richness are shown in table s9 and discussed in pages s11 s12 in si and the changes in microbial populations at phylum level are shown in fig s9 and discussed in pages s12 13 in si the microbial community structures changed significantly p 0 05 based on the principal coordinate analysis pcoa and adonis analysis see fig s10 in si at different ibu concentrations the changes in relative abundance of microbial populations at the genus level top 25 genera with relative abundance 0 1 in as system were visualized via a heatmap as shown in fig 4 a the relative abundance of genus candidatus competibacter mainly responsible for accumulating glycogen and degrading organics mcilroy et al 2014 in as system decreased from 9 2 at ibu concentration of 0 μg l stage 1 to 0 9 at ibu concentration of 1000 μg l stage 4 which also explains the deterioration in cod removal efficiency in this study although the genus nitrospira a well known nitrite oxidizing bacterium and complete ammonia oxidizer comammox daims et al 2015 liu et al 2017 was inhibited significantly p 0 05 by ibu at all concentrations in as system see fig 4 a the nitrogen removal throughout the sbr operation was not affected at all see table s7 in si this could be due to the presence of some other genera such as pseudomonas and thermomonas relative abundances are shown in table s10 in si which have also been reported capable of denitrifying nitrate nitrite into n2 gas li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 kostrytsia et al 2018 interestingly the genus thiothrix was also found in as samples in high relative abundance e g 7 5 in the four operational stages table s10 in si the genus thiothrix has been reported as a metabolically diverse genus facultative chemoorganotroph odintsova et al 1993 autotroph and mixotroph howarth et al 1999 with detection in a wide range of environments including as system nielsen et al 2000 in this study genus thiothrix a filamentous bacterium wu et al 2019 contributed to sludge bulking in as system since sludge volume index svi of sludge sample increased from 87 8 3 5 stage 1 to 195 7 6 5 ml g ss stage 4 table s7 in si the microbial populations phylum and genus levels are shown in fig s9 and fig 4 b and c respectively in anms and srb enriched sludge samples were markedly changed based on the pcoa and adonis analysis fig s10 b and c after a long term 180 days continuous ibu exposure from stage 1 to stage 4 in anms system the major microbial groups were mainly represented by bacteroidetes and chloroflexi phyla especially bacteroidetes vadinha17 groups phylum bacteroidetes anaerolineaceae groups phylum chloroflexi and chloroflexi unclassfied groups phylum chloroflexi fig s9 b which play important roles in organic degradation pan et al 2015 anne et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 groups decreased with increasing ibu concentration however opposite trends were observed with anaerolineaceae groups and chloroflexi unclassfied groups fig 4 b suggesting that anaerolineaceae groups and chloroflexi unclassfied groups showed higher tolerance to ibu than bacteroidetes vadinha17 groups in srb enriched sludge system the genus desulfobacter belonging to proteobacteria phylum was the most abundant in all srb enriched sludge samples relative abundance of 17 1 1 2 stage 1 and 25 0 0 8 from stage 4 suggesting that ibu apparently had no negative effect on desulfobacter fig 4 c and table s11 these findings conformed well with reactor performance data such as cod and sulfate removals which were not affected by ibu addition as shown in table s7 in si our previous study also showed that cip had no negative effects on desulfobacter kovacik et al 2010 suggesting that desulfobacter had high tolerance to pharmaceuticals e g ibu and cip 4 conclusions this study investigated ibu removal in three important biological sludge systems i e as anms and srb enriched sludge systems our results showed that ibu removal via adsorption was less effective in all three sludge systems and the biodegradation was the main removal pathway especially in as system at lower ibu concentration 100 μg l additionally we found that as system was superior to anaerobic sludge systems anms and srb enriched sludge in ibu biodegradation thus the low ibu concentration 100 μg l in municipal wastewater could be effectively removed in as process via biodegradation 94 0 by ahb with high relative abundance of genus candidatus competibacter 9 2 however higher ibu concentration i e 500 and 1000 μg l imposed significant inhibition of ahb activity coupled with poor settling of sludge due to proliferation of genus thiothrix a filamentous bacterium thus conventional as process may be less effective to treat ibu laden wastewater at high concentration in such cases a hybrid process integrating physical chemical process i e neutral photo fenton process granular media filtration membrane microfiltration granular activated carbon gac adsorption and ozonation dong et al 2019 yang et al 2011 to lower the ibu concentration followed by as process could be applied this study provides a better insight into fate and biotransformation mechanism of ibu in three biological sludge systems via microbial community

18248,biological pump is important to control the fate and distribution of organic contaminants particularly in temperate and cold oligotrophic waters however it remains largely unknown how factors affect the long term occurrence and fate of ionogenic organic compounds in subtropical eutrophic waters the present study aimed to assess biogeochemical and physical factors affecting the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of 14 antibiotics through planktonic food webs in the pearl river a large subtropical eutrophic river in china this was done by carrying out 1 year simultaneous field observations of antibiotic concentrations in five water column compartments and assessing the variability of bioconcentration bcf bioaccumulation baf and biomagnification bmf factors which were influenced by plankton biomass ph and temperature of water columns the annual mean antibiotic concentration per site ranged from 1014 66 535 66 ng l 1 to 1464 63 1075 91 ng l 1 and was positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass but independent of the proximity of the sites to urban areas antibiotic occurrences in both phytoplankton and zooplankton were greatly influenced by a biodilution effect the annual occurrence of antibiotics in the water column was modulated by biological pumps as well as their equilibrium partitioning and indirectly influenced of eutrophication with ph increased with phytoplankton biomass and phytoplankton life cycling baf of antibiotics by plankton had biphasic correlations with temperature n 150 r2 0 17 0 60 p 0 001 and decreased with plankton biomass n 105 147 r2 0 10 0 22 p 0 001 the trophic transfer of antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton bmfs were positively correlated with both phytoplankton biomass n 30 r2 0 58 p 0 001 and temperature n 132 150 r2 0 12 0 43 p 0 001 mean bmfs of ciprofloxacin lomefloxacin ofloxacin oxytetracycline and tetracycline ranged between 0 18 and 2 25 implying these chemicals can undergo biomagnification along planktonic food webs the present research demonstrates the important role of biogeochemical and physical factors in the environmental fate of antibiotics at large spatiotemporal scales keywords antibiotics planktonic food webs bioaccumulation trophic transfer eutrophic river biological pump 1 introduction antibiotics have been recognized as the main emerging environmental pollutants in aquatic environments since they are continuously released into the environment and biomagnified in marine food webs and global concern about their potential adverse effects on the ecosystem and human health is consequently growing boonsaner and hawker 2013 liu et al 2017 richmond et al 2018 phytoplankton and zooplankton as the primary producer and primary predator respectively are important to influence the energy flow and the carbon cycling in aquatic environments the first two steps for antibiotics to enter the food web are bioaccumulation and trophic transfer through planktonic food webs it is necessary to clarify and quantify the factors affecting the occurrence and fate of organic contaminants in the planktonic food web to better understand and eliminate the risk of contaminants in the water environment nizzetto et al 2012 tao et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 antibiotics are ingested by phytoplankton and subsequently transferred to higher trophic levels biotas or to deeper water and sediment by phytoplankton derived organic matter which is one of the fundamental mechanisms for the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in the aquatic environment bai et al 2017 wilson et al 2004 phytoplankton deplete pollutants dissolved in water columns when they bloom leading to the decreased concentrations of pollutants in aquatic biota but enhance their air water exchange fluxes sink fluxes and solids in sediments everaert et al 2015 nizzetto et al 2012 the sequestration of contaminants from the water column is determined by the biogeochemical process known as biological pump which has been intensively examined in space e g along the navigational route of a research vessel in oceans in one growth season berrojalbiz et al 2011a 2011b casal et al 2017 morales et al 2015 contrastingly there are less empirical studies on the work of biological pumps on the temporal scale the most frequently detected ciprofloxacin cfx have been used to investigate effects on freshwater plankton communities and results showed that even low concentration 7 μg l 1 have unexpected effects on the taxonomy and function of a plankton community and the effect was more significant on eukaryotic than bacterial communities while cyanobacteria may strengthen their two component regulatory system and the photosystem to cope with cfx lu et al 2019 the correlation between the sulfamethazine smz induced feeding depression and body size reduction in zooplankton has been explored on a time scale of exposure post exposure and re exposure periods and results demonstrate that smz can influence neurotransmission inhibit digestive enzyme activity leading to body size reduction in rotifer brachionus calyciflorus yan et al 2019 gorokhova et al 2015 reported that trimethoprim tmp may impact daphnia magna via changes in their microbiota and concomitant changes in the host feeding resulting in compromised nutrition and growth ultimately all these studies provided very valuable information on the spatiotemporal occurrence and fate of antibiotics mostly in several tropical and subtropical regions china is the largest producer and user of antibiotics in the world sulfonamides and macrolides due to their low price and high efficiency have been widely used for treating human and animal diseases as well as for promoting growth in livestock and aquaculture tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin nfx and ciprofloxacin cfx are largely consumed by pig as antibacterial agents in china zhang et al 2015 and approximately 10 90 of the administered antibiotics are excreted into river environments tang et al 2019 xie et al 2019 due to the rapid development in china most rivers are currently polluted by antibiotics with antibiotic concentrations in river water and sediments ranged from 0 1 ng l 1 to 1 0 μg l 1 and 0 1 ng g 1 to 1 0 μg g 1 respectively li et al 2018a zhao et al 2016 in the pearl river anhydrous erythromycin etm ranged from 0 to 1540 ng l 1 with mean 63 ng l 1 is predominantly higher than that of other antibiotics except norfloxacin nfx as etm is one of the most widely used antibiotics in china with usage of 3 77 million kg in year 2013 zhang et al 2015 risk assessment has revealed that antibiotic pollution posed a high risk to algae in the pearl river delta li et al 2018b xie et al 2019 xu et al 2013 in the subtropical aquatic environment of china the hydrochemistry and circulation of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and pollutants are changing fast and the background level of antibiotics in waters increased because of increase in annual average water temperatures and plankton biomass le page et al 2018 mei et al 2018 peng et al 2008 xie et al 2019 leading to different results from previous studies in oligotrophic waters to the best of our knowledge little attention has been paid to the long term occurrence and fate of antibiotics in the planktonic food web of subtropical rivers in china due to a lack of field observations the principal aims of this research are i to report concentration levels of 14 antibiotics in five compartments of the water column water total suspended particles tsp dissolved organic carbon phytoplankton and zooplankton at five sampling sites following a 1 year data set of continuous monitoring ii to evaluate and discuss the effects of biogeochemical and physical factors on the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of antibiotics in planktonic food webs in the pearl river a large subtropical eutrophic river in south china 2 materials

obtained from the shanghai anpel laboratory technologies inc shanghai china 2 2 study area sample collection and analyses 2 2 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river in china and flows through the central city of guangzhou one of the most densely populated industrial cities in china fig 1 five sampling sites z1 z5 were chosen from upstream to the estuary along the main stream of the pearl river as described by fan et al 2019 z1 was located in the downstream of liuxi river z2 in the upstream rural areas z3 in the midstream urban reaches that flow through guangzhou city z4 in the downstream industrial belt surrounded by docks and factories and z5 near the estuary of the south china sea fig 1 sampling campaigns were performed simultaneously every twelve days from september 2016 to september 2017 a total of 30 sampling campaigns were performed at each sampling site water total suspended particles tsp phytoplankton and zooplankton sampling were conducted simultaneously during each sampling campaign detailed information describing of study area environmental sampling and the physical and chemical characteristics in water column can be found in tables s2 s3 and the section 1 3 of supplementary information 2 2 2 phytoplankton sampling and analyses to analyze the composition abundance and biomass of phytoplankton community 2 l of surface water 0 30 cm was collected at each sampling site long et al 2019 tao et al 2017b 2017c lugol s iodine was added to the filtrate containing phytoplankton sample for preservation settled for 48 h and concentrated to 30 ml the phytoplankton species was identified according to hu et al 1980 the cell density of each species was counted by a sedgwick rafter counting chamber pyser sgi limited uk using a light microscope olympus cx31 olympus corp at magnifications between 200 and 400 and the cell size was also measured by the same microscope olympus cx31 olympus corp the total biovolume of each species was calculated based on the cell number and cell size the amount of biomass was obtained by converting the cell volumes from the cell shape of each species into biomass assuming that 1 mm3 was equivalent to 1 mg fresh weight biomass according to pápista et al 2002 the remaining phytoplankton samples were freeze dried weighted and stored at 18 c for further analysis of antibiotics 2 2 3 zooplankton sampling and analyses at each sampling site large quantities of zooplanktons were collected by multiple tows from 0 5 m above the bottom to water surface each tow was equipped with a 160 μm nylon mesh net according to long et al 2019 zooplankton sample from each tow was transferred into a 20 l sample bottle tows were repeated at the same sampling site and zooplankton samples from different tows were pooled together until the estimated dry weight of the zooplankton sample was larger than 3 0 g the zooplankton sample in the bottle was cleaned by placing it statically for 20 min and the particulate matter at the bottom was removed formaldehyde reagent was added to fix the sample and the dead zooplanktons were settled at the bottom of the bottle the remaining suspended solids phytoplanktons and soluble organic matter in the water were removed the dead zooplankton was then placed into a 100 ml measuring cylinder and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water settling for 20 min dead phytoplankton and other impurities in the water were then removed zooplankton samples were transferred to 50 ml eppendorf tubes sealed frozen at 80 c in polypropylene and polystyrol containers and stored in a vacuum desiccator until further analysis long et al 2016 a binocular microscope olympus cx31 olympus corp was used to examine the purity of zooplankton samples for purity to ensure the absence of foreign particles samples for identification were operated to preserve in vials and then fixed with the use of a 4 formalin solution zooplankton species composing of copepoda cladocera and rotifera were identified by a bxt 90b dissecting microscope shanghai bingyu optical instrument co ltd china according to previous works jiang and du 1979 shen and song 1979 wang 1961 the body length in millimeters and shape were also measured by the same microscope and the mean value of 100 zooplankton individuals of the same species were used to calculate the taxa volume and biomass zooplankton biomass was calculated by converting individual measurement into shape related volume and then adjusted assuming that the specific gravity was equivalent to 1 mg fresh weight biomass zooplankton sample was stored at 18 c for the further analysis of antibiotics 2 3 extraction and data analysis the freeze dried samples of tsp phytoplankton and zooplankton were separately ground in a mortar followed by sieving to obtain homogeneous samples standardized dry weights were used consistently to measure antibiotic concentrations in these samples the targeted residues were extracted based on a slightly modified quechers methodology as previously described guo et al 2016 li et al 2019 tai et al 2019 details of the extraction and instrumental conditions can be found in the section 4 5 of the supplementary information dry weight d w in the individual plankton sample was measured to normalize the concentrations of antibiotics in this study the bioconcentration of antibiotics in phytoplankton was described by bioconcentration factor bcf which was defined as 1 bcf c p c f w where c p and c f w represent the concentration of antibiotics in phytoplankton ng g 1 d w and freely

antibiotics statistical significance was obtained if p value 0 05 analysis were carried out by using sigma plot v 14 0 systat software inc london uk or spss 17 spss inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 phytoplankton and zooplankton communities cyanophyta chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were the dominant phytoplankton phyla in the pearl river fig 2 the abundance of total phytoplankton showed significant spatial and temporal differences with the highest abundance 2 04 107 cells l 1 at site z3 in april 2017 while the lowest 1 11 106 cells l 1 was at site z3 in december 2016 fig 2a microcystis spp cyanobacteria scenedesmus spp chlorophyceae coscinodiscus and cyclotella spp coscinodiscophyceae and melosira including aulacoseira spp bacillariophyceae were prominent phytoplankton genera fig 2b these results were consistent with long et al 2019 the abundance of scenedesmus spps was low 1 29 104 cells l 1 at site z2 in november 2016 and was high 2 48 106 cells l 1 at site z1 in april 2017 fig 2b in terms of biomass diatom biomass was the highest ranging from 5 7 to 96 6 with a mean of 64 5 fig 2c cryptophyta contributed 0 3 38 7 mean 10 3 of the total biomass while the other phytoplankton with mean biomass below 10 fluctuated significantly during the entire study period the dominant planktonic diatom melosira spp had a higher biomass mean 1833 μg l 1 w w than the ecologically related cyclotella spp mean 385 μg l 1 w w fig 2d the dynamics biomass of total phytoplanktons in the water column of pearl river ranged from 0 60 to 10 46 mg l 1 w w fig s1 and had a significant positive correlation with the average temperature during the studied period fig s2a the zooplankton communities were represented by copepods cladocerans and rotifers which consisted of 6 4 and 7 genera respectively fig 3 rotifers were the most dominant component in the zooplankton community with mean abundance of 800 4 ind l 1 ranged from 98 0 to 2309 3 ind l 1 representing 96 8 of the total zooplankton abundance the dominant species b angularis contributed 5 0 52 1 mean 22 1 to the total abundance of rotifers fig 3a schmackeria forbesi poppe richard identified as pseudodiaptomus forbesi according to poppe richard walter et al 2006 limnoithona sinenisis burckhardt mesocyclops leuckarti claus and bosmina longirostris o f müller were common throughout the year fig 3b and c with mean biomass of 143 291 105 and 211 μg l 1 wet weight respectively fig 4 b and c themocyclops mongolicus kiefer was the dominant copepods between september 2016 and august 2017 and the values increased with increase in t breuifurcatus harada and other rotifers fig 3c the highest zooplankton abundance 2345 4 ind l 1 was found at site z1 in march 2017 in terms of biomass asplanchna priodonta gosse brachionus calyciflorus pallas keratella cochlearis gosse keratella valga ehrenberg and brachionus angularis gosse were the prominent rotifer species and the combined biomass contributed 35 3 of total zooplankton biomass fig 4a the biomass of diaphanosoma dubium manuilova changed significantly during mar 2017 daphnia pulex leydig was the predominant cladoceran but its biomass was significantly lower than that of b longirostris fig 4b the biomass of d dubium followed the same temporal rend as total biomass of all rotifers fig 5 b the biomass of copepods p tunguidus s forbesi t breuifurcatus m leuckarti and t mongolicus cladocerans d pulex and d dubium and rotifers were also followed the same temporal trend as the phytoplankton biomass fig 5c 3 2 annual occurrence of antibiotics in the water column ab 14 concentration in water phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp of the pearl river ranged from 32 10 to 10808 70 ng l 1 72 73 97803 58 ng g 1 0 9 13237 43 ng g 1 and 71 43 9416 67 ng g 1 respectively table 1 etm cfx and smz were the dominant antibiotics in these four compartments in the water column temporal variations of ab 14 were highly significant in water p 0 003 and in tsp p 0 001 while the spatial effects were not significant according to two way anova table s5 indicating that antibiotic pollution was more affected by time than location the total concentration of antibiotics in phytoplankton increased with increasing phytoplankton biomass fig s2c the annual mean absolute antibiotic concentration ab 14 in water columns of different sampling sites increased in the following order z4 1014 66 535 66 ng l 1 z5 1216 00 601 39 ng l 1 z1 1236 82 643 70 ng l 1 z3 1247 34 599 83 ng l 1 z2 1464 63 1075 91 ng l 1 which was consistent with the orders of annual mean plankton biomass and total phosphorus of these sites table s6 but independent of the proximity of these sites to urban areas the results indicated that ab 14 in these sites were enhanced by eutrophication this could be attributed to the fact that more eutrophicated water column has lower organic carbon turnover berglund et al 2001 the annual mean ab 14 in water freely dissolved doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were 726 72 487 67 418 42 312 14 28 17 18 61 10 92 6 68 and 51 66 34 16 ng l 1 accounting for 33 86 58 80 2 28 0 88 and 4 18 of the total ab 14 in the water column respectively the freely dissolved ab 14 increased with water column ph but ab 14 i n doc bound decreased with ph fig s4 the percentages of ab 14 partitioning in each compartment observed significant biphasic correlations with temperature fig 6 n 150 r2 0 110 0 400 p 0 001 biphasic correlations were also found between the percentages of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons partitioning in each compartment and the temperature according to tao et al 2018 the percentage of ab 14 in freely dissolved f d water was found to decrease with temperatures lower than 21 48 c while continued to rise with increases in temperatures contrastingly the percentages of ab 14 in other compartments showed inverse biphasic relationships with temperature fig 6 this may be attributed not only to the correlation between temperature and the dynamics of plankton biomass doc and tsp but also to the relationship of antibiotics equilibrium partitioning between water and other compartments it is clear that a river system is much more complex than standing water the temperature fluctuations recorded in the present river system coincide with changes in rainfall quantity in hong kong in 2016 and 2017 according to the available weather data http www hko gov hk cis climat c htm suggesting that the effect of temperature on the concentrations of antibiotics in this study was very likely due to riverine discharge the river discharge is also likely to affect concentrations and loads of individual antibiotics through various processes such as dilution first flush effects and hysteresis etc 3 3 evaluation of factors affecting the annual occurrence of the antibiotics although a positive relationship was found between ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass in the water column fig s2c the influencing factors on the occurrence of antibiotics in the water columns were different at different time the 1 year study period with different influencing factors were defined into four types i iv fig 7 the dynamics of a n t i b i o t i c s in doc bound phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were inverse to those in water during most of the investigated time type ii in fig 7 in addition correlations between temperature and the percentages of ab 14 in doc bound phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were observed to be inverse to that of water fig 6 according to the results the distribution of antibiotics in the water column was dominated by equilibrium partitioning between water and other compartments during most of the investigated periods from september to november both ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass decreased sharply in the water columns from 2346 04 1334 04 to 1093 85 391 02 ng l 1 and from 0 90 0 07 to 0 15 0 02 mg d w l 1 respectively type ii in fig 7 furthermore positive correlations were found between ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass in all compartments moreover the average temperature of this period was 21 42 5 48 c during this period the rapid decrease of phytoplankton biomass in the water column was caused by the settling and overwintering of phytoplankton therefore atmospheric deposition especially the settling of overwintering phytoplankton modulated the air water exchange dominating the occurrence of antibiotics in the water column during this period during the end of may and the beginning of july positive correlations were observed between freely dissolved ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass and ph of the water column while ab 14 in phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp showed the opposite correlations type iii in fig 7 this was due to the indirect influence of eutrophication as described in tao et al 2017b ph of the water column in the pearl river was consistent with changes of phytoplankton biomass that was modulated by water temperature figs s2a and b resulting in increased freely dissolved ab 14 and accordingly decreased ab 14 in doc bound fig s4 bcfs bafs and ktsp water of the antibiotics fig s5 this could be explained by the high ph deprotonating chemical groups leading to a surficial hydrophilicity increase in doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp tao et al 2017b the mean ph increased from 7 41 0 14 to 8 63 0 19 during the periods of beginning of march and the end of july consequently antibiotic accumulation adsorption capacity of doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was found to decrease contrastingly freely dissolved ab 14 increased during the investigated periods during the periods of beginning of january and end of february recruitment from surface sediments to water columns by phytoplankton was observed in the water column kong et al 2009 tao et al 2017a 2017b during this period the lowest concentration of ab 14 507 66 283 21 ng l 1 was observed type iv in fig 7 although biomass of phytoplankton was as high as 0 87 0 11 mg d w l 1 all the compartments contained low concentrations of ab 14 and were negatively correlated with phytoplankton biomass fig 7 more the average ph was only 7 04 0 14 with antibiotics still having high affinity to phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp fig s5 therefore the occurrence of antibiotics in mid january was possibly controlled by settling of phytoplankton derived organic matter depleting the freely dissolved antibiotics thus reducing the concentrations of antibiotics in other compartments 3 4 bioaccumulation and biomagnification of the antibiotics negative linear correlations were observed between logarithm concentration of antibiotics and the logarithm value of plankton biomass see section 7 in supplementary information significant biphasic correlations were observed between m p and logk d n 14 r2 0 315 p 0 001 fig 8 biphasic correlation was also observed between m p and the log kow of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons according to tao and liu 2019 the annual means range of log bcfs by phytoplankton and log bafs by zooplankton of the individual antibiotics were from 2 80 0 10 to 3 88 0 31 and from 1 96 0 29 to 5 58 0 34 respectively fig 9 log bcfs of the antibiotics decreased significantly with phytoplankton biomass fig s8 n 106 138 r2 0 102 0 218 p 0 001 significant negative linear relationships were also found between the bcfs of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phytoplankton biomass according to tao et al 2017c the annual mean bcfs and bafs of antibiotics for 5 sampling sites in the pearl river showed an increase in the following order z2 z3 z1 z5 z4 fig 9 which were negatively correlated with annual average phytoplankton biomass and total phosphorus concentrations fig s9 and table s6 annual mean phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass in sampling site z2 were 1 02 and 1 11 times higher than z4 table s6 respectively while both annual mean bcf and baf of antibiotics in z2 were 1 04 times lower than that in z4 fig s9 because of a lack of long term data sets little attention has been paid to the correlation between the bioaccumulation of contaminants and temperature in the field study tao et al 2017a significant biphasic correlations were observed between log bcfs and log bafs of the antibiotics and the average temperature t in these sites as shown in fig 10 n 150 r2 0 19 0 45 p 0 001 and fig 11 n 150 r2 0 17 0 60 p 0 001 biphasic correlations were also found between the log bcfs and the mean temperature t according to tao et al 2017a which were fitted by following parabolic equations 8 log bcf c 1 a 1 t b 1 t 2 9 log baf c 2 a 2 t b 2 t 2 the range of temperatures for the maximum log bcfs t m bcf of antibiotics was from 17 3 to 21 9 c fig 10 and decreased with the log d of the antibiotics except for smz sct and otc etm fig s10 the results suggested that bioaccumulation of antibiotics by phytoplankton and zooplanktons in pearl river was predominantly modulated by the biomass dilution effect similar findings on bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been observed in gaoping coastal waters hsieh et al 2019 four chinese subtropical lakes tao et al 2018 2017c the mean t m bcf was 19 5 c which was previously found to be associate with maximum abundance for cyanobacteria cao et al 2008 the cell density of cyanophyta was 6 60 106 cell l 1 at this temperature fig 2a the mean t m baf was calculated as 21 5 c which was previously found to be associate with maximum abundance for rotifera wang et al 2014 the density of rotifera was 2309 3 ind l 1 at this temperature fig 3a in this study strong relationship was observed between annual plankton bioaccumulated antibiotics and plankton phenology recruitments of plankton have shifted earlier due to global warming global warming is projected to be more pronounced in winter and spring and precipitation patterns will also shift seasonally piao et al 2010 which may alter plankton phenology structure and dynamics edwards and richardson 2004 walther et al 2002 and alter the seasonal occurrence and cycling of chemical pollutants in the water column as well bioaccumulation and biomagnification of chemical pollutants in the planktonic food web may be altered accordingly our study indicates that bcfs and bafs of the antibiotics in the planktonic food web are well correlated with the phenology of plankton which increase with the mean temperature only at lower temperatures but decrease with the mean temperature when it is higher than 19 5 c 21 5 c for phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively it may be ascribed to the direct effect of temperature on thermodynamics of bioaccumulation and the biodilution effect indirectly induced by temperature when temperature was lower than the plankton recruitment temperatures the rate constant for uptake ku by plankton was greater than the growth rate constant kg fan and reinfelder 2003 the direct effect of bioaccumulation thermodynamics induced by temperature thereby overwhelmed the biodilution effect contrastingly when temperature was higher than the plankton recruitment temperatures kg would be greater than ku and the bioaccumulation of the contaminants was dominated by the biomass dilution effect fan and reinfelder 2003 seasonal variations in species dominance and diversity would lead to variations in surface area cell volume ratios thus affecting the adsorption properties of plankton to antibiotics cell volume determines the accumulation of organic pollutants in phytoplankton as small cells with higher surface area to volume ratios would have a higher capability to adsorb and absorb organic contaminants onto cell surface and into the cells respectively del vento and dachs 2002 previous studies found that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs bioaccumulated by plankton involved both surface adsorption and interior absorption processes fan and reinfelder 2003 tao et al 2015 in the present study sulfamethoxazole smx norfloxacin nfx erythromycin etm and roxithromycin rtm concentrations in phytoplankton increased with biomass growth of bacillariophyta statistically significant spearman correlations were observed between the concentrations of the target compounds and biomass of bacillariophyta for smx r 0 802 n 60 p 0 001 nfx r 0 795 n 60 p 0 001 etm r 0 805 n 60 p 0 001 and rtm r 0 796 n 60 p 0 001 significant negative correlations were found between log cp and log bp fig s6 as well as between log cz and log bz fig s7 suggesting that the bioaccumulation of antibiotics by phytoplankton and zooplankton was dominated by interior absorption which is consistent with del vento and dachs 2002 the annual mean log bmfs of the antibiotics ranged from 1 91 0 29 to 2 25 0 43 fig 9 the biomagnification in planktonic food webs was found for sulfacetamide ciprofloxacin lomefloxacin oxytetracycline and tetracycline in all sites of the pearl river fig 9 the annual mean log bmfs of the individual antibiotics in each site increased in the following order z4 z5 z1 z3 z2 and was found to be consistent with the total phosphorus concentration levels in these sites fig s9 and table s6 contrastingly investigation of mercury bioaccumulation in the northeast usa by chen and folt 2005 indicated that the biomagnification of mercury decreased due to high plankton densities in the present study phytoplankton biomass enhanced the annual trophic transfer of antibiotics in planktonic food webs in these sites fig s11 this could be caused by atmospheric deposition rapidly compensating the large pool of contaminants in the water column he et al 2014 tao et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2013 and desorption from sediments resulting from the shallow depths of these areas rotifers copepods and cladocerans were direct or indirect predators of phytoplankton in the pearl river as confirmed by the positive correlation between the biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton fig s3 it was observed that annual mean bmfs of cfx ofx otc tc ranged between 0 18 and 2 25 implying these chemicals could undergo biomagnification along planktonic food webs fig s12 moreover the biomagnification of spd sct and lfx was observed in the planktonic food webs only during algal bloom periods this might be due to the fact that the peaks of rotifera copepoda and cladocera biomass mean 1 68 0 89 mg w w l 1 lag behind those of phytoplankton biomass mean 3 32 1 81 mg w w l 1 p 0 001 t test fig s1 the biomass dilution effect on the bioaccumulation of phytoplankton antibiotics was greater than that of zooplankton during algal bloom periods in contrast to log bcf and log baf the mean log bmfs of the individual antibiotics were positively correlated with temperature fig s13 indicating that temperature enhanced the annual trophic transfer of antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton dominated by rotifers copepods and cladocerans in the pearl river 4 conclusions this study investigated biogeochemical and physical factors effecting annual occurrence bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of 14 antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton in a subtropical river results indicated that total phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass in the river enhanced the annual mean ab 14 in the water column which was independent on the proximity to urban areas occurrence and bioaccumulation of antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton were dominated by a biomass dilution effect annual occurrence of antibiotics in the water column was modulated not only by the role of the biological pump but also the equilibrium partitioning behaviour and the indirect influence of total phosphorus the bcfs and bafs of antibiotics were biphasically correlated with temperature which was related to plankton phenology trophic transfer of antibiotics in planktonic food webs increased with phytoplankton biomass and temperature annual mean bmfs of cfx ofx otc and tc ranged from 0 18 to 2 25 implying these chemicals could undergo biomagnification along planktonic food webs moreover the biomagnification of spd sct and lfx along planktonic food webs only occurred during algal bloom periods our study highlights the importance of considering biogeochemical and physical factors as fundamental elements in understanding the fate of antibiotics in planktonic food webs of subtropical

18248,biological pump is important to control the fate and distribution of organic contaminants particularly in temperate and cold oligotrophic waters however it remains largely unknown how factors affect the long term occurrence and fate of ionogenic organic compounds in subtropical eutrophic waters the present study aimed to assess biogeochemical and physical factors affecting the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of 14 antibiotics through planktonic food webs in the pearl river a large subtropical eutrophic river in china this was done by carrying out 1 year simultaneous field observations of antibiotic concentrations in five water column compartments and assessing the variability of bioconcentration bcf bioaccumulation baf and biomagnification bmf factors which were influenced by plankton biomass ph and temperature of water columns the annual mean antibiotic concentration per site ranged from 1014 66 535 66 ng l 1 to 1464 63 1075 91 ng l 1 and was positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass but independent of the proximity of the sites to urban areas antibiotic occurrences in both phytoplankton and zooplankton were greatly influenced by a biodilution effect the annual occurrence of antibiotics in the water column was modulated by biological pumps as well as their equilibrium partitioning and indirectly influenced of eutrophication with ph increased with phytoplankton biomass and phytoplankton life cycling baf of antibiotics by plankton had biphasic correlations with temperature n 150 r2 0 17 0 60 p 0 001 and decreased with plankton biomass n 105 147 r2 0 10 0 22 p 0 001 the trophic transfer of antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton bmfs were positively correlated with both phytoplankton biomass n 30 r2 0 58 p 0

biomagnification along planktonic food webs the present research demonstrates the important role of biogeochemical and physical factors in the environmental fate of antibiotics at large spatiotemporal scales keywords antibiotics planktonic food webs bioaccumulation trophic transfer eutrophic river biological pump 1 introduction antibiotics have been recognized as the main emerging environmental pollutants in aquatic environments since they are continuously released into the environment and biomagnified in marine food webs and global concern about their potential adverse effects on the ecosystem and human health is consequently growing boonsaner and hawker 2013 liu et al 2017 richmond et al 2018 phytoplankton and zooplankton as the primary producer and primary predator respectively are important to influence the energy flow and the carbon cycling in aquatic environments the first two steps for antibiotics to enter the food web are bioaccumulation and trophic transfer through planktonic food webs it is necessary to clarify and quantify the factors affecting the occurrence and fate of organic contaminants in the planktonic food web to better understand and eliminate the risk of contaminants in the water environment nizzetto et al 2012 tao et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 antibiotics are ingested by phytoplankton and subsequently transferred to higher trophic levels biotas or to deeper water and sediment by phytoplankton derived organic matter which is one of the fundamental mechanisms for the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in the aquatic environment bai et al 2017 wilson et al 2004 phytoplankton deplete pollutants dissolved in water columns when they bloom leading to the decreased concentrations of pollutants in aquatic biota but enhance their air water exchange fluxes sink fluxes and solids in sediments everaert et al 2015 nizzetto et al 2012 the sequestration of contaminants from the water column is determined by the biogeochemical process known as biological pump which has been intensively examined in space e g along the navigational route of a research vessel in oceans in one growth season berrojalbiz et al 2011a 2011b casal et al 2017 morales et al 2015 contrastingly there are less empirical studies on the work of biological pumps on the temporal scale the most frequently detected ciprofloxacin cfx have been used to investigate effects on freshwater plankton communities and results showed that even low concentration 7 μg l 1 have unexpected effects on the taxonomy and function of a plankton community and the effect was more significant on eukaryotic than bacterial communities while cyanobacteria may strengthen their two component regulatory system and the photosystem to cope with cfx lu et al 2019 the correlation between the sulfamethazine smz induced feeding depression and body size reduction in zooplankton has been explored on a time scale of exposure post exposure and re exposure periods and results demonstrate that smz can influence neurotransmission inhibit digestive enzyme activity leading to body size reduction in rotifer brachionus calyciflorus yan et al 2019 gorokhova et al 2015 reported that trimethoprim tmp may impact daphnia magna via changes in their microbiota and concomitant changes in the host feeding resulting in compromised nutrition and growth ultimately all these studies provided very valuable information on the spatiotemporal occurrence and fate of antibiotics mostly in several tropical and subtropical regions china is the largest producer and user of antibiotics in the world sulfonamides and macrolides due to their low price and high efficiency have been widely used for treating human and animal diseases as well as for promoting growth in livestock and aquaculture tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin nfx and ciprofloxacin cfx are largely consumed by pig as antibacterial agents in china zhang et al 2015 and approximately 10 90 of the administered antibiotics are excreted into river environments tang et al 2019 xie et al 2019 due to the rapid development in china most rivers are currently polluted by antibiotics with antibiotic concentrations in river water and sediments ranged from 0 1 ng l 1 to 1 0 μg l 1 and 0 1 ng g 1 to 1 0 μg g 1 respectively li et al 2018a zhao et al 2016 in the pearl river anhydrous erythromycin etm ranged from 0 to 1540 ng l 1 with mean 63 ng l 1 is predominantly higher than that of other antibiotics except norfloxacin nfx as etm is one of the most widely used antibiotics in china with usage of 3 77 million kg in year 2013 zhang et al 2015 risk assessment has revealed that antibiotic pollution posed a high risk to algae in the pearl river delta li et al 2018b xie et al 2019 xu et al 2013 in the subtropical aquatic environment of china the hydrochemistry and circulation of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and pollutants are changing fast and the background level of antibiotics in waters increased because of increase in annual average water temperatures and plankton biomass le page et al 2018 mei et al 2018 peng et al 2008 xie et al 2019 leading to different results from previous studies in oligotrophic waters to the best of our knowledge little attention has been paid to the long term occurrence and fate of antibiotics in the planktonic food web of subtropical rivers in china due to a lack of field observations the principal aims of this research are i to report concentration levels of 14 antibiotics in five compartments of the water column water total suspended particles tsp dissolved organic carbon phytoplankton and zooplankton at five sampling sites following a 1 year data set of continuous monitoring ii to evaluate and discuss the effects of biogeochemical and physical factors on the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of antibiotics in planktonic food webs in the pearl river a large subtropical eutrophic river in south china 2 materials

obtained from the shanghai anpel laboratory technologies inc shanghai china 2 2 study area sample collection and analyses 2 2 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river in china and flows through the central city of guangzhou one of the most densely populated industrial cities in china fig 1 five sampling sites z1 z5 were chosen from upstream to the estuary along the main stream of the pearl river as described by fan et al 2019 z1 was located in the downstream of liuxi river z2 in the upstream rural areas z3 in the midstream urban reaches that flow through guangzhou city z4 in the downstream industrial belt surrounded by docks and factories and z5 near the estuary of the south china sea fig 1 sampling campaigns were performed simultaneously every twelve days from september 2016 to september 2017 a total of 30 sampling campaigns were performed at each sampling site water total suspended particles tsp phytoplankton and zooplankton sampling were conducted simultaneously during each sampling campaign detailed information describing of study area environmental sampling and the physical and chemical characteristics in water column can be found in tables s2 s3 and the section 1 3 of supplementary information 2 2 2 phytoplankton sampling and analyses to analyze the composition abundance and biomass of phytoplankton community 2 l of surface water 0 30 cm was collected at each sampling site long et al 2019 tao et al 2017b 2017c lugol s iodine was added to the filtrate containing phytoplankton sample for preservation settled for 48 h and concentrated to 30 ml the phytoplankton species was identified according to hu et al 1980 the cell density of each species was counted by a sedgwick rafter counting chamber pyser sgi limited uk using a light microscope olympus cx31 olympus corp at magnifications between 200 and 400 and the cell size was also measured by the same microscope olympus cx31 olympus corp the total biovolume of each species was calculated based on the cell number and cell size the amount of biomass was obtained by converting the cell volumes from the cell shape of each species into biomass assuming that 1 mm3 was equivalent to 1 mg fresh weight biomass according to pápista et al 2002 the remaining phytoplankton samples were freeze dried weighted and stored at 18 c for further analysis of antibiotics 2 2 3 zooplankton sampling and analyses at each sampling site large quantities of zooplanktons were collected by multiple tows from 0 5 m above the bottom to water surface each tow was equipped with a 160 μm nylon mesh net according to long et al 2019 zooplankton sample from each tow was transferred into a 20 l sample bottle tows were repeated at the same sampling site and zooplankton samples from different tows were pooled together until the estimated dry weight of the zooplankton sample was larger than 3 0 g the zooplankton sample in the bottle was cleaned by placing it statically for 20 min and the particulate matter at the bottom was removed formaldehyde reagent was added to fix the sample and the dead zooplanktons were settled at the bottom of the bottle the remaining suspended solids phytoplanktons and soluble organic matter in the water were removed the dead zooplankton was then placed into a 100 ml measuring cylinder and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water settling for 20 min dead phytoplankton and other impurities in the water were then removed zooplankton samples were transferred to 50 ml eppendorf tubes sealed frozen at 80 c in polypropylene and polystyrol containers and stored in a vacuum desiccator until further analysis long et al 2016 a binocular microscope olympus cx31 olympus corp was used to examine the purity of zooplankton samples for purity to ensure the absence of foreign particles samples for identification were operated to preserve in vials and then fixed with the use of a 4 formalin solution zooplankton species composing of copepoda cladocera and rotifera were identified by a bxt 90b dissecting microscope shanghai bingyu optical instrument co ltd china according to previous works jiang and du 1979 shen and song 1979 wang 1961 the body length in millimeters and shape were also measured by the same microscope and the mean value of 100 zooplankton individuals of the same species were used to calculate the taxa volume and biomass zooplankton biomass was calculated by converting individual measurement into shape related volume and then adjusted assuming that the specific gravity was equivalent to 1 mg fresh weight biomass zooplankton sample was stored at 18 c for the further analysis of antibiotics 2 3 extraction and data analysis the freeze dried samples of tsp phytoplankton and zooplankton were separately ground in a mortar followed by sieving to obtain homogeneous samples standardized dry weights were used consistently to measure antibiotic concentrations in these samples the targeted residues were extracted based on a slightly modified quechers methodology as previously described guo et al 2016 li et al 2019 tai et al 2019 details of the extraction and instrumental conditions can be found in the section 4 5 of the supplementary information dry weight d w in the individual plankton sample was measured to normalize the concentrations of antibiotics in this study the bioconcentration of antibiotics in phytoplankton was described by bioconcentration factor bcf which was defined as 1 bcf c p c f w where c p and c f w represent the concentration of antibiotics in phytoplankton ng g 1 d w and freely

among 1 year and site 5 sampling sites as the two fixed factors were conducted to explore spatiotemporal patterns in the concentration level of individual antibiotic and the total amount of all antibiotics statistical significance was obtained if p value 0 05 analysis were carried out by using sigma plot v 14 0 systat software inc london uk or spss 17 spss inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 phytoplankton and zooplankton communities cyanophyta chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were the dominant phytoplankton phyla in the pearl river fig 2 the abundance of total phytoplankton showed significant spatial and temporal differences with the highest abundance 2 04 107 cells l 1 at site z3 in april 2017 while the lowest 1 11 106 cells l 1 was at site z3 in december 2016 fig 2a microcystis spp cyanobacteria scenedesmus spp chlorophyceae coscinodiscus and cyclotella spp coscinodiscophyceae and melosira including aulacoseira spp bacillariophyceae were prominent phytoplankton genera fig 2b these results were consistent with long et al 2019 the abundance of scenedesmus spps was low 1 29 104 cells l 1 at site z2 in november 2016 and was high 2 48 106 cells l 1 at site z1 in april 2017 fig 2b in terms of biomass diatom biomass was the highest ranging from 5 7 to 96 6 with a mean of 64 5 fig 2c cryptophyta contributed 0 3 38 7 mean 10 3 of the total biomass while the other phytoplankton with mean biomass below 10 fluctuated significantly during the entire study period the dominant planktonic diatom melosira spp had a higher biomass mean 1833 μg l 1 w w than the ecologically related cyclotella spp mean 385 μg l 1 w w fig 2d the dynamics biomass of total phytoplanktons in the water column of pearl river ranged from 0 60 to 10 46 mg l 1 w w fig s1 and had a significant positive correlation with the average temperature during the studied period fig s2a the zooplankton communities were represented by copepods cladocerans and rotifers which consisted of 6 4 and 7 genera respectively fig 3 rotifers were the most dominant component in the zooplankton community with mean abundance of 800 4 ind l 1 ranged from 98 0 to 2309 3 ind l 1 representing 96 8 of the total zooplankton abundance the dominant species b angularis contributed 5 0 52 1 mean 22 1 to the total abundance of rotifers fig 3a schmackeria forbesi poppe richard identified as pseudodiaptomus forbesi according to poppe richard walter et al 2006 limnoithona sinenisis burckhardt mesocyclops leuckarti claus and bosmina longirostris o f müller were common throughout the year fig 3b and c with mean biomass of 143 291 105 and 211 μg l 1 wet weight respectively fig 4 b and c themocyclops mongolicus kiefer was the dominant copepods between september 2016 and august 2017 and the values increased with increase in t breuifurcatus harada and other rotifers fig 3c the highest zooplankton abundance 2345 4 ind l 1 was found at site z1 in march 2017 in terms of biomass asplanchna priodonta gosse brachionus calyciflorus pallas keratella cochlearis gosse keratella valga ehrenberg and brachionus angularis gosse were the prominent rotifer species and the combined biomass contributed 35 3 of total zooplankton biomass fig 4a the biomass of diaphanosoma dubium manuilova changed significantly during mar 2017 daphnia pulex leydig was the predominant cladoceran but its biomass was significantly lower than that of b longirostris fig 4b the biomass of d dubium followed the same temporal rend as total biomass of all rotifers fig 5 b the biomass of copepods p tunguidus s forbesi t breuifurcatus m leuckarti and t mongolicus cladocerans d pulex and d dubium and rotifers were also followed the same temporal trend as the phytoplankton biomass fig 5c 3 2 annual occurrence of antibiotics in the water column ab 14 concentration in water phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp of the pearl river ranged from 32 10 to 10808 70 ng l 1 72 73 97803 58 ng g 1 0 9 13237 43 ng g 1 and 71 43 9416 67 ng g 1 respectively table 1 etm cfx and smz were the dominant antibiotics in these four compartments in the water column temporal variations of ab 14 were highly significant in water p 0 003 and in tsp p 0 001 while the spatial effects were not significant according to two way anova table s5 indicating that antibiotic pollution was more affected by time than location the total concentration of antibiotics in phytoplankton increased with increasing phytoplankton biomass fig s2c the annual mean absolute antibiotic concentration ab 14 in water columns of different sampling sites increased in the following order z4 1014 66 535 66 ng l 1 z5 1216 00 601 39 ng l 1 z1 1236 82 643 70 ng l 1 z3 1247 34 599 83 ng l 1 z2 1464 63 1075 91 ng l 1 which was consistent with the orders of annual mean plankton biomass and total phosphorus of these sites table s6 but independent of the proximity of these sites to urban areas the results indicated that ab 14 in these sites were enhanced by eutrophication this could be attributed to the fact that more eutrophicated water column has lower organic carbon turnover berglund et al 2001 the annual mean ab 14 in water freely dissolved doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were 726 72 487 67 418 42 312 14 28 17 18 61 10 92 6 68 and 51 66 34 16 ng l 1 accounting for 33 86 58 80 2 28 0 88 and 4 18 of the total ab 14 in the water column respectively the freely dissolved ab 14 increased with water column ph but ab 14 i n doc bound decreased with ph fig s4 the percentages of ab 14 partitioning in each compartment observed significant biphasic correlations with temperature fig 6 n 150 r2 0 110 0 400 p 0 001 biphasic correlations were also found between the percentages of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons partitioning in each compartment and the temperature according to tao et al 2018 the percentage of ab 14 in freely dissolved f d water was found to decrease with temperatures lower than 21 48 c while continued to rise with increases in temperatures contrastingly the percentages of ab 14 in other compartments showed inverse biphasic relationships with temperature fig 6 this may be attributed not only to the correlation between temperature and the dynamics of plankton biomass doc and tsp but also to the relationship of antibiotics equilibrium partitioning between water and other compartments it is clear that a river system is much more complex than standing water the temperature fluctuations recorded in the present river system coincide with changes in rainfall quantity in hong kong in 2016 and 2017 according to the available weather data http www hko gov hk cis climat c htm suggesting that the effect of temperature on the concentrations of antibiotics in this study was very likely due to riverine discharge the river discharge is also likely to affect concentrations and loads of individual antibiotics through various processes such as dilution first flush effects and hysteresis etc 3 3 evaluation of factors affecting the annual occurrence of the antibiotics although a positive relationship was found between ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass in the water column fig s2c the influencing factors on the occurrence of antibiotics in the water columns were different at different time the 1 year study period with different influencing factors were defined into four types i iv fig 7 the dynamics of a n t i b i o t i c s in doc bound phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were inverse to those in water during most of the investigated time type ii in fig 7 in addition correlations between temperature and the percentages of ab 14 in doc bound phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were observed to be inverse to that of water fig 6 according to the results the distribution of antibiotics in the water column was dominated by equilibrium partitioning between water and other compartments during most of the investigated periods from september to november both ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass decreased sharply in the water columns from 2346 04 1334 04 to 1093 85 391 02 ng l 1 and from 0 90 0 07 to 0 15 0 02 mg d w l 1 respectively type ii in fig 7 furthermore positive correlations were found between ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass in all compartments moreover the average temperature of this period was 21 42 5 48 c during this period the rapid decrease of phytoplankton biomass in the water column was caused by the settling and overwintering of phytoplankton therefore atmospheric deposition especially the settling of overwintering phytoplankton modulated the air water exchange dominating the occurrence of antibiotics in the water column during this period during the end of may and the beginning of july positive correlations were observed between freely dissolved ab 14 and phytoplankton biomass and ph of the water column while ab 14 in phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp showed the opposite correlations type iii in fig 7 this was due to the indirect influence of eutrophication as described in tao et al 2017b ph of the water column in the pearl river was consistent with changes of phytoplankton biomass that was modulated by water temperature figs s2a and b resulting in increased freely dissolved ab 14 and accordingly decreased ab 14 in doc bound fig s4 bcfs bafs and ktsp water of the antibiotics fig s5 this could be explained by the high ph deprotonating chemical groups leading to a surficial hydrophilicity increase in doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp tao et al 2017b the mean ph increased from 7 41 0 14 to 8 63 0 19 during the periods of beginning of march and the end of july consequently antibiotic accumulation adsorption capacity of doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was found to decrease contrastingly freely dissolved ab 14 increased during the investigated periods during the periods of beginning of january and end of february recruitment from surface sediments to water columns by phytoplankton was observed in the water column kong et al 2009 tao et al 2017a 2017b during this period the lowest concentration of ab 14 507 66 283 21 ng l 1 was observed type iv in fig 7 although biomass of phytoplankton was as high as 0 87 0 11 mg d w l 1 all the compartments contained low concentrations of ab 14 and were negatively correlated with phytoplankton biomass fig 7 more the average ph was only 7 04 0 14 with antibiotics still having high affinity to phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp fig s5 therefore the occurrence of antibiotics in mid january was possibly controlled by settling of phytoplankton derived organic matter depleting the freely dissolved antibiotics thus reducing the concentrations of antibiotics in other compartments 3 4 bioaccumulation and biomagnification of the antibiotics negative linear correlations were observed between logarithm concentration of antibiotics and the logarithm value of plankton biomass see section 7 in supplementary information significant biphasic correlations were observed between m p and logk d n 14 r2 0 315 p 0 001 fig 8 biphasic correlation was also observed between m p and the log kow of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons according to tao and liu 2019 the annual means range of log bcfs by phytoplankton and log bafs by zooplankton of the individual antibiotics were from 2 80 0 10 to 3 88 0 31 and from 1 96 0 29 to 5 58 0 34 respectively fig 9 log bcfs of the antibiotics decreased significantly with phytoplankton biomass fig s8 n 106 138 r2 0 102 0 218 p 0 001 significant negative linear relationships were also found between the bcfs of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phytoplankton biomass according to tao et al 2017c the annual mean bcfs and bafs of antibiotics for 5 sampling sites in the pearl river showed an increase in the following order z2 z3 z1 z5 z4 fig 9 which were negatively correlated with annual average phytoplankton biomass and total phosphorus concentrations fig s9 and table s6 annual mean phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass in sampling site z2 were 1 02 and 1 11 times higher than z4 table s6 respectively while both annual mean bcf and baf of antibiotics in z2 were 1 04 times lower than that in z4 fig s9 because of a lack of long term data sets little attention has been paid to the correlation between the bioaccumulation of contaminants and temperature in the field study tao et al 2017a significant biphasic correlations were observed between log bcfs and log bafs of the antibiotics and the average temperature t in these sites as shown in fig 10 n 150 r2 0 19 0 45 p 0 001 and fig 11 n 150 r2 0 17 0 60 p 0 001 biphasic correlations were also found between the log bcfs and the mean temperature t according to tao et al 2017a which were fitted by following parabolic equations 8 log bcf c 1 a 1 t b 1 t 2 9 log baf c 2 a 2 t b 2 t 2 the range of temperatures for the maximum log bcfs t m bcf of antibiotics was from 17 3 to 21 9 c fig 10 and decreased with the log d of the antibiotics except for smz sct and otc etm fig s10 the results suggested that bioaccumulation of antibiotics by phytoplankton and zooplanktons in pearl river was predominantly modulated by the biomass dilution effect similar findings on bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been observed in gaoping coastal waters hsieh et al 2019 four chinese subtropical lakes tao et al 2018 2017c the mean t m bcf was 19 5 c which was previously found to be associate with maximum abundance for cyanobacteria cao et al 2008 the cell density of cyanophyta was 6 60 106 cell l 1 at this temperature fig 2a the mean t m baf was calculated as 21 5 c which was previously found to be associate with maximum abundance for rotifera wang et al 2014 the density of rotifera was 2309 3 ind l 1 at this temperature fig 3a in this study strong relationship was observed between annual plankton bioaccumulated antibiotics and plankton phenology recruitments of plankton have shifted earlier due to global warming global warming is projected to be more pronounced in winter and spring and precipitation patterns will also shift seasonally piao et al 2010 which may alter plankton phenology structure and dynamics edwards and richardson 2004 walther et al 2002 and alter the seasonal occurrence and cycling of chemical pollutants in the water column as well bioaccumulation and biomagnification of chemical pollutants in the planktonic food web may be altered accordingly our study indicates that bcfs and bafs of the antibiotics in the planktonic food web are well correlated with the phenology of plankton which increase with the mean temperature only at lower temperatures but decrease with the mean temperature when it is higher than 19 5 c 21 5 c for phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively it may be ascribed to the direct effect of temperature on thermodynamics of bioaccumulation and the biodilution effect indirectly induced by temperature when temperature was lower than the plankton recruitment temperatures the rate constant for uptake ku by plankton was greater than the growth rate constant kg fan and reinfelder 2003 the direct effect of bioaccumulation thermodynamics induced by temperature thereby overwhelmed the biodilution effect contrastingly when temperature was higher than the plankton recruitment temperatures kg would be greater than ku and the bioaccumulation of the contaminants was dominated by the biomass dilution effect fan and reinfelder 2003 seasonal variations in species dominance and diversity would lead to variations in surface area cell volume ratios thus affecting the adsorption properties of plankton to antibiotics cell volume determines the accumulation of organic pollutants in phytoplankton as small cells with higher surface area to volume ratios would have a higher capability to adsorb and absorb organic contaminants onto cell surface and into the cells respectively del vento and dachs 2002 previous studies found that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs bioaccumulated by plankton involved both surface adsorption and interior absorption processes fan and reinfelder 2003 tao et al 2015 in the present study sulfamethoxazole smx norfloxacin nfx erythromycin etm and roxithromycin rtm concentrations in phytoplankton increased with biomass growth of bacillariophyta statistically significant spearman correlations were observed between the concentrations of the target compounds and biomass of bacillariophyta for smx r 0 802 n 60 p 0 001 nfx r 0 795 n 60 p 0 001 etm r 0 805 n 60 p 0 001 and rtm r 0 796 n 60 p 0 001 significant negative correlations were found between log cp and log bp fig s6 as well as between log cz and log bz fig s7 suggesting that the bioaccumulation of antibiotics by phytoplankton and zooplankton was dominated by interior absorption which is consistent with del vento and dachs 2002 the annual mean log bmfs of the antibiotics ranged from 1 91 0 29 to 2 25 0 43 fig 9 the biomagnification in planktonic food webs was found for sulfacetamide ciprofloxacin lomefloxacin oxytetracycline and tetracycline in all sites of the pearl river fig 9 the annual mean log bmfs of the individual antibiotics in each site increased in the following order z4 z5 z1 z3 z2 and was found to be consistent with the total phosphorus concentration levels in these sites fig s9 and table s6 contrastingly investigation of mercury bioaccumulation in the northeast usa by chen and folt 2005 indicated that the biomagnification of mercury decreased due to high plankton densities in the present study phytoplankton biomass enhanced the annual trophic transfer of antibiotics in planktonic food webs in these sites fig s11 this could be caused by atmospheric deposition rapidly compensating the large pool of contaminants in the water column he et al 2014 tao et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2013 and desorption from sediments resulting from the shallow depths of these areas rotifers copepods and cladocerans were direct or indirect predators of phytoplankton in the pearl river as confirmed by the positive correlation between the biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton fig s3 it was observed that annual mean bmfs of cfx ofx otc tc ranged between 0 18 and 2 25 implying these chemicals could undergo biomagnification along planktonic food webs fig s12 moreover the biomagnification of spd sct and lfx was observed in the planktonic food webs only during algal bloom periods this might be due to the fact that the peaks of rotifera copepoda and cladocera biomass mean 1 68 0 89 mg w w l 1 lag behind those of phytoplankton biomass mean 3 32 1 81 mg w w l 1 p 0 001 t test fig s1 the biomass dilution effect on the bioaccumulation of phytoplankton antibiotics was greater than that of zooplankton during algal bloom periods in contrast to log bcf and log baf the mean log bmfs of the individual antibiotics were positively correlated with temperature fig s13 indicating that temperature enhanced the annual trophic transfer of antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton dominated by rotifers copepods and cladocerans in the pearl river 4 conclusions this study investigated biogeochemical and physical factors effecting annual occurrence bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of 14 antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton in a subtropical river results indicated that total phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass in the river enhanced the annual mean ab 14 in the water column which was independent on the proximity to urban areas occurrence and bioaccumulation of antibiotics from phytoplankton to zooplankton were dominated by a biomass dilution effect annual occurrence of antibiotics in the water column was modulated not only by the role of the biological pump but also the equilibrium partitioning behaviour and the indirect influence of total phosphorus the bcfs and bafs of antibiotics were biphasically correlated with temperature which was related to plankton phenology trophic transfer of antibiotics in planktonic food webs increased with phytoplankton biomass and temperature annual mean bmfs of cfx ofx otc and tc ranged from 0 18 to 2 25 implying these chemicals could undergo biomagnification along planktonic food webs moreover the biomagnification of spd sct and lfx along planktonic food webs only occurred during algal bloom periods our study highlights the importance of considering biogeochemical and physical factors as fundamental elements in understanding the fate of antibiotics in planktonic food webs of subtropical

18249,autotrophic iron dependent denitrification aidd is arising as a promising process for nitrogen removal from wastewater with a low carbon to nitrogen ratio however there is still a debate about the existence of such a process in activated sludge systems this work provides evidence and elucidated the feasibility of autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture for nitrogen removal by long term reactor operation batch experimental verification unstructured kinetic modeling and microbial community analyses a relatively stable nitrate removal rate was achieved coupled with the oxidation of ferrous ions in 3 month operation of reactor the kinetic modeling suggests that the iron oxidation was a growth associated process in aidd utilization of extracellular polymeric substances and or soluble microbial products as electron donor for denitrification by heterotrophic denitrifiers was not mainly responsible for nitrogen removal in the reactor after long term operation of the reactor with activated sludge as inoculum the enrichment culture ks like consortium dominated by fe ii oxidizer gallionellaceae was successfully acclimated for autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction this work extents our understanding about the existence of such an autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture in both natural and engineered systems and opens a door for its potential application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge autotrophic iron dependent denitrification aidd gallionellaceae kinetic modeling wastewater treatment 1 introduction recently autotrophic denitrification has gradually become an acceptable alternative for conventional heterotrophic denitrification to treat wastewater with a low carbon to nitrogen ratio di capua et al 2015 wei et al 2017 autotrophic denitrification has no demand for external organic carbon source and can utilize inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfur reduced compounds ferrous iron and solid phase fe ii etc as electron donor for complete nitrogen removal di capua et al 2015 weber et al 2001 zhang et al 2014 among the inorganic electron donor available for autotrophic denitrification zero valent and ferrous iron hold promise to achieve wide application compared with hydrogen and sulfide autotrophic iron dependent denitrification aidd shows attractive characteristics e g high safety for storage and transportation and low cost kiskira et al 2017 in addition the produced ferric iron could serve as coagulants and adsorbents to remove phosphate li et al 2014a b zhang et al 2015 and heavy metals such as as and ni hohmann et al 2010 schmid et al 2016 sun et al 2016 microbially driven aidd was first proposed by straub et al who observed the simultaneous fe ii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction reaction 1 straub et al 1996 this process and its significance in fe n cycling in subsurface environments such as aquifers jessen et al 2017 smith et al 2017 soils li et al 2016 ratering and schnell 2001 and sediments laufer et al 2016 weber et al 2006 have been intensively studied although knowledge gaps of the mechanisms such as enzymes responsible for fe ii oxidation and electron transfer pathways among different components remain to be addressed bryce et al 2018 the application of the aidd process has been explored and reported to be a prospective process to remove nitrate from wastewater wang et al 2015 2017 zhang et al 2014 2015 in these studies activated sludge was used as initial inoculum to achieve potential aidd and further bioaugmentation by supplementing heterotrophic denitrifying sludge was also explored wang et al 2015 1 10fe ii 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h however so far there is no clear and convincing evidence to prove that the observed fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction in these studies is an exclusive microbially driven autotrophic process to determine whether a strain or culture involved in fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction is autotrophic four strict criteria should be met i no demand for organic carbon source ii growth with only fe ii nitrate and co2 provided iii maintain fe ii oxidation activity over several transfers and iv uptake and incorporate co2 into biomass bryce et al 2018 although bicarbonate was used as the sole carbon source in the operation of aidd reactors the contribution of heterotrophic denitrifiers to the fe ii oxidation cannot be fully ruled out in these studies because the extracellular polymeric substances eps and or soluble microbial products smp produced by autotrophs might be used as an electron donor for nitrate reduction by heterotrophic denitrifiers kindaichi et al 2004 ni et al 2011 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 abiotic oxidation of fe ii by reactive nitrogen species e g nitrite produced in denitrification reaction 2 has induced the controversy about the existence of enzymatic fe ii oxidation involved in the mixotrophic metabolisms bryce et al 2018 etique et al 2014 klueglein et al 2014 klueglein and kappler 2013 recently model based kinetic studies have suggested the co existence of chemical and biological fe ii oxidation in several fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing strains jamieson et al 2018 liu et al 2018 thus considering the key role of nitrite in chemical oxidation of fe ii the microbially mediated fe ii oxidation by using the heat inactivated sludge nielsen and nielsen 1998 weber et al 2006 xiu et al 2016 or without sludge as controls blöthe and roden 2009 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 should be re evaluated because of nitrite deficiency under such experimental conditions 2 4fe ii 2no2 9h2o 4fe oh 3 n2o 6h another concern is the development of the microbial community who is capable of autotrophic fe ii oxidation and nitrate reduction the enrichment culture ks named after k straub originally isolated from a freshwater sediment is the only convincingly demonstrated autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture to date bryce et al 2018 he et al 2016 straub et al 1996 tominski et al 2018a such a chemolithoautotrophic co culture consists of strains from the family of gallionellaceae as the dominant bacteria capable of oxidizing fe ii and a flanking community including several species of denitrifiers like comamonadaceae rhodanobacter polaromonas and etc bryce et al 2018 whether such a functional culture could be obtained from activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants remains unknown therefore the main objective of this work was to explore the feasibility of achieving microbially mediated aidd using activated sludge as inoculum and to identify the corresponding microbial community long term reactor operation and batch tests coupled with kinetic modeling were adopted to better understand the aidd process and answer the two primary problems i is the oxidation of fe ii a microbially driven process and ii if the oxidation of fe ii is truly mediated by microorganisms is it an autotrophic or heterotrophic process 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up and operation of aidd reactor a laboratory scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a working volume of 2 9 l diameter of 10 cm and height of 37 cm was operated at room temperature 27 30 c for 90 d fig 1 the uasb reactor was inoculated with activated sludge collected from a sludge thickener tank of jingkai wastewater treatment plant hefei china a synthetic wastewater with sodium bicarbonate as the sole carbon source was fed to the reactor in the operation the synthetic wastewater included in mg l 1 nahco3 1000 kh2po4 25 mgso4 75 nacl 50 cacl2 20 and trace element solution in μg l 1 h3bo3 14 nicl3 6h2o 190 cuso4 5h2o 250 mncl2 4h2o 990 cocl2 6h2o 240 namoo4 2h2o 220 znso4 7h2o 430 nawo4 2h2o 50 the initial ph of the feeding was adjusted to 7 2 0 1 with 0 1 m hcl and oxygen was purged from the feeding by aerating with n2 gas for 20 min to maintain dissolved oxygen do below 0 5 mg l 1 in the 90 d operation of the reactor the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 8 h and the ph was not controlled nitrate in the form of sodium nitrate and fe ii in the form of ferrous sulfate were used as the electron acceptor and donor respectively the concentrations of n and fe species including nitrate nitrite ammonium fe ii and fe iii in the influent and effluent were measured every day during the operation period 2 2 analyses of fe ii oxidizing products the fe iii mineral products at the stable stage of fe ii oxidation were identified by combining powder x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps for xrd and xps analysis samples were collected from the reactor effluent and vacuum dried at room temperature then dry powder samples were filled in 0 5 mm diameter glass capillary tubes sealed within a glovebox under anoxic conditions xrd data were collected using a ttr iii instrument rigaku co japan with cu kα radiation λ 1 54718 å in the 2θ range from 10 to 70 xps assays were performed on an escalab 250xi instrument thermo fisher scientific inc usa with mgkα radiation to explore the chemical compositions and surface element oxidation states the precipitates of sludge and fe iii mineral complex were observed by using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f jeol co japan the sem imaging was adopted from the procedures reported previously tian et al 2017 the elemental contents in the precipitates were also analyzed via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds morphology analysis of fe phases was performed by extracting using 0 5 m hcl for fe ii 0 25 m hydroxylamine hcl in 0 25 m hcl for amorphous fe iii and 0 2 m ammonium oxalate 0 2 m oxalic acid ph 3 4 for total fe iii respectively senko et al 2005 the collected fe containing precipitates were injected into acidic solution immediately for further extraction to avoid oxidation of the adsorbed fe ii fe content in the extracts was quantified with the phenanthroline assay klueglein et al 2015 2 3 batch verification tests for microbially mediated fe ii oxidation and nitrate reduction a series of batch tests were conducted under fe ii oxidizing and nitrate reducing conditions to verify whether the observed aidd was a microbially mediated process first for the abiotic sludge free control anoxic piperazine 1 4 bisethanesulfonic acid pipes 10 mm ph 7 0 buffer amended with fe ii 7 5 mm in the form of feso4 7h2o as the sole electron donor and nitrate or nitrite 2 5 mm in the form of sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite as the electron acceptor was prepared to monitor the chemical oxidation of fe ii by nitrate or nitrite xiu et al 2016 for the biotic tests with activated sludge nahco3 2 0 mm was used as the carbon source for the microbial growth xiu et al 2016 nitrate 2 mm or nitrite 4 mm was used in the biotic tests with an excess fe ii of 30 mm secondly for autotrophic metabolism evaluation nahco3 and methanol were respectively used as the inorganic and organic carbon sources in addition penicillin g an inhibitor for most heterotrophic denitrifiers rathnayake et al 2018 was also introduced to the biotic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing system at a concentration of 1 4 mm to repress potential heterotrophic denitrification with eps or smp as substrate kindaichi et al 2004 ni et al 2011 moreover to rule out the role of eps and smp as organic carbon substrate for heterotrophic denitrifiers batch tests amended with eps and smp were also carried out the eps and smp were extracted using a modified heat extraction method xu et al 2013 and injected into the batch runs with fe ii in the absence of nahco3 batch runs amended with fe ii and nahco3 but without eps and smp addition were conducted as the control all the batch tests were conducted in 100 ml serum bottles sealed with a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal at 30 2 c in the dark batch tests were carried out in triplicates and the results are expressed as mean sd values 2 4 kinetic modeling of batch iron dependent nitrate reducing process the iron dependent nitrate reducing kinetics was examined according to the methods described by mu et al 2006 briefly the nitrate and fe ii utilization kinetics was modeled using michaelis menten equation as eq 1 wu et al 2002 the logistic model was adapted to describe the microbial growth kinetics measured as the increase in the volatile suspended solids vss as eq 2 fujikawa et al 2004 the fe ii oxidizing products formation kinetics measured as the increase in the difference between total suspended solids tss and vss was modeled using a modified gompertz equation as eq 3 van ginkel et al 2001 the relationship between biomass and the products was simulated by the luedeking piret model as eq 4 luedeking and piret 2000 the relationship between fe ii concentration and fe ii oxidizing product was expressed as eqs 5 and 6 yang et al 1988 3 v v m s k m s where ν mm g vss 1d 1

microbial community of the iron dependent denitrification system a mixture volume of 10 ml of suspended sludge was collected from the reactor and transferred to 10 ml centrifuge tubes followed by being centrifuged at 8 000 g for 20 min to remove supernatant subsequently the sample was resuspended in saline solution 0 9 nacl w v and threefold centrifuged at 8 000 g for 20 min plus washing with saline genomic dna was extracted using an extraction kit sangon biotech shanghai china the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified using the universal primers 338f 5ʹ actcctacgggaggcagcag 3ʹ 806r 5ʹ ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3ʹ after being purified quantified and homogenized according to the methods by lu et al 2015 pyrosequencing was performed using illumina high

com and details are given in supplementary materials tss and vss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 do and ph were measured with a portable do meter hq30d hach co usa and a benchtop ph meter fe 28 mettler toledo inc usa respectively the influent and effluent samples were collected filtered through 0 22 μm pore polyethersulfone pes membranes and analyzed for concentrations of nitrate nitrite and ammonium using the standard methods apha 2005 fe including fe ii and total fe was quantified with the phenanthroline assay klueglein et al 2015 3 results 3 1 long term performance of the aidd reactor the long term performance of the reactor with activated sludge as original inoculum and a continuous feeding of nitrate and ferrous is shown in fig 2 in the initial 5 days the average concentration of nitrate in the effluent was approximately 6 0 mg l 1 with an average nitrate removal efficiency of 88 during the same period the ferrous oxidation efficiency was calculated to be 30 resulting in a molecular ratio of 1 3 1 for reduced nitrate and oxidized fe ii this result was mainly caused by the residual organic carbon substrate in the inoculum which could be used as electron donors by the denitrifiers in the sludge to reduce nitrate ni et al 2011 bi et al 2014 after the complete consumption of the residual organic carbon substrate the effluent nitrate sharply increased to around 20 mg l 1 resulting in a decrease in average nitrate removal efficiency to 58 from day 5 to day 20 an obvious amount of ammonium in the effluent was observed in the initial 20 days of operation which might be resulted from the cell lysis of the heterotrophs bi et al 2014 yin et al 2016 from day 21 to day 60 the influent fe ii concentration was gradually increased and the fe ii removal also showed an increasing trend during this period a simultaneous increase in the nitrate removal efficiency coupled with the oxidation of fe ii was observed considering the decreased ammonium level in the effluent the cell lysis of the heterotrophs became relatively balanced and autotrophic denitrification might become a more prominent reaction responsible for nitrogen removal in the subsequent 30 days both the nitrate reducing and ferrous oxidizing efficiencies leveled off with an average nitrate removal rate of 0 33 kg n m 3d 1 and ferrous oxidation rate of 6 46 kg fe m 3d 1 average removal efficiency of 81 and 92 respectively during the whole operation period nitrite accumulation was only found in the initial 5 days and iron in the effluent was mainly present in the form of fe ii the molecular ratio of the reduced nitrate to oxidized fe ii was calculated approximately as 0 2 after 20 day operation which is in agreement with the theoretical stoichiometry of aidd straub et al 1996 weber et al 2001 after a gradual decreasing a stable ph of approximately 6 0 of the effluent was achieved during the last 10 days of operation fig s1 however it should be noted that the in situ produced nitrite in the reactor vessel might immediately react with the excess fe ii such chemical reaction could be accelerated with fe iii minerals acting as catalysts picardal 2012 tai and dempsey 2009 resulting in a non measurable nitrite in the effluent thus the abiotic fe ii oxidation could not be fully ruled out in the long term reactor operation and further batch tests were required to provide a reasonable explanation to this observation discussed in section 3 3 3 2 fe ii oxidizing products the formation of reddish brown precipitates was observed in the aidd reactor fig 3 a shows the image of the generated fe ii oxidizing products which show a certain degree of magnetism the sem image fig 3b illustrates the precipitates were a complex of microbial cells covered by the fe ii oxidizing products indicated by the eds spectrum in fig 3c the fe ii oxidizing products were further characterized using xrd and xps the xrd pattern of the fe ii oxidizing products fig 3d reveals a relatively low crystallinity suggesting the compositions of the crystalline structures for lepidocrocite γ feooh and amorphous structures for iron oxides li et al 2014a b xiu et al 2016 the fe 2p xps spectra of the fe ii oxidizing products in fig 3e 1 and the peak positions of fe 2p3 2 fe 2p1 2 together with their satellite peaks were used to determine the valence states of iron liu et al 2014 the three feature peaks at 710 6 719 3 and 724 7 ev suggest that the fe ii oxidizing products mainly consisted of iron oxides and hydroxides however it was difficult to identify the presence of exact iron oxides and hydroxides because of their similar xps features and peak positions li and zhang 2007 thus o 1s survey scans were further analyzed to delineate the states of surface oxygen which could be used to differentiate the fe species the o 1s region was decomposed into two peaks at 529 9 and 531 2 ev which are attributed to the o2 and oh respectively li and zhang 2007 the observation of surface oh group demonstrates the existence of oxidized iron in the state of feooh which is consistent with the xrd results morphology analysis of fe phases further indicates that 51 2 of the fe ii oxidizing products were in crystalline fe iii phase and 48 2 were in amorphous fe iii phase fig 3f thus it could be calculated that the percentage of the adsorbed fe ii to the fe iii precipitates was approximately 0 6 compared with fe iii species the amount of fe ii was relatively lower since the extraction was immediately carried out under acidic conditions after the precipitates were collected from the reactor thus further oxidation of the adsorbed fe ii in the extraction process could be ruled out although the fe iii hydro oxides might act as a good adsorbent for the dissolved ferrous ions the relatively lower amount of fe ii adsorbed onto these minerals indicates that the vast majority of fe ii species were used to reduce nitrate it was assumed that the formed fe iii minerals might also act as an efficient catalyst triggering a rapid oxidation of the adsorbed fe ii on their surface by microbes kappler et al 2005 as a result the amount of adsorbed fe ii in the precipitates was limited 3 3 verification of microbially mediated nitrate reduction coupled with fe ii oxidation whether the ferrous oxidation in aidd is caused by microbially mediated biochemical reaction or a side reaction between ferrous and the denitrification intermediates nitrite and nitric oxide remains controversial bryce et al 2018 in this work two batch tests were conducted to qualitatively examine the microbially mediated nitrate reduction coupled with ferrous oxidation using the acclimated sludge collected from the aidd reactor on day 80 fig 4a and b illustrates the first batch run for the abiotic ferrous oxidation by nitrate and nitrite at neutral ph the ferrous oxidation by nitrite showed a much faster rate compared with that measured with nitrate suggesting a higher reactive activity of nitrite than nitrate approximately 0 3 mm of fe ii was oxidized by reducing 0 1 mm of nitrate fig 4 a while a decrease of 2 3 mm of fe ii was observed when 0 4 mm of nitrite was consumed within 5 days fig 4b it should also be noted that the measured ratio of the decrease in fe ii to nitrite was much higher than the ideal stoichiometry given in reaction 2 such a difference might be resulted from the adsorption and or coprecipitation of dissolved fe ii to with the yellow brown precipitates produced in the test amended with nitrite and fe ii fig s2 since there were no microorganisms in this system the adsorbed fe ii might not be further oxidized by microbes therefore in addition to the direct oxidation by nitrite the adsorption and or co precipitation process might also contribute to a large part of the decline of dissolved fe ii in the aqueous phase these results reveal that the contribution of nitrite to the iron dependent denitrification could not be ignored klueglein et al 2014 klueglein and kappler 2013 in the long term operation of the aidd reactor only the nitrite in the effluent was monitored as a result the in situ generation and consumption of nitrite inside the sludge flocs remained unclear thus the biotic ferrous oxidation by nitrite was examined in comparison with that by nitrate in the presence of the acclimated sludge there was no substantial difference observed in the ferrous oxidation with 2 mm of either nitrate or nitrite and nitrate and nitrite were completely converted within 2 days fig 4c and d however when the dosage of nitrate or nitrite increased to 4 mm an observable difference in the conversion of nitrogen species was found approximately 10 mm of ferrous ions were oxidized with both nitrate and nitrite and the conversion of nitrate was 2 mm with a molecular ratio of 0 2 for the reduced nitrate and oxidized fe ii while the ratio was measured to be 0 4 for the reduced nitrite and oxidized fe ii compared with the acclimated sludge free tests fig 4b the ratio of the reduced nitrite to oxidized fe ii was close to the ideal stoichiometry of 0 5 reaction 2 these results might support our earlier hypothesis that the adsorbed and or coprecipitated fe ii was a major contributor to the decline of dissolved fe ii in the abiotic test in the presence of microorganisms even the trapped fe ii on the produced fe iii minerals could be further oxidized resulting in a significant increase in the ratio of the reduced nitrite to oxidized fe ii thus microbial process was suggested to play an irreplaceable role in the oxidation of fe ii coupled with nitrate reduction 3 4 experimental verification of aidd three batch tests were carried out to rule out the impact of heterotrophic denitrifiers on the fe ii oxidation and nitrate reduction when simultaneous nitrate reduction and fe ii oxidation were observed on day 30 activated sludge was withdrawn from the aidd reactor for batch tests as shown in fig 5 a the added ferrous of 2 mm was completely consumed in the first day and a simultaneous conversion of approximately 0 5 mm of nitrate was measured subsequently additional ferrous of 7 5 mm and nahco3 of 10 mm were supplemented into the serum bottles as the electron donor and carbon source to reduce the residual nitrate as ferrous was fully oxidized nearly 2 4 mm of the residual nitrate was further converted although penicillin g of 1 4 mm was injected into the serum bottles to suppress the metabolic activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers rathnayake et al 2018 simultaneous nitrate reduction 0 6 mm and iron oxidation 2 4 mm occurred heterotrophic denitrification with methanol as electron donor was obviously inhibited by penicillin g fig s3 moreover no accumulation of nitrite and ammonia was observed stable denitrification was achieved with a molecular ratio of 0 2 for the reduced nitrate and oxidized ferrous from day 60 90 on day 80 batch tests with the acclimated sludge were carried out to examine the feasibility of using eps and smp as electron donor for nitrate reduction by heterotrophic denitrifiers fig 5b illustrates the denitrification performance with either nahco3 or eps smp as the carbon source for the group amended with nahco3 significant removals of nitrate and fe ii were observed however for the group amended with eps smp consisting of proteins of 5 0 mg l 1 and carbohydrates of 40 mg l 1 almost no nitrate conversion occurred this result rules out the contribution of the heterotrophic denitrifiers using eps smp as electron donor to the observed iron dependent denitrification furthermore the effects of ferrous ion and carbon substrate on the iron dependent denitrification were also evaluated in the absence of ferrous ions almost no nitrate conversion was observed with supplemented nahco3 fig 5c compared with the results obtained with fe ii and nahco3 the added fe ii could serve as electron donor for nitrate reduction it was interesting to observe that when methanol was used as organic carbon source to replicate nahco3 for denitrification similar nitrate reduction but no fe ii oxidation occurred these results indicate that the acclimated sludge might have two different metabolic pathways an autotrophic one using fe ii as electron donor and hco3 as carbon source and a heterotrophic one using organic carbon source such as methanol 3 5 kinetic modeling of batch iron dependent nitrate reduction to estimate whether the ferrous oxidation was associated with microbial growth kinetic models were employed to describe the substrate utilization biomass growth and product formation in the iron dependent nitrate reduction process using the acclimated sludge as inoculum the michaelis menten equation eq 1 was used to model the nitrate and fe ii conversions linearization of eq 1 gives the following equation 1 v k m v m 1 s 1 v m after plotting 1 ν against 1 s a straight line was obtained with an intercept of 1 ν m and a slope of k m v m these plots are shown in fig 6 a and b from which ν m mm g vss 1d 1 and k m mm were estimated to be 58 8 and 4 0 for nitrate and 200 and 16 0 for fe ii respectively the high correlation coefficients of 0 981 and 0 990 suggest the applicability of eq 1 the logistic model eq 2 was adopted to describe the microbial growth kinetics from the relationship between the microbial growth and cultivation time in fig 6c the logistic model parameters of x max and k c were estimated to be 932 8 mg vss l 1 and 0 42 d 1 the r 2 value was 0 980 indicating a good agreement between the modeling results and the experimental data the modified gompertz equation eq 3 was applied to model the formation of fe ii oxidizing products which was measured as the d value between tss and vss fig 6d the fitted curve shown in fig 6d had a correlation coefficient of non linear analysis by eq 3 of 0 971 suggesting that the modified gompertz equation was able to describe the formation of fe ii oxidizing products by the acclimated sludge when the relationship between the biomass and fe ii oxidizing products was modeled using the luedeking piret equation eq 4 an excellent linear dependence r 2 0 998 was obtained fig 6e moreover a close relationship between the fe ii oxidizing products and the added ferrous ions was also obtained and the yield of fe ii oxidizing products was estimated to be 1 47 mg mg 1 these results suggest that the iron oxidation was growth associated in the aidd process 3 6 microbial community changing profiles to date the enrichment culture ks is reported as the most robust example of a purely autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture he et al 2016 nordhoff et al 2017 straub et al 1996 tominski et al 2018a on day 90 the microbial community compositions of the acclimated sludge from the aidd reactor were analyzed via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing five primary phyla were detected in the acclimated sludge with a relative abundance of 43 56 for proteobacteria 28 47 for chloroflexi 11 13 for acidobacteria 9 10 for actinobacteria and 3 13 for firmicutes fig s4 fig 7 illustrates the bacterial community structure at the family and genus levels respectively and the community heatmap illustrates the abundance of the top 20 genera the phylogenetic classification of species and primary bacteria genus relative abundance 5 in the acclimated sludge and their reported metabolisms is summarized in table s1 at the family level the most abundant strains were identified as the family of gallionellaceae with a relative abundance of 16 1 this finding agrees with the previous reports that in the enrichment culture ks gallionellaceae was designated as the dominant autotrophic ferrous oxidizer he et al 2016 nordhoff et al 2017 tominski et al 2018a in addition the detected consortium consisted of a flanking community including several common strains which are widely present in municipal wastewater treatment plants shu et al 2015 e g xanthomonadaceae 7 06 holophagaceae 9 41 anaerolineaceae 11 8 and caldilineaceae 6 29 the midas database http www midasfieldguide org was used to classify the functional roles of these bacteria mcilroy et al 2017 among these strains xanthomonadaceae were previously reported as putative facultative autotrophic denitrifiers capable of using pyrite as an electron donor for denitrification gao et al 2017 torreno et al 2011 xu et al 2015 and might also play an important role in the aidd system the heterotrophic denitrifiers reported in previous works such as rhodanobacter 1 14 tominski et al 2018a and comamonadaceae 2 41 gao et al 2017 tominski et al 2018b were also detected in our system but their relative abundances were much lower in our aidd reactor the relative abundance and composition of the flanking community are highly related with the inoculum and the cultivation conditions bryce et al 2018 the presence of these heterotrophic and facultative autotrophic denitrifiers might explain the observations that the acclimated sludge was able to reduce nitrate with methanol as electron donor it should be noted that the family of nitrosomonadaceae lithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers with a relative abundance of 5 22 was also found in the sludge in the aidd reactor the exact roles of these strains were not clear a possible explanation was that they could oxidize the ammonia converted from organic nitrogen using a trace level of residual oxygen or in the absence of oxygen they could use the electrons from fe ii with nitrite as an electron acceptor bock et al 1995 it is reported the autotrophs could fix co2 for the heterotrophs whilst the heterotrophs could detoxify nitric oxide that the autotrophs could not reduce he et al 2016 tominski et al 2018a this implies that the co existence of the autotrophs and heterotrophs might lead to the formation of syntrophic community thus the syntrophic like community could further achieve stable aidd process microbial community analysis at genus level shows that the dominant strains in the acclimated sludge were the genera of norank f gallionellaceae unclassified f gallionellaceae thermononas geothrix norank f caldilineaceae norank f nitrosomonadaceae and norank f anaerolineaceae fig 7b microbial community heatmap analysis shows that among these genera norank f gallionellaceae 9 65 norank f anaerolineaceae 10 52 and geothrix 9 38 were the most abundant in the enriched culture fig 7c the genera of norank f gallionellaceae and unclassified f gallionellaceae belonged to the family of gallionellaceae which was the primary fe ii oxidizers in the acclimated sludge members of norank f anaerolineaceae thermononas and norank f caldilineaceae were reported to be denitrifiers in various types of bioreactors for nitrogen removal han et al 2019 xing et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the microbial community analysis at genus level further reveals the compositions were coincided with the autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture moreover the relatively high abundance of iron respiring bacteria geothrix 9 38 in the aidd system should be given attention in this work geothrix is widely recognized as iron reducing bacteria that could reduce fe iii to fe ii using a suite of electron donors e g hydrogen acetate and lactate jin et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 in the aidd system the biogenic fe iii hydro oxides were favorable electron acceptors for these fe iii reducers additionally geothrix could release electron shuttling compounds to promote fe iii oxide reduction and electron transfer from the cells to fe iii oxide lovley et al 2004 a similar finding about geothrix was recently reported in a coupled sulfur and fe ii carbonate driven autotrophic denitrification system by zhu et al 2019 these findings suggest that a cycle between fe ii and fe iii might exist and play important roles in the aidd system in which the genera of norank f gallionellaceae and unclassified f gallionellaceae dominated the fe ii oxidation and geothrix mediated the fe iii reduction 4 discussion it is highly desirable to achieve autotrophic nitrogen removal from wastewater with a low c n ratio to avoid excess utilization of organic carbon source in this work the feasibility of applying aidd for nitrogen removal was demonstrated by the long term reactor operation batch experimental verification kinetic modeling and microbial community analysis after continuous operation of 90 d a stable nitrate removal rate of approximately 0 33 kg n m 3d 1 and nitrate removal efficiency of 81 were achieved the nitrate removal rate was much higher than the values 0 07 0 09 kg n m 3d 1 reported previously wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the relatively superior performance was suggested resulting from a shorter hrt 8 h in the present work than those in previous studies from 16 to 18 h a shorter hrt could effectively washout the fe iii products from the reactor and relieve the stress of cell encrustation the cell encrustation induced by fe iii mineral formation e g lepidocrocite in this work and precipitation on the surface or in the periplasm of cells is reported to be the main reason for the decline of denitrification performance kappler et al 2005 klueglein et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the formed mineral crust around the cells might hinder nutrient uptake and metabolite efflux resulting in the decline of cell metabolic activity and even causing cell death klueglein et al 2014 the microbes tightly covered by iron hydro oxides after 16 day continuous operation could be observed from the sem image fig s5 which shows the co existence of the acclimated sludge and fe iii mineral products thus there is a great risk for the aidd reactor to fail how to efficiently prevent cell encrustation in an aidd reactor warrants further investigations on one hand the fe ii oxidizing products cause cell encrustation and further deteriorate the denitrification performance on the other hand these fe iii minerals also have a great potential for environmental remediation one promising application of these fe iii minerals like lepidocrocite goethite green rust magnetite etc is for heavy metal immobilization and transformation attempts to immobilize arsenic using magnetite sun et al 2016 lepidocrocite xiu et al 2016 and goethite hohmann et al 2010 to scavenge uranium vi by green rust yan et al 2018 and amorphous iron seder colomina et al 2015 have been made and validated to be effective for the in situ generated fe iii minerals in wastewater treatment bioreactors their ability to remove phosphorus was also demonstrated li et al 2014a b takeda et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 these results suggest the feasibility of aidd for simultaneous removals of nitrogen and phosphorus without requirement for organic carbon source laufer et al 2016 reported the existence of autotrophic nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizing bacteria in marine coastal sediments through restoring the nitrate reducing activity of the sediment slurries after adding fe ii similarly in this work after culturing without organic carbon for 30 d fig s6 the nitrate reducing activity of the activated sludge became lost suggesting that the heterotrophic nitrate reduction had ceased because of the depletion of the residual available organic carbon when fe ii was injected into the reactor the nitrate reducing activity was resumed with simultaneous fe ii oxidation observed however the mechanism for aidd has been debate recently after reviewing related literatures bryce et al 2018 proposed several requirements for a true autotrophic culture in this work the performance of the denitrifying bioreactor clearly demonstrates that aidd occurred in the uasb reactor the acclimated sludge possessed two distinct metabolic pathways in which fe ii and methanol could be respectively used as electron donors such a difference might be attributed to the microbial community compositions in the acclimated sludge for instance the putative facultative autotrophic denitrifiers strains from the family of xanthomonadaceae could also utilize methanol to reduce nitrate when co2 was not supplemented as carbon source for the autotrophic ferrous oxidizers gallionellaceae fig 5 whether eps smp serve as electron donors for denitrifiers to reduce nitrate remains controversial the main contribution of autotrophic ferrous oxidation to the denitrification was validated by our results but impact of eps smp on the aidd could not be completely elucidated as the cultivation time in the batch tests was relatively short in the batch tests the eps concentration exhibited an obvious decline as ferrous was oxidized fig s7 suggesting the formation of complex between iron species and eps this might be one of the reasons for the observed results the binding of the iron species to microbial eps is found to be a strategy to prevent mineral encrusting on the cell surface klueglein et al 2014 wu et al 2014 such a tightly combined structure might prevent the use of eps smp by the heterotrophic denitrifiers benefitting for the development of autotrophic ferrous oxidizing microbes moreover the situation would become more complex when the dissolved fe ii is bound to eps which seems to be inevitable in such a combined bio iron system the binding of fe ii onto eps may directly influence the distribution and transport of iron in the system the accumulation of fe ii eps complex on the surface of fe ii oxidizers could alter the electron transfer pathways involved in microbial fe ii oxidation and also assist the rapid chemical oxidation of fe ii by intermediate nitrogen species such as nitrite thus the interactions between eps and iron species warrant further investigations pyrosequencing results indicate that the acclimated sludge was dominated by the family of gallionellaceae which is highly similar to the enrichment culture ks fig 7 the enrichment culture ks was originally obtained by straub et al 1996 from a freshwater sediment in 1996 and until now this is the only convincingly demonstrated autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture he et al 2016 tominski et al 2018a recently laufer et al 2016 further demonstrated the existence of autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria in marine coastal sediments the enrichment culture ks like microbial community in our aidd reactor is similar to that described by wang et al 2017 indicating the feasibility of cultivating such a functional culture with activated sludge as inoculum these results imply a wide existence of aidd process in both natural and engineered systems the aidd process to some extent offers several advantages for removing nitrogen from wastewater over conventional denitrification with organics and autotrophic denitrification with hydrogen and sulfur however to achieve practical applications there are some challenges still required to be solved one concern is the amount of fe ii used in denitrification process thus to treat raw municipal wastewater with a low c n ratio iron based mixotrophic denitrification process with different electron donors shall be a favorable option firstly such a combined denitrification process can effectively use the existent organics in the raw wastewater secondly it can also reduce the demand for additional fe ii as electron donor finally the produced fe iii may enhance the settling properties of sludge which will reduce the amount of flocculant ferric salts used for the removal of colloids and phosphate from wastewater another concern is the disposal of the fe containing residual sludge if iron based denitrification is applied anaerobic digestion is a sustainable process to treat residual activated sludge by converting the waste organics into biogas mainly in the form of ch4 fortunately the presence of iron containing compounds such as conductive magnetite jing et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 and nonconductive iron oxides e g ferric oxide ferric hydroxide and goethite baek et al 2014 li et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yao et al 2017 could enhance biogas production in anaerobic digestion these results imply that the iron containing sludge may be suitable to be digested to produce biogas therefore determining the optimal dosage of fe ii with the help of accurate calculation and evaluation is required and should be the key for the practical applications of the aidd process 5 conclusions in this work the performance of an aidd system acclimated from activated sludge for continuous nitrogen removal is examined the simultaneous fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction is demonstrated to be an exclusive autotrophic reaction driven by the enriched culture the microbial community in the enriched culture is dominated by the strains belonging to the family of gallionellaceae which is similar to the dominated species in the identified chemolithoautotrophic enrichment culture ks the successful acclimation of aidd culture in this work also indicates the feasibility of developing iron based mixotrophic denitrification process which holds a great promise to be developed into a competitively combined process for simultaneous removals of c n p and heavy metals through reasonable design and management great efforts should also be made to investigate the synergistic effects between ferrous oxidizers and denitrifiers to better understand the mechanisms of the aidd process declaration of competing interest the

18249,autotrophic iron dependent denitrification aidd is arising as a promising process for nitrogen removal from wastewater with a low carbon to nitrogen ratio however there is still a debate about the existence of such a process in activated sludge systems this work provides evidence and elucidated the feasibility of autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture for nitrogen removal by long term reactor operation batch experimental verification unstructured kinetic modeling and microbial community analyses a relatively stable nitrate removal rate was achieved coupled with the oxidation of ferrous ions in 3 month operation of reactor the kinetic modeling suggests that the iron oxidation was a growth associated process in aidd utilization of extracellular polymeric substances and or soluble microbial products as electron donor for denitrification by heterotrophic denitrifiers was not mainly responsible for nitrogen removal in the reactor after long term operation of the reactor with activated sludge as inoculum the enrichment culture ks like consortium dominated by fe ii oxidizer gallionellaceae was successfully acclimated for autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction this work extents our understanding about the existence of such an autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture in both natural and engineered systems and opens a door for its potential application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge autotrophic iron dependent denitrification aidd gallionellaceae kinetic modeling wastewater treatment 1 introduction recently autotrophic denitrification has gradually become an acceptable alternative for conventional heterotrophic denitrification to treat wastewater with a low

attractive characteristics e g high safety for storage and transportation and low cost kiskira et al 2017 in addition the produced ferric iron could serve as coagulants and adsorbents to remove phosphate li et al 2014a b zhang et al 2015 and heavy metals such as as and ni hohmann et al 2010 schmid et al 2016 sun et al 2016 microbially driven aidd was first proposed by straub et al who observed the simultaneous fe ii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction reaction 1 straub et al 1996 this process and its significance in fe n cycling in subsurface environments such as aquifers jessen et al 2017 smith et al 2017 soils li et al 2016 ratering and schnell 2001 and sediments laufer et al 2016 weber et al 2006 have been intensively studied although knowledge gaps of the mechanisms such as enzymes responsible for fe ii oxidation and electron transfer pathways among different components remain to be addressed bryce et al 2018 the application of the aidd process has been explored and reported to be a prospective process to remove nitrate from wastewater wang et al 2015 2017 zhang et al 2014 2015 in these studies activated sludge was used as initial inoculum to achieve potential aidd and further bioaugmentation by supplementing heterotrophic denitrifying sludge was also explored wang et al 2015 1 10fe ii 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h however so far there is no clear and convincing evidence to prove that the observed fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction in these studies is an exclusive microbially driven autotrophic process to determine whether a strain or culture involved in fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction is autotrophic four strict criteria should be met i no demand for organic carbon source ii growth with only fe ii nitrate and co2 provided iii maintain fe ii oxidation activity over several transfers and iv uptake and incorporate co2 into biomass bryce et al 2018 although bicarbonate was used as the sole carbon source in the operation of aidd reactors the contribution of heterotrophic denitrifiers to the fe ii oxidation cannot be fully ruled out in these studies because the extracellular polymeric substances eps and or soluble microbial products smp produced by autotrophs might be used as an electron donor for nitrate reduction by heterotrophic denitrifiers kindaichi et al 2004 ni et al 2011 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 abiotic oxidation of fe ii by reactive nitrogen species e g nitrite produced in denitrification reaction 2 has induced the controversy about the existence of enzymatic fe ii oxidation involved in the mixotrophic metabolisms bryce et al 2018 etique et al 2014 klueglein et al 2014 klueglein and kappler 2013 recently model based kinetic studies have suggested the co existence of chemical and biological fe ii oxidation in several fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing strains jamieson et al 2018 liu et al 2018 thus considering the key role of nitrite in chemical oxidation of fe ii the microbially mediated fe ii oxidation by using the heat inactivated sludge nielsen and nielsen 1998 weber et al 2006 xiu et al 2016 or without sludge as controls blöthe and roden 2009 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 should be re evaluated because of nitrite deficiency under such experimental conditions 2 4fe ii 2no2 9h2o 4fe oh 3 n2o 6h another concern is the development of the microbial community who is capable of autotrophic fe ii oxidation and nitrate reduction the enrichment culture ks named after k straub originally isolated from a freshwater sediment is the only convincingly demonstrated autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture to date bryce et al 2018 he et al 2016 straub et al 1996 tominski et al 2018a such a chemolithoautotrophic co culture consists of strains from the family of gallionellaceae as the dominant bacteria capable of oxidizing fe ii and a flanking community including several species of denitrifiers like comamonadaceae rhodanobacter polaromonas and etc bryce et al 2018 whether such a functional culture could be obtained from activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants remains unknown therefore the main objective of this work was to explore the feasibility of achieving microbially mediated aidd using activated sludge as inoculum and to identify the corresponding microbial community long term reactor operation and batch tests coupled with kinetic modeling were adopted to better understand the aidd process and answer the two primary problems i is the oxidation of fe ii a microbially driven process and ii if the oxidation of fe ii is truly mediated by microorganisms is it an autotrophic or heterotrophic process 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up and operation of aidd reactor a laboratory scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a working volume of 2 9 l diameter of 10 cm and height of 37 cm was operated at room temperature 27 30 c for 90 d fig 1 the uasb reactor was inoculated with activated sludge collected from a sludge thickener tank of jingkai wastewater treatment plant hefei china a synthetic wastewater with sodium bicarbonate as the sole carbon source was fed to the reactor in the operation the synthetic wastewater included in mg l 1 nahco3 1000 kh2po4 25 mgso4 75 nacl 50 cacl2 20 and trace element solution in μg l 1 h3bo3 14 nicl3 6h2o 190 cuso4 5h2o 250 mncl2 4h2o 990 cocl2

maintain dissolved oxygen do below 0 5 mg l 1 in the 90 d operation of the reactor the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 8 h and the ph was not controlled nitrate in the form of sodium nitrate and fe ii in the form of ferrous sulfate were used as the electron acceptor and donor respectively the concentrations of n and fe species including nitrate nitrite ammonium fe ii and fe iii in the influent and effluent were measured every day during the operation period 2 2 analyses of fe ii oxidizing products the fe iii mineral products at the stable stage of fe ii oxidation were identified by combining powder x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps for xrd and xps analysis samples were collected from the reactor effluent and vacuum dried at room temperature then dry

and surface element oxidation states the precipitates of sludge and fe iii mineral complex were observed by using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f jeol co japan the sem imaging was adopted from the procedures reported previously tian et al 2017 the elemental contents in the precipitates were also analyzed via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds morphology analysis of fe phases was performed by extracting using 0 5 m hcl for fe ii 0 25 m hydroxylamine hcl in 0 25 m hcl for amorphous fe iii and 0 2 m ammonium oxalate 0 2 m oxalic acid ph 3 4 for total fe iii respectively senko et al 2005 the collected fe containing precipitates were injected into acidic solution immediately for further extraction to avoid oxidation of the adsorbed fe ii fe content in the extracts was quantified with the phenanthroline assay klueglein et al 2015 2 3 batch verification tests for microbially mediated fe ii oxidation and nitrate reduction a series of batch tests were conducted under fe ii oxidizing and nitrate reducing conditions to verify whether the observed aidd was a microbially mediated process first for the abiotic sludge free control anoxic piperazine 1 4 bisethanesulfonic acid pipes 10 mm ph 7 0 buffer amended with fe ii 7 5 mm in the form of feso4 7h2o as the sole electron donor and nitrate or nitrite 2 5 mm in the form of sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite as the electron acceptor was prepared to monitor the chemical oxidation of fe ii by nitrate or nitrite xiu et al 2016 for the biotic tests with activated sludge nahco3 2 0 mm was used as the carbon source for the microbial growth xiu et al 2016 nitrate 2 mm or nitrite 4 mm was used in the biotic tests with an excess fe ii of 30 mm secondly for autotrophic metabolism evaluation nahco3 and methanol were respectively used as the inorganic and organic carbon sources in addition penicillin g an inhibitor for most heterotrophic denitrifiers rathnayake et al 2018 was also introduced to the biotic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing system at a concentration of 1 4 mm to repress potential heterotrophic denitrification with eps or smp as substrate kindaichi et al 2004 ni et al 2011 moreover to rule out the role of eps and smp as organic carbon substrate for heterotrophic denitrifiers batch tests amended with eps and smp were also carried out the eps and smp were extracted using a modified heat extraction method xu et al 2013 and injected into the batch runs with fe ii in the absence of nahco3 batch runs amended with fe ii and nahco3 but without eps and smp addition were conducted as the control all the batch tests were conducted in 100 ml serum bottles sealed with a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal at 30 2 c in the dark batch tests were carried out in triplicates and the results are expressed as mean sd values 2 4 kinetic modeling of batch iron dependent nitrate reducing process the iron dependent nitrate reducing kinetics was examined according to the methods described by mu et al 2006 briefly the nitrate and fe ii utilization kinetics was modeled using michaelis menten equation as eq 1 wu et al 2002 the logistic model was adapted to describe the microbial growth kinetics measured as the increase in the volatile suspended solids vss as eq 2 fujikawa et al 2004 the fe ii oxidizing products formation kinetics measured as the increase in the difference between total suspended solids tss and vss was modeled using a modified gompertz equation as eq 3 van ginkel et al 2001 the relationship between biomass and the products was simulated by the luedeking piret model as eq 4 luedeking and piret 2000 the relationship between fe ii concentration and fe ii oxidizing product was expressed as eqs 5 and 6 yang et al 1988 3 v v m s k m s where ν mm g vss 1d 1

microbial community of the iron dependent denitrification system a mixture volume of 10 ml of suspended sludge was collected from the reactor and transferred to 10 ml centrifuge tubes followed by being centrifuged at 8 000 g for 20 min to remove supernatant subsequently the sample was resuspended in saline solution 0 9 nacl w v and threefold centrifuged at 8 000 g for 20 min plus washing with saline genomic dna was extracted using an extraction kit sangon biotech shanghai china the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified using the universal primers 338f 5ʹ

com and details are given in supplementary materials tss and vss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 do and ph were measured with a portable do meter hq30d hach co usa and a benchtop ph meter fe 28 mettler toledo inc usa respectively the influent and effluent samples were collected filtered through 0 22 μm pore polyethersulfone pes membranes and analyzed for concentrations of nitrate nitrite and ammonium using the standard methods apha 2005 fe including fe ii and total fe was quantified with the phenanthroline assay klueglein et al 2015 3 results 3 1 long term performance of the aidd reactor the long term performance of the reactor with activated sludge as original inoculum and a continuous feeding of nitrate and ferrous is shown in fig 2 in the initial 5 days the average concentration of nitrate in the effluent was approximately 6 0 mg l 1 with an average nitrate removal efficiency of 88 during the same period the ferrous oxidation efficiency was calculated to be 30 resulting in a molecular ratio of 1 3 1 for reduced nitrate and oxidized fe ii this result was mainly caused by the residual organic carbon substrate in the inoculum which could be used as electron donors by the denitrifiers in the sludge to reduce nitrate ni et al 2011 bi et al 2014 after the complete consumption of the residual organic carbon substrate the effluent nitrate sharply increased to around 20 mg l 1 resulting in a decrease in average nitrate removal efficiency to 58 from day 5 to day 20 an obvious amount of ammonium in the effluent was observed in the initial 20 days of operation which might be resulted from the cell lysis of the heterotrophs bi et al 2014 yin et al 2016 from day 21 to day 60 the influent fe ii concentration was gradually increased and the fe ii removal also showed an increasing trend during this period a simultaneous increase in the nitrate removal efficiency coupled with the oxidation of fe ii was observed considering the decreased ammonium level in the effluent the cell lysis of the heterotrophs became relatively balanced and autotrophic denitrification might become a more prominent reaction responsible for nitrogen removal in the subsequent 30 days both the nitrate reducing and ferrous oxidizing efficiencies leveled off with an average nitrate removal rate of 0 33 kg n m 3d 1 and ferrous oxidation rate of 6 46 kg fe m 3d 1 average removal efficiency of 81 and 92 respectively during the whole operation period nitrite accumulation was only found in the initial 5 days and iron in the effluent was mainly present in the form of fe ii the molecular ratio of the reduced nitrate to oxidized fe ii was calculated approximately as 0 2 after 20 day operation which is in agreement with the theoretical stoichiometry of aidd straub et al 1996 weber et al 2001 after a gradual decreasing a stable ph of approximately 6 0 of the effluent was achieved during the last 10 days of operation fig s1 however it should be noted that the in situ produced nitrite in the reactor vessel might immediately react with the excess fe ii such chemical reaction could be accelerated with fe iii minerals acting as catalysts picardal 2012 tai and dempsey 2009 resulting in a non measurable nitrite in the effluent thus the abiotic fe ii oxidation could not be fully ruled out in the long term reactor operation and further batch tests were required to provide a reasonable explanation to this observation discussed in section 3 3 3 2 fe ii oxidizing products the formation of reddish brown precipitates was observed in the aidd reactor fig 3 a shows the image of the generated fe ii oxidizing products which show a certain degree of magnetism the sem image fig 3b illustrates the precipitates were a complex of microbial cells covered by the fe ii oxidizing products indicated by the eds spectrum in fig 3c the fe ii oxidizing products were further characterized using xrd and xps the xrd pattern of the fe ii oxidizing products fig 3d reveals a relatively low crystallinity suggesting the compositions of the crystalline structures for lepidocrocite γ feooh and amorphous structures for iron oxides li et al 2014a b xiu et al 2016 the fe 2p xps spectra of the fe ii oxidizing products in fig 3e 1 and the peak positions of fe 2p3 2 fe 2p1 2 together with their satellite peaks were used to determine the valence states of iron liu et al 2014 the three feature peaks at 710 6 719 3 and 724 7 ev suggest that the fe ii oxidizing products mainly consisted of iron oxides and hydroxides however it was difficult to identify the presence of exact iron oxides and hydroxides because of their similar xps features and peak positions li and zhang 2007 thus o 1s survey scans were further analyzed to delineate the states of surface oxygen which could be used to differentiate the fe species the o 1s region was decomposed into two peaks at 529 9 and 531 2 ev which are attributed to the o2 and oh respectively li and zhang 2007 the observation of surface oh group demonstrates the existence of oxidized iron in the state of feooh which is consistent with the xrd results morphology analysis of fe phases further indicates that 51 2 of the fe ii oxidizing products were in crystalline fe iii phase and 48 2 were in amorphous fe iii phase fig 3f thus it could be calculated that the percentage of the adsorbed fe ii to the fe iii precipitates was approximately 0 6 compared with fe iii species the amount of fe ii was relatively lower since the extraction was immediately carried out under acidic conditions after the precipitates were collected from the reactor thus further oxidation of the adsorbed fe ii in the extraction process could be ruled out although the fe iii hydro oxides might act as a good adsorbent for the dissolved ferrous ions the relatively lower amount of fe ii adsorbed onto these minerals indicates that the vast majority of fe ii species were used to reduce nitrate it was assumed that the formed fe iii minerals might also act as an efficient catalyst triggering a rapid oxidation of the adsorbed fe ii on their surface by microbes kappler et al 2005 as a result the amount of adsorbed fe ii in the precipitates was limited 3 3 verification of microbially mediated nitrate reduction coupled with fe ii oxidation whether the ferrous oxidation in aidd is caused by microbially mediated biochemical reaction or a side reaction between ferrous and the denitrification intermediates nitrite and nitric oxide remains controversial bryce et al 2018 in this work two batch tests were conducted to qualitatively examine the microbially mediated nitrate reduction coupled with ferrous oxidation using the acclimated sludge collected from the aidd reactor on day 80 fig 4a and b illustrates the first batch run for the abiotic ferrous oxidation by nitrate and nitrite at neutral ph the ferrous oxidation by nitrite showed a much faster rate compared with that measured with nitrate suggesting a higher reactive activity of nitrite than nitrate approximately 0 3 mm of fe ii was oxidized by reducing 0 1 mm of nitrate fig 4 a while a decrease of 2 3 mm of fe ii was observed when 0 4 mm of nitrite was consumed within 5 days fig 4b it should also be noted that the measured ratio of the decrease in fe ii to nitrite was much higher than the ideal stoichiometry given in reaction 2 such a difference might be resulted from the adsorption and or coprecipitation of dissolved fe ii to with the yellow brown precipitates produced in the test amended with nitrite and fe ii fig s2 since there were no microorganisms in this system the adsorbed fe ii might not be further oxidized by microbes therefore in addition to the direct oxidation by nitrite the adsorption and or co precipitation process might also contribute to a large part of the decline of dissolved fe ii in the aqueous phase these results reveal that the contribution of nitrite to the iron dependent denitrification could not be ignored klueglein et al 2014 klueglein and kappler 2013 in the long term operation of the aidd reactor only the nitrite in the effluent was monitored as a result the in situ generation and consumption of nitrite inside the sludge flocs remained unclear thus the biotic ferrous oxidation by nitrite was examined in comparison with that by nitrate in the presence of the acclimated sludge there was no substantial difference observed in the ferrous oxidation with 2 mm of either nitrate or nitrite and nitrate and nitrite were completely converted within 2 days fig 4c and d however when the dosage of nitrate or nitrite increased to 4 mm an observable difference in the conversion of nitrogen species was found approximately 10 mm of ferrous ions were oxidized with both nitrate and nitrite and the conversion of nitrate was 2 mm with a molecular ratio of 0 2 for the reduced nitrate and oxidized fe ii while the ratio was measured to be 0 4 for the reduced nitrite and oxidized fe ii compared with the acclimated sludge free tests fig 4b the ratio of the reduced nitrite to oxidized fe ii was close to the ideal stoichiometry of 0 5 reaction 2 these results might support our earlier hypothesis that the adsorbed and or coprecipitated fe ii was a major contributor to the decline of dissolved fe ii in the abiotic test in the presence of microorganisms even the trapped fe ii on the produced fe iii minerals could be further oxidized resulting in a significant increase in the ratio of the reduced nitrite to oxidized fe ii thus microbial process was suggested to play an irreplaceable role in the oxidation of fe ii coupled with nitrate reduction 3 4 experimental verification of aidd three batch tests were carried out to rule out the impact of heterotrophic denitrifiers on the fe ii oxidation and nitrate reduction when simultaneous nitrate reduction and fe ii oxidation were observed on day 30 activated sludge was withdrawn from the aidd reactor for batch tests as shown in fig 5 a the added ferrous of 2 mm was completely consumed in the first day and a simultaneous conversion of approximately 0 5 mm of nitrate was measured subsequently additional ferrous of 7 5 mm and nahco3 of 10 mm were supplemented into the serum bottles as the electron donor and carbon source to reduce the residual nitrate as ferrous was fully oxidized nearly 2 4 mm of the residual nitrate was further converted although penicillin g of 1 4 mm was injected into the serum bottles to suppress the metabolic activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers rathnayake et al 2018 simultaneous nitrate reduction 0 6 mm and iron oxidation 2 4 mm occurred heterotrophic denitrification with methanol as electron donor was obviously inhibited by penicillin g fig s3 moreover no accumulation of nitrite and ammonia was observed stable denitrification was achieved with a molecular ratio of 0 2 for the reduced nitrate and oxidized ferrous from day 60 90 on day 80 batch tests with the acclimated sludge were carried out to examine the feasibility of using eps and smp as electron donor for nitrate reduction by heterotrophic denitrifiers fig 5b illustrates the denitrification performance with either nahco3 or eps smp as the carbon source for the group amended with nahco3 significant removals of nitrate and fe ii were observed however for the group amended with eps smp consisting of proteins of 5 0 mg l 1 and carbohydrates of 40 mg l 1 almost no nitrate conversion occurred this result rules out the contribution of the heterotrophic denitrifiers using eps smp as electron donor to the observed iron dependent denitrification furthermore the effects of ferrous ion and carbon substrate on the iron dependent denitrification were also evaluated in the absence of ferrous ions almost no nitrate conversion was observed with supplemented nahco3 fig 5c compared with the results obtained with fe ii and nahco3 the added fe ii could serve as electron donor for nitrate reduction it was interesting to observe that when methanol was used as organic carbon source to replicate nahco3 for denitrification similar nitrate reduction but no fe ii oxidation occurred these results indicate that the acclimated sludge might have two different metabolic pathways an autotrophic one using fe ii as electron donor and hco3 as carbon source and a heterotrophic one using organic carbon source such as methanol 3 5 kinetic modeling of batch iron dependent nitrate reduction to estimate whether the ferrous oxidation was associated with microbial growth kinetic models were employed to describe the substrate utilization biomass growth and product formation in the iron dependent nitrate reduction process using the acclimated sludge as inoculum the michaelis menten equation eq 1 was used to model the nitrate and fe ii conversions linearization of eq 1 gives the following equation 1 v k m v m 1 s 1 v m after plotting 1 ν against 1 s a straight line was obtained with an intercept of 1 ν m and a slope of k m v m these plots are shown in fig 6 a and b from which ν m mm g vss 1d 1 and k m mm were estimated to be 58 8 and 4 0 for nitrate and 200 and 16 0 for fe ii respectively the high correlation coefficients of 0 981 and 0 990 suggest the applicability of eq 1 the logistic model eq 2 was adopted to describe the microbial growth kinetics from the relationship between the microbial growth and cultivation time in fig 6c the logistic model parameters of x max and k c were estimated to be 932 8 mg vss l 1 and 0 42 d 1 the r 2 value was 0 980 indicating a good agreement between the modeling results and the experimental data the modified gompertz equation eq 3 was applied to model the formation of fe ii oxidizing products which was measured as the d value between tss and vss fig 6d the fitted curve shown in fig 6d had a correlation coefficient of non linear analysis by eq 3 of 0 971 suggesting that the modified gompertz equation was able to describe the formation of fe ii oxidizing products by the acclimated sludge when the relationship between the biomass and fe ii oxidizing products was modeled using the luedeking piret equation eq 4 an excellent linear dependence r 2 0 998 was obtained fig 6e moreover a close relationship between the fe ii oxidizing products and the added ferrous ions was also obtained and the yield of fe ii oxidizing products was estimated to be 1 47 mg mg 1 these results suggest that the iron oxidation was growth associated in the aidd process 3 6 microbial community changing profiles to date the enrichment culture ks is reported as the most robust example of a purely autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture he et al 2016 nordhoff et al 2017 straub et al 1996 tominski et al 2018a on day 90 the microbial community compositions of the acclimated sludge from the aidd reactor were analyzed via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing five primary phyla were detected in the acclimated sludge with a relative abundance of 43 56 for proteobacteria 28 47 for chloroflexi 11 13 for acidobacteria 9 10 for actinobacteria and 3 13 for firmicutes fig s4 fig 7 illustrates the bacterial community structure at the family and genus levels respectively and the community heatmap illustrates the abundance of the top 20 genera the phylogenetic classification of species and primary bacteria genus relative abundance 5 in the acclimated sludge and their reported metabolisms is summarized in table s1 at the family level the most abundant strains were identified as the family of gallionellaceae with a relative abundance of 16 1 this finding agrees with the previous reports that in the enrichment culture ks gallionellaceae was designated as the dominant autotrophic ferrous oxidizer he et al 2016 nordhoff et al 2017 tominski et al 2018a in addition the detected consortium consisted of a flanking community including several common strains which are widely present in municipal wastewater treatment plants shu et al 2015 e g xanthomonadaceae 7 06 holophagaceae 9 41 anaerolineaceae 11 8 and caldilineaceae 6 29 the midas database http www midasfieldguide org was used to classify the functional roles of these bacteria mcilroy et al 2017 among these strains xanthomonadaceae were previously reported as putative facultative autotrophic denitrifiers capable of using pyrite as an electron donor for denitrification gao et al 2017 torreno et al 2011 xu et al 2015 and might also play an important role in the aidd system the heterotrophic denitrifiers reported in previous works such as rhodanobacter 1 14 tominski et al 2018a and comamonadaceae 2 41 gao et al 2017 tominski et al 2018b were also detected in our system but their relative abundances were much lower in our aidd reactor the relative abundance and composition of the flanking community are highly related with the inoculum and the cultivation conditions bryce et al 2018 the presence of these heterotrophic and facultative autotrophic denitrifiers might explain the observations that the acclimated sludge was able to reduce nitrate with methanol as electron donor it should be noted that the family of nitrosomonadaceae lithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers with a relative abundance of 5 22 was also found in the sludge in the aidd reactor the exact roles of these strains were not clear a possible explanation was that they could oxidize the ammonia converted from organic nitrogen using a trace level of residual oxygen or in the absence of oxygen they could use the electrons from fe ii with nitrite as an electron acceptor bock et al 1995 it is reported the autotrophs could fix co2 for the heterotrophs whilst the heterotrophs could detoxify nitric oxide that the autotrophs could not reduce he et al 2016 tominski et al 2018a this implies that the co existence of the autotrophs and heterotrophs might lead to the formation of syntrophic community thus the syntrophic like community could further achieve stable aidd process microbial community analysis at genus level shows that the dominant strains in the acclimated sludge were the genera of norank f gallionellaceae unclassified f gallionellaceae thermononas geothrix norank f caldilineaceae norank f nitrosomonadaceae and norank f anaerolineaceae fig 7b microbial community heatmap analysis shows that among these genera norank f gallionellaceae 9 65 norank f anaerolineaceae 10 52 and geothrix 9 38 were the most abundant in the enriched culture fig 7c the genera of norank f gallionellaceae and unclassified f gallionellaceae belonged to the family of gallionellaceae which was the primary fe ii oxidizers in the acclimated sludge members of norank f anaerolineaceae thermononas and norank f caldilineaceae were reported to be denitrifiers in various types of bioreactors for nitrogen removal han et al 2019 xing et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the microbial community analysis at genus level further reveals the compositions were coincided with the autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture moreover the relatively high abundance of iron respiring bacteria geothrix 9 38 in the aidd system should be given attention in this work geothrix is widely recognized as iron reducing bacteria that could reduce fe iii to fe ii using a suite of electron donors e g hydrogen acetate and lactate jin et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 in the aidd system the biogenic fe iii hydro oxides were favorable electron acceptors for these fe iii reducers additionally geothrix could release electron shuttling compounds to promote fe iii oxide reduction and electron transfer from the cells to fe iii oxide lovley et al 2004 a similar finding about geothrix was recently reported in a coupled sulfur and fe ii carbonate driven autotrophic denitrification system by zhu et al 2019 these findings suggest that a cycle between fe ii and fe iii might exist and play important roles in the aidd system in which the genera of norank f gallionellaceae and unclassified f gallionellaceae dominated the fe ii oxidation and geothrix mediated the fe iii reduction 4 discussion it is highly desirable to achieve autotrophic nitrogen removal from wastewater with a low c n ratio to avoid excess utilization of organic carbon source in this work the feasibility of applying aidd for nitrogen removal was demonstrated by the long term reactor operation batch experimental verification kinetic modeling and microbial community analysis after continuous operation of 90 d a stable nitrate removal rate of approximately 0 33 kg n m 3d 1 and nitrate removal efficiency of 81 were achieved the nitrate removal rate was much higher than the values 0 07 0 09 kg n m 3d 1 reported previously wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the relatively superior performance was suggested resulting from a shorter hrt 8 h in the present work than those in previous studies from 16 to 18 h a shorter hrt could effectively washout the fe iii products from the reactor and relieve the stress of cell encrustation the cell encrustation induced by fe iii mineral formation e g lepidocrocite in this work and precipitation on the surface or in the periplasm of cells is reported to be the main reason for the decline of denitrification performance kappler et al 2005 klueglein et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the formed mineral crust around the cells might hinder nutrient uptake and metabolite efflux resulting in the decline of cell metabolic activity and even causing cell death klueglein et al 2014 the microbes tightly covered by iron hydro oxides after 16 day continuous operation could be observed from the sem image fig s5 which shows the co existence of the acclimated sludge and fe iii mineral products thus there is a great risk for the aidd reactor to fail how to efficiently prevent cell encrustation in an aidd reactor warrants further investigations on one hand the fe ii oxidizing products cause cell encrustation and further deteriorate the denitrification performance on the other hand these fe iii minerals also have a great potential for environmental remediation one promising application of these fe iii minerals like lepidocrocite goethite green rust magnetite etc is for heavy metal immobilization and transformation attempts to immobilize arsenic using magnetite sun et al 2016 lepidocrocite xiu et al 2016 and goethite hohmann et al 2010 to scavenge uranium vi by green rust yan et al 2018 and amorphous iron seder colomina et al 2015 have been made and validated to be effective for the in situ generated fe iii minerals in wastewater treatment bioreactors their ability to remove phosphorus was also demonstrated li et al 2014a b takeda et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 these results suggest the feasibility of aidd for simultaneous removals of nitrogen and phosphorus without requirement for organic carbon source laufer et al 2016 reported the existence of autotrophic nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizing bacteria in marine coastal sediments through restoring the nitrate reducing activity of the sediment slurries after adding fe ii similarly in this work after culturing without organic carbon for 30 d fig s6 the nitrate reducing activity of the activated sludge became lost suggesting that the heterotrophic nitrate reduction had ceased because of the depletion of the residual available organic carbon when fe ii was injected into the reactor the nitrate reducing activity was resumed with simultaneous fe ii oxidation observed however the mechanism for aidd has been debate recently after reviewing related literatures bryce et al 2018 proposed several requirements for a true autotrophic culture in this work the performance of the denitrifying bioreactor clearly demonstrates that aidd occurred in the uasb reactor the acclimated sludge possessed two distinct metabolic pathways in which fe ii and methanol could be respectively used as electron donors such a difference might be attributed to the microbial community compositions in the acclimated sludge for instance the putative facultative autotrophic denitrifiers strains from the family of xanthomonadaceae could also utilize methanol to reduce nitrate when co2 was not supplemented as carbon source for the autotrophic ferrous oxidizers gallionellaceae fig 5 whether eps smp serve as electron donors for denitrifiers to reduce nitrate remains controversial the main contribution of autotrophic ferrous oxidation to the denitrification was validated by our results but impact of eps smp on the aidd could not be completely elucidated as the cultivation time in the batch tests was relatively short in the batch tests the eps concentration exhibited an obvious decline as ferrous was oxidized fig s7 suggesting the formation of complex between iron species and eps this might be one of the reasons for the observed results the binding of the iron species to microbial eps is found to be a strategy to prevent mineral encrusting on the cell surface klueglein et al 2014 wu et al 2014 such a tightly combined structure might prevent the use of eps smp by the heterotrophic denitrifiers benefitting for the development of autotrophic ferrous oxidizing microbes moreover the situation would become more complex when the dissolved fe ii is bound to eps which seems to be inevitable in such a combined bio iron system the binding of fe ii onto eps may directly influence the distribution and transport of iron in the system the accumulation of fe ii eps complex on the surface of fe ii oxidizers could alter the electron transfer pathways involved in microbial fe ii oxidation and also assist the rapid chemical oxidation of fe ii by intermediate nitrogen species such as nitrite thus the interactions between eps and iron species warrant further investigations pyrosequencing results indicate that the acclimated sludge was dominated by the family of gallionellaceae which is highly similar to the enrichment culture ks fig 7 the enrichment culture ks was originally obtained by straub et al 1996 from a freshwater sediment in 1996 and until now this is the only convincingly demonstrated autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing culture he et al 2016 tominski et al 2018a recently laufer et al 2016 further demonstrated the existence of autotrophic fe ii oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria in marine coastal sediments the enrichment culture ks like microbial community in our aidd reactor is similar to that described by wang et al 2017 indicating the feasibility of cultivating such a functional culture with activated sludge as inoculum these results imply a wide existence of aidd process in both natural and engineered systems the aidd process to some extent offers several advantages for removing nitrogen from wastewater over conventional denitrification with organics and autotrophic denitrification with hydrogen and sulfur however to achieve practical applications there are some challenges still required to be solved one concern is the amount of fe ii used in denitrification process thus to treat raw municipal wastewater with a low c n ratio iron based mixotrophic denitrification process with different electron donors shall be a favorable option firstly such a combined denitrification process can effectively use the existent organics in the raw wastewater secondly it can also reduce the demand for additional fe ii as electron donor finally the produced fe iii may enhance the settling properties of sludge which will reduce the amount of flocculant ferric salts used for the removal of colloids and phosphate from wastewater another concern is the disposal of the fe containing residual sludge if iron based denitrification is applied anaerobic digestion is a sustainable process to treat residual activated sludge by converting the waste organics into biogas mainly in the form of ch4 fortunately the presence of iron containing compounds such as conductive magnetite jing et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 and nonconductive iron oxides e g ferric oxide ferric hydroxide and goethite baek et al 2014 li et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yao et al 2017 could enhance biogas production in anaerobic digestion these results imply that the iron containing sludge may be suitable to be digested to produce biogas therefore determining the optimal dosage of fe ii with the help of accurate calculation and evaluation is required and should be the key for the practical applications of the aidd process 5 conclusions in this work the performance of an aidd system acclimated from activated sludge for continuous nitrogen removal is examined the simultaneous fe ii oxidizing nitrate reduction is demonstrated to be an exclusive autotrophic reaction driven by the enriched culture the microbial community in the enriched culture is dominated by the strains belonging to the family of gallionellaceae which is similar to the dominated species in the identified chemolithoautotrophic enrichment culture ks the successful acclimation of aidd culture in this work also indicates the feasibility of developing iron based mixotrophic denitrification process which holds a great promise to be developed into a competitively combined process for simultaneous removals of c n p and heavy metals through reasonable design and management great efforts should also be made to investigate the synergistic effects between ferrous oxidizers and denitrifiers to better understand the mechanisms of the aidd process declaration of competing interest the
