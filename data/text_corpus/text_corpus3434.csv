17170,glycogen accumulating organisms gaos are thought to compete with polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos for the often limiting carbon sources available in wastewater deteriorating enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr performance at high temperatures fermentation liquids are often used to provide an additional carbon source supply in ebpr processes where butyrate is known to be an important volatile fatty acid vfa produced in sludge fermentation nevertheless the impact of butyrate on the pao gao competition is not well understood especially at high temperature the results of this study demonstrate that butyrate as a supplemental or sole carbon source could be promising for ebpr in tropical climates when the carbon source was gradually changed from acetate to butyrate a substantial pao population was found under both conditions despite a substantial shift in the abundance of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis decreased from 37 4 to 13 9 to rhodocyclaceae increased from 2 0 to 14 5 where both organisms likely played an important role in p removal thus a relatively stable p removal performance was realized throughout the whole operation period nevertheless butyrate had a negative impact on gaos the biomass concentration and microbial diversity continually decreased in the gao reactor and candidatus competibacter phosphatis reduced from 27 3 to 6 2 where the dominant population was replaced by zoogloea with the addition of butyrate as carbon source the total amount of synthesized phas reduced in both pao and gao cultures and the composition of pha was greatly changed the presence of a novel pha fraction phh may disturb the microbial activity in the aerobic phase where the gao culture was more severely affected glycogen cycling also seemed to be limited in both reactors this could reduce the gao metabolism in both cultures and favor paos and p removal furthermore the biomass growth rate of the pao culture was higher than that of gao when fed with butyrate which also provides pao a competitive advantage all the above results indicate that butyrate could not be well metabolized by gaos but could provide paos a competitive advantage thus mixed vfas i e acetate propionate and butyrate are likely to favor paos over gaos in ebpr processes operated in warm climates where the impact of substantial butyrate fractions represents an advantage

can be difficult to maintain especially when the operational temperature is above 25 c lopez vazquez et al 2009 whang and park 2006 one reason of ebpr performance fluctuation or even failure is that glycogen accumulating organisms gaos compete for limited carbon sources with paos without contributing to phosphorus removal oehmen et al 2006 saunders et al 2003 it is known that at higher

ratio successfully demonstrated that ebpr can be operated at high temperature ong et al 2014 shen et al 2017 nevertheless the pao gao competition requires study focused on suitable carbon sources to promote ebpr at high temperature qiu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a while commercially obtained carbon sources are commonly applied in wastewater treatment plants to enhance denitrification and ebpr volatile fatty acids vfas produced from sludge fermentation have been widely studied and implemented in ebpr systems cao et al 2019 shen and zhou 2016 thomas et al 2003 tong and chen 2007 acetate and propionate are two most common vfas used to drive ebpr systems because they are abundant in wastewater and fermentation liquids it should be noted that butyrate is another abundant vfa in fermentation liquids which may be used to support ebpr systems as well yuan et al 2009 showed that butyrate was the third most abundant vfa 12 16 of total vfa in fermented waste activated sludge while ahn and speece 2006 also displayed that around 20 of butyrate could be formed during primary sludge fermentation esteban gutiérrez et al 2018 demonstrated that winery wastewater fermented at acidic ph could produce 60 of butyrate per total vfa while xie et al 2014 showed that butyrate accounted for 10 76 of the vfa species with different ph adjustment strategies during fermentation of cassava thin stillage despite the potential significance of butyrate ebpr studies have more widely focused on acetate and propionate where knowledge about butyrate on the pao gao competition at high temperature is particularly lacking begum and batista 2014 reported that butyrate could enrich more accumulibacter than defluviicoccus while competibacter was not selected the study also concluded that the uptake rate of butyrate was slow and p release lasted the entire anaerobic phase begum and batista 2014 with organic carbon entering the aerobic phase which may have caused instability to the system it should be noted that the study was performed at room temperature 22 c that is in fact already a favorable temperature for pao s enrichment thus a high temperature system with butyrate as carbon source could be even more challenging since competition by gaos is typically stronger at high temperatures knowledge regarding the impact of butyrate on paos and gaos at such high temperatures is needed in order to control gaos under such challenging conditions other studies incorporating butyrate include levantesi et al 2002 who demonstrated a high efficiency and stable ebpr with a mixture of acetate propionate and butyrate and accumulibacter was enriched up to 53 of the total population where the consumption rate of butyrate was comparable to that of acetate the impact of vfa other than acetate such as propionate or butyrate has been suggested to have a significant impact on the pao gao competition even at levels of approximately 25 of the total vfa lopez vazquez et al 2009 recently wang et al 2020b indicated that the consumption rate of butyrate in mixed carbon sources including acetate and propionate was higher than its use as the sole carbon source by paos at high temperature while butyrate has potential to be used as a supplemental carbon source to promote ebpr there is no clear evidence of its impact on the pao gao competition and on ebpr performance the metabolism of pao and gao using butyrate is quite unclear currently and must be understood in order to be able to assess the impact of this carbon source this motivated the enrichment of pao and gao cultures in this study in order to be able to assess these factors for the first time which is of particular relevance at high temperatures where gaos display a higher level of metabolic activity therefore this study aimed to investigate how butyrate would affect the competition between paos and gaos at high temperature two sequencing batch reactors sbrs were operated for seven months to enrich paos or gaos the carbon source of the two reactors was gradually shifted from acetate to butyrate to investigate the effects of butyrate on pao and gao cultures in terms of system performance microbial community selection and metabolic activities this study provides insight into the impact of butyrate from sludge fermentation liquors on ebpr systems providing a comparison of this important carbon source with acetate and propionate which are much more commonly studied vfas 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor operation two sbrs with a 6 l working volume were seeded from two lab scale acetate fed enriched pao and gao cultures respectively wang et al 2020a a 6 h cycle consisted of three loops and one hour settling and decanting period each loop contained 30 min continuous anaerobic feeding followed by a 10 min anaerobic period and a 60 min aerobic period one liter of synthetic wastewater was fed in every loop both reactors were fed with total 400 mg cod l 20 mg po4 3 p l pao reactor or 2 mg po4 3 p l gao reactor and other necessary nutrients shen et al 2017 during three stages of operation for the pao reactor a phosphorus concentration that is similar as sewage was used intending to perform ebpr to remove p from the wastewater such concentration will not affect gao s activity and growth if they exist in the same system for the gao reactor the lower influent p concentration was applied aiming to create a condition that is favorable for gao in order to increase gao s abundance in this way an enriched culture could be obtained to study their metabolism in stage 1 acetate was fed as the sole carbon source for both reactors in stage 2 carbon source was changed to a mixture of acetate and butyrate in pre designed ratios where the acetate proportion was gradually reduced and the butyrate content increased table 1 in stage 3 100 butyrate was fed as the sole carbon source the temperature was controlled at 30 1 c and ph was maintained between 7 0 8 0 by addition of 0 5 m hcl or 0 5 m naoh the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h and sludge retention time srt was 7 14 days more details are given in the results section nitrogen was sparged into the reactors during the feeding and anaerobic periods while the dissolved oxygen do level was maintained between 1 0 2 0 mg l during the aerobic period 2 2 batch experiments batch tests were performed to study the anaerobic butyrate uptake kinetics of paos and gaos as well as their aerobic kinetics one liter of sludge was withdrawn from the parent reactors at the end of the aerobic phase during stage 3 the sludge was washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs and resuspended with 1 l of trace nutrients shen et al 2017 to initiate the anaerobic phase 500 ml of supernatant was discarded and replaced with synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater consisted of 400 mg cod l butyrate and other trace nutrients similar to the parent reactors the batch tests consisted of 2 h of anaerobic phase and 3 h of aerobic phase sludge was washed with pbs to remove any remaining cod at the end of the anaerobic phase the amount of phosphorus released was added back to the pao culture at the beginning of the aerobic phase replicate batch experiments were carried out in each case other operational conditions such as do ph and temperature were similar to the parent reactors 2 3 chemical analysis mixed liquor total suspended solids mltss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss were collected at the end of the aerobic phase in cycle studies and batch tests and determined according to standard methods apha 2005 liquid samples from reactor cycle studies and batch experiments were immediately filtered by 0 45 µm membranes for volatile fatty acids vfas phosphorus and ammonium analysis vfas were analyzed by flame ionization detector gas chromatography phosphorus and ammonia were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 solid samples were collected for phas and glycogen analysis glycogen was extracted according to zeng et al 2003 and measured by an agilent hplc system phas including poly β hydroxybutyrate phb poly β hydroxyvalerate phv poly β hydroxy 2 methylvalerate ph2mv poly β hydroxy 4 methylvalerate ph4mv and poly β hydroxyhexanoate phh were extracted according to oehmen et al 2005 and analyzed by shimadzu gc ms system le et al 2020 the biomass growth rate was calculated through ammonium consumption based on a chemical formula for biomass of ch1 8o0 5n0 2 zeng et al 2003 the active biomass concentration x was calculated as vss pha glycogen 2 4 microbial community analysis sludge samples were collected from pao and gao reactors during the three stages for dna analysis in stage 1 dna samples were collected on the first day and 30th day table 1 in stage 2 dna samples were collected on the

2020 microbial abundance at the genus level was visualized by the circos on line program http circos ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 sbrs acclimation a stable phosphorus removal performance was found during stage 1 in the pao reactor fig 1 a at the beginning of stage 2 when butyrate was introduced the effluent p concentration increased slightly while both the vss and active biomass concentration table 4 and table s1 decreased after a few days acclimation the phosphorus removal performance and biomass concentration gradually recovered during the periodic increases in the butyrate fraction similar responses were occasionally noted fig 1a particularly at a 50 butyrate fraction day 92 109 during this time the effluent p accumulated and the biomass concentration reduced sharply due to carbon source leakage to the aerobic phase thus the srt was prolonged from 7 to 10 days to prevent sludge washout the performance gradually recovered and a stable p removal performance lasted for the rest of stage 2 butyrate was the sole carbon source for the pao reactor in stage 3 where stable p removal performance lasted more than two months till the end of the experiment overall while butyrate may not be as efficient as acetate and propionate to support biomass growth necessitating a higher srt it could be still utilized to maintain good ebpr performance at 30 c average p removal efficiency was 94 5 3 5 93 3 8 8 95 7 3 1 and average vss tss was 0 53 0 59 and 0 62 in stages 1 2 and 3 respectively the biomass concentration of the gao reactor in stage 1 was relatively stable however the active biomass concentration started to decrease with the addition of butyrate at the beginning of stage 2 fig 1b table 4 and table s1 in order to avoid the sludge being washed out and retain the enrichment of gaos the srt was also prolonged from 7 to 10 days from day 55 although the biomass concentration stopped declining and remained constant throughout the rest of stage 2 it did not recover to the level of stage 1 unlike the pao reactor in stage 3 the biomass concentration reduced further when butyrate was used as the sole carbon source the srt was further prolonged to 14 days from day 170 thus a longer srt was required to maintain a similar biomass concentration in the gao reactor as compared to that of the pao reactor these results suggested that butyrate may not be as suitable to enrich for gao growth under similar operational conditions 3 2 microbial community 3 2 1 alpha and beta diversity the microbial population shift along the acclimation of the pao and gao reactors to butyrate feed can be found in fig s1 in this section one sample from each stage i e 100 acetate stage 1 50 acetate 50 butyrate stage 2 and 100 butyrate stage 3 was chosen for comparison and discussion table 2 when the carbon source was gradually changed from acetate in stage 1 to butyrate in stage 3 the number of otus in the pao reactor did not change substantially while a gradual shift was observed in the gao reactor table 2 the richness indicated by ace index and diversity indicated by shannon index in the pao reactor slightly decreased by 3 6 and 10 9 respectively while more pronounced decreasing trends of microbial richness and diversity were found in the gao reactor decreased by 9 5 and 18 1 respectively the present results indicate that butyrate reduced the microbial diversities of both pao and gao cultures and had greater influences on the gao culture pcoa analysis based on bray curtis dissimilarity further showed that changing carbon sources from acetate to butyrate substantially shaped the microbial community in both the pao and the gao reactors fig 2 moreover the microbial communities in the pao and the gao reactors were distinct regardless of the carbon source with a closer relationship observed between the butyrate fed and acetate butyrate fed pao or gao reactors respectively 3 2 2 microbial taxa the genera with abundance greater than 5 in the pao and gao reactors were selected for circos visualization fig 3 candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis or accumulibacter was the most abundant genus in the pao reactor the abundance of accumulibacter in 100 acetate 50 acetate 50 butyrate and 100 butyrate as feed samples were 37 4 8 4 and 13 9 respectively besides the abundance of non accumulibacter rhodocyclaceae was also substantial in the pao reactor at 2 0 12 3 and 14 5 some microorganisms belonging to the rhodocyclaceae family but not related to candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis could be potential paos performing ebpr datta and goel 2010 wu et al 2013 also showed that rhodocyclaceae had the capacity to perform p removal and its presence ensured stable and efficient p removal when the candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis abundance decreased a relatively stable phosphorus removal performance could be maintained in this study which may be related to the enrichment of rhodocyclaceae when the accumulibacter population was reduced in the gao reactor candidatus competibacter phosphatis or competibacter was dominant when acetate existed with an abundance of 27 3 and 19 4 in the samples of 100 acetate and 50 acetate 50 butyrate as feed respectively but this population reduced to 6 2 with butyrate as the sole feed this suggests that butyrate was less suitable to support the growth of competibacter and the overall biomass in the gao culture which is evidenced by its reduced biomass concentration meanwhile zoogloea was enriched in the gao reactor when the carbon source changed from acetate to butyrate with an abundance of 0 2 11 7 and 38 0 respectively zoogloea have long been observed as floc producing bacteria in activated sludge systems rosselló mora et al 1995 and its enrichment may indicate carbon source leakage into the aerobic phase during the turbulent period of pao reactor operation a small amount of zoogloea was also enriched fig 3 and fig s1 when the performance of the pao reactor recovered the population of zoogloea greatly decreased however zoogloea remained dominant in the gao reactor till the end of stage 3 no defluviicoccus vanus gaos dvgaos was detected in this study in either the pao or gao reactor wang et al 2020a showed that dvgaos were less competitive than paos at 30 c due to the lower maximum anaerobic substrate uptake rate according to the microbial community analysis overall both accumulibacter and competibacter were negatively affected but accumulibacter and potentially some other rhodocyclaceae related paos better adapted to butyrate than competibacter 3 3 pao gao metabolism 3 3 1 cycle studies cycle studies of the two reactors were performed at every carbon source mixing ratio in stages 1 3 three cycle study results are reported here at acetate butyrate ratios of 10 0 stage 1 5 5 stage 2 and 0 10 stage 3 to illustrate pao and gao performance the cycle study results of other mixing ratios are presented in the supporting information si the pao reactor displayed a clear pao phenotype within every sub cycle throughout the three stages regardless of the carbon mixing ratio fig 4 a b c and fig s2 carbon source was completely consumed with p release during the feeding and anaerobic phase and glycogen hydrolysis as well as phas synthesis were observed in the aerobic phase p was completely removed accompanied by phas degradation and glycogen replenishment there was no clear trend of p release to vfa uptake ratio p c ratio among all the cycles although a higher p c ratio was found when the acetate to butyrate ratio was close to 1 1 table 3 table s1 it is noteworthy that in stage 1 phosphorus uptake mainly occurred in the first 15 min of the aerobic phase 2 58 mmol g vss h while in the second and third stages the phosphorus uptake slowed down 1 12 mmol g vss h and 0 8 mmol g vss h fig 4a b c a higher p uptake rate was found when acetate was more dominant in the feed table 3 table s1 the slower p uptake rate may be related to the quantity and composition of pha produced with butyrate feeding with the increase of butyrate in the feed the total pha c ratio was reduced by 34 compared to using acetate as sole carbon source table 3 and table s1 considering the decreased pha storage and that pha degradation by paos is a 2 3 order kinetic reaction murnleitner et al 1997 the 17 decrease in specific pha storage per active biomass with an acetate feed 0 30 c mmol c mmol and a butyrate feed 0 25 c mmol c mmol would decrease the maximum pha degradation rate by 11 4 this decreased pha degradation would in turn lower the atp available for p uptake and other cell functions i e biomass growth glycogen replenishment maintenance furthermore the shift in pha composition where the phh fraction was increased may also have impacted the aerobic kinetics nevertheless the net p removal was comparable in all cycles indicating that the lower pha content only reduced the p uptake rate and not the efficiency of p uptake table 4 in addition the anaerobic gly c and aerobic gly pha ratios were relatively higher in stage 1 vs stage 2 and 3 indicating that glycogen turnover was limited with the addition of butyrate similar to the pao reactor the pha storage of the gao reactor was also reduced with the addition of butyrate though much more than as compared to paos where a 58 reduction in pha storage was found from stage 1 to 3 correspondingly the maximum pha degradation rate decreased by 57 2 due to the reduction in specific pha storage per active biomass with an acetate feed 1 32 c mmol c mmol and a butyrate feed 0 37 c mmol c mmol this reduced pha storage would clearly impact the pha oxidation rate much more in the case of gaos than paos furthermore the pha content shifted in the gao producing much more phh at the expense of phb and the glycogen degradation was also reduced by 61 table 3 the reduced pha and glycogen cycling most likely reflects that butyrate is a less suitable substrate to support gao s metabolism the decline in glycogen turnover would be detrimental to gaos but paos would be able to rely on their polyphosphate for atp production while nadh generation could be provided by other pathways including the tca cycle or butyrate degradation to e g acetyl coa oehmen et al 2010 santos et al 2020 3 3 2 batch experiments in order to further investigate the competition between pao and gao for butyrate batch experiments were conducted and the results are shown in fig 5 and table 5 butyrate in the pao reactor was completely consumed during the 2 h anaerobic phase while 35 1 of the added butyrate remained in the gao reactor fig 5 the change in feeding rate during the batch tests could result in incomplete substrate consumption at the end of the anaerobic phase nevertheless the anaerobic specific maximum vfa uptake rate of pao and gao cultures is comparable given the lower active biomass concentration of the gao culture table 5 most of the pao and gao stoichiometric transformations observed in the batch tests were consistent with that observed in the cycle studies some parameters that differed include the pha c storage ratio and the pha fractionation the change in feeding rate in the pao and gao reactors may have led to reduced butyrate loss through fermentation and decarboxylation impacting the quantity of pha stored and its monomeric composition importantly the biomass growth rate of pao was higher than that of gao table 5 since the anaerobic substrate uptake rate is comparable between pao and gao the aerobic biomass yield pao vs gao 0 13 vs 0 07 g vss g cod likely plays a key role in the pao gao competition with this carbon source the slower growth rate of gao may also explain the lower biomass concentration observed in the parent reactor and why the srt had to be extended more in the gao reactor than the pao reactor 3 4 impact of butyrate on ebpr system through long term reactor operation and short term batch experiment results it is concluded that butyrate is a promising carbon source for ebpr systems in tropical climates a relatively stable p removal performance was realized with butyrate in a pao reactor throughout the whole operation process whereas butyrate may not be suitable for gaos under similar operational conditions with addition of butyrate in the feed the total synthesized pha reduced and the composition of pha greatly changed such changes likely disturbed the microbial activity in the aerobic phase which severely affected the gao culture while both accumulibacter and competibacter were negatively affected to a certain extent accumulibacter and other rhodocyclaceae paos appear to adapt better to butyrate than competibacter though pao could completely consume butyrate after acclimation the specific maxmium uptake rate of butyrate 2 59 c mmol g vss h in batch experiments was still much lower than those of acetate and propionate by pao at 30 c acetate 6 30 and propionate 9 17 c mmol g vss h wang et al 2020b and led to a lower p uptake rate ebpr plants with very high butyrate fractions would likely require longer hrts and srts to achieve good p removal and system stability nevertheless the abundance of butyrate in fermented liquors is typically less than acetate reducing the risk of butyrate entering into the subsequent aerobic phase and de stablising the ebpr process despite the fact that the accumulibacter enrichment with butyrate is not as abundant as that in acetate and or propionate fed cultures the enrichment of other non accumulibacter like rhodocyclaceae in the pao reactor can greatly contribute to phosphorus removal butyrate is often the second or third most abundant vfa after acetate and propionate in the wastewater and fermented liquids this study for the first time revealed the function of butyrate in the competition of pao and gao and reported that butyrate would inhibit gao s metabolism by reducing glycogen and pha turnover significantly thus using butyrate in mixed vfa sludge fermentation liquors is likely beneficial to ebpr reducing the competition from gao at high temperature 4 conclusions a stable phosphorus removal performance could be realized using butyrate as mixed or sole carbon source under tropical climate when the carbon source is gradually changed from acetate to butyrate both accumulibacter and competibacter are negatively affected but accumulibacter could better adapt to butyrate the enriched rhodocyclaceae in pao reactor also assisted in p removal besides the net pha production and the composition of pha were greatly changed in both cultures which affected their aerobic metabolism of the gao culture much more severely than the pao culture glycogen turnover was limited in both reactors which could provide competitive advantages for paos thus butyrate could be used as a carbon source to promote ebpr and also suppress the population of gaos at high

anaerobic period and a 60 min aerobic period one liter of synthetic wastewater was fed in every loop both reactors were fed with total 400 mg cod l 20 mg po4 3 p l pao reactor or 2 mg po4 3 p l gao reactor and other necessary nutrients shen et al 2017 during three stages of operation for the pao reactor a phosphorus concentration that is similar as sewage was used intending to perform ebpr to remove p from the wastewater such concentration will not affect gao s activity and growth if they exist in the same system for the gao reactor the lower influent p concentration was applied aiming to create a condition that is favorable for gao in order to increase gao s abundance in this way an enriched culture could be obtained to study their metabolism in stage 1 acetate was fed as the sole carbon source for both reactors in stage 2 carbon source was changed to a mixture of acetate and butyrate in pre designed ratios where the acetate proportion was gradually reduced and the butyrate content increased table 1 in stage 3 100 butyrate was fed as the sole carbon source the temperature was controlled at 30 1 c and ph was maintained between 7 0 8 0 by addition of 0 5 m hcl or 0 5 m naoh the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h and sludge retention time srt was 7 14 days more details are given in the results section nitrogen was sparged into the reactors during the feeding and anaerobic periods while the dissolved oxygen do level was maintained between 1 0 2 0 mg l during the aerobic period 2 2 batch experiments batch tests were performed to study the anaerobic butyrate uptake kinetics of paos and gaos as well as their aerobic kinetics one liter of sludge was withdrawn from the parent reactors at the end of the aerobic phase during stage 3 the sludge was washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs and resuspended with 1 l of trace nutrients shen et al 2017 to initiate the anaerobic phase 500 ml of supernatant was discarded and replaced with synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater consisted of 400 mg cod l butyrate and other trace nutrients similar to the parent reactors the batch tests consisted of 2 h of anaerobic phase and 3 h of aerobic phase sludge was washed with pbs to remove any remaining cod at the end of the anaerobic phase the amount of phosphorus released was added back to the pao culture at the beginning of the aerobic phase replicate batch experiments were carried out in each case other operational conditions such as do ph and temperature were similar to the parent reactors 2 3 chemical analysis mixed liquor total suspended solids mltss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss were collected at the end of the aerobic phase in cycle studies and batch tests and determined according to standard methods apha 2005 liquid samples from reactor cycle studies and batch experiments were immediately filtered by 0 45 µm membranes for volatile fatty acids vfas phosphorus and ammonium analysis vfas were analyzed by flame ionization detector gas chromatography phosphorus and ammonia were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 solid samples were collected for phas and glycogen analysis glycogen was extracted according to zeng et al 2003 and measured by an agilent hplc system phas including poly β hydroxybutyrate phb poly β hydroxyvalerate phv poly β hydroxy 2 methylvalerate ph2mv poly β hydroxy 4 methylvalerate ph4mv and poly β hydroxyhexanoate phh were extracted according to oehmen et al 2005 and analyzed by shimadzu gc ms system le et al 2020 the biomass growth rate was calculated through ammonium consumption based on a chemical formula for biomass of ch1 8o0 5n0 2 zeng et al 2003 the active biomass concentration x was calculated as vss pha glycogen 2 4 microbial community analysis sludge samples were collected from pao and gao reactors during the three stages for dna analysis in stage 1 dna samples were collected on the first day and 30th day table 1 in stage 2 dna samples were collected on the last day of each different acetate butyrate ratio in stage 3 dna samples were collected on the 190th day total genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was checked using 1 agarose gel and dna concentration and purity were determined with a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo

2020 microbial abundance at the genus level was visualized by the circos on line program http circos ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 sbrs acclimation a stable phosphorus removal performance was found during stage 1 in the pao reactor fig 1 a at the beginning of stage 2 when butyrate was introduced the effluent p concentration increased slightly while both the vss and active biomass concentration table 4 and table s1 decreased after a few days acclimation the phosphorus removal performance and biomass concentration gradually recovered during the periodic increases in the butyrate fraction similar responses were occasionally noted fig 1a particularly at a 50 butyrate fraction day 92 109 during this time the effluent p accumulated and the biomass concentration reduced sharply due to carbon source leakage to the aerobic phase thus the srt was prolonged from 7 to 10 days to prevent sludge washout the performance gradually recovered and a stable p removal performance lasted for the rest of stage 2 butyrate was the sole carbon source for the pao reactor in stage 3 where stable p removal performance lasted more than two months till the end of the experiment overall while butyrate may not be as efficient as acetate and propionate to support biomass growth necessitating a higher srt it could be still utilized to maintain good ebpr performance at 30 c average p removal efficiency was 94 5 3 5 93 3 8 8 95 7 3 1 and average vss tss was 0 53 0 59 and 0 62 in stages 1 2 and 3 respectively the biomass concentration of the gao reactor in stage 1 was relatively stable however the active biomass concentration started to decrease with the addition of butyrate at the beginning of stage 2 fig 1b table 4 and table s1 in order to avoid the sludge being washed out and retain the enrichment of gaos the srt was also prolonged from 7 to 10 days from day 55 although the biomass concentration stopped declining and remained constant throughout the rest of stage 2 it did not recover to the level of stage 1 unlike the pao reactor in stage 3 the biomass concentration reduced further when butyrate was used as the sole carbon source the srt was further prolonged to 14 days from day 170 thus a longer srt was required to maintain a similar biomass concentration in the gao reactor as compared to that of the pao reactor these results suggested that butyrate may not be as suitable to enrich for gao growth under similar operational conditions 3 2 microbial community 3 2 1 alpha and beta diversity the microbial population shift along the acclimation of the pao and gao reactors to butyrate feed can be found in fig s1 in this section one sample from each stage i e 100 acetate stage 1 50 acetate 50 butyrate stage 2 and 100 butyrate stage 3 was chosen for comparison and discussion table 2 when the carbon source was gradually changed from acetate in stage 1 to butyrate in stage 3 the number of otus in the pao reactor did not change substantially while a gradual shift was observed in the gao reactor table 2 the richness indicated by ace index and diversity indicated by shannon index in the pao reactor slightly decreased by 3 6 and 10 9 respectively while more pronounced decreasing trends of microbial richness and diversity were found in the gao reactor decreased by 9 5 and 18 1 respectively the present results indicate that butyrate reduced the microbial diversities of both pao and gao cultures and had greater influences on the gao culture pcoa analysis based on bray curtis dissimilarity further showed that changing carbon sources from acetate to butyrate substantially shaped the microbial community in both the pao and the gao reactors fig 2 moreover the microbial communities in the pao and the gao reactors were distinct regardless of the carbon source with a closer relationship observed between the butyrate fed and acetate butyrate fed pao or gao reactors respectively 3 2 2 microbial taxa the genera with abundance greater than 5 in the pao and gao reactors were selected for circos visualization fig 3 candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis or accumulibacter was the most abundant genus in the pao reactor the abundance of accumulibacter in 100 acetate 50 acetate 50 butyrate and 100 butyrate as feed samples were 37 4 8 4 and 13 9 respectively besides the abundance of non accumulibacter rhodocyclaceae was also substantial in the pao reactor at 2 0 12 3 and 14 5 some microorganisms belonging to the rhodocyclaceae family but not related to candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis could be potential paos performing ebpr datta and goel 2010 wu et al 2013 also showed that rhodocyclaceae had the capacity to perform p removal and its presence ensured stable and efficient p removal when the candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis abundance decreased a relatively stable phosphorus removal performance could be maintained in this study which may be related to the enrichment of rhodocyclaceae when the accumulibacter population was reduced in the gao reactor candidatus competibacter phosphatis or competibacter was dominant when acetate existed with an abundance of 27 3 and 19 4 in the samples of 100 acetate and 50 acetate 50 butyrate as feed respectively but this population reduced to 6 2 with butyrate as the sole feed this suggests that butyrate was less suitable to support the growth of competibacter and the overall biomass in the gao culture which is evidenced by its reduced biomass concentration meanwhile zoogloea was enriched in the gao reactor when the carbon source changed from acetate to butyrate with an abundance of 0 2 11 7 and 38 0 respectively zoogloea have long been observed as floc producing bacteria in activated sludge systems rosselló mora et al 1995 and its enrichment may indicate carbon source leakage into the aerobic phase during the turbulent period of pao reactor operation a small amount of zoogloea was also enriched fig 3 and fig s1 when the performance of the pao reactor recovered the population of zoogloea greatly decreased however zoogloea remained dominant in the gao reactor till the end of stage 3 no defluviicoccus vanus gaos dvgaos was detected in this study in either the pao or gao reactor wang et al 2020a showed that dvgaos were less competitive than paos at 30 c due to the lower maximum anaerobic substrate uptake rate according to the microbial community analysis overall both accumulibacter and competibacter were negatively affected but accumulibacter and potentially some other rhodocyclaceae related paos better adapted to butyrate than competibacter 3 3 pao gao metabolism 3 3 1 cycle studies cycle studies of the two reactors were performed at every carbon source mixing ratio in stages 1 3 three cycle study results are reported here at acetate butyrate ratios of 10 0 stage 1 5 5 stage 2 and 0 10 stage 3 to illustrate pao and gao performance the cycle study results of other mixing ratios are presented in the supporting information si the pao reactor displayed a clear pao phenotype within every sub cycle throughout the three stages regardless of the carbon mixing ratio fig 4 a b c and fig s2 carbon source was completely consumed with p release during the feeding and anaerobic phase and glycogen hydrolysis as well as phas synthesis were observed in the aerobic phase p was completely removed accompanied by phas degradation and glycogen replenishment there was no clear trend of p release to vfa uptake ratio p c ratio among all the cycles although a higher p c ratio was found when the acetate to butyrate ratio was close to 1 1 table 3 table s1 it is noteworthy that in stage 1 phosphorus uptake mainly occurred in the first 15 min of the aerobic phase 2 58 mmol g vss h while in the second and third stages the phosphorus uptake slowed down 1 12 mmol g vss h and 0 8 mmol g vss h fig 4a b c a higher p uptake rate was found when acetate was more dominant in the feed table 3 table s1 the slower p uptake rate may be related to the quantity and composition of pha produced with butyrate feeding with the increase of butyrate in the feed the total pha c ratio was reduced by 34 compared to using acetate as sole carbon source table 3 and table s1 considering the decreased pha storage and that pha degradation by paos is a 2 3 order kinetic reaction murnleitner et al 1997 the 17 decrease in specific pha storage per active biomass with an acetate feed 0 30 c mmol c mmol and a butyrate feed 0 25 c mmol c mmol would decrease the maximum pha degradation rate by 11 4 this decreased pha degradation would in turn lower the atp available for p uptake and other cell functions i e biomass growth glycogen replenishment maintenance furthermore the shift in pha composition where the phh fraction was increased may also have impacted the aerobic kinetics nevertheless the net p removal was comparable in all cycles indicating that the lower pha content only reduced the p uptake rate and not the efficiency of p uptake table 4 in addition the anaerobic gly c and aerobic gly pha ratios were relatively higher in stage 1 vs stage 2 and 3 indicating that glycogen turnover was limited with the addition of butyrate similar to the pao reactor the pha storage of the gao reactor was also reduced with the addition of butyrate though much more than as compared to paos where a 58 reduction in pha storage was found from stage 1 to 3 correspondingly the maximum pha degradation rate decreased by 57 2 due to the reduction in specific pha storage per active biomass with an acetate feed 1 32 c mmol c mmol and a butyrate feed 0 37 c mmol c mmol this reduced pha storage would clearly impact the pha oxidation rate much more in the case of gaos than paos furthermore the pha content shifted in the gao producing much more phh at the expense of phb and the glycogen degradation was also reduced by 61 table 3 the reduced pha and glycogen cycling most likely reflects that butyrate is a less suitable substrate to support gao s metabolism the decline in glycogen turnover would be detrimental to gaos but paos would be able to rely on their polyphosphate for atp production while nadh generation could be provided by other pathways including the tca cycle or butyrate degradation to e g acetyl coa oehmen et al 2010 santos et al 2020 3 3 2 batch experiments in order to further investigate the competition between pao and gao for butyrate batch experiments were conducted and the results are shown in fig 5 and table 5 butyrate in the pao reactor was completely consumed during the 2 h anaerobic phase while 35 1 of the added butyrate remained in the gao reactor fig 5 the change in feeding rate during the batch tests could result in incomplete substrate consumption at the end of the anaerobic phase nevertheless the anaerobic specific maximum vfa uptake rate of pao and gao cultures is comparable given the lower active biomass concentration of the gao culture table 5 most of the pao and gao stoichiometric transformations observed in the batch tests were consistent with that observed in the cycle studies some parameters that differed include the pha c storage ratio and the pha fractionation the change in feeding rate in the pao and gao reactors may have led to reduced butyrate loss through fermentation and decarboxylation impacting the quantity of pha stored and its monomeric composition importantly the biomass growth rate of pao was higher than that of gao table 5 since the anaerobic substrate uptake rate is comparable between pao and gao the aerobic biomass yield pao vs gao 0 13 vs 0 07 g vss g cod likely plays a key role in the pao gao competition with this carbon source the slower growth rate of gao may also explain the lower biomass concentration observed in the parent reactor and why the srt had to be extended more in the gao reactor than the pao reactor 3 4 impact of butyrate on ebpr system through long term reactor operation and short term batch experiment results it is concluded that butyrate is a promising carbon source for ebpr systems in tropical climates a relatively stable p removal performance was realized with butyrate in a pao reactor throughout the whole operation process whereas butyrate may not be suitable for gaos under similar operational conditions with addition of butyrate in the feed the total synthesized pha reduced and the composition of pha greatly changed such changes likely disturbed the microbial activity in the aerobic phase which severely affected the gao culture while both accumulibacter and competibacter were negatively affected to a certain extent accumulibacter and other rhodocyclaceae paos appear to adapt better to butyrate than competibacter though pao could completely consume butyrate after acclimation the specific maxmium uptake rate of butyrate 2 59 c mmol g vss h in batch experiments was still much lower than those of acetate and propionate by pao at 30 c acetate 6 30 and propionate 9 17 c mmol g vss h wang et al 2020b and led to a lower p uptake rate ebpr plants with very high butyrate fractions would likely require longer hrts and srts to achieve good p removal and system stability nevertheless the abundance of butyrate in fermented liquors is typically less than acetate reducing the risk of butyrate entering into the subsequent aerobic phase and de stablising the ebpr process despite the fact that the accumulibacter enrichment with butyrate is not as abundant as that in acetate and or propionate fed cultures the enrichment of other non accumulibacter like rhodocyclaceae in the pao reactor can greatly contribute to phosphorus removal butyrate is often the second or third most abundant vfa after acetate and propionate in the wastewater and fermented liquids this study for the first time revealed the function of butyrate in the competition of pao and gao and reported that butyrate would inhibit gao s metabolism by reducing glycogen and pha turnover significantly thus using butyrate in mixed vfa sludge fermentation liquors is likely beneficial to ebpr reducing the competition from gao at high temperature 4 conclusions a stable phosphorus removal performance could be realized using butyrate as mixed or sole carbon source under tropical climate when the carbon source is gradually changed from acetate to butyrate both accumulibacter and competibacter are negatively affected but accumulibacter could better adapt to butyrate the enriched rhodocyclaceae in pao reactor also assisted in p removal besides the net pha production and the composition of pha were greatly changed in both cultures which affected their aerobic metabolism of the gao culture much more severely than the pao culture glycogen turnover was limited in both reactors which could provide competitive advantages for paos thus butyrate could be used as a carbon source to promote ebpr and also suppress the population of gaos at high

17171,treated wastewater tww irrigation is a useful counter measure against the depletion of freshwater fw resources however tww contains several contaminants of emerging concern such as antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args thus tww irrigation might promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance in soil environments in the present work we hypothesized that the arg load and irrigation intensity define the effect of tww irrigation on arg spread dynamics in soil this hypothesis was tested using a multiphase approach a comparing soil from a full scale commercially operated tww irrigated field with non irrigated soil b long term sampling of the tww irrigated field over one year with different irrigation intensities and intercepted by irrigation breaks and c laboratory scale soil microcosms irrigated with tww compared to fw six args the integrase gene inti1 and the 16s rrna were quantified using qpcr in addition effects of tww irrigation on bacterial community composition of microcosm samples were analysed with 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the genes sul1 qnrs bla oxa 58 tet m and inti1 were significantly more abundant in the tww irrigated field soil whereas bla ctx m 32 and bla tem the least abundant genes in the tww irrigation showed higher abundance in the non irrigated soil the relative abundance of sul1 qnrs bla oxa 58 tet m and inti1 correlated with tww irrigation intensity and decreased during irrigation breaks despite the decrease the levels of these genes remained consistently higher than the non irrigated soil indicating persistence upon their introduction into the soil microcosm experiments verified observations from the field study tww irrigation promoted the spread of args and inti1 into soil at far elevated levels compared to fw irrigation however the impact of tww irrigation on 16s rrna absolute abundance and the soil microbial community composition was negligible in conclusion the impact of tww irrigation depends mainly on the introduced arg load and the irrigation intensity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords args wastewater reuse topsoil treated wastewater irrigation freshwater irrigation 1 introduction wastewater reuse has recently gained popularity in arid semi arid areas as an action against the depletion of freshwater fw resources for irrigation purposes paranychianakis et al 2015 the rising temperatures and lower precipitation rates are expected to increase the relevance of treated wastewater tww irrigation even in northern european countries paranychianakis et al 2015 maaß et al 2016 despite the usefulness of tww irrigation concerns regarding this practice originate from the introduction of contaminants of emerging concern into the soil environment michael et al 2013 these contaminants include pharmaceutical residues michael et al 2013 antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args manaia et al 2018 caucci et al 2016 pärnänen et al 2019 cacace et al 2019 the high and increasing mortality rates due to infections with antibiotic resistant pathogens are a major global threat to human health friedman et al 2016 recently recognised by the world health organisation who 2014 the continuous release of args into natural and agricultural environments fatta kassinos et al 2011 gatica and cytryn 2013 rizzo et al 2013 christou et al 2017 could pose risks for human health specifically resistance genes can be acquired by soil bacteria trough horizontal gene transfer hgt musovic et al 2014 klümper et al 2015 and disseminate back to human associated pathogenic strains forsberg et al 2012 therefore identifying and monitoring of arb arg sources in the environment has been prioritised recently as part of the one health strategy to combat the antimicrobial resistance amr threat berendonk et al 2015 although amr is often associated with clinical environments the majority of the clinically relevant args originate from soil bacteria and have been mobilized into human pathogens cytryn 2013 nesme and simonet 2015 despite the natural occurrence of args in soil agricultural practices e g manure amendment or dairy wastewater irrigation have been identified to significantly increase their prevalence and thus the risk for dissemination of args to humans chen et al 2016 muurinen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 mckinney et al 2018 dungan et al 2018 wolters et al 2018 the impact of tww irrigation on the prevalence of args and inti1 in topsoil has been investigated in full scale agricultural systems from different countries continents with contradicting conclusions a few studies have reported that tww irrigation increases arg prevalence wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 dalkmann et al 2012 jechalke et al 2015 furthermore chen et al 2019 reported higher relative abundance of only a subset of sulphonamide tetracycline args in tww irrigated soils nevertheless other studies reported minimal impact of tww irrigation on arg prevalence in soil negreanu et al 2012 cerqueira et al 2019a 2019b in addition marano et al 2019 detected several args in higher prevalence in tww when compared to fw but reported no enrichment of args in tww irrigated soils these contradicting results could be attributed to the variability of tww quality or of tested args between the different studies in addition variations occur between the soil ecosystems of different geographical regions forsberg et al 2014 bahram et al 2018 which could potentially influence the results of each study still we consider that some important factors have so far been neglected when estimating the impact of tww irrigation on soil arg dynamics several args e g bla tem and bla ctx m variants are indigenous to soil resistomes even in the absence of anthropogenic impact cytryn 2013 nesme and simonet 2015 gatica et al 2015 cerqueira et al 2019c thus the impact of tww irrigation on their prevalence in soil might be negligible as long as these args occur in tww at low abundance for example dairy wastewater irrigation promoted the increase of several args with the exception of bla ctx m 1 dungan et al 2018 furthermore the irrigation water demand might differ for different crops or vary across different climatic seasons thus during real scale commercial tww irrigation operations the irrigation intensity fluctuates during the year consequently the applied arg loads differ dramatically between high and low intensity irrigation given the high capacity for resilience of the soil microbiome towards invasion by arb and args bahram et al 2018 low intensity irrigation might not alter soil arg profiles in addition the prevalence of args differs between irrigation waters of different quality for example args are not only abundant in tww but also well disseminated in freshwater resources used for irrigation cacace et al 2019 pantanella et al 2020 even if usually at lower absolute abundance the absolute arg abundance in combination with irrigation intensity ultimately determines the arg load that a field receives accordingly including the applied arg load in combination with soil arg background levels can substantially improve comparability between studies on tww irrigation impacts thus the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of tww irrigation on the prevalence of args in soil taking into account these factors to achieve this we applied a multiphase approach including a long term monitoring survey in a real scale tww irrigated field with varying irrigation intensity and controlled laboratory experiments for further validation we hypothesized that the arg load and irrigation intensity define the effect of tww irrigation on arg spread dynamics in soil to test the hypothesis we quantified six args inti1 and 16s rrna in a commercially operated tww irrigated field and non impacted soil to gain insights on which genes are tww related or predominant members of the native soil resistome microbiome the selection of genes was based on the framework for tww monitoring established by the nereus www nereus cost eu and answer itn www answer itn eu networks cacace et al 2019 rocha et al 2018 for example sul1 qnrs and tet m and bla oxa 58 were included for their clinical importance high occurrence rate and abundance in tww across european countries caucci et al 2016 alygizakis et al 2020 cacace et al 2019 the two final β lactamase genes bla tem and bla ctx m 32 were selected due to their clinical importance their low abundance in tww cacace et al 2019 and their known natural prevalence in soil microbiota gatica et al 2015 the integrase gene inti1 was analysed as well since is commonly used as a genetic marker for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 and frequently part of mobile gene cassettes that carry args gatica et al 2016 in addition we aimed to gain insights into the effect of irrigation intensity and irrigation breaks on arg and inti1 prevalence in soil on a real scale setting with a temporal sampling campaign of the tww irrigated field under various irrigation intensity periods we further verified the results from the real scale tww irrigation operation with performance of fw tww irrigated soil microcosms under controlled laboratory conditions while simultaneously monitoring irrigation effects on the microbial community density and composition 2 materials methods 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 agricultural practice of the sampled location field sampling took place in a real scale commercially operated tww irrigated field that belongs to braunschweig wastewater association bwa in central germany n 52 360139 e 10 398805 fig s1 s2 the soil cambisol sandy soil of the nearby area of braunschweig is deficient in nutrients and has a limited water retention capacity ternes et al 2007 maaß et al 2016 the local area farmers use tww subjected only to secondary biological treatment to counter the nutrient limitation and in case of high nutrient demand they mix tww with digested sludge ds to tackle the low nutrient retention capacity commercial tww irrigation has taken place in the local area for over 50 years ternes et al 2007 2 1 2 sampling tww irrigation impacted and non impacted soil we sampled soil not impacted by tww irrigation adjacent to the tww irrigated field along with the soil of the tww irrigated field comparative sampling took place only in may 2019 due to logistic legal issues with sampling of the adjacent area for the remainder of the sampling period the tww irrigated field was irrigated with tww in the three months leading up to this sampling campaign for both sampling sites we sampled the topsoil aseptically 10 15 cm of upper soil layer n 12 the top 10 cm of soil most severely exposed to changing environmental conditions and potentially containing crop debris were removed with a sterile spade then a 50 ml falcon tube was driven 5 cm deep into the ground to extract a representative soil core from this slightly deeper part of the topsoil with tww irrigation as the defining variable on arg abundance each soil core was transported to the lab on ice homogenized with a sterile spatula and subsequent vortexing 2000 rpm x 60 s and finally used for dna extraction the samples were stored at 20 c until dna extraction the ph of the field soil was moderately acidic 5 97 both soils contained more than 90 of sand the ph of the adjacent soil was more acidic 3 77 which was expected for this soil as it hosts coniferous vegetation mareschal et al 2010 2 1 3 long term sampling of real scale tww irrigated field along with the respective irrigation water long term sampling of the tww irrigated field started in october 2017 and lasted until december 2018 during this period the field was irrigated with tww or tww mixed with ds tww ds at different irrigation intensities intercepted by long irrigation breaks table 1 the total volume of irrigation water per irrigation event was 35 mm3 perm2 of the field the field was irrigated 10 14 times per month during periods of high intensity irrigation resulting in 350 420 mm3 m2 month in the periods of low intensity irrigation two to three irrigation events took place per month thus during low irrigation intensity periods the total irrigation volume per surface was 70 105 mm3 m2 month the soil samples 12 samples per time point were taken temporally across this gradient of irrigation intensities high irrigation intensity n 24 low irrigation intensity n 36 irrigation breaks n 36 and subsequently handled as described in the previous section furthermore samples of the respective tww irrigation water were taken frequently three replicates per time point total n 15 bacteria from water samples were captured by filtration polycarbonate 0 2 μm pore size 47 mm diameter sartorius germany of 150 ml of irrigation water and filters were stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction 2 2 microcosm experiments for microcosm experiments we sampled the soil adjacent to the tww irrigated field that was not previously impacted by tww irrigation 12 samples at 0 60 cm depth and homogenised it to create a composite sample after air drying at room temperature we sieved the soil 6 mm mesh size and used it for microcosm experiments the microcosms were assembled by acrylic cylinders of 66 cm total height and 4 5 cm radius fig s3 and an inner tube 1 5 cm radius was placed centrally to allow the collection and removal of the percolated water then the microcosms were filled with gravel size 3 mm3 in the bottom 5 cm and the previously homogenized soil up to 50 cm height resulting in a total soil volume per microcosm of 2827 6 ml the same volume of dry sieved homogenised and similarly packed soil was placed in the microcosms ensuring similar bulk density microcosms were divided into two groups with four replicate microcosms per treatment the fw group and tww group were defined with respect to the type of irrigation water tww for irrigation subjected to secondary biological treatment was obtained from an urban wastewater treatment plant nearby the dresden area kaditz germany n 51 070640 e 13 680888 the fw was collected from a shallow well depth 7 m located next to the elbe river in pirna germany n 50 965905 e 13 924034 the microcosms were irrigated with 350 ml of water which led to saturation fresh irrigation water 3 l each of fw and tww was aseptically sampled three times per week in sterile 1 l glass bottles from july to august 2019 sampled irrigation water was transported to the lab on ice homogenized by shaking and used for microcosm irrigation within the day of sampling prior to irrigation the residual water in the microcosms was removed the microcosms were placed in a controlled temperature chamber at 20 c and with controlled light conditions with 12 h light darkness both groups were initially irrigated with fw for two weeks to stabilize and equilibrate the soil conditions then the tww group switched to tww irrigation for three weeks while the fw group was continuously irrigated with fw soil samples were taken aseptically from the microcosms with a sterile spatula at 15

the programing language r r core team 2019 v 3 5 3 for generation of graphical representations with the packages ggplot wickham 2016 and ggpubr v 0 2 2 kassambara 2019 significant differences were

dunn s test v1 3 5 dinno 2016 for pairwise multiple comparisons additional statistical analysis of arg and inti1 profiles was performed with a permanova test adonis function method euclidean from the

inti1 profile the arg and inti1 profiles were significantly different between the tww irrigated field and the non impacted adjacent soil permanova euclidean distance n 12 r2 0 59 p 0 001 specifically sul1 qnrs tet m and bla oxa 58 were only present in the tww irrigated field at high relative abundance sul1 3 8 1 1 qnrs 6 1 0 9 tet m 4 8 1 4 bla oxa 58 5 3 0 9 log10 copies 16s rrna and not detected in the non impacted soil with exceptions of outliers fig 1 s4 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 n 12 the integrase gene inti1 was present in both types of soil with one order of magnitude higher relative abundance in the tww irrigated field soil wilcoxon rank sum test p 7 5 10 11 n 12 contrary bla tem and bla ctx m 32 showed higher relative abundance in the non impacted soil 4 2 0 1 and 5 7 1

information regarding the temporal dynamics of args and inti1 whether they increase instantly or are eliminated quickly during irrigation breaks in addition the two soils differed in vegetation and physicochemical conditions therefore further insights into tww irrigation effects were needed from more detailed temporal observations of the soil of the tww irrigated field 3 2 the genes sul1 inti1 qnrs tet m and bla oxa 58 were highly abundant in tww irrigation water to determine if the relative abundance of args and inti1 in the tww irrigated soil is linked to their abundance in the tww resistome tww irrigation water samples were taken for a period of one year the genes with the highest relative abundance in tww were inti1 1 8 0 6 log10 copies 16s rrna and sul1 2 0 0 3 log10 copies 16s rrna fig 2 those with the highest relative abundance in tww irrigated soil fig 1 the remaining three genes detected at higher relative abundance in tww irrigated soil were also highly abundant in tww bla oxa 58 3 1 0 3 qnrs 3 6 0 6 tet m 3 8 0 3 log10 copies 16s rrna fig 2 unsurprisingly bla tem and bla ctx m 32 displayed the lowest abundance in the irrigation water bla tem 5 8 0 3 bla ctx m 32 4 7 1 0 log10 copies 16s rrna fig 2 as digested sludge was added to the tww during a few periods of the sampling campaign its influence on the tww resistome was tested the profile of args of tww ds irrigation was similar to tww irrigation with the exception of qnrs and bla oxa 58 where their relative abundance was more than one order of magnitude higher in tww ds compared to tww fig s5 in conclusion genes with higher relative abundance in the irrigation water tww or tww ds were also found in higher relative abundance in tww irrigated field soil when compared to the non impacted soil strongly indicating a direct link of the respective resistomes 3 3 temporal dynamics of most args and inti1 in soil correlate with tww irrigation intensity as the irrigation water and the receiving soil resistomes were correlated we tested if the load of introduced args played a significant role on their prevalence in the soil microbiome to determine the temporal arg and inti1 dynamics in a full scale tww irrigated field samples were regularly taken during different irrigation intensity periods and irrigation breaks for over a year table 1 the samples were grouped based on irrigation intensity high low and irrigation breaks the soil arg and inti1 profiles were significantly different across the three irrigation intensities permanova euclidean distances with r2 0 3 p 0 001 n 24 36 fig 3 a specifically a separation between irrigation breaks and high irrigation intensity periods was observed fig 3a pairwise permanova tests with benjamini hochberg correction revealed that all groups of irrigation intensity were indeed significantly different from each other p 0 001 r2 0 2 0 33 n 24 36 table 2 most of the genes exhibited significantly higher relative abundances during the high intensity irrigation periods in comparison with low irrigation or irrigation breaks the relative abundance of sul1 was 3 4 0 3 log10 copies 16s rrna at high irrigation intensity while it dropped to 3 8 0 4 log10 copies 16s rrna in low irrigation intensity and 4 1 0 7 log10 copies 16s rrna during irrigation breaks kruskal wallis test p 9 7 107 n 24 36 fig 3b similarly the relative abundance of inti1 was significantly higher during high irrigation intensity with 3 5 0 4 4 0 0 3 and 4 0 0 4 log10 copies 16s rrna for high low irrigation intensity and irrigation breaks kruskal wallis test p 2 4 10 7 n 24 36 fig 3b the genes tet m bla oxa 58 and qnrs exhibited similar trends to sul1 and inti1 with higher relative abundances during high intensity irrigation periods kruskal wallis test p 0 001 n 24 36 fig 3b however the tet m gene showed higher relative abundance in the irrigation breaks compared to low irrigation intensity dunn s test p 0 001 n 36 fig 3b mainly because its relative abundance only slightly decreased from 3 8 01 to 4 0 0 2 log10 copies 16s rrna during the final tested irrigation break which happened immediately after the high intensity irrigation periods fig s6 despite this observed irrigation intensity effect the relative abundance of these five genes remained consistently significantly elevated when compared to the non impacted soil under any irrigation scenario permanova r2 0 8 0 6 p 0 0001 n 12 36 contrary the genes that occurred in low relative abundance in the tww and were predominant in the non impacted soil bla tem and bla ctx m 32 did not display any significant effect based on tww irrigation intensity the relative abundance of bla tem was one order of magnitude lower during high intensity irrigation in comparison to the other irrigation periods fig 3b in addition bla ctx m 32 was not detected in most of the samples during this campaign with the exception of outliers independent of irrigation intensity when comparing the temporal dynamics of sul1 qnrs and inti1 in detail prior to the start of high intensity irrigation june 2018 during one month july 2018 and three months of high intensity irrigation september 2018 an immediate increase in relative abundance was detected visible from one month after irrigation started june july 2018 fig 4 kruskal wallis p 0 001 n 12 the relative abundance of sul1 inti1 and qnrs increased from 3 9 0 2 to 3 4 0 4 4 6 0 5 to 3 5 0 5 and 7 5 1 1 to 5 4 0 9 log10 copies 16s rrna for each gene respectively fig 4 however a plateau effect was observed where the relative abundance of these three genes was not significantly impacted when re examining it after three months of continuous high intensity irrigation dunn s test p 0 05 n 12 fig 4 it is noteworthy that despite this plateau effect the standard deviation of each gene s relative abundance was lower after three months of irrigation which indicates improved homogenisation of the tww irrigation effect on the field soil after a prolonged time period the long term temporal investigation of arg and inti1 dynamics of the real scale tww irrigated field along with comparison with the non impacted soil provided clear indication that tww irrigation affects mainly the prevalence of tww related genes such as sul1 inti1 qnrs and tet m in the soil in addition the genes that were absent in the non impacted soil sul1 tet m qnrs and bla oxa 58 fig 1 were not eliminated during irrigation breaks fig 3b indicating persistence of these genes upon their introduction to the soil however qnrs and bla oxa 58 were far less persistent than sul1 and tet m since their relative abundance decreased close to loq during irrigation breaks nevertheless high variability of environmental conditions and agricultural management e g temperature precipitation and different crop cultivars occurred in the investigated field across the year such variation is common among field studies of real scale tww irrigation operations therefore we aimed at further confirming and extending our results using controlled laboratory conditions 3 4 higher abundance of args and inti1 in tww irrigated soil microcosms compared to fw irrigated ones to overcome the effect of varying environmental conditions we performed laboratory scale microcosm experiments with the non irrigated soil adjacent to the tww irrigation field the microcosms were irrigated with either tww or fw for three weeks when comparing the two irrigation waters the 16s rrna absolute abundance was two orders of magnitude higher in tww 9 8 0 1 log10 copies l compared to fw 7 5 1 1 log10 copies l wilcoxon rank sum test n 6 p 3 6 10 5 fig s7a further the absolute abundance of all args and inti1 was constantly more than one order of magnitude higher in tww than in fw fig s7a the relative abundance of sul1 inti1 bla oxa 58 qnrs and tet m was equally higher in tww with significant differences ranging from one to two orders of magnitude p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test n 6 fig s7b however the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ctx m 32 did not differ between the two types of irrigation water with p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test n 6 despite the log fold difference of 16s rrna load observed for the irrigation waters no significant increase of 16s rrna absolute abundance in the soil of the tww group was observed over the three weeks of irrigation fig 5 a in fact 16s rrna absolute abundance in the soil of the tww group did not change significantly from week 0 to week 3 week 0 11 9 0 9 week 3 11 9 1 1 log 10 copies g of dry soil dunn s test n 4 p 0 05 fig 5a moreover the 16s rrna absolute abundance in the tww group soil was similar to the fw group at week 3 11 8 1 6 log 10 copies g of dry soil fig 5b with p 0 05 dunn s test n 4 the average 16s rrna absolute abundance per gram of soil was four orders of magnitude higher than in the tww irrigation water soil 11 8 0 1 log10 copies g of dry soil tww 6 9 0 1 log10 copies ml dunn s test p 0 05 fig 5a thus the bacterial load addition of tww irrigation in the soil was relatively minor to support the qpcr results we sequenced microcosm samples to gain insights into if tww irrigation altered community composition however no particular difference in the phyla composition of tww fw irrigated soil fig 5b was detected the profile of fw tww and all soils was different on the phylum level with actinobacteria and acidobacteria being more prevalent in any of the soils and patescibacteria and firmicutes being present mainly in the tww fig 5b however the most predominant phylum proteobacteria was overly abundant in all types of samples soil 52 5 54 4 tww 51 2 fw 75 8 fig 5b nevertheless no increase of tww related phyla in the tww group soil over the weeks of irrigation with tww was detected fig 5b supporting the fact that tww irrigation addition to bacterial abundance in soil was negligible despite the absence of an immediate effect of tww irrigation on the bacterial load of the soil and its phylogenetic composition the arg and inti1 profiles between the two groups of microcosms tww fw differed significantly over the three weeks of irrigation permanova fig 4 euclidean distance r2 0 63 p 0 001 table 3 specifically the genes bla oxa 58 inti1 and sul1 increased in the tww group after the switch to tww irrigation at week 1 and 3 fig 6 s8 the gene sul1 was present in the soil of the fw group and the tww group at week 0 3 8 0 2 log10 copies 16s rrna and at week 3 it increased to 3 0 0 05 log10 copies 16s rrna kruskal wallis test p 0 0001 n 4 fig 6 s8 in the fw group sul1 relative abundance was more than one order of magnitude lower at week 3 4 5 1 6 log10 copies 16s rrna compared to the tww group fig 6 s8 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0093 n 4 even lower than at the beginning of the experiment the qnrs abundance was below lod in both groups at week 0 and was detected only in the tww group at week 1 fig 6 however it was detected at week 3 in both groups but remained slightly elevated in the tww group tww group 6 0 0 5 log10 copies 16s rrna fw group 6 5 0 6 log10 copies 16s rrna wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 049 n 4 fig 6 s8 similarly to qnrs tet m was below the loq in both groups at week 0 while it was detected in three out of four microcosms in the tww group at week 1 and week 3 however tet m was detected at week 3 in one fw group microcosm as well the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ctx m 32 in week 3 did not differ between the groups of irrigation wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 n 4 fig 6 s8 these two genes had the lowest abundance in the tww used for irrigation of the microcosms while their relative abundance was similar in fw and tww fig s7b supporting the interconnection of the low abundance of two genes in tww with the absence of impact of tww irrigation on their relative abundance in the soil therefore the laboratory microcosms confirmed the results of the real scale field sampling and elucidated that tww irrigation has a high and fast impact on the prevalence of args and inti1 in soil when compared to fw irrigation 4 discussion the necessity to bridge the gap interconnecting anthropogenic and soil resistomes has been highlighted in previous studies nesme and simonet 2015 cytryn 2013 smalla et al 2018 in this study we focused on the effects of irrigation with tww on the soil resistome using a multiphase approach the approach consisted of detailed time series sampling of a full scale commercially operated tww irrigated agricultural field and controlled laboratory microcosm experiments to investigate the dynamics of args and inti1 under tww irrigation our set of genes six args and inti1 covered resistance to a wide variety of antibiotic classes sulphonamides tetracyclines quinolones penicillins cephalosporins and carbapenems the in decrease of args and inti1 due to tww irrigation varied across the different genes the gene abundances of sul1 inti1 qnrs bla oxa 58 and tet m were positively correlated with tww irrigation intensity in the field contrary bla tem and bla ctx m 32 which were of higher prevalence in the non irrigated soil did not significantly increase with tww irrigation in soil microcosm experiments with either fw or tww irrigation we confirmed that the field observed dynamics hold true under controlled laboratory conditions consequently the working hypothesis that the arg load and irrigation intensity define the effect of tww irrigation on arg spread dynamics in soil was supported the three different experiments elucidated temporal arg dynamics as a consequence of tww irrigation significantly elevated levels of args manifested in the long term 50 years tww irrigated soil when compared to the non irrigated control however arg abundances remain dynamic and dependent on irrigation intensity across a one year monitoring period still throughout the year even during irrigation breaks arg levels constantly remained far above background levels detected for non irrigated soil indicating that introduced args once established in the soil microbiome do not disappear first effects of tww irrigation on arg abundance and hence early arg establishment in non impacted soil can already be detected after short time spans on the week to month scale previous studies have reported contradictive statements on whether they observed dalkmann et al 2012 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 or did not observe negreanu et al 2012 cerqueira 2019a c marano et al 2019 increases of args in the soil due to tww irrigation the here reported variance of effects across the tested genes suggests that the choice of target genes might play a key role while the coverage of common investigated genes among the previous studies is low studies from both contradicting groups of statements included at least some of the genes that we observed to be affected by tww irrigation in our study e g sul1 qnrs and bla oxa 58 dalkmann et al 2012 negreanu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 cerqueira 2019a c marano et al 2019 however the two studies with the highest coverage of args utilizing parallel qpcr semi quantitative method for a massive amount of args reported that tww irrigation promotes the spread of at least a subset of args in soil wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 in agreement with our quantitative study genes with high abundance in the tww and commonly associated with gene mobility were particularly increased in the irrigated soil while those associated with the native soil resistome were not following similar patterns among those genes introduced to the soil due to anthropogenic irrigation activity and most severely increased in abundance in irrigated soil were sul1 and inti1 these two genes were the most abundant in the here used tww and are generally found at high levels in tww across several european countries cacace et al 2019 the arg sul1 confers resistance to sulphonamides a group of synthetic antibiotics that persist through the wastewater treatment and are usually present in high concentration in twws reis 2018 zhang and li 2011 the inti1 gene is commonly considered as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer and anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 due to its association with mge it is often present in gene cassettes that contain args or other genes for various stress responses with sul1 frequently being part of these gene cassettes gillings et al 2015 this explains the correlated increase of sul1 and inti1 in our experiments mobile broad host range resistance plasmids regularly hosting these integron cassettes have previously been shown to transfer from human associated bacteria to a majority of indigenous soil microbial communities klümper et al 2015 klümper et al 2017 this mobility allows the integron cassettes to persist in the soil microbiome independent of their original tww hosts gillings et al 2015 while the relative abundance of the tested args increased independent of one another no changes in the phylogenetic structure of the communities were observed in our microcosm experiments this indicates that horizontal gene transfer of the tested genes from the tww to the soil community might be the main mechanism behind this increase furthermore a plateau effect was observed where these affected genes sul1 inti1 and qnrs initially increased in abundance after one month of high intensity tww irrigation however they did not exhibit any further increase from one to three months of high intensity irrigation in the full scale tww irrigated field such plateau effects up to carrying capacity are expected in microbial ecosystems dalkmann et al 2012 additionally ecological barriers may limit the dissemination of resistance genes to further members of the microbial community gibson et al 2015 a similar plateau effect has been reported from a field study in mexico dalkmann et al 2012 with higher abundance of sul1 in topsoil of untreated wastewater full scale irrigated fields compared to rainfall fed ones however the relative abundance of sul1 in the fields irrigated for 1 5 years was similar compared to fields that were irrigated with untreated wastewater for three and even up to 100 years dalkmann et al 2012 presumably soil previously amended with manure with an even higher load of args than tww irrigation chen et al 2016 muurinen et al 2017 would exhibit similar plateau effects thus measuring only at the peak of this plateau could mask the impact of tww irrigation hence leading to no additional observable effects of tww irrigation as reported in previous studies cerqueira et al 2019c upon decreasing irrigation intensity the abundance of args dropped in our field study indicating that carrying capacity of args is only stable as long as fresh mobile genes are constantly provided at a high rate especially when there is weaker selective pressure compared to clinical environments fitness cost of args may be higher for certain bacterial species porse et al 2018 and thus args are lost in relatively short time however despite their decrease the relative abundance of tww affected genes in the field remained higher during irrigation breaks than in the non irrigated soil especially sul1 inti1 and tet m showed higher persistence upon their introduction in the soil when compared to qnrs and bla oxa 58 the two args that were unaffected by tww irrigation bla ctx m 32 and bla tem were also present in tww but at comparably lower relative abundance however they were among the most abundant genes in the native soil resistome of the non irrigated soil both belong to the group of β lactamase genes a class of genes that has frequently been reported to occur naturally in soil environments wolters et al 2018 muurinen et al 2017 gatica et al 2015 the production of β lactams by indigenous soil bacteria or fungi is speculated to be the cause of this natural prevalence of β lactamase genes in soil bacterial communities nesme and simonet 2015 gatica et al 2015 the third tested β lactamase gene blaoxa 58 was absent from the non irrigated soil it initially increased upon irrigation but its relative abundance rapidly decreased during irrigation breaks close to loq levels therefore contrary to its counterparts which are unaffected by irrigation bla oxa 58 was not stably maintained in the soil community hence if args are already naturally and stably prevalent in the soil and might consequently be unaffected by tww irrigation needs to be considered before prioritizing arg targets for estimating the effects of tww irrigation for all here observed effects the quality of irrigation water remained a crucial parameter despite their detection sul1 qnrs inti1 tet m and bla oxa 58 were present at lower relative abundance in fw compared to tww used for irrigation in our microcosm experiments it is noteworthy that sul1 was not detected in the non irrigated soil whereas it was detected in both microcosm groups at week 0 after the equilibration with fw irrigation in addition qnrs was detected in the fw group of microcosms at week 3 as well consequently even irrigation with higher quality water can introduce certain args such as sul1 and qnrs but at lower hence slower rates presumably if irrigation was performed with tww subjected to advanced tertiary treatment michael et al 2013 or with fw with a higher load of args due to general anthropogenic pollution then the observable differences between fw and tww irrigation would be eliminated similar studies comparing the effects of fw and tww irrigation are currently lacking one exception is the study by marano et al 2019 that highlighted differences in arg abundance in tww and fw but detected no irrigation effect on arg abundance in the respective soils in contrary we detected all the args and inti1 in our sampled fw while most of the args were present in fw irrigated soil microcosms as well therefore the estimation of arg abundance in fw and tww should be considered as a crucial step prior the estimation of the irrigation impact on soil consequently the differing arg loads due to differing tww quality might thus have contributed to the contradictive statements from previous studies on the impact of tww irrigation however there are other important factors to consider such as the variability of soil types physicochemical characteristics and microbiota from different geographical regions forsberg et al 2014 bahram et al 2018 most of the studies including our own are limited to distinct geographical regions with different climate and soil characteristics thus the contrasting observations could be explained by the different geographic locations of the studies we here show that microcosm studies with different soil types microbial communities and different quality twws could provide a successful research tool to gain further insights into the exact parameters determining the effects of tww irrigation on args in soil in the future this includes considering complex mutualistic and antagonistic interactions of the soil microbiome with different agricultural crops through for example root exudates chen et al 2019 interactions in the rhizosphere have previously been shown to lead to either positive jechalke et al 2013 or negative song et al 2020 selection for args in agricultural soils further soil properties might change as tww irrigation introduces not only bacteria and mobile resistant genes but also high nutrient loads and chemical contaminants e g heavy metals ternes et al 2007 rusan et al 2007 this may lead to accumulation of metals and drug residues elgallal et al 2016 and induce bacterial stress hence favouring arg and inti1 dissemination zhao et al 2019 consequently we speculate that the alteration of soil properties with enrichment of metals and drug residues could have contributed partially to the observed arg and inti1 persistence in the soil however further research is necessary to elucidate the complex interplay of soil biotic and abiotic factors with tww irrigation 5 conclusion in summary we demonstrated that multiphase and multifactorial experiments are a powerful tool to assess the impact of tww irrigation on the prevalence of args in agricultural soil these include temporal field sampling comparisons with non impacted soil and microcosm experiments with various types of irrigation we showed that any type of irrigation could lead to the dissemination of args in soil e g sul1 and qnrs nevertheless the impact of fw irrigation on arg and inti1 profile of soil was distinctively minor compared to the impact of tww irrigation with a high load of args our multiphase approach was a useful tool for differentiating which genes were increased by tww irrigation sul1 inti1 qnrs and bla oxa 58 and genes that were stable members of the indigenous soil resistome unaffected by tww irrigation bla ctx m 32 and bla tem therefore the impact of tww irrigation depends on the arg and inti1 load of irrigation water the irrigation intensity the type of each gene and its potential link with the native soil resistome funding this work was supported by

17171,treated wastewater tww irrigation is a useful counter measure against the depletion of freshwater fw resources however tww contains several contaminants of emerging concern such as antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args thus tww irrigation might promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance in soil environments in the present work we hypothesized that the arg load and irrigation intensity define the effect of tww irrigation on arg spread dynamics in soil this hypothesis was tested using a multiphase approach a comparing soil from a full scale commercially operated tww irrigated field with non irrigated soil b long term sampling of the tww irrigated field over one year with different irrigation intensities and intercepted by irrigation breaks and c laboratory scale soil microcosms irrigated with tww compared to fw six args the integrase gene inti1 and the 16s rrna were quantified using qpcr in addition effects of tww irrigation on bacterial community composition of microcosm samples were analysed with 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the genes sul1 qnrs bla oxa 58 tet m and inti1 were significantly more abundant in the tww irrigated field soil whereas bla ctx m 32 and bla tem the least abundant genes in the tww irrigation showed higher abundance in the non irrigated soil the relative abundance of sul1 qnrs bla oxa 58 tet m and inti1 correlated with tww irrigation intensity and decreased during irrigation breaks despite the decrease the levels of these genes remained consistently higher than the non irrigated soil indicating persistence upon their introduction into the soil microcosm experiments verified observations from the field study tww irrigation promoted the spread of args and inti1 into soil at far elevated levels compared to fw irrigation however the impact of tww irrigation on 16s rrna absolute abundance and the soil microbial community composition was negligible in conclusion the impact of

al 2013 christou et al 2017 could pose risks for human health specifically resistance genes can be acquired by soil bacteria trough horizontal gene transfer hgt musovic et al 2014 klümper et al 2015 and disseminate back to human associated pathogenic strains forsberg et al 2012 therefore identifying and monitoring of arb arg sources in the environment has been prioritised recently as part of the one health strategy to combat the antimicrobial resistance amr threat berendonk et al 2015 although amr is often associated with clinical environments the majority of the clinically relevant args originate from soil bacteria and have been mobilized into human pathogens cytryn 2013 nesme and simonet 2015 despite the natural occurrence of args in soil agricultural practices e g manure amendment or dairy wastewater irrigation have been identified to significantly increase their prevalence and thus the risk for dissemination of args to humans chen et al 2016 muurinen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 mckinney et al 2018 dungan et al 2018 wolters et al 2018 the impact of tww irrigation on the prevalence of args and inti1 in topsoil has been investigated in full scale agricultural systems from different countries continents with contradicting conclusions a few studies have reported that tww irrigation increases arg prevalence wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 dalkmann et al 2012 jechalke et al 2015 furthermore chen et al 2019 reported higher relative abundance of only a subset of sulphonamide tetracycline args in tww irrigated soils nevertheless other studies reported minimal impact of tww irrigation on arg prevalence in soil negreanu et al 2012 cerqueira et al 2019a 2019b in addition marano et al 2019 detected several args in higher prevalence in tww when compared to fw but reported no enrichment of args in tww irrigated soils these contradicting results could be attributed to the variability of tww quality or of tested args between the different studies in addition variations occur between the soil ecosystems of different geographical regions forsberg et al 2014 bahram et al 2018 which could potentially influence the results of each study still we consider that some important factors have so far been neglected when estimating the impact of tww irrigation on soil arg dynamics several args e g bla tem and bla ctx m variants are indigenous to soil resistomes even in the absence of anthropogenic impact cytryn 2013 nesme and simonet 2015 gatica et al 2015 cerqueira et al 2019c thus the impact of tww irrigation on their prevalence in soil might be negligible as long as these args occur in tww at low abundance for example dairy wastewater irrigation promoted the increase of several args with the exception of bla ctx m 1 dungan et al 2018 furthermore the irrigation water demand might differ for different crops or vary across different climatic seasons thus during real scale commercial tww irrigation operations the irrigation intensity fluctuates during the year consequently the applied arg loads differ dramatically between high and low intensity irrigation given the high capacity for resilience of the soil microbiome towards invasion by arb and args bahram et al 2018 low intensity irrigation might not alter soil arg profiles in addition the prevalence of args differs between irrigation waters of different quality for example args are not only abundant in tww but also well disseminated in freshwater resources used for irrigation cacace et al 2019 pantanella et al 2020 even if usually at lower absolute abundance the absolute arg abundance in combination with irrigation intensity ultimately determines the arg load that a field receives accordingly including the applied arg load in combination with soil arg background levels can substantially improve comparability between studies on tww irrigation impacts thus the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of tww irrigation on the prevalence of args in soil taking into account these factors to achieve this we applied a multiphase approach including a long term monitoring survey in a real scale tww irrigated field with varying irrigation intensity and controlled laboratory experiments for further validation we hypothesized that the arg load and irrigation intensity define the effect of tww irrigation on arg spread dynamics in soil to test the hypothesis we quantified six args inti1 and 16s rrna in a commercially operated tww irrigated field and non impacted soil to gain insights on which genes are tww related or predominant members of the native soil resistome microbiome the selection of genes was based on the framework for tww monitoring established by the nereus www nereus cost eu and answer itn www answer itn eu networks cacace et al 2019 rocha et al 2018 for example sul1 qnrs and tet m and bla oxa 58 were included for their clinical importance high occurrence rate and abundance in tww across european countries caucci et al 2016 alygizakis et al 2020 cacace et al 2019 the two final β lactamase genes bla tem and bla ctx m 32 were selected due to their clinical importance their low abundance in tww cacace et al 2019 and their known natural prevalence in soil microbiota gatica et al 2015 the integrase gene inti1 was analysed as well since is commonly used as a genetic marker for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 and frequently part of mobile gene cassettes that carry args gatica et al 2016 in addition we aimed to gain insights into the effect of irrigation intensity and irrigation breaks on arg and inti1 prevalence in soil on a real scale setting with a temporal sampling campaign of the tww irrigated field under various irrigation intensity periods we further verified the results from the real scale tww irrigation operation with performance of fw tww irrigated soil microcosms under controlled laboratory conditions while simultaneously monitoring irrigation effects on the microbial community density and composition 2 materials methods 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 agricultural practice of the sampled location field sampling took place in a real scale commercially operated tww irrigated field that belongs to braunschweig wastewater association bwa in central germany n 52 360139 e 10 398805 fig s1 s2 the soil cambisol sandy soil of the nearby area of braunschweig is deficient in nutrients and has a limited water retention capacity ternes et al 2007 maaß et al 2016 the local area farmers use tww subjected only to secondary biological treatment to counter the nutrient limitation and in case of high nutrient demand they mix tww with digested sludge ds to tackle the low nutrient retention capacity commercial tww irrigation has taken place in the local area for over 50 years ternes et al 2007 2 1 2 sampling tww irrigation impacted and non impacted soil we sampled soil not impacted by tww irrigation adjacent to the tww irrigated field along with the soil of the tww irrigated field comparative sampling took place only in may 2019 due to logistic legal issues with sampling of the adjacent area for the remainder of the sampling period the tww irrigated field was irrigated with tww in the three months leading up to this sampling campaign for both sampling sites we sampled the topsoil aseptically 10 15 cm of upper soil layer n 12 the top 10 cm of soil most severely exposed to changing environmental conditions and potentially containing crop debris were removed with a sterile spade then a 50 ml falcon tube was driven 5 cm deep into the ground to extract a representative soil core from this slightly deeper part of the topsoil with tww irrigation as the defining variable on arg abundance each soil core was transported to the lab on ice homogenized with a sterile spatula and subsequent vortexing 2000 rpm x 60 s and finally used for dna extraction the samples were stored at 20 c until dna extraction the ph of the field soil was moderately acidic 5 97 both soils contained more than 90 of sand the ph of the adjacent soil was more acidic 3 77 which was expected for this soil as it hosts coniferous vegetation mareschal et al 2010 2 1 3 long term sampling of real scale tww irrigated field along with the respective irrigation water long term sampling of the tww irrigated field started in october 2017 and lasted until december 2018 during this period the field was irrigated with tww or tww mixed with ds tww ds at different irrigation intensities intercepted by long irrigation breaks table 1 the total volume of irrigation water per irrigation event was 35 mm3 perm2 of the field the field was irrigated 10 14 times per month during periods of high intensity irrigation resulting in 350 420 mm3 m2 month in the periods of low intensity irrigation two to three irrigation events took place per month thus during low irrigation intensity periods the total irrigation volume per surface was 70 105 mm3 m2 month the soil samples 12 samples per time point were taken temporally across this gradient of irrigation intensities high irrigation intensity n 24 low irrigation intensity n 36 irrigation breaks n 36 and subsequently handled as described in the previous section furthermore samples of the respective tww irrigation water were taken frequently three replicates per time point total n 15 bacteria from water samples were captured by filtration polycarbonate 0 2 μm pore size 47 mm diameter sartorius germany of 150 ml of irrigation water and filters were stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction 2 2 microcosm experiments for microcosm experiments we sampled the soil adjacent to the tww irrigated field that was not previously impacted by tww irrigation 12 samples at 0 60 cm depth and homogenised it to create a composite sample after air drying at room temperature we sieved the soil 6 mm mesh size and used it for microcosm experiments the microcosms were assembled by acrylic cylinders of 66 cm total height and 4 5 cm radius fig s3 and an inner tube 1 5 cm radius was placed centrally to allow the collection and removal of the percolated water then the microcosms were filled with gravel size 3 mm3 in the bottom 5 cm and the previously homogenized soil up to 50 cm height resulting in a total soil volume per microcosm of 2827 6 ml the same volume of dry sieved homogenised and similarly packed soil was placed in the microcosms ensuring similar bulk density microcosms were divided into two groups with four replicate microcosms per treatment the fw group and tww group were defined with respect to the type of irrigation water tww for irrigation subjected to secondary biological treatment was obtained from an urban wastewater treatment plant nearby the dresden area kaditz germany n 51 070640 e 13 680888 the fw was collected from a shallow well depth 7 m located next to the elbe river in pirna germany n 50 965905 e 13 924034 the microcosms were irrigated with 350 ml of water which led to saturation fresh irrigation water 3 l each of fw and tww was aseptically sampled three times per week in sterile 1 l glass bottles from july to august 2019 sampled irrigation water was transported to the lab on ice homogenized by shaking and used for microcosm irrigation within the day of sampling prior to irrigation the residual water in the microcosms was removed the microcosms were placed in a controlled temperature chamber at 20 c and with controlled light conditions with 12 h light darkness both groups were initially irrigated with fw for two weeks to stabilize and equilibrate the soil conditions then the tww group switched to tww irrigation for three weeks while the fw group was continuously irrigated with fw soil samples were taken aseptically from the microcosms with a sterile spatula at 15 cm depth this was the same depth of soil previously sampled in the tww irrigated field to allow comparability between results obtained from field sampling and microcosm experiments samples were transferred in a falcon tube and were homogenised first sampling took place at the end of the two week fw irrigation stabilization period week 0 the second in the 1st week after switching to tww irrigation week 1 and the third in the 3rd week after switching to tww irrigation week 3 in addition bacteria were harvested from six fw and six tww irrigation samples through filtration as described above specifically filtration 500 ml and subsequent dna extraction was performed on both types of irrigation water samples on day 1 5 8 12 15 and 19 after switching to tww irrigation 2 3 dna extraction quantitative real time pcr and sequencing dna extractions were performed according to the manufacturer s instructions using the dneasy powerwater kit for water 150 ml and the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen germany for soil samples 0 25 g quantity and quality of dna was measured with nanodrop thermo fischer scientific germany we performed qpcr for the following genes a qnrs protein family which protects dna gyrase from the inhibition of quinolones b bla tem class a β lactamase c sul1 sulphonamide resistant dihydropteroate synthase d bla ctx m 32 class a β lactamase

this gene is associated with horizontal gene transfer and environmental pollution and h 16s rrna which is an indicator for the total microbial abundance the reactions were performed in a mastercycler realplex eppendorf germany at a final volume of 20 μl with 10 μl of luna universal qpcr master mix new england biolabs germany which uses sybr green chemistry details about reagents primers thermal profile and plasmid standards are given in the table s4 the template volume was 4 μl the amount of dna per reaction was standardized to 20 ng the limit of detection lod was set at 3 copies per reaction according to kralik ricchi 2017 the limit of quantification loq varied among targeted genes details are listed in tables s4 s5 standard curves with amplification efficiency 0 9 1 1 and r2 0

and if so present at very low abundance in our samples bla ctx m 32 spiking concentration 4 106 copies μl no pcr inhibition was detected the absolute abundance for soil samples is expressed in copies g of dry soil and for water samples in copies l the ratio of gene copies per 16s rrna copy will be referred to as the relative abundance for the rest of the manuscript the fw tww group replicates were pooled in equimolar concentrations with final concentration of 5 ng μl and were analyzed with the 16s ion metagenomics kit thermo fisher scientific germany for amplification and sequencing of multiple parallel variable regions the protocols for 16s rrna library preparation for parallel variable regions sequencing and processing of the sequences were described previously in orschler et al 2019 raw fastq sequences were submitted to sra bioproject accession number prjna668737 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis prior to statistical analysis every sample that was below lod loq was placed at 1 copy l or 1 copy g of dry soil absolute abundance and 10 8 relative abundance one order of magnitude below the minimum relative abundance that we observed 10 7 data were log10 transformed we used the programing language r r core team 2019 v 3 5 3 for generation of graphical representations with the packages ggplot wickham 2016 and ggpubr v 0 2 2 kassambara 2019 significant differences were assessed with the wilcoxon rank sum test or in case of group comparisons with the kruskal wallis test package ggpubr dunn s test with benjamini hochberg correction was carried out with the package dunn s test v1 3 5 dinno 2016 for pairwise multiple comparisons additional statistical analysis of arg and inti1 profiles was performed with a permanova test adonis function method euclidean from the vegan package v2 5 6 oksanen et al 2019 or pairwiseadonis package v0 3 martinez arbizu et al 2019 for the analysis and graphical representation of bacterial community data the package phyloseq was used mcmurdie and holmes 2013 comparisons with p values below 0 05 were considered as statistically significant α 0 05 3 results 3 1 non impacted and tww irrigated soil displayed different arg and inti1 profile the arg and inti1 profiles were significantly different between the tww irrigated field and the non impacted adjacent soil permanova euclidean distance n 12 r2 0 59 p 0 001 specifically sul1 qnrs tet m and bla oxa 58 were only present in the tww irrigated field at high relative abundance sul1 3 8 1 1 qnrs 6 1 0 9 tet m 4 8 1 4 bla oxa 58 5 3 0 9 log10 copies 16s rrna and not detected in the non impacted soil with exceptions of outliers fig 1 s4 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 n 12 the integrase gene inti1 was present in both types of soil with one order of magnitude higher relative abundance in the tww irrigated field soil wilcoxon rank sum test p 7 5 10 11 n 12 contrary bla tem and bla ctx m 32 showed higher relative abundance in the non impacted soil 4 2 0 1 and 5 7 1

information regarding the temporal dynamics of args and inti1 whether they increase instantly or are eliminated quickly during irrigation breaks in addition the two soils differed in vegetation and physicochemical conditions therefore further insights into tww irrigation effects were needed from more detailed temporal observations of the soil of the tww irrigated field 3 2 the genes sul1 inti1 qnrs tet m and bla oxa 58 were highly abundant in tww irrigation water to determine if the relative abundance of args and inti1 in the tww irrigated soil is linked to their abundance in the tww resistome tww irrigation water samples were taken for a period of one year the genes with the highest relative abundance in tww were inti1 1 8 0 6 log10 copies 16s rrna and sul1 2 0 0 3 log10 copies 16s rrna fig 2 those with the highest relative abundance in tww irrigated soil fig 1 the remaining three genes detected at higher relative abundance in tww irrigated soil were also highly abundant in tww bla oxa 58 3 1 0 3 qnrs 3 6 0 6 tet m 3 8 0 3 log10 copies 16s rrna fig 2 unsurprisingly bla tem and bla ctx m 32 displayed the lowest abundance in the irrigation water bla tem 5 8 0 3 bla ctx m 32 4 7 1 0 log10 copies 16s rrna fig 2 as digested sludge was added to the tww during a few periods of the sampling campaign its influence on the tww resistome was tested the profile of args of tww ds irrigation was similar to tww irrigation with the exception of qnrs and bla oxa 58 where their relative abundance was more than one order of magnitude higher in tww ds compared to tww fig s5 in conclusion genes with higher relative abundance in the irrigation water tww or tww ds were also found in higher relative abundance in tww irrigated field soil when compared to the non impacted soil strongly indicating a direct link of the respective resistomes 3 3 temporal dynamics of most args and inti1 in soil correlate with tww irrigation intensity as the irrigation water and the receiving soil resistomes were correlated we tested if the load of introduced args played a significant role on their prevalence in the soil microbiome to determine the temporal arg and inti1 dynamics in a full scale tww irrigated field samples were regularly taken during different irrigation intensity periods and irrigation breaks for over a year table 1 the samples were grouped based on irrigation intensity high low and irrigation breaks the soil arg and inti1 profiles were significantly different across the three irrigation intensities permanova euclidean distances with r2 0 3 p 0 001 n 24 36 fig 3 a specifically a separation between irrigation breaks and high irrigation intensity periods was observed fig 3a pairwise permanova tests with benjamini hochberg correction revealed that all groups of irrigation intensity were indeed significantly different from each other p 0 001 r2 0 2 0 33 n 24 36 table 2 most of the genes exhibited significantly higher relative abundances during the high intensity irrigation periods in comparison with low irrigation or irrigation breaks the relative abundance of sul1 was 3 4 0 3 log10 copies 16s rrna at high irrigation intensity while it dropped to 3 8 0 4 log10 copies 16s rrna in low irrigation intensity and 4 1 0 7 log10 copies 16s rrna during irrigation breaks kruskal wallis test p 9 7 107 n 24 36 fig 3b similarly the relative abundance of inti1 was significantly higher during high irrigation intensity with 3 5 0 4 4 0 0 3 and 4 0 0 4 log10 copies 16s rrna for high low irrigation intensity and irrigation breaks kruskal wallis test p 2 4 10 7 n 24 36 fig 3b the genes tet m bla oxa 58 and qnrs exhibited similar trends to sul1 and inti1 with higher relative abundances during high intensity irrigation periods kruskal wallis test p 0 001 n 24 36 fig 3b however the tet m gene showed higher relative abundance in the irrigation breaks compared to low irrigation intensity dunn s test p 0 001 n 36 fig 3b mainly because its relative abundance only slightly decreased from 3 8 01 to 4 0 0 2 log10 copies 16s rrna during the final tested irrigation break which happened immediately after the high intensity irrigation periods fig s6 despite this observed irrigation intensity effect the relative abundance of these five genes remained consistently significantly elevated when compared to the non impacted soil under any irrigation scenario permanova r2 0 8 0 6 p 0 0001 n 12 36 contrary the genes that occurred in low relative abundance in the tww and were predominant in the non impacted soil bla tem and bla ctx m 32 did not display any significant effect based on tww irrigation intensity the relative abundance of bla tem was one order of magnitude lower during high intensity irrigation in comparison to the other irrigation periods fig 3b in addition bla ctx m 32 was not detected in most of the samples during this campaign with the exception of outliers independent of irrigation intensity when comparing the temporal dynamics of sul1 qnrs and inti1 in detail prior to the start of high intensity irrigation june 2018 during one month july 2018 and three months of high intensity irrigation september 2018 an immediate increase in relative abundance was detected visible from one month after irrigation started june july 2018 fig 4 kruskal wallis p 0 001 n 12 the relative abundance of sul1 inti1 and qnrs increased from 3 9 0 2 to 3 4 0 4 4 6 0 5 to 3 5 0 5 and 7 5 1 1 to 5 4 0 9 log10 copies 16s rrna for each gene respectively fig 4 however a plateau effect was observed where the relative abundance of these three genes was not significantly impacted when re examining it after three months of continuous high intensity irrigation dunn s test p 0 05 n 12 fig 4 it is noteworthy that despite this plateau effect the standard deviation of each gene s relative abundance was lower after three months of irrigation which indicates improved homogenisation of the tww irrigation effect on the field soil after a prolonged time period the long term temporal investigation of arg and inti1 dynamics of the real scale tww irrigated field along with comparison with the non impacted soil provided clear indication that tww irrigation affects mainly the prevalence of tww related genes such as sul1 inti1 qnrs and tet m in the soil in addition the genes that were absent in the non impacted soil sul1 tet m qnrs and bla oxa 58 fig 1 were not eliminated during irrigation breaks fig 3b indicating persistence of these genes upon their introduction to the soil however qnrs and bla oxa 58 were far less persistent than sul1 and tet m since their relative abundance decreased close to loq during irrigation breaks nevertheless high variability of environmental conditions and agricultural management e g temperature precipitation and different crop cultivars occurred in the investigated field across the year such variation is common among field studies of real scale tww irrigation operations therefore we aimed at further confirming and extending our results using controlled laboratory conditions 3 4 higher abundance of args and inti1 in tww irrigated soil microcosms compared to fw irrigated ones to overcome the effect of varying environmental conditions we performed laboratory scale microcosm experiments with the non irrigated soil adjacent to the tww irrigation field the microcosms were irrigated with either tww or fw for three weeks when comparing the two irrigation waters the 16s rrna absolute abundance was two orders of magnitude higher in tww 9 8 0 1 log10 copies l compared to fw 7 5 1 1 log10 copies l wilcoxon rank sum test n 6 p 3 6 10 5 fig s7a further the absolute abundance of all args and inti1 was constantly more than one order of magnitude higher in tww than in fw fig s7a the relative abundance of sul1 inti1 bla oxa 58 qnrs and tet m was equally higher in tww with significant differences ranging from one to two orders of magnitude p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test n 6 fig s7b however the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ctx m 32 did not differ between the two types of irrigation water with p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test n 6 despite the log fold difference of 16s rrna load observed for the irrigation waters no significant increase of 16s rrna absolute abundance in the soil of the tww group was observed over the three weeks of irrigation fig 5 a in fact 16s rrna absolute abundance in the soil of the tww group did not change significantly from week 0 to week 3 week 0 11 9 0 9 week 3 11 9 1 1 log 10 copies g of dry soil dunn s test n 4 p 0 05 fig 5a moreover the 16s rrna absolute abundance in the tww group soil was similar to the fw group at week 3 11 8 1 6 log 10 copies g of dry soil fig 5b with p 0 05 dunn s test n 4 the average 16s rrna absolute abundance per gram of soil was four orders of magnitude higher than in the tww irrigation water soil 11 8 0 1 log10 copies g of dry soil tww 6 9 0 1 log10 copies ml dunn s test p 0 05 fig 5a thus the bacterial load addition of tww irrigation in the soil was relatively minor to support the qpcr results we sequenced microcosm samples to gain insights into if tww irrigation altered community composition however no particular difference in the phyla composition of tww fw irrigated soil fig 5b was detected the profile of fw tww and all soils was different on the phylum level with actinobacteria and acidobacteria being more prevalent in any of the soils and patescibacteria and firmicutes being present mainly in the tww fig 5b however the most predominant phylum proteobacteria was overly abundant in all types of samples soil 52 5 54 4 tww 51 2 fw 75 8 fig 5b nevertheless no increase of tww related phyla in the tww group soil over the weeks of irrigation with tww was detected fig 5b supporting the fact that tww irrigation addition to bacterial abundance in soil was negligible despite the absence of an immediate effect of tww irrigation on the bacterial load of the soil and its phylogenetic composition the arg and inti1 profiles between the two groups of microcosms tww fw differed significantly over the three weeks of irrigation permanova fig 4 euclidean distance r2 0 63 p 0 001 table 3 specifically the genes bla oxa 58 inti1 and sul1 increased in the tww group after the switch to tww irrigation at week 1 and 3 fig 6 s8 the gene sul1 was present in the soil of the fw group and the tww group at week 0 3 8 0 2 log10 copies 16s rrna and at week 3 it increased to 3 0 0 05 log10 copies 16s rrna kruskal wallis test p 0 0001 n 4 fig 6 s8 in the fw group sul1 relative abundance was more than one order of magnitude lower at week 3 4 5 1 6 log10 copies 16s rrna compared to the tww group fig 6 s8 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0093 n 4 even lower than at the beginning of the experiment the qnrs abundance was below lod in both groups at week 0 and was detected only in the tww group at week 1 fig 6 however it was detected at week 3 in both groups but remained slightly elevated in the tww group tww group 6 0 0 5 log10 copies 16s rrna fw group 6 5 0 6 log10 copies 16s rrna wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 049 n 4 fig 6 s8 similarly to qnrs tet m was below the loq in both groups at week 0 while it was detected in three out of four microcosms in the tww group at week 1 and week 3 however tet m was detected at week 3 in one fw group microcosm as well the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ctx m 32 in week 3 did not differ between the groups of irrigation wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 n 4 fig 6 s8 these two genes had the lowest abundance in the tww used for irrigation of the microcosms while their relative abundance was similar in fw and tww fig s7b supporting the interconnection of the low abundance of two genes in tww with the absence of impact of tww irrigation on their relative abundance in the soil therefore the laboratory microcosms confirmed the results of the real scale field sampling and elucidated that tww irrigation has a high and fast impact on the prevalence of args and inti1 in soil when compared to fw irrigation 4 discussion the necessity to bridge the gap interconnecting anthropogenic and soil resistomes has been highlighted in previous studies nesme and simonet 2015 cytryn 2013 smalla et al 2018 in this study we focused on the effects of irrigation with tww on the soil resistome using a multiphase approach the approach consisted of detailed time series sampling of a full scale commercially operated tww irrigated agricultural field and controlled laboratory microcosm experiments to investigate the dynamics of args and inti1 under tww irrigation our set of genes six args and inti1 covered resistance to a wide variety of antibiotic classes sulphonamides tetracyclines quinolones penicillins cephalosporins and carbapenems the in decrease of args and inti1 due to tww irrigation varied across the different genes the gene abundances of sul1 inti1 qnrs bla oxa 58 and tet m were positively correlated with tww irrigation intensity in the field contrary bla tem and bla ctx m 32 which were of higher prevalence in the non irrigated soil did not significantly increase with tww irrigation in soil microcosm experiments with either fw or tww irrigation we confirmed that the field observed dynamics hold true under controlled laboratory conditions consequently the working hypothesis that the arg load and irrigation intensity define the effect of tww irrigation on arg spread dynamics in soil was supported the three different experiments elucidated temporal arg dynamics as a consequence of tww irrigation significantly elevated levels of args manifested in the long term 50 years tww irrigated soil when compared to the non irrigated control however arg abundances remain dynamic and dependent on irrigation intensity across a one year monitoring period still throughout the year even during irrigation breaks arg levels constantly remained far above background levels detected for non irrigated soil indicating that introduced args once established in the soil microbiome do not disappear first effects of tww irrigation on arg abundance and hence early arg establishment in non impacted soil can already be detected after short time spans on the week to month scale previous studies have reported contradictive statements on whether they observed dalkmann et al 2012 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 or did not observe negreanu et al 2012 cerqueira 2019a c marano et al 2019 increases of args in the soil due to tww irrigation the here reported variance of effects across the tested genes suggests that the choice of target genes might play a key role while the coverage of common investigated genes among the previous studies is low studies from both contradicting groups of statements included at least some of the genes that we observed to be affected by tww irrigation in our study e g sul1 qnrs and bla oxa 58 dalkmann et al 2012 negreanu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 cerqueira 2019a c marano et al 2019 however the two studies with the highest coverage of args utilizing parallel qpcr semi quantitative method for a massive amount of args reported that tww irrigation promotes the spread of at least a subset of args in soil wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 in agreement with our quantitative study genes with high abundance in the tww and commonly associated with gene mobility were particularly increased in the irrigated soil while those associated with the native soil resistome were not following similar patterns among those genes introduced to the soil due to anthropogenic irrigation activity and most severely increased in abundance in irrigated soil were sul1 and inti1 these two genes were the most abundant in the here used tww and are generally found at high levels in tww across several european countries cacace et al 2019 the arg sul1 confers resistance to sulphonamides a group of synthetic antibiotics that persist through the wastewater treatment and are usually present in high concentration in twws reis 2018 zhang and li 2011 the inti1 gene is commonly considered as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer and anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 due to its association with mge it is often present in gene cassettes that contain args or other genes for various stress responses with sul1 frequently being part of these gene cassettes gillings et al 2015 this explains the correlated increase of sul1 and inti1 in our experiments mobile broad host range resistance plasmids regularly hosting these integron cassettes have previously been shown to transfer from human associated bacteria to a majority of indigenous soil microbial communities klümper et al 2015 klümper et al 2017 this mobility allows the integron cassettes to persist in the soil microbiome independent of their original tww hosts gillings et al 2015 while the relative abundance of the tested args increased independent of one another no changes in the phylogenetic structure of the communities were observed in our microcosm experiments this indicates that horizontal gene transfer of the tested genes from the tww to the soil community might be the main mechanism behind this increase furthermore a plateau effect was observed where these affected genes sul1 inti1 and qnrs initially increased in abundance after one month of high intensity tww irrigation however they did not exhibit any further increase from one to three months of high intensity irrigation in the full scale tww irrigated field such plateau effects up to carrying capacity are expected in microbial ecosystems dalkmann et al 2012 additionally ecological barriers may limit the dissemination of resistance genes to further members of the microbial community gibson et al 2015 a similar plateau effect has been reported from a field study in mexico dalkmann et al 2012 with higher abundance of sul1 in topsoil of untreated wastewater full scale irrigated fields compared to rainfall fed ones however the relative abundance of sul1 in the fields irrigated for 1 5 years was similar compared to fields that were irrigated with untreated wastewater for three and even up to 100 years dalkmann et al 2012 presumably soil previously amended with manure with an even higher load of args than tww irrigation chen et al 2016 muurinen et al 2017 would exhibit similar plateau effects thus measuring only at the peak of this plateau could mask the impact of tww irrigation hence leading to no additional observable effects of tww irrigation as reported in previous studies cerqueira et al 2019c upon decreasing irrigation intensity the abundance of args dropped in our field study indicating that carrying capacity of args is only stable as long as fresh mobile genes are constantly provided at a high rate especially when there is weaker selective pressure compared to clinical environments fitness cost of args may be higher for certain bacterial species porse et al 2018 and thus args are lost in relatively short time however despite their decrease the relative abundance of tww affected genes in the field remained higher during irrigation breaks than in the non irrigated soil especially sul1 inti1 and tet m showed higher persistence upon their introduction in the soil when compared to qnrs and bla oxa 58 the two args that were unaffected by tww irrigation bla ctx m 32 and bla tem were also present in tww but at comparably lower relative abundance however they were among the most abundant genes in the native soil resistome of the non irrigated soil both belong to the group of β lactamase genes a class of genes that has frequently been reported to occur naturally in soil environments wolters et al 2018 muurinen et al 2017 gatica et al 2015 the production of β lactams by indigenous soil bacteria or fungi is speculated to be the cause of this natural prevalence of β lactamase genes in soil bacterial communities nesme and simonet 2015 gatica et al 2015 the third tested β lactamase gene blaoxa 58 was absent from the non irrigated soil it initially increased upon irrigation but its relative abundance rapidly decreased during irrigation breaks close to loq levels therefore contrary to its counterparts which are unaffected by irrigation bla oxa 58 was not stably maintained in the soil community hence if args are already naturally and stably prevalent in the soil and might consequently be unaffected by tww irrigation needs to be considered before prioritizing arg targets for estimating the effects of tww irrigation for all here observed effects the quality of irrigation water remained a crucial parameter despite their detection sul1 qnrs inti1 tet m and bla oxa 58 were present at lower relative abundance in fw compared to tww used for irrigation in our microcosm experiments it is noteworthy that sul1 was not detected in the non irrigated soil whereas it was detected in both microcosm groups at week 0 after the equilibration with fw irrigation in addition qnrs was detected in the fw group of microcosms at week 3 as well consequently even irrigation with higher quality water can introduce certain args such as sul1 and qnrs but at lower hence slower rates presumably if irrigation was performed with tww subjected to advanced tertiary treatment michael et al 2013 or with fw with a higher load of args due to general anthropogenic pollution then the observable differences between fw and tww irrigation would be eliminated similar studies comparing the effects of fw and tww irrigation are currently lacking one exception is the study by marano et al 2019 that highlighted differences in arg abundance in tww and fw but detected no irrigation effect on arg abundance in the respective soils in contrary we detected all the args and inti1 in our sampled fw while most of the args were present in fw irrigated soil microcosms as well therefore the estimation of arg abundance in fw and tww should be considered as a crucial step prior the estimation of the irrigation impact on soil consequently the differing arg loads due to differing tww quality might thus have contributed to the contradictive statements from previous studies on the impact of tww irrigation however there are other important factors to consider such as the variability of soil types physicochemical characteristics and microbiota from different geographical regions forsberg et al 2014 bahram et al 2018 most of the studies including our own are limited to distinct geographical regions with different climate and soil characteristics thus the contrasting observations could be explained by the different geographic locations of the studies we here show that microcosm studies with different soil types microbial communities and different quality twws could provide a successful research tool to gain further insights into the exact parameters determining the effects of tww irrigation on args in soil in the future this includes considering complex mutualistic and antagonistic interactions of the soil microbiome with different agricultural crops through for example root exudates chen et al 2019 interactions in the rhizosphere have previously been shown to lead to either positive jechalke et al 2013 or negative song et al 2020 selection for args in agricultural soils further soil properties might change as tww irrigation introduces not only bacteria and mobile resistant genes but also high nutrient loads and chemical contaminants e g heavy metals ternes et al 2007 rusan et al 2007 this may lead to accumulation of metals and drug residues elgallal et al 2016 and induce bacterial stress hence favouring arg and inti1 dissemination zhao et al 2019 consequently we speculate that the alteration of soil properties with enrichment of metals and drug residues could have contributed partially to the observed arg and inti1 persistence in the soil however further research is necessary to elucidate the complex interplay of soil biotic and abiotic factors with tww irrigation 5 conclusion in summary we demonstrated that multiphase and multifactorial experiments are a powerful tool to assess the impact of tww irrigation on the prevalence of args in agricultural soil these include temporal field sampling comparisons with non impacted soil and microcosm experiments with various types of irrigation we showed that any type of irrigation could lead to the dissemination of args in soil e g sul1 and qnrs nevertheless the impact of fw irrigation on arg and inti1 profile of soil was distinctively minor compared to the impact of tww irrigation with a high load of args our multiphase approach was a useful tool for differentiating which genes were increased by tww irrigation sul1 inti1 qnrs and bla oxa 58 and genes that were stable members of the indigenous soil resistome unaffected by tww irrigation bla ctx m 32 and bla tem therefore the impact of tww irrigation depends on the arg and inti1 load of irrigation water the irrigation intensity the type of each gene and its potential link with the native soil resistome funding this work was supported by

17172,the unique characteristics of bacterial communities on plastic debris and microplastics in the environment have been widely studied in recent years however due to the randomness of sampling it is hard to identify whether the unique characteristics of bacterial communities on plastic debris is due to the plastics as substrate itself or the accumulation and transportation by plastics therefore the ecological effects of bacterial communities on plastic debris including the species invasion are still not clear to investigate such issue we took the haihe estuary tianjin china as an example and designed a strategy to sample and redeploy randomly collected environmental plastic debris for 6 weeks thus the variation of bacterial communities on plastic debris could be assessed at the same time commercial experimental plastic debris was used as the control group to monitor the growth of local bacterial communities on plastics in the cultivation environment our study discussed the bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris from three aspects including colonization characteristics taxonomic analysis and molecular metabolism estimation we found that the bacterial communities on environmental plastic debris tended to show local characteristics which were less affected by their original characteristics therefore the results reminded us that the ecological risks of bacterial communities on plastics which were brought by the transportation of plastic debris in the environment may not be as serious as it was expected previously geographical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic debris bacterial communities localization transportation 1 introduction plastics are widely used in daily life due to their advantages such as light weight solidity low price and high plasticity plastics europe 2016 wang et al 2019 however as a result of abuse a large amount of plastics enters the environment jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 subsequently breaks into smaller plastic debris cooper and corcoran 2010 feldman 2002 kubowicz and booth 2017 and has been detected in various corners of the world law et al 2010 thompson 2004 wu et al 2019a due to its hydrophobic surface large surface area and stable chemical properties plastic debris has become a good substrate for microbial adhesion which is called the plastisphere schlundt et al 2019 zettler et al 2013 many studies have indicated that the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris is different from the composition of bacterial communities in the surrounding environment and plastic debris is generally considered to be a good carrier of bacteria making bacteria a hitchhiker didier et al 2017 kirstein et al 2016 zettler et al found that the richness and evenness of the bacterial communities on the surface of plastic debris were higher than the richness and evenness of the bacterial communities in the surrounding water and conditional pathogens e g vibrio had a higher abundance on plastic debris in the subtropical circulation zone of the north atlantic zettler et al 2013 frere et al found that many bacteria including some pathogenic bacteria that were not detected in the water colonized the surface of plastic debris in the bay of brest frere et al 2018 moreover de tender et al found that bacteria on plastic debris could be transported from the original site to a new site where these bacteria were not frequently detected de tender et al 2015 therefore the plastisphere is often regarded as a unique niche arousing great concern regarding ecological risks including species invasion keswani et al 2016 viršek et al 2017 according to the published studies the bacterial communities on plastic debris are usually different from the bacterial communities in the surrounding environment such as sediments and water however it is hard to identify whether this difference is due to the unique niche of the plastisphere itself or the transportation of bacterial communities mediated by plastic debris from other places moreover the latter was considered to result in greater ecological risks including species invasion some previous studies based on the field sampling method did find unique bacterial communities and invasive species on plastic debris giving reference to the ecological risk of bacterial communities on plastics however due to the unclear original location and residence time of these plastic debris at the sampling site previous studies were unable to confirm whether these bacterial communities as well as the pathogenic bacteria would survive at the sampling site for a long time consequently the stability of bacterial communities and the survivability of representative species on plastic debris in the environment might be the key factors to reveal the ecological effects of bacterial communities on plastic debris the haihe estuary which is located in bohai bay tianjin china was selected as a natural experimental field in this study fresh water and sea water are mixed here and thus environmental factors including salinity vary intensely moreover the haihe estuary is also a site highly impacted by human activities including fishing activities ship transportation and entertainment so many kinds of plastic debris can be found in this area previously for the haihe estuary we studied the bacterial communities on the surface of microplastics in the nature environment by randomly sampling wu et al 2020 moreover we exposed commercial experimental plastic debris in situ to monitor the adhesion process of bacterial communities on plastic debris li et al 2019 we gained valuable insights about the bacterial communities on microplastics plastic debris to some extent however for the field sampling experiment the residence time of the collected samples was unknown while for the in situ exposure experiment the physicochemical characteristics of the commercial plastics including their aging stage might not be similar to the physicochemical characteristics of environmental plastic debris these methods did provide valuable information on the bacterial communities on plastic debris in the environment e g de tender et al 2015 li et al 2020 tu et al 2020 zettler et al 2013 but there are still some limitations therefore we made further improvements based on previous studies in this study the sampling method was improved namely we combined the field sampling experiment environmental plastic debris and the in situ experiment experimental plastic debris we designed a strategy in which the environmental plastic debris was randomly sampled and redeployed at the sampling sites so that the bacterial communities on them were further developed thus the variation of bacterial communities on plastic debris that were randomly collected from the surrounding environment could be assessed meanwhile the experimental plastic debris was deployed at the same sampling sites and was used as the control group to monitor the growth of local bacterial communities on plastics by evaluating the colonization characteristics of bacterial communities on randomly collected environmental plastic debris the ecological effects of bacterial communities on plastics in the environment were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of sampling and experiment sites three sites were selected in the haihe estuary tianjin china fig 1 site 1 s1 is located upstream of the haihe tidal gate site 2 s2 is located downstream of the haihe tidal gate and site 3 s3 is located at the mouth of the dagu river the specific longitude and latitude of each site are shown in table s1 all the selected sites belong to the interaction area of freshwater and seawater in the haihe estuary the field sampling experiment and the in situ experiment were conducted from september 12 2019 to october 24 2019 the samples were harvested during the same tidal period meanwhile the environmental factors are measured and summarized in table s2 2 2 the procedures of the field sampling experiment and the in situ experiment in the haihe estuary plastic debris samples consisted of two parts including environmental plastic debris en ps and experimental plastic debris exp ps en ps were randomly sampled from the surrounding environment and partly redeployed at selected sites exp ps which are commercial plastics were placed at the same sites at low tide for each site we collected six pieces of debris from the environment with sterile forceps randomly the six pieces of debris were preliminarily judged based on visual observation at each site the collection range of debris at each site was universal including the land intertidal zone and water since we were unable to determine the exact composition of collected debris when we conducted the field sampling experiment we performed the same treatment for debris including plastics and nonplastics after all collected debris was brought back to the laboratory and identified by attenuated total reflection fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy atr ftir nonplastic debris was excluded from the subsequent dna extraction and analysis the size of debris we randomly collected was approximately 10 50 cm2 so that each piece of suspected plastic debris could be randomly divided into two parts initially one part was brought back to the laboratory immediately and used to extract dna from the bacterial communities on the plastic debris and thus the initial state of bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris en ps could be recorded environmental plastic debris at the 0 week e0 the other part was put into a 40 mesh nylon filter bag 15 cm 12 cm and redeployed with weights 2 kg at the interface between sediments and water of the corresponding sampling site the textile of the nylon bags was translucent and most sediments water sunlight and microorganisms could pass through the mesh to reach the surface of plastic debris after being cultured for 6 weeks the other part was harvested and used to extract dna to record the state of bacterial communities environmental plastic debris at the 6th week e6 according to the main detected polymer types of plastic debris in the haihe estuary liu et al 2020 wu et al 2019b six types of commercial plastic samples including polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyurethane pu polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc purchased from jinyusheng industrial co ltd cn were selected as experimental plastic debris exp ps each type of exp ps was cut into small pieces with a size of 5 mm 5 mm and 50 pieces in total were put into a 40 mesh nylon filter bag six nylon bags containing the six types of exp ps were set up as one group at each site at the beginning of the experiment 0 weeks three groups of exp ps were deployed by the same method as en ps moreover one group of exp ps was harvested at each site at the 2nd week experimental plastic debris at the 2nd week p2 4th week experimental plastic debris at the 4th week p4 and 6th week experimental plastic debris at the 6th week p6 li et al 2019 in total during the 6 weeks of culture nine groups of exp ps were harvested from the three sampling sites all the samples were harvested during the same tidal period rinsed with milli q water ulupure technology co ltd cn for three times harrison et al 2014 miao et al 2019 and then kept in ice bags during transportation in the laboratory the samples were stored at 80 c and dna extraction was performed as soon as possible 2 3 collection of sediment and water samples at each site three parallel sediment samples and three parallel water samples were collected all samples were kept in ice bags during transportation and the bacteria in the water samples were harvested by passing through the 0 22 μm filter membrane merck millipore usa as soon as possible when arriving at the laboratory the sediment samples and filtered membranes were stored at 80 c before dna extraction the details are provided in the supporting information paragraph s1 2 4 characterization of environmental plastic debris to identify the polymer type of collected debris each piece of sampled debris was cut into small pieces with a size of 5 mm 5 mm three pieces of small debris were selected randomly and placed in ep tubes then 30 v v hydrofluoric acid hf was added to the ep tube to remove the organic matter absorbed on the surface of debris after 24 h of treatment each piece of debris was ultrasonicated for 2 min rinsed with milli q water three times and dried at 30 c in vacuo attenuated total reflection fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy atr ftir bruker tensor ii ger was used to identify the components of the collected debris the spectral range of the detector was 400 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 8 cm 1 for 16 scans the spectral data were processed by opus software and compared with the shanghai organic institute infrared spectrogram database website http 202 127 145 134 scdb main irs introduce asp in addition when collecting the debris at the sampling sites the color and shape of each piece of debris were recorded and the information about debris that was identified as plastics is shown in table s3 2 5 dna extraction and sequencing dna from en ps and exp ps was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit qiangen ger according to the instructions a previous study showed that microplastics in coastal sediments do not interfere with dna extraction from sediments in the haihe estuary wu et al 2020 therefore three parallel sediment samples at each site were mixed together and dna was extracted by a powersoil dna isolation kit qiangen ger according to the instructions dna from water samples was enriched on the filter membrane and then extracted using a powerwater dna isolation kit omega usa according to the instructions the species identification analysis of bacterial communities was determined by next generation amplicon sequencing of the v4 variable region of the 16s rrna gene primers used in pcr amplification reaction system pcr amplification conditions and subsequent processing of pcr products are shown in the supporting information paragraph s2 2 6 data analysis and statistics vsearch v2 4 4 was used to stitch the reads of each sample to obtain raw tags after filtering out low quality sequences that were less than 150 bp had a quality score 20 had undefined bases and contained 8 bp single nucleotide repeats effective tags were obtained operational taxonomic units otus were defined as clustered sequences with 97 similarity and the otus less than 0 001 of the total sequences in all samples were removed representative sequences were annotated based on the silva128 database christian et al 2013 the software used for data analysis and statistics included quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime r megan graphlan statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp bugbase online platform and statistical product and service solutions spss please see supporting information for the details paragraph s3 2 7 quality assurance all exp ps and nylon filter bags were sterilized with 70 alcoholic solution to remove bacteria and contaminants washed with milli q water three times and stored in sterile glass bottles before the in situ experiments li et al 2020 during the sampling and in situ experiments blank quartz sand milli q water and virgin plastic debris which were also applied in the in situ experiments as exp ps were taken as the travel blanks according to previous studies we set the threshold of 100 reads in dna extraction de tender et al 2017 since the number of reads of the travel blanks was less than 100 and the number of reads of sediments water plastic debris samples ranged from 240 to 292 indicating that the samples were not polluted during transportation moreover during all operations in the laboratory laboratory clothes and laboratory gloves were always worn and the plastic product was avoided before dna extraction the working platform was cleaned with alcohol 70 v v to avoid bacterial contamination from the air aluminum foil was used to cover the samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the environmental plastic debris the polymer types of en ps were identified via atr ftir and defined based on the main ingredients a total of fourteen en ps were obtained after two nonplastic samples at s3 were excluded six samples were obtained at s1 including four pe one pp and one pet six samples were obtained at s2 including three pe one pp one ps and one pu in addition a total of four samples including two pe one pp and one ps were obtained at s3 all the collected plastic samples were common polymer types in the haihe estuary liu et al 2020 wu et al 2019b in addition the photo color shape and atr ftir spectrum of the en ps are summarized in table s3 3 2 colonization characteristics of bacterial communities on plastic debris based on the types of en ps we collected exp ps with the same polymer types were selected for the analysis of bacterial communities namely commercial pe pp and pet were selected at s1 commercial pe pp ps and pu were selected at s2 and commercial pe pp and ps were selected at s3 photos of exp ps collected at the 2nd 4th and 6th weeks are summarized in table s4 according to the results of dna sequencing the polymer type of plastic debris had less effect on the composition of bacterial communities in this study anova p 0 05 which was also consistent with previous studies in the haihe estuary li et al 2019 and other areas amaral zettler et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 oberbeckmann and labrena 2020 moreover the change trend of otu abundance on the en ps at different sampling sites was different which could be attributed to the survival or death of bacteria in the cultivation environment further verifying that the en ps were collected randomly and from the unknown original locations fig s1 according to anosim analysis the composition of bacterial communities on en ps and exp ps were all in the process of obvious dynamic variation during the 6 weeks of culture anosim r 0 706 0 p 1 0 10 3 0 01 principal component analysis pcoa based on the otu tables was used to investigate the time dependent variation in bacterial communities fig 2 a the overlapping part among the confidence ellipse of bacterial communities in the sediments water and plastic debris indicated that the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris was more similar to the composition of bacterial communities in the sediments li et al 2019 wu et al 2020 for plastic debris the confidence ellipses of e0 and e6 partially overlapped which could be ascribed to the reconstruction of bacterial communities on en ps during the 6 weeks of culture to probe the formation process of local bacterial communities on the plastic debris at the sampling sites exp ps was monitored reflected by the variation in the confidence ellipse of exp ps the confidence ellipse of bacterial communities on the exp ps p2 partially overlapped with the en ps both e0 and e6 after 2 weeks of culture fig 2a a while the confidence ellipse of the exp ps p4 and p6 tended to deviate from e0 and cover e6 in the following weeks fig 2a b c in addition the relatively scattered dots representing the bacterial communities on en ps became more aggregated after 6 weeks of culture fig 2a c the overlapping parts of e6 and p6 showed that regardless of the original location of the en ps after being cultured for a long time the composition of bacterial communities on the en ps became similar to those on the local exp ps that is the composition of bacterial communities on the en ps from other locations could not be stable when redeployed at the sampling site and tended to be more localized to further compare the variation of the composition of bacterial communities on the en ps during the 6 weeks of culture alpha diversity including shannon simpson and chao 1 indexes was also calculated among plastic debris including e0 e6 p2 p4 and p6 fig 2b during 6 weeks of culture the alpha indexes of bacterial communities on en ps showed a change trend similar to the alpha indexes of bacterial communities on exp ps which could be ascribed to the reconstruction of bacterial communities on en ps specifically the shannon and simpson indexes showed the overall upward trend the chao 1 index showed the overall downward trend which was consistent with the change trend of otu abundance additionally the value range of alpha indexes from the en ps exhibited a narrower distribution after 6 weeks of culture indicating that the differences among randomly collected en ps at the same sampling site were reduced due to the same cultivation environment since the original location of en ps was unclear and many bacteria colonized the en ps initially environmental selection drove the variation in bacterial communities which tended to reflect the local characteristics the results indicated that the bacterial communities on the en ps were reconstructed and the differences among randomly collected en ps in the same sampling site were reduced due to the same cultivation environment fig 2b rda was applied to analyze the effects of environmental factors on the composition of bacterial communities on en ps and exp ps at different culture times fig s2 based on the relationship between the symbols representing the bacterial communities on plastic debris and the vectors representing the environmental factors the dominant environmental factors were similar within each site except for e0 briefly the dominant factor was dissolved oxygen do at s1 while at s3 the dominant factor was salinity sal followed by total nitrogen tn at s2 the bacterial communities were affected by multiple environmental factors such as ph total phosphorus tp total carbon tc inorganic carbon ic total organic carbon toc and temperature t fig s2 in addition exp ps would be more heavily affected by the environment which could be attributed to its sterile surface at the initial stage the results indicated that the bacterial communities on en ps might be influenced by cultivation environmental factors and reflect characteristics similar to those of the local bacterial communities on plastic debris fig s2 combining the results including pcoa alpha indexes and rda mentioned above the local environmental effects were found to play important roles in changing the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris the bacterial communities on the en ps from the different original locations became similar at the sampling sites and tended to show local characteristics in the current circumstance after being cultured for 6 weeks 3 3 taxonomic analysis of bacterial communities on plastic debris as depicted in fig 3 during the 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance and composition of the top 10 bacteria with the highest relative abundance on en ps and exp ps at the genus level were different from those in the surrounding environment sediments and water indicating that plastic debris could supply a distinct habitat to construct a special bacterial community amaral zettler et al 2015 de tender et al 2015 for plastic debris some specimens of en ps showed a different fingerprint of main bacteria from others at the same site e g s1 e0 1 s2 e0 1 and s3 e0 3 which could be ascribed to the various original locations and residence times of en ps however after 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance of the top 10 bacteria from each en ps specimen tended to be similar at each site meanwhile some en ps specimens changed slightly after 6 weeks of culture e g s1 e0 3 s2 e0 4 and s2 e0 6 these en ps specimens could be inferred to have resided in the sampling environment for a long time before sampling notably initially many bacteria had colonized the en ps before sampling while there were no microorganisms on the sterilized exp ps before deployment at the sampling site however after 6 weeks of culture the fingerprints of the top 10 bacteria on en ps e6 were different from the fingerprints of the top 10 bacteria at the initial stage e0 and showed characteristics similar to those on exp ps p6 namely we can speculate that if the residence time was sufficient both en ps and exp ps under the same deployment conditions would show similar bacterial taxonomic characteristics which were independent of the original location of plastic debris fig 3 since the polymer types had fewer effects on the composition of bacterial communities anova p 0 05 plastic debris samples at the same site and the same collection time were regarded as a whole the composition of bacterial communities on plastic samples was clustered at the genus level including e0 e6 p2 p4 and p6 fig 4 according to the heat map the composition of bacterial communities on the exp ps became relatively stable after 4 weeks of deployment reflected by the similar fingerprints and the clusters of exp ps at the 4th week and the 6th week i e s1 p4 and s1 p6 s2 p4 and s2 p6 and s3 p4 and s3 p6 respectively however en ps showed a different fingerprint at the 6th week e6 compared with themselves at the initial stage e0 but tended to cluster with exp ps p6 at the corresponding site indicating that the bacterial communities on the en ps were gradually reconstructed and exhibited similarities to the local bacterial communities during the 6 weeks of culture notably the bacterial communities on s1 e0 showed a very different fingerprint from the bacterial communities on other plastic debris at s1 which could be explained by the fact that these en ps might not exist at the sampling site for a long time thus the composition of bacterial communities was different however after 6 weeks of deployment the bacterial communities on en ps at s1 became more similar to the bacterial communities on exp ps namely s1 e6 tended to cluster with s1 p6 fig 4 in addition plastic debris samples at the same site and the same collection time were also taken as a whole to analyze the top 10 bacteria with the highest relative abundance at the genus level fig s3 table s5 most bacteria on en ps showed the same total upward downward change trend as exp ps at the same site further verifying the local environmental effects on the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris fig s3 table s5 at each site bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between plastic debris were analyzed at the genus level fig s4 s9 a total of 178 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between the initial time s1 e0 and after 6 weeks of culture s1 e6 were detected on the en ps at s1 fig s4 however there were only 120 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between the en ps s1 e6 and the exp ps s1 p6 at the 6th week fig s5 for s2 there were 125 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between s2 e0 and s2 e6 fig s6 while there were 56 kinds between s2 e6 and s2 p6 fig s7 meanwhile there were 105 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between s3 e0 and s3 e6 fig s8 while only 6 kinds between s3 e6 and s3 p6 fig s9 at s3 consequently the differences between e0 and e6 were greater than the differences between e6 and p6 indicating that bacterial communities on en ps were changed and tended to be more localized combining all the results mentioned above we found that the bacterial communities as well as the main bacteria were obviously influenced by the local cultivation environment in the same environment most bacteria on the surface of en ps changed significantly and became more similar to those on exp ps therefore the taxonomic analysis further verified that the composition of bacterial communities would tend to show the local characteristics of the sampling sites regardless of whether the surface of plastic debris had been colonized by bacterial communities at the beginning of cultivation 3 4 ecological effects of environmental plastic debris according to the analysis of the previous sections although the original location of the randomly collected en ps was unclear the redeployment of plastic debris resulted in the localization of bacterial communities on en ps however it cannot be denied that some bacteria carried by the en ps from the original locations might continue growing in the cultivation environment the survival of bacteria on plastic debris in the new environment especially some representative bacteria was a key criterion to evaluate whether plastic debris can lead to ecological risks e g species invasion by analyzing the pathogenic bacteria and functional prediction of bacterial communities on randomly collected en ps the ecological effects of bacterial communities on en ps were discussed 3 4 1 pathogenic bacteria to evaluate the ecological effects of bacterial communities on en ps the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria on plastic debris was compared among en ps and exp ps during 6 weeks of culture fig 5 and s10 table s6 the species and abundance of pathogenic bacteria on the different kinds of plastic debris might not be identical but plastic debris is generally considered to be a good carrier of pathogenic bacteria making pathogenic bacteria into hitchhikers didier et al 2017 keswani et al 2016 kirstein et al 2016 in this study pathogenic bacteria including vibrio pseudomonas pseudoalteromonas bacillus halomonas photobacterium and rhodococcus were detected on the surface of en ps when collected after 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance of some bacteria on the en ps changed significantly i e vibrio and pseudomonas at s1 halomonas at s2 pseudomonas halomonas and photobacterium at s3 in addition the relative abundance of most pathogenic bacteria on the en ps showed no significant difference from those on the exp ps at corresponding sites after being cultured for 6 weeks except for vibrio pseudoalteromonas and photobacterium at s2 the abnormal decrease in the relative abundance of vibrio and pseudoalteromonas at s2 might be due to environmental disturbance when the haihe tidal gate was opened table s2 the difference in the relative abundance of photobacterium between the bacterial communities on en ps and exp ps at s2 after 6 weeks of culture could be attributed to the large gap in the relative abundance at the initial stage or the insufficient culture time vibrio is a widely reported pathogen on plastic debris jiang et al 2018 kirstein et al 2016 several species of vibrio can cause diseases in spinal and invertebrate animals and some are also pathogenic to humans and cause diarrhea or extratesticular infections farmer iii et al 2015 in this study many vibrio colonized the en ps at the initial stage however after 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance of vibrio on the en ps at all the selected sites decreased furthermore it became more similar to that on the corresponding exp ps at s1 and s3 indicating that the bacterial communities including some pathogens were under reconstruction in the cultivation environment and showed some similar characteristics to the local bacterial communities on plasitcs consequently the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria on en ps at each site became comparable to or lower than that on exp ps at the same site after 6 weeks of culture notably we must acknowledge that the relative abundance of some pathogens on en ps and exp ps remained different after being cultured for 6 weeks fig 5 however the comparative or lower relative abundance of most pathogens on en ps after 6 weeks of culture verified the assumption that plastic debris would have a small role in spreading pathogens over large areas oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 3 4 2 functional prediction the typical functions of bacterial communities including biofilm formation potential pathogenicity mobile elements and stress tolerance on e0 e6 and p6 were predicted using the bugbase online platform fig 6 a biofilms are diverse communities composed of bacteria fungi algae and protozoa that can form within minutes to hours after microorganisms from the surrounding environment accumulate on plastic debris rummel et al 2017 as described in fig 6a a the biofilm formation index was the highest on p6 followed by e6 and the lowest on e0 the results showed that after being cultured under the same environmental conditions for 6 weeks the biofilm formation ability of en ps was weaker than that of the exp ps which had a smooth and sterilized surface at the beginning to predict the potential ecological impact of bacterial communities on plastic debris three indexes including potentially pathogenic mobile element and stress tolerant indexes were assessed using the bugbase online platform fig 6a b c d potentially pathogenic and mobile element indexes were the highest in the bacterial communities on p6 fig 6a b c while the stress tolerance index was the highest on e0 fig 6a d in addition all three indexes were the lowest in the bacterial communities on e6 after 6 weeks of culture the three indexes of en ps all decreased and became lower than the indexes of exp ps cultured under the same environmental conditions meanwhile the difference between each en ps decreased suggesting that the ecological impacts of bacterial communities on different en ps tended to be more uniform after 6 weeks of exposure therefore after being redeployed the potential ecological impact of bacterial communities on randomly collected en ps was reduced and became similar to the potential ecological impact of those on the local exp ps for functional classification kegg analysis was used to distinguish the difference between e0 and e6 as well as between e6 and p6 at each site fig 6b and s11 s16 according to kegg analysis 140 kinds of functional classifications between e0 and e6 were significantly different at s1 among which the top 3 were fatty acid elongation in mitochondria aminoacyl trna biosynthesis and amino acid related enzymes fig 6b a and s11 meanwhile 92 kinds of functional classifications were significantly different from e6 to p6 and the top 3 were photosynthesis antenna proteins drug metabolism cytochrome p450 and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450 fig s12 for the above 6 kinds of functional classifications all of them belonged to metabolism except for aminoacyl trna biosynthesis which belonged to genetic information processing for s2 there were 16 kinds of functional classifications between e0 and e6 that were significantly different and the adipocytokine signaling pathway glutamatergic synapse and ppar signaling pathway accounted for the top 3 which belonged to organismal systems fig 6b b and s13 moreover 27 kinds of functional classifications were different from e6 to p6 and the top 3 with the most significant differences were membrane and intracellular structural molecules caffeine metabolism and base excision repair membrane and intracellular structural molecules belonged to cell process and signaling caffeine metabolism belonged to metabolism and base excision repair belonged to genetic information processing which were different from each other fig s14 the amount of different functional classifications was smaller at s2 than at the other two sites which was consistent with the fingerprints of the main bacteria being more similar between e0 and e6 at s2 fig 4 for s3 epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection pentose and glucuronate interconversions and lipid metabolism were the top 3 among 105 kinds of different functional classifications between e0 and e6 pentose and glucuronate interconversions and lipid metabolism both belonged to metabolism fig 6b c and s15 notably the most significant one helicobacter pylori infection belonged to human diseases and was more actively on e0 than on e6 fig 6b c since some en ps at s3 were the debris of beverage bottles and food packing bags we speculated that these en ps were infected by helicobacter pylori before collection however after being cultured for 6 weeks the expression was reduced significantly which was in accordance with the results of pathogenic bacteria fig 5 and the potentially pathogenic index fig 6a b in addition there were 28 kinds of functional classifications between e6 and p6 that were significantly different and the top 3 were beta alanine metabolism lysine biosynthesis and butanoate metabolism all of which belonged to metabolism fig s16 most of the above functional classifications with significant differences belonged to metabolism which might be related to some metabolic pathways being overrepresented on plastics more than on natural substrates miao et al 2019 and reflected the adaptation of the bacterial communities to the environment breton deval et al 2020 the differences in functional classification between e0 and e6 were much greater than the differences between e6 and p6 at s1 and s3 and slightly smaller than the differences between e6 and p6 at s2 after 6 weeks of culture the functional prediction from en ps became more similar to the functional prediction from exp ps the results further indicated that the local cultivation environment had strong effects on the reconstruction of bacterial communities on the plastic debris whose original locations were unclear namely bacterial communities on the plastic debris would adapt their composition to the current environment thus the ecological risks such as species invasion which were brought by the transportation of plastic debris in the environment may not be as serious as it was expected previously 4 conclusions taking the estuary area of bohai bay tianjin china as an example this study discussed the bacterial communities on randomly collected environmental plastic debris after being cultured in the surrounding environment for 6 weeks we combined the field sampling experiment and the in situ experiment and designed a strategy to sample and redeploy the environmental plastic debris at the selected sites the variation of bacterial communities on plastic debris which was collected from the surrounding environment randomly was assessed at the same time the experimental plastic debris was used as the control group to monitor the growth of local bacterial communities on plastics in the cultivation environment based on the comparison of bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris and the experimental plastic debris during the 6 weeks of culture we found that 1 the composition of bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris changed and showed local characteristics in the cultivation environment 2 some bacteria on the surface of environmental plastic debris showed significant differences from those at the collection time and the relative abundance of bacteria on environmental plastic debris became more similar to those on local plastics 3 the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria and typical metabolic function prediction indexes on the environmental plastic debris became comparable to or lower than the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria and metabolic functions on local plastics from the above three aspects including colonization characteristics taxonomic analysis and molecular metabolism estimation we found that the bacterial communities on randomly collected environmental plastic debris tended to show local characteristics which were less affected by their original characteristics moreover the results also reminded us that the ecological risks of bacterial communities on plastics such as species invasion which were brought by the transportation of plastic debris in the environment may not be as serious as it was expected previously credit authorship contribution statement xiaohan zhang investigation formal analysis formal analysis validation

17172,the unique characteristics of bacterial communities on plastic debris and microplastics in the environment have been widely studied in recent years however due to the randomness of sampling it is hard to identify whether the unique characteristics of bacterial communities on plastic debris is due to the plastics as substrate itself or the accumulation and transportation by plastics therefore the ecological effects of bacterial communities on plastic debris including the species invasion are still not clear to investigate such issue we took the haihe estuary tianjin china as an example and designed a strategy to sample and redeploy randomly collected environmental plastic debris for 6 weeks thus the variation of bacterial communities on plastic debris could be assessed at the same time commercial experimental plastic debris was used as the control group to monitor the growth of local bacterial communities on plastics in the cultivation environment our study discussed the bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris from three aspects including colonization characteristics taxonomic analysis and molecular metabolism estimation we found that the bacterial communities on environmental plastic debris tended to show local characteristics which were less affected by their original characteristics therefore the results reminded us that the ecological risks of bacterial communities on plastics which were brought by the transportation of plastic debris in the environment may not be as serious as it was expected previously geographical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic debris bacterial communities localization transportation 1 introduction plastics are widely used in daily life due to their advantages such as light weight solidity low price and high plasticity plastics europe 2016 wang et al 2019 however as a result of abuse a large amount of plastics enters the environment jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 subsequently breaks into smaller plastic debris cooper and corcoran 2010 feldman 2002 kubowicz and booth 2017 and has been detected in various corners of the world law et al 2010 thompson 2004 wu et al 2019a due to its hydrophobic surface large surface area and stable chemical properties plastic debris has become a good substrate for microbial adhesion which is called the plastisphere schlundt et al 2019 zettler et al 2013 many studies have indicated that the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris is different from the composition of bacterial communities in the surrounding environment and plastic debris is generally considered to be a good carrier of bacteria making bacteria a hitchhiker didier et al 2017 kirstein et al 2016 zettler et al found that the richness and evenness of the bacterial communities on the surface of plastic debris were higher than the richness and evenness of the bacterial communities in the surrounding water and conditional pathogens e g vibrio had a higher abundance on plastic debris in the subtropical circulation zone of the north atlantic zettler et al 2013 frere et al found that many bacteria including some pathogenic bacteria that were not detected in the water colonized the surface of plastic debris in the bay of brest frere et al 2018 moreover de tender et al found that bacteria on plastic debris could be transported from the original site to a new site where these bacteria were not frequently detected de tender et al 2015 therefore the plastisphere is often regarded as a unique niche arousing great concern regarding ecological risks including species invasion keswani et al 2016 viršek et al 2017 according to the published studies the bacterial communities on plastic debris are usually different from the bacterial communities in the surrounding environment such as sediments and water however it is hard to identify whether this difference is due to the unique niche of the plastisphere itself or the transportation of bacterial communities mediated by plastic debris from other places moreover the latter was considered to result in greater ecological risks including species invasion some previous studies based on the field sampling method did find unique bacterial communities and invasive species on plastic debris giving reference to the ecological risk of bacterial communities on plastics however due to the unclear original location and residence time of these plastic debris at the sampling site previous studies were unable to confirm whether these bacterial communities as well as the pathogenic bacteria would survive at the sampling site for a long time consequently the stability of bacterial communities and the survivability of representative species on plastic debris in the environment might be the key factors to reveal the ecological effects of bacterial communities on plastic debris the haihe estuary which is located in bohai bay tianjin china was selected as a natural experimental field in this study fresh water and sea water are mixed here and thus environmental factors including salinity vary intensely moreover the haihe estuary is also a site highly impacted by human activities including fishing activities ship transportation and entertainment so many kinds of plastic debris can be found in this area previously for the haihe estuary we studied the bacterial communities on the surface of microplastics in the nature environment by randomly sampling wu et al 2020 moreover we exposed commercial experimental plastic debris in situ to monitor the adhesion process of bacterial communities on plastic debris li et al 2019 we gained valuable insights about the bacterial communities on microplastics plastic debris to some extent however for the field sampling experiment the residence time of the collected samples was unknown while for the in situ exposure experiment the physicochemical characteristics of the commercial plastics including their aging stage might not be similar to the physicochemical characteristics of environmental plastic debris these methods did provide valuable information on the bacterial communities on plastic debris in the environment e g de tender et al 2015 li et al 2020 tu et al 2020 zettler et al 2013 but there are still some limitations therefore we made further improvements based on previous studies in this study the sampling method was improved namely we combined the field sampling experiment environmental plastic debris and the in situ experiment experimental plastic debris we designed a strategy in which the environmental plastic debris was randomly sampled and redeployed at the sampling sites so that the bacterial communities on them were further developed thus the variation of bacterial communities on plastic debris that were randomly collected from the surrounding environment could be assessed meanwhile the experimental plastic debris was deployed at the same sampling sites and was used as the control group to monitor the growth of local bacterial communities on plastics by evaluating the colonization characteristics of bacterial communities on randomly collected environmental plastic debris the ecological effects of bacterial communities on plastics in the environment were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of sampling and experiment sites three sites were selected in the haihe estuary tianjin china fig 1 site 1 s1 is located upstream of the haihe tidal gate site 2 s2 is located downstream of the haihe tidal gate and site 3 s3 is located at the mouth of the dagu river the specific longitude and latitude of each site are shown in table s1 all the selected sites belong to the interaction area of freshwater and seawater in the haihe estuary the field sampling experiment and the in situ experiment were conducted from september 12 2019 to october 24 2019 the samples were harvested during the same tidal period meanwhile the environmental factors are measured and summarized in table s2 2 2 the procedures of the field sampling experiment and the in situ experiment in the haihe estuary plastic debris samples consisted of two parts including environmental plastic debris en ps and experimental plastic debris exp ps en ps were randomly sampled from the surrounding environment and partly redeployed at selected sites exp ps which are commercial plastics were placed at the same sites at low tide for each site we collected six pieces of debris from the environment with sterile forceps randomly the six pieces of debris were preliminarily judged based on visual observation at each site the collection range of debris at each site was universal including the land intertidal zone and water since we were unable to determine the exact composition of collected debris when we conducted the field sampling experiment we performed the same treatment for debris including plastics and nonplastics after all collected debris was brought back to the laboratory and identified by attenuated total reflection fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy atr ftir nonplastic debris was excluded from the subsequent dna extraction and analysis the size of debris we randomly collected was approximately 10 50 cm2 so that each piece of suspected plastic debris could be randomly divided into two parts initially one part was brought back to the laboratory immediately and used to extract dna from the bacterial communities on the plastic debris and thus the initial state of bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris en ps could be recorded environmental plastic debris at the 0 week e0 the other part was put into a 40 mesh nylon filter bag 15 cm 12 cm and redeployed with weights 2 kg at the interface between sediments and water of the corresponding sampling site the textile of the nylon bags was translucent and most sediments water sunlight and microorganisms could pass through the mesh to reach the surface of plastic debris after being cultured for 6 weeks the other part was harvested and used to extract dna to record the state of bacterial communities environmental plastic debris at the 6th week e6 according to the main detected polymer types of plastic debris in the haihe estuary liu et al 2020 wu et al 2019b six types of commercial plastic samples including polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyurethane pu polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc purchased from jinyusheng industrial co ltd cn were selected as experimental plastic debris exp ps each type of exp ps was cut into small pieces with a size of 5 mm 5 mm and 50 pieces in total were put into a 40 mesh nylon filter bag six nylon bags containing the six types of exp ps were set up as one group at each site at the beginning of the experiment 0 weeks three groups of exp ps were deployed by the same method as en ps moreover one group of exp ps was harvested at each site at the 2nd week experimental plastic debris at the 2nd week p2 4th week experimental plastic debris at the 4th week p4 and 6th week experimental plastic debris at the 6th week p6 li et al 2019 in total during the 6 weeks of culture nine groups of exp ps were harvested from the three sampling sites all the samples were harvested during the same tidal period rinsed with milli q water ulupure technology co ltd cn for three times harrison et al 2014 miao et al 2019 and then kept in ice bags during transportation in the laboratory the samples were stored at 80 c and dna extraction was performed as soon as possible 2 3 collection of sediment and water samples at each site three parallel sediment samples and three parallel water samples were collected all samples were kept in ice bags during transportation and the bacteria in the water samples were harvested by passing through the 0 22 μm filter membrane merck millipore usa as soon as possible when arriving at the laboratory the sediment samples and filtered membranes were stored at 80 c before dna extraction the details are provided in the supporting information paragraph s1 2 4 characterization of environmental plastic debris to identify the polymer type of collected debris each piece of sampled debris was cut into small pieces with a size of 5 mm 5 mm three pieces of small debris were selected randomly and placed in ep tubes then 30 v v hydrofluoric acid hf was added to the ep tube to remove the organic matter absorbed on the surface of debris after 24 h of treatment each piece of debris was ultrasonicated for 2 min rinsed with milli q water three times and dried at 30 c in vacuo attenuated total reflection fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy atr ftir bruker tensor ii ger was used to identify the components of the collected debris the spectral range of the detector was 400 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 8 cm 1 for 16 scans the spectral data were processed by opus software and compared with the shanghai organic institute infrared spectrogram database website http 202 127 145 134 scdb main irs introduce asp in addition when collecting the debris at the sampling sites the color and shape of each piece of debris were recorded and the information about debris that was identified as plastics is shown in table s3 2 5 dna extraction and sequencing dna from en ps and exp ps was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit qiangen ger according to the instructions a previous study showed that microplastics in coastal sediments do not interfere with dna extraction from sediments in the haihe estuary wu et al 2020 therefore three parallel sediment samples at each site were mixed together and dna was extracted by a powersoil dna isolation kit qiangen ger according to the instructions dna from water samples was enriched on the filter membrane and then extracted using a powerwater dna isolation kit omega usa according to the instructions the species identification analysis of bacterial communities was determined by next generation amplicon sequencing of the v4 variable region of the 16s rrna gene primers used in pcr amplification reaction system pcr amplification conditions and subsequent processing of pcr products are shown in the supporting information paragraph s2 2 6 data analysis and statistics vsearch v2 4 4 was used to stitch the reads of each sample to obtain raw tags after filtering out low quality sequences that were less than 150 bp had a quality score 20 had undefined bases and contained 8 bp single nucleotide repeats effective tags were obtained operational taxonomic units otus were defined as clustered sequences with 97 similarity and the otus less than 0 001 of the total sequences in all samples were removed representative sequences were annotated based on the silva128 database christian et al 2013 the software used for data analysis and statistics included quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime r megan graphlan statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp bugbase online platform and statistical product and service solutions spss please see supporting information for the details paragraph s3 2 7 quality assurance all exp ps and nylon filter bags were sterilized with 70 alcoholic solution to remove bacteria and contaminants washed with milli q water three times and stored in sterile glass bottles before the in situ experiments li et al 2020 during the sampling and in situ experiments blank quartz sand milli q water and virgin plastic debris which were also applied in the in situ experiments as exp ps were taken as the travel blanks according to previous studies we set the threshold of 100 reads in dna extraction de tender et al 2017 since the number of reads of the travel blanks was less than 100 and the number of reads of sediments water plastic debris samples ranged from 240 to 292 indicating that the samples were not polluted during transportation moreover during all operations in the laboratory laboratory clothes and laboratory gloves were always worn and the plastic product was avoided before dna extraction the working platform was cleaned with alcohol 70 v v to avoid bacterial contamination from the air aluminum foil was used to cover the samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the environmental plastic debris the polymer types of en ps were identified via atr ftir and defined based on the main ingredients a total of fourteen en ps were obtained after two nonplastic samples at s3 were excluded six samples were obtained at s1 including four pe one pp and one pet six samples were obtained at s2 including three pe one pp one ps and one pu in addition a total of four samples including two pe one pp and one ps were obtained at s3 all the collected plastic samples were common polymer types in the haihe estuary liu et al 2020 wu et al 2019b in addition the photo color shape and atr ftir spectrum of the en ps are summarized in table s3 3 2 colonization characteristics of bacterial communities on plastic debris based on the types of en ps we collected exp ps with the same polymer types were selected for the analysis of bacterial communities namely commercial pe pp and pet were selected at s1 commercial pe pp ps and pu were selected at s2 and commercial pe pp and ps were selected at s3 photos of exp ps collected at the 2nd 4th and 6th weeks are summarized in table s4 according to the results of dna sequencing the polymer type of plastic debris had less effect on the composition of bacterial communities in this study anova p 0 05 which was also consistent with previous studies in the haihe estuary li et al 2019 and other areas amaral zettler et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 oberbeckmann and labrena 2020 moreover the change trend of otu abundance on the en ps at different sampling sites was different which could be attributed to the survival or death of bacteria in the cultivation environment further verifying that the en ps were collected randomly and from the unknown original locations fig s1 according to anosim analysis the composition of bacterial communities on en ps and exp ps were all in the process of obvious dynamic variation during the 6 weeks of culture anosim r 0 706 0 p 1 0 10 3 0 01 principal component analysis pcoa based on the otu tables was used to investigate the time dependent variation in bacterial communities fig 2 a the overlapping part among the confidence ellipse of bacterial communities in the sediments water and plastic debris indicated that the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris was more similar to the composition of bacterial communities in the sediments li et al 2019 wu et al 2020 for plastic debris the confidence ellipses of e0 and e6 partially overlapped which could be ascribed to the reconstruction of bacterial communities on en ps during the 6 weeks of culture to probe the formation process of local bacterial communities on the plastic debris at the sampling sites exp ps was monitored reflected by the variation in the confidence ellipse of exp ps the confidence ellipse of bacterial communities on the exp ps p2 partially overlapped with the en ps both e0 and e6 after 2 weeks of culture fig 2a a while the confidence ellipse of the exp ps p4 and p6 tended to deviate from e0 and cover e6 in the following weeks fig 2a b c in addition the relatively scattered dots representing the bacterial communities on en ps became more aggregated after 6 weeks of culture fig 2a c the overlapping parts of e6 and p6 showed that regardless of the original location of the en ps after being cultured for a long time the composition of bacterial communities on the en ps became similar to those on the local exp ps that is the composition of bacterial communities on the en ps from other locations could not be stable when redeployed at the sampling site and tended to be more localized to further compare the variation of the composition of bacterial communities on the en ps during the 6 weeks of culture alpha diversity including shannon simpson and chao 1 indexes was also calculated among plastic debris including e0 e6 p2 p4 and p6 fig 2b during 6 weeks of culture the alpha indexes of bacterial communities on en ps showed a change trend similar to the alpha indexes of bacterial communities on exp ps which could be ascribed to the reconstruction of bacterial communities on en ps specifically the shannon and simpson indexes showed the overall upward trend the chao 1 index showed the overall downward trend which was consistent with the change trend of otu abundance additionally the value range of alpha indexes from the en ps exhibited a narrower distribution after 6 weeks of culture indicating that the differences among randomly collected en ps at the same sampling site were reduced due to the same cultivation environment since the original location of en ps was unclear and many bacteria colonized the en ps initially environmental selection drove the variation in bacterial communities which tended to reflect the local characteristics the results indicated that the bacterial communities on the en ps were reconstructed and the differences among randomly collected en ps in the same sampling site were reduced due to the same cultivation environment fig 2b rda was applied to analyze the effects of environmental factors on the composition of bacterial communities on en ps and exp ps at different culture times fig s2 based on the relationship between the symbols representing the bacterial communities on plastic debris and the vectors representing the environmental factors the dominant environmental factors were similar within each site except for e0 briefly the dominant factor was dissolved oxygen do at s1 while at s3 the dominant factor was salinity sal followed by total nitrogen tn at s2 the bacterial communities were affected by multiple environmental factors such as ph total phosphorus tp total carbon tc inorganic carbon ic total organic carbon toc and temperature t fig s2 in addition exp ps would be more heavily affected by the environment which could be attributed to its sterile surface at the initial stage the results indicated that the bacterial communities on en ps might be influenced by cultivation environmental factors and reflect characteristics similar to those of the local bacterial communities on plastic debris fig s2 combining the results including pcoa alpha indexes and rda mentioned above the local environmental effects were found to play important roles in changing the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris the bacterial communities on the en ps from the different original locations became similar at the sampling sites and tended to show local characteristics in the current circumstance after being cultured for 6 weeks 3 3 taxonomic analysis of bacterial communities on plastic debris as depicted in fig 3 during the 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance and composition of the top 10 bacteria with the highest relative abundance on en ps and exp ps at the genus level were different from those in the surrounding environment sediments and water indicating that plastic debris could supply a distinct habitat to construct a special bacterial community amaral zettler et al 2015 de tender et al 2015 for plastic debris some specimens of en ps showed a different fingerprint of main bacteria from others at the same site e g s1 e0 1 s2 e0 1 and s3 e0 3 which could be ascribed to the various original locations and residence times of en ps however after 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance of the top 10 bacteria from each en ps specimen tended to be similar at each site meanwhile some en ps specimens changed slightly after 6 weeks of culture e g s1 e0 3 s2 e0 4 and s2 e0 6 these en ps specimens could be inferred to have resided in the sampling environment for a long time before sampling notably initially many bacteria had colonized the en ps before sampling while there were no microorganisms on the sterilized exp ps before deployment at the sampling site however after 6 weeks of culture the fingerprints of the top 10 bacteria on en ps e6 were different from the fingerprints of the top 10 bacteria at the initial stage e0 and showed characteristics similar to those on exp ps p6 namely we can speculate that if the residence time was sufficient both en ps and exp ps under the same deployment conditions would show similar bacterial taxonomic characteristics which were independent of the original location of plastic debris fig 3 since the polymer types had fewer effects on the composition of bacterial communities anova p 0 05 plastic debris samples at the same site and the same collection time were regarded as a whole the composition of bacterial communities on plastic samples was clustered at the genus level including e0 e6 p2 p4 and p6 fig 4 according to the heat map the composition of bacterial communities on the exp ps became relatively stable after 4 weeks of deployment reflected by the similar fingerprints and the clusters of exp ps at the 4th week and the 6th week i e s1 p4 and s1 p6 s2 p4 and s2 p6 and s3 p4 and s3 p6 respectively however en ps showed a different fingerprint at the 6th week e6 compared with themselves at the initial stage e0 but tended to cluster with exp ps p6 at the corresponding site indicating that the bacterial communities on the en ps were gradually reconstructed and exhibited similarities to the local bacterial communities during the 6 weeks of culture notably the bacterial communities on s1 e0 showed a very different fingerprint from the bacterial communities on other plastic debris at s1 which could be explained by the fact that these en ps might not exist at the sampling site for a long time thus the composition of bacterial communities was different however after 6 weeks of deployment the bacterial communities on en ps at s1 became more similar to the bacterial communities on exp ps namely s1 e6 tended to cluster with s1 p6 fig 4 in addition plastic debris samples at the same site and the same collection time were also taken as a whole to analyze the top 10 bacteria with the highest relative abundance at the genus level fig s3 table s5 most bacteria on en ps showed the same total upward downward change trend as exp ps at the same site further verifying the local environmental effects on the composition of bacterial communities on plastic debris fig s3 table s5 at each site bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between plastic debris were analyzed at the genus level fig s4 s9 a total of 178 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between the initial time s1 e0 and after 6 weeks of culture s1 e6 were detected on the en ps at s1 fig s4 however there were only 120 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between the en ps s1 e6 and the exp ps s1 p6 at the 6th week fig s5 for s2 there were 125 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between s2 e0 and s2 e6 fig s6 while there were 56 kinds between s2 e6 and s2 p6 fig s7 meanwhile there were 105 kinds of bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between s3 e0 and s3 e6 fig s8 while only 6 kinds between s3 e6 and s3 p6 fig s9 at s3 consequently the differences between e0 and e6 were greater than the differences between e6 and p6 indicating that bacterial communities on en ps were changed and tended to be more localized combining all the results mentioned above we found that the bacterial communities as well as the main bacteria were obviously influenced by the local cultivation environment in the same environment most bacteria on the surface of en ps changed significantly and became more similar to those on exp ps therefore the taxonomic analysis further verified that the composition of bacterial communities would tend to show the local characteristics of the sampling sites regardless of whether the surface of plastic debris had been colonized by bacterial communities at the beginning of cultivation 3 4 ecological effects of environmental plastic debris according to the analysis of the previous sections although the original location of the randomly collected en ps was unclear the redeployment of plastic debris resulted in the localization of bacterial communities on en ps however it cannot be denied that some bacteria carried by the en ps from the original locations might continue growing in the cultivation environment the survival of bacteria on plastic debris in the new environment especially some representative bacteria was a key criterion to evaluate whether plastic debris can lead to ecological risks e g species invasion by analyzing the pathogenic bacteria and functional prediction of bacterial communities on randomly collected en ps the ecological effects of bacterial communities on en ps were discussed 3 4 1 pathogenic bacteria to evaluate the ecological effects of bacterial communities on en ps the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria on plastic debris was compared among en ps and exp ps during 6 weeks of culture fig 5 and s10 table s6 the species and abundance of pathogenic bacteria on the different kinds of plastic debris might not be identical but plastic debris is generally considered to be a good carrier of pathogenic bacteria making pathogenic bacteria into hitchhikers didier et al 2017 keswani et al 2016 kirstein et al 2016 in this study pathogenic bacteria including vibrio pseudomonas pseudoalteromonas bacillus halomonas photobacterium and rhodococcus were detected on the surface of en ps when collected after 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance of some bacteria on the en ps changed significantly i e vibrio and pseudomonas at s1 halomonas at s2 pseudomonas halomonas and photobacterium at s3 in addition the relative abundance of most pathogenic bacteria on the en ps showed no significant difference from those on the exp ps at corresponding sites after being cultured for 6 weeks except for vibrio pseudoalteromonas and photobacterium at s2 the abnormal decrease in the relative abundance of vibrio and pseudoalteromonas at s2 might be due to environmental disturbance when the haihe tidal gate was opened table s2 the difference in the relative abundance of photobacterium between the bacterial communities on en ps and exp ps at s2 after 6 weeks of culture could be attributed to the large gap in the relative abundance at the initial stage or the insufficient culture time vibrio is a widely reported pathogen on plastic debris jiang et al 2018 kirstein et al 2016 several species of vibrio can cause diseases in spinal and invertebrate animals and some are also pathogenic to humans and cause diarrhea or extratesticular infections farmer iii et al 2015 in this study many vibrio colonized the en ps at the initial stage however after 6 weeks of culture the relative abundance of vibrio on the en ps at all the selected sites decreased furthermore it became more similar to that on the corresponding exp ps at s1 and s3 indicating that the bacterial communities including some pathogens were under reconstruction in the cultivation environment and showed some similar characteristics to the local bacterial communities on plasitcs consequently the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria on en ps at each site became comparable to or lower than that on exp ps at the same site after 6 weeks of culture notably we must acknowledge that the relative abundance of some pathogens on en ps and exp ps remained different after being cultured for 6 weeks fig 5 however the comparative or lower relative abundance of most pathogens on en ps after 6 weeks of culture verified the assumption that plastic debris would have a small role in spreading pathogens over large areas oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 3 4 2 functional prediction the typical functions of bacterial communities including biofilm formation potential pathogenicity mobile elements and stress tolerance on e0 e6 and p6 were predicted using the bugbase online platform fig 6 a biofilms are diverse communities composed of bacteria fungi algae and protozoa that can form within minutes to hours after microorganisms from the surrounding environment accumulate on plastic debris rummel et al 2017 as described in fig 6a a the biofilm formation index was the highest on p6 followed by e6 and the lowest on e0 the results showed that after being cultured under the same environmental conditions for 6 weeks the biofilm formation ability of en ps was weaker than that of the exp ps which had a smooth and sterilized surface at the beginning to predict the potential ecological impact of bacterial communities on plastic debris three indexes including potentially pathogenic mobile element and stress tolerant indexes were assessed using the bugbase online platform fig 6a b c d potentially pathogenic and mobile element indexes were the highest in the bacterial communities on p6 fig 6a b c while the stress tolerance index was the highest on e0 fig 6a d in addition all three indexes were the lowest in the bacterial communities on e6 after 6 weeks of culture the three indexes of en ps all decreased and became lower than the indexes of exp ps cultured under the same environmental conditions meanwhile the difference between each en ps decreased suggesting that the ecological impacts of bacterial communities on different en ps tended to be more uniform after 6 weeks of exposure therefore after being redeployed the potential ecological impact of bacterial communities on randomly collected en ps was reduced and became similar to the potential ecological impact of those on the local exp ps for functional classification kegg analysis was used to distinguish the difference between e0 and e6 as well as between e6 and p6 at each site fig 6b and s11 s16 according to kegg analysis 140 kinds of functional classifications between e0 and e6 were significantly different at s1 among which the top 3 were fatty acid elongation in mitochondria aminoacyl trna biosynthesis and amino acid related enzymes fig 6b a and s11 meanwhile 92 kinds of functional classifications were significantly different from e6 to p6 and the top 3 were photosynthesis antenna proteins drug metabolism cytochrome p450 and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450 fig s12 for the above 6 kinds of functional classifications all of them belonged to metabolism except for aminoacyl trna biosynthesis which belonged to genetic information processing for s2 there were 16 kinds of functional classifications between e0 and e6 that were significantly different and the adipocytokine signaling pathway glutamatergic synapse and ppar signaling pathway accounted for the top 3 which belonged to organismal systems fig 6b b and s13 moreover 27 kinds of functional classifications were different from e6 to p6 and the top 3 with the most significant differences were membrane and intracellular structural molecules caffeine metabolism and base excision repair membrane and intracellular structural molecules belonged to cell process and signaling caffeine metabolism belonged to metabolism and base excision repair belonged to genetic information processing which were different from each other fig s14 the amount of different functional classifications was smaller at s2 than at the other two sites which was consistent with the fingerprints of the main bacteria being more similar between e0 and e6 at s2 fig 4 for s3 epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection pentose and glucuronate interconversions and lipid metabolism were the top 3 among 105 kinds of different functional classifications between e0 and e6 pentose and glucuronate interconversions and lipid metabolism both belonged to metabolism fig 6b c and s15 notably the most significant one helicobacter pylori infection belonged to human diseases and was more actively on e0 than on e6 fig 6b c since some en ps at s3 were the debris of beverage bottles and food packing bags we speculated that these en ps were infected by helicobacter pylori before collection however after being cultured for 6 weeks the expression was reduced significantly which was in accordance with the results of pathogenic bacteria fig 5 and the potentially pathogenic index fig 6a b in addition there were 28 kinds of functional classifications between e6 and p6 that were significantly different and the top 3 were beta alanine metabolism lysine biosynthesis and butanoate metabolism all of which belonged to metabolism fig s16 most of the above functional classifications with significant differences belonged to metabolism which might be related to some metabolic pathways being overrepresented on plastics more than on natural substrates miao et al 2019 and reflected the adaptation of the bacterial communities to the environment breton deval et al 2020 the differences in functional classification between e0 and e6 were much greater than the differences between e6 and p6 at s1 and s3 and slightly smaller than the differences between e6 and p6 at s2 after 6 weeks of culture the functional prediction from en ps became more similar to the functional prediction from exp ps the results further indicated that the local cultivation environment had strong effects on the reconstruction of bacterial communities on the plastic debris whose original locations were unclear namely bacterial communities on the plastic debris would adapt their composition to the current environment thus the ecological risks such as species invasion which were brought by the transportation of plastic debris in the environment may not be as serious as it was expected previously 4 conclusions taking the estuary area of bohai bay tianjin china as an example this study discussed the bacterial communities on randomly collected environmental plastic debris after being cultured in the surrounding environment for 6 weeks we combined the field sampling experiment and the in situ experiment and designed a strategy to sample and redeploy the environmental plastic debris at the selected sites the variation of bacterial communities on plastic debris which was collected from the surrounding environment randomly was assessed at the same time the experimental plastic debris was used as the control group to monitor the growth of local bacterial communities on plastics in the cultivation environment based on the comparison of bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris and the experimental plastic debris during the 6 weeks of culture we found that 1 the composition of bacterial communities on the environmental plastic debris changed and showed local characteristics in the cultivation environment 2 some bacteria on the surface of environmental plastic debris showed significant differences from those at the collection time and the relative abundance of bacteria on environmental plastic debris became more similar to those on local plastics 3 the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria and typical metabolic function prediction indexes on the environmental plastic debris became comparable to or lower than the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria and metabolic functions on local plastics from the above three aspects including colonization characteristics taxonomic analysis and molecular metabolism estimation we found that the bacterial communities on randomly collected environmental plastic debris tended to show local characteristics which were less affected by their original characteristics moreover the results also reminded us that the ecological risks of bacterial communities on plastics such as species invasion which were brought by the transportation of plastic debris in the environment may not be as serious as it was expected previously credit authorship contribution statement xiaohan zhang investigation formal analysis formal analysis validation

17173,fluoride bearing apatite minerals such as fluorapatite fap ca10 po4 6f2 and related carbonate rich fluorapatites cfa ca10 po4 5 co3 f f2 which occur ubiquitously as trace components of rocks and sediments may act as sources for geogenic groundwater fluoride contamination cfa dissolution often occurs in conjunction with declining dissolved calcium concentrations therefore managed aquifer recharge mar operations using deionised or low calcium source water are at risk of disturbing the naturally persisting geochemical equilibrium between cfa and the ambient groundwater and induce fluoride mobilisation in this study we employ reactive transport modelling to investigate how an engineered manipulation of the mar source water composition might mitigate such groundwater fluoride contamination based on a previously developed and calibrated model for australia s largest groundwater replenishment operation we investigate the efficiency of i raising aqueous calcium concentration through the addition of cacl2 or ca oh 2 amendment ii raising aqueous sodium concentrations through the addition of nacl or sea salt amendment and iii raising the ph the modelling results illustrate in detail how the geochemical zonation around injection boreholes evolves over time and how this affects fluoride release and attenuation for the different amendment types treatments involving the addition of calcium and sodium in the source water are both found to be effective at reducing maximum groundwater fluoride concentrations during mar with calcium generally producing the greatest reduction in maximum fluoride concentrations in contrast increasing the injectate ph was found to be inefficient in reducing fluoride concentrations significantly due to the strong ph buffering effect of the aquifer sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoride managed aquifer recharge reactive transport modelling cfa water treatment 1 introduction increasing water demands and climate variability have caused aquifer depletion and seawater intrusion in australia and elsewhere csiro and bom 2015 fienen and arshad 2016 unesco 2016 managed aquifer recharge mar is an increasingly used tool to combat these problems burris 2018 casanova et al 2016 dillon et al 2018 ebrahim et al 2016 reichard and johnson 2005 mar involves the intentional infiltration or injection of various source water types into aquifers often for later recovery dillon 2005 dillon et al 2018 stefan and ansems 2018 with recent advances and cost reductions in water treatment technology reclaimed highly treated wastewater has become an attractive source water type to supplement existing resources in many water scarce areas burris 2018 casanova et al 2016 dillon et al 2018 ganot et al 2018 missimer et al 2014 reichard and johnson 2005 rodriguez et al 2009 stuyfzand et al 2017 compared to seawater desalinisation wastewater recycling requires several additional advanced treatment steps such as ultraviolet light uv and ozonation to remove the significantly higher pathogen and contaminant loading yuan et al 2019 nevertheless reclaimed wastewater is generally the economically more viable and environmentally more friendly option due to the often much lower salt load and energy consumption dillon et al 2018 missimer et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2009 zekri et al 2014 mar of reclaimed wastewater plays a central role for indirect water reuse schemes as it provides a much needed additional treatment buffer i e an aquifer where engineering risks and public perception issues preclude direct wastewater reuse dillon et al 2018 ganot et al 2018 gibson and burton 2014 ormerod 2015 rodriguez et al 2009 wester et al 2015 wester 2016 however the hydrochemical composition of the treated wastewater typically differs strongly from the native groundwater mar will therefore often trigger a pronounced geochemical disequilibrium within the target aquifer and induce various geochemical reactions between the injected water and the aquifer sediments previously reported water sediment reactions observed during mar include redox reactions mineral dissolution desorption of trace metals and metalloids cation exchange and mobilisation of colloids brown and misut 2010 descourvieres et al 2010 fakhreddine et al 2015 fakhreddine et al 2020 ganot et al 2018 jones and pichler 2007 mcnab et al 2009 rathi et al 2017 treumann et al 2014 vandenbohede et al 2013 wallis et al 2010 mar with treated wastewater may induce additional highly specific water sediment interactions as a result of the very low concentrations of divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 which are preferentially excluded during the reverse osmosis process compared to monovalent cations eisenberg and middlebrooks 1985 fakhreddine et al 2015 richards et al 2011 low concentrations of divalent cations in the recharged water have previously been shown to cause the release of adsorbed negatively charged contaminants during mar by decreasing the density of positive surface charge on phyllosilicate clay minerals fakhreddine et al 2015 alternatively they may trigger the enhanced dissolution of minerals such as calcite and dolomite of which divalent cations are a major component ganot et al 2018 vandenbohede et al 2013 those reactions may be exacerbated with low ionic strength injectant because divalent cations preferentially partition onto sediment exchanger sites relative to monovalent cations thus increasing the degree of disequilibrium appelo and postma 2005 vandenbohede et al 2013 the long term success of mar schemes requires a thorough understanding of concomitant water sediment interactions which may affect water quality or scheme operation while ample attention has been given to the removal of contaminants prior to injection jokela et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 as well as the potential for the aquifer to remove pathogens and dissolved organic pollutants betancourt et al 2014 händel and fichtner 2019 henzler et al 2014 kolehmainen et al 2007 kortelainen and karhu 2006 sidhu et al 2015 wiese et al 2011 less attention has been given to a systematic optimisation of water treatment options to proactively prevent water sediment interactions that release geogenic contaminants fakhreddine et al 2021 in cases where the geochemical mechanisms that control the release of geogenic contaminants are well understood mitigation strategies involving the targeted modification of the injectant composition through water treatment can be developed for example prommer et al 2018 demonstrated that pre treatment involving deoxygenation could prevent pyrite oxidation and associated arsenic release during reinjection of co produced water from coal seam gas production sun et al 2020 showed through reactive transport modelling how changes in the water treatment processes affect long term groundwater ph changes during groundwater replenishment with reclaimed wastewater also fakhreddine et al 2015 investigated experimentally at the laboratory scale a series of amendments of divalent cations to deionised reclaimed water and how this would reduce the release of arsenate from phyllosilicate clay minerals in shallow aquifer sediments with the present study we systematically investigate how the release of fluoride which can occur during the injection of low ionic strength water can be mitigated to identify possible water treatment options at the selected study site the fluoride bearing apatite mineral carbonate rich fluorapatite cfa ca10 po4 5 co3f f2 has been identified as a source of geogenic release of fluoride in response to replenishing the aquifer with highly purified wastewater schafer et al 2018 fluoride in aquifers used for drinking water abstraction needs to be closely monitored as both deficiency and excess of fluoride can lead to human and animal health problems brahman et al 2013 knappett et al 2020 the world health organisation drinking water quality guidelines considers that fluoride concentration 0 5 mg l 26 µm is beneficial for human health while concentrations exceeding the guideline value of 1 5 mg l 79 µm may lead to health problems such as dental and skeletal fluorosis who 2017 excessive fluoride may also lead to learning difficulties in children yu et al 2018 here we use a process based reactive transport modelling framework to provide deeper insights into the critical geochemical mechanisms that control the mobility of fluoride in a deep siliciclastic aquifer that is now targeted by a large scale groundwater replenishment operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located approximately 25 km north of the perth metropolitan area western australia fig 1 where the feasibility of recycling wastewater through a combination of advanced water treatment awt and mar was comprehensively investigated over the last 15 years the initial feasibility study phase included a detailed hydrogeological and geochemical characterisation campaign and most importantly a groundwater replenishment trial gwrt during which 3 9 gl of highly purified recycled wastewater sourced from the adjacent beenyup wastewater treatment plant was injected over a four year period from 2010 to 2014 into the deep siliciclastic leederville aquifer the interpretation of the site characterisation and the hydrochemical data collected during the gwrt higginson and martin 2012 was supported by a suite of geochemical descourvieres et al 2010a b solute heat seibert et al 2014 and reactive transport modelling studies seibert et al 2016 schafer et al 2020 based on the success of the gwrt it was decided to pursue a staged implementation of large scale groundwater replenishment gwr the first stage of the infrastructure construction was completed in 2017 and injection with a rate of 14gl year has since commenced donn et al 2017 sun et al 2020 injection currently occurs through three wells lrb1 lrb2 and lrb3 that are screened in the leederville aquifer max injection rate 10 13 ml day bore and an additional well yrb1 that is screened in the deeper yarragadee aquifer fig 1 similar to the gwrt the source water for the full scale gwr implementation is recycled wastewater highly purified by three sequential treatment steps i e ultra filtration reverse osmosis and uv disinfection higginson and martin 2012 moscovis 2013 the infrastructure for stage 2 is currently under construction which will shortly add another 14gl year to the overall capacity the additional capacity is provided by two wells screened in the leederville aquifer lrb4 and lrb5 and two additional wells yrb2 and yrb3 screened in the yarragadee aquifer fig 1 the scheme forms now australia s largest awt mar operation 2 2 target aquifer and injectant characteristics the target injection interval comprises the interbedded sand and shale lenses of the wanneroo member of the cretaceous leederville formation leyland 2011 timms et al 2015 which is confined above and below by clayey units the sediments of the leederville formation are a mature siliciclastic sequence that consists predominantly of quartz kaolinite and k feldspar with trace coal fragments pyrite siderite muscovite biotite chlorite glauconite and cfa descourvieres et al 2011 schafer et al 2018 the native groundwater ngw increases in salinity with depth over the injection interval from approximately 400 to 1100 mg l table 1 its hydrochemical composition varies from na cl type groundwater near the top towards a na cl hco3 type groundwater at the base of the injection interval in contrast the highly purified wastewater is characterised by a very low ionic strength tds 33 mg l with particularly low divalent cation concentrations 2 5 µm ca2 5 0 µm mg2 and a dissolved oxygen concentration of 500 µm table 1 2 3 gwr induced groundwater flow and solute transport processes the hydrogeological characterisation and the monitoring data collected during both the gwrt seibert et al 2014 and gwr stage 1 sun et al 2020 suggest that at the local scale the injectant radially migrates away from the injection wells in strictly horizontal direction and preferentially in the sandy sections of the target aquifer while flow and solute transport in the silty and clayey sections is negligible the natural regional groundwater flow at the field site hydraulic gradient 0 0006 along with the potential impacts of seawater the deeper aquifer systems exhibit relatively fresh water extending far offshore are assumed negligible and therefore groundwater flow was controlled primarily by the mar reinjection scheme over time injectant transport is predicted to successively divert from the initially radial symmetric pattern and to be increasingly influenced by the regional groundwater flow patterns and hydrogeological features such as faults and groundwater extraction wells that impact groundwater flow rates and directions fig 1 the predictive model simulations performed by sun et al 2020 show that the injectant plume fronts migrate up to 4 km away from the respective injection locations in both the leederville and the yarragadee aquifer after 30 years of injection fig 1 the model simulations also illustrate the clear hydraulic separation of the two gwr target aquifers that is imposed by the south perth shale 2 4 major gwr induced geochemical changes and reactions gwr results in significant groundwater quality changes in the leederville aquifer the majority of the observed changes can be attributed to the successive displacement of the native water by the injectant however the displacement of the native water causes a geochemical dis equilibrium and therefore triggers a whole range of geochemical reactions underpinned by results from laboratory scale incubation and column experiments descourvieres et al 2010a b as well as detailed field observations higginson and martin 2012 the model based analysis of the gwrt demonstrated that pyrite oxidation was the primary geochemical reaction that was triggered by the injection pyrite oxidation is primarily triggered by the dissolved oxygen that is contained in the injectant prommer and stuyfzand 2005 seibert et al 2016 1 fe s 2 3 75 o 2 3 5 h 2 o fe oh 3 2 so 4 2 4 h and to some extent also by residual concentrations of nitrate that is also contained in the injectant 2 fe s 2 3 no 3 2 h 2 o fe oh 3 2 so 4 2 1 5 n 2 h with pyrite oxidation being accompanied by the release of acidity and the inherent buffering capacity of the injectant being low proton exchange on sediment exchanger sites and the dissolution of trace minerals including aluminosilicates and siderite showed to be the main reactions to prevent a ph decline in the target aquifer and potentially associated with it an increase in metal loid mobility seibert et al 2016 sun et al 2020 2 5 fluoride mobilisation during the gwrt and gwr stage 1 elevated fluoride up to 58 μm and phosphate concentrations up to 55 μm were observed at or near the injection plume front laboratory based experimental work schafer et al 2018 and the model based interpretation of the gwrt schafer et al 2020 identified that the source of both the fluoride and phosphate was the dissolution of cfa the fluoride and phosphate breakthrough behaviour that was observed during the gwrt is considered to be a result of the incongruent dissolution of cfa where i a rapid proton exchange reaction primarily released fluoride and calcium and ii a simultaneous equilibrium with a mineral water interface layer of hydrated dibasic calcium phosphate referred to as dcpsurface cahpo4 nh2o released phosphate atlas and pytkowicz 1977 chaïrat et al 2007a chaïrat et al 2007b christoffersen et al 1996 gómez morales et al 2013 guidry and mackenzie 2003 tribble et al 1995 based on the analysed cfa composition the two step reaction could be represented by schafer et al 2018 schafer et al 2020 3 ca 9 75 na 0 25 po 4

dissolution and thus fluoride and phosphate release was found to occur because the divalent calcium contained in the injectant preferentially partitions onto cation exchanger sites with the low aqueous calcium concentrations shifting the cfa equilibria that persisted with the ngw prior to gwr schafer et al 2020 3 model based assessment of awt process modifications 3 1 overview together with the induced spatially and temporally varying ph changes and other moving reaction fronts the controls on fluoride mobility are complex and highly nonlinear suggesting that any systematic exploration of the feasibility of successful and appropriately dosed awt process modifications is best achieved through a process based numerical modelling approach we therefore use predictive reactive transport modelling as a tool to assess and compare the efficiency of a suite of potential awt process modifications the simulations rely on our previously developed and comprehensively calibrated and evaluated reactive transport modelling framework sun et al 2020 which includes a process based simulation of the fluoride release and attenuation mechanisms the modelling framework relies on the conceptual hydrogeochemical model that fluoride mobilisation occurred as a result of cfa dissolution at locations where the arrival of the gwr induced injectant plume changed the persisting geochemical equilibrium between the ngw and the aquifer sediments the model based interpretation of fluoride mobility during the gwrt illustrated the complex interactions that occur as a result of i the low ionic strength of the injectant and ii the critical role that cation exchange can play on decreasing aqueous calcium concentrations and therefore inducing cfa dissolution schafer et al 2020 in the following we only provide a brief summary of the employed numerical model framework while the full details of the large scale flow solute and reactive transport simulations are provided in sun et al 2020 additional details of the conceptual numerical model aspects concerning fluoride mobility can be found in schafer et al 2018 and schafer et al 2020 in this study our model based assessment is focused on the leederville aquifer however our results will also be largely transferrable to the deeper yarragadee aquifer and more broadly to many other sites of similar geochemical characteristics that are subjected to awt mar 3 2 numerical model framework 3 2 1 groundwater flow and solute transport the site specific groundwater flow and solute transport behaviour at this awt mar study site has been intensively characterised at the local gwrt scale supported by a wide range of geophysical logging and other techniques higginson and martin 2012 at the gwrt scale the constructed numerical flow and solute transport models were set up at a high vertical resolution to capture the strong vertical heterogeneity of the leederville aquifer seibert et al 2014 each of the considered model layers was assumed to be hydrogeologically and geochemically homogeneous in the lateral direction over the gwrt scale this assumption was deemed to be reasonable supported by the solute transport modelling results that showed a good agreement with gwrt observations however for the simulations assessing the long term and larger scale solute and reactive transport behaviour the assumption that the layering assumed in the local scale models would be continuous fails to hold to overcome this limitation sun et al 2020 recently developed a pragmatic upscaling approach that allowed to perform computationally efficient large scale predictions of the gwr induced flow solute and reactive transport behaviour the upscaling process involved lumping the heterogenous solute transport behaviour into a vertically integrated surrogate model the key transport characteristics which are affected by a high fraction of silty clayey aquifer sections were successfully captured by invoking a dual domain mass transfer model ddmt feehley et al 2000 schweizer et al 2018 underwood et al 2018 which conceptually separates the model domain into a mobile and an immobile fraction with the former fraction capturing the preferential transport in the leederville aquifer s sandy layers and the latter fraction representing the silty clayey layers that make a negligible contribution to the aquifer s transmissivity and to the mass fluxes away from the injection wells the large scale groundwater flow behaviour is captured by downscaling the simulation results of the perth regional aquifer modelling system prams cymod systems 2009 2014 davidson and yu 2008 siade et al 2020 siade et al 2017 to the subdomain that was selected for the assessment of the large scale gwr impacts further details of the model construction and the up and down scaling procedures are provided in sun et al 2020 fig 1 illustrates the location of the model subdomain simulated groundwater head contours for the considered 28gl year gwr scheme and the simulated evolution of the injectant transport over a 30 year period 3 2 2 reaction transport model framework based on the insights gained from the gwrt scale flow and conservative transport simulations long term large scale reactive transport simulations were performed by sun et al 2020 to assess the two potentially most critical groundwater quality changes that could result from gwr these two critical issues were i to develop a quantitative estimate of the longevity of the previously identified ph buffering mechanism thus minimising the risk of metal mobilisation and ii to understand the long term large scale mobility of fluoride specifically on whether there could be any accumulative snow plough effects starr and parlange 1979 at the injection plume front that could lead to successively increasing fluoride concentrations at increasing distance from the injection wells to simulate the key reactions impacting the fate of fluoride incongruent cfa dissolution reaction 3 was incorporated as an equilibrium exchange reaction and the dcpsurface reaction 4 was considered as an equilibrium mineral reaction the associated equilibrium constants and some other important reaction parameters are provided in table 2 further details of the developed reaction network its implementation into the reaction database and its evaluation against a wide range of field data are discussed in seibert et al 2016 schafer et al 2018 and sun et al 2020 the model simulation results obtained by sun et al 2020 suggested that the maximum fluoride concentrations would not rise above the levels that were already observed at the local scale during the gwr for the present assessment of potential awt process modifications that could minimise fluoride mobilization these model simulations were used as the base case against which the efficiency of any injectant modification was benchmarked 3 3 investigated injectant modifications a total of five different options for modifying the injectant composition were tested to evaluate whether they were effective in minimising the release of fluoride during long term large scale gwr into the leederville formation table 3 the selected scenarios either involve i a direct increase of calcium concentrations through the amendment of calcium bearing chemicals during awt ii an indirect increase of aqueous calcium concentrations by promoting cation exchange or iii injectant treatment that is aimed at causing a ph increase within the targeted aquifer zones as a way to suppress fluoride release eq 3 each of the five amendment variants is described in more detail below and the corresponding hypothetical injectant water compositions for the different model variants are listed in table 3 the investigated amendments were tested for different amendment doses from those that caused only minor reduction in fluoride to those that almost completely prevented fluoride concentrations to rise above background levels 3 3 1 calcium chloride the effectiveness of amending the injectant with calcium chloride cacl2 was explored by model variants v1 1 v1 5 cacl2 was selected because it has the benefit of directly adding calcium ions to the injectant and therefore to potentially suppress cfa dissolution the potential for cacl2 to be effective is underpinned by earlier experimental work by borgnino et al 2013 that showed that the addition of calcium successfully inhibited fluorapatite dissolution at circumneutral ph five different calcium amendment doses i e 1 10 4 m 5 10 4 m 5 10 3 m 3 10 3 m and 5 10 3 m cacl2 were tested in model variants v1 1 1 5 respectively 3 3 2 calcium hydroxide the model variants v2 1 and v2 2 involved the amendment of calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 it has the potential benefit of directly adding calcium ions while also elevating the injectant ph both of which would be expected to suppress cfa dissolution ca oh 2 is currently being applied as an amendment for the mar of low ionic strength water in orange county california where it is mainly applied to limit the potential corrosion of concrete pipes fakhreddine et al 2015 two different calcium hydroxide amendment doses i e 1 10 4 m and 3 10 4 m were tested in model variants v2 1 and v2 2 respectively note that the amount of ca oh 2 that can be added is limited by the potential for calcite precipitation fakhreddine et al 2015 which is estimated to occur at a concentration of 3 10 4 m ca oh 2 under atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure 3 3 3 sodium chloride the model variants v3 1 v3 5 involved the addition of nacl addition of sodium was expected to displace calcium ions from sediment exchanger sites causing an increase in aqueous calcium concentrations and thus suppress cfa dissolution five doses i e 1 10 4 m 5 10 4 m 5 10 3 m 3 10 3 m and 5 10 3 m nacl were trialled in model variants v3 1 v3 5 3 3 4 synthetic sea salt the amendment of synthetic sea salt was explored as it has the benefit of i the direct addition of calcium ions into the injectant and ii adding sodium which can displace calcium from sediment exchanger sites or prevent the partitioning of aqueous

of the major ions chloride sodium bicarbonate magnesium sulphate potassium calcium and fluoride that occurs in standard seawater doe 1997 was applied to the current base injectant composition table 3 note that seawater has been found to be in equilibrium with the surface of cfa atlas and pytkowicz 1977 atlas 1975 3 3 5 deoxygenation the final model variant v5 involved the hypothetical complete deoxygenation of the injectant this model variant was included to test whether the reduction of the electron acceptor capacity with the injectant nitrate would still be present could minimise the release of acidity sufficiently to have indirect benefits on reducing the level of fluoride mobilisation 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulated long term geochemical response to gwr and associated fluoride behaviour the large scale reactive transport simulation for the base case v0 illustrates the anticipated long term behaviour of fluoride in the leederville aquifer for a 28 gl year gwr scheme fig 2 shows 2d contour plots of groundwater fluoride concentrations after 5 10 and 30 years as well as the corresponding concentrations of calcium and the groundwater ph while fig 3 shows simulated breakthrough curves at selected locations at increasing radial distances from injection well lrb1 as can be seen in fig 2 the injection plumes initially grow radially but the shapes of the injection plumes are successively changing as the influence of the background groundwater flow increases and the influence of the gwr induced flow decreases with increasing distance from the various injection well locations the simulations show the development of four distinct geochemical zones along the radial direction which evolve as the injectant plumes grow these four zones z1 z4 numbered from the injection front towards the injection well right to left are marked in the concentration length profiles in fig 4 by different shadings the zonation identified in this study is largely consistent with the zonation that was found to evolve during the gwrt which was discussed in more detail by schafer et al 2020 understanding the key mechanisms that underly the formation of these zones is critical for deciphering the variations in the response to the tested modifications in the hydrochemical composition of the injectant therefore salient features of the evolution of geochemical zones for the base case are discussed below the first zone z1 marks the mixing zone at the injectant plume front in this zone chloride concentrations drop sharply from the elevated ngw concentrations towards the much lower chloride concentrations of the injectant fig 4a c despite its chemically inert behaviour at larger radial distances the simulated chloride concentrations do not decline completely to the level of the injectant concentrations this is explained by the chloride enrichment that occurs through the simulated kinetically controlled physical ddmt process which is driven by the chloride concentration gradient between the mobile domain and immobile domains the ddmt process represents the more gradual displacement of ngw from the leederville aquifer s low permeability zones immobile domain compared to that of the sandy permeable layers mobile domain by the low ionic strength injectant due to the kinetic control of the ddmt process and the groundwater flow velocities that decrease with increasing distance from injection wells the impact of the ddmt gradually becomes more pronounced at larger radial distances which results in increased tapering of chloride at the injection front fig 4a c within z1 calcium concentrations also abruptly decrease with distance from lrb1 which disturb the cfa equilibrium condition thereby inducing a rise in groundwater fluoride concentrations the fluoride concentrations within z1 increase from their ngw concentrations levels towards their maximum concentrations at the z1 z2 interface fig 4d f within z1 the ph rises to 7 3 during the early years of gwr as a result of proton exchange with ca fig 4j l and thus above the ph within both the injectant and the ngw the adjacent zone z2 is characterized by the peaking fluoride concentrations at the interface with z1 which then decrease within z2 towards z3 fig 4d f in this zone the much lower ionic strength of the injectant results in a higher proportion of calcium on exchanger sites compared to that occurring in z1 and in the native aquifer fig 4y aa as the calcium concentration in the injectant is below detection tables 2 and 3 calcium in this zone is derived from ddmt and more importantly from the dissolution of cfa which decreases towards the injection front insets fig 4v x calcium on the cation exchanger sites x therefore increases within this zone towards the injection well insets fig 4m o exchanging for both sodium insets in fig 4p r and protons insets in fig 4s u at later times when the injectant plume has become much larger the proportion of calcium derived via mass transfer from low permeability layers dominates over the calcium derived from cfa dissolution fig 4g i ddmt also affects all other groundwater constituents in that it causes a successive mixing of the injectant with ngw at the injection front causing the concentrations of all species to more gradually increase towards ngw concentrations zone z3 is characterized by significant calcium removal from the groundwater due to greater cation exchange fig 4g i m o accordingly the fraction of calcium occupying the cation exchanger sites cax2 is increased in this zone fig 4m o y aa while sodium fig 4p r and proton concentrations fig 4s u on the exchanger site nax and hx are lower in this zone ph is also elevated compared to the ph of the injectant table 3 as well as the ngw fig 4j l the ratio of hydrogen activity to calcium activity is lower in this zone compared to the adjacent z2 red shading fig 4ab ad and fluoride concentrations are relatively low and significantly below ngw concentrations the geochemical zone z4 resides in the vicinity of the injection well and is the only zone where pyrite oxidation occurs as all oxidants are exhausted at larger travel distances this zone is characterized by a lower ph relative to the ph of the injectant fig 4j l and high calcium concentrations considering the deionized injectant started with negligible calcium tables 2 and 3 note calcium concentrations are plotted on a logarithmic scale in this zone protons generated from pyrite oxidation displace calcium fig 4m o and sodium fig 4p r from the cation exchanger and dissolve cfa eq 3 fig 4v x consequently fluoride concentrations are low in this zone fig 4d f and are similar to the concentrations in the deionized injectant of 4 µm table 3 4 2 performance and mechanisms controlling amendment efficacy for fluoride attenuation 4 2 1 performance of different amendments the reactive transport model was used to assess whether cfa dissolution could be suppressed through the modification of the injectant composition all the simulated scenarios for injectant modifications except for the deoxygenation scenario v5 were found to reduce maximum fluoride concentrations compared to the base case v0 as shown by selected breakthrough curves for radially increasing distances from the injection location lrb1 fig 3 the efficacy of the different amendments in reducing maximum fluoride concentrations for varying dosages is summarized in fig 5 it can be seen that for the lowest dose 1 10 4 m all amendment types had negligible impact on reducing maximum fluoride concentrations relative to the base case v0 however the maximum fluoride concentrations decreased consistently for all amendment types with increasing dosage the release of fluoride can be almost entirely suppressed once dosages reach and exceed concentrations of 1 10 3 m cacl2 nacl or sea salt amendment of the injectant with cacl2 v1 1 1 5 produced the greatest reduction of maximum fluoride concentrations at all dosages except for 1 10 3 m where nacl v3 3 and sea salt v4 3 perform slightly better fig 5 unsurprisingly the performance of sea salt v4 1 4 5 and nacl v3 1 3 5 are similar with sea salt consistently producing slightly lower maximum fluoride concentrations for the investigated range of dosages the amendment of ca oh 2 v2 1 2 2 performs similarly to nacl and sea salt however as discussed above the application of ca oh 2 is limited by the solubility of calcite precluding the application of sufficiently high dosages with the maximum applicable dosage of ca oh 2 3 10 4 m v2 2 only a relatively modest reduction in the maximum fluoride concentration is achieved fig 5 4 2 2 geochemical mechanisms controlling amendment efficacy for fluoride attenuation the aqueous calcium concentration was a major control for regulating cfa solubility to illustrate the role of calcium two of the investigated variants both of similar dosing i e 1 10 3 m cacl2 v1 3 and 1 10 3 m nacl v3 3 are compared with the base case v0 in fig 4 both variants v1 3 and v3 3 develop a similar geochemical zonation pattern to v0 however throughout the different geochemical zones both v1 3 and v3 3 maintain consistently higher groundwater calcium concentrations than v0 fig 4g i either due to direct addition v1 3 or due to sodium displacing calcium from sediment exchanger sites in either case the higher calcium concentration decreases cfa solubility and consequently suppresses fluoride release eq 3 despite calcium playing a central role in controlling fluoride release the direct addition of cacl2 does not necessarily yield the best long term results for all dosages considered variant v3 3 with nacl performed marginally better than v1 3 with cacl2 after 30 years this is due to a greater reduction in ph in v1 3 which induces some additional cfa dissolution and consequently fluoride release the lower ph is the result of higher calcium concentrations in v1 3 displacing more hydrogen from sediment exchanger sites the effect of reduced ph in z3 for v1 3 is not significant at higher dosages e g v1 4 and 1 5 fig 6 j l from the result of v1 4 it can be seen that due to the much higher calcium concentrations in the injectant the proportion of calcium on exchanger cax2 sites decreases significantly to well below that occurring under ngw conditions fig 6j l as the proportion of calcium attenuated on exchanger sites decreases higher calcium concentrations were able to propagate closer to the injection front where they more effectively suppress cfa dissolution fig 6d f m o as mentioned before the performance of the sea salt amendments v4 1 4 5 were similar to the nacl amendments v3 1 3 5 fig 5 this similarity results from the sodium concentrations for each of the corresponding variants being similar thus causing an equivalent extent of competitive exchange with calcium on sediment exchange sites however the sea salt amendments v4 1 4 5 consistently produced slightly lower maximum fluoride compared to nacl v3 1 3 5 amendments demonstrating that the relatively small amount of additional calcium in the sea salt amendments table 3 has an appreciable effect the ph is also a strong control that regulates the release and attenuation of fluoride nevertheless the variants designed to increase that ph either by addition of ca oh 2 v2 1 v2 2 or minimising pyrite oxidation via deoxygenation v5 were found to be less efficient at reducing fluoride concentrations fig 7 despite the injectant ph for v2 1 and v2 2 being elevated to 7 71 and 8 04 respectively the substantial ph buffering effect of the sediment s cation exchanger site x prevented any significant rise of the ph fig 7d e as calcium displaced protons on the exchanger sites these model variants v2 1 v2 2 produced similar calcium concentration profiles and consequently the release of fluoride was similar to the base case the small reduction in fluoride by the 3 10 4 m ca oh 2 v2 2 amendment figs 6 and 7b is primarily due to the increased calcium concentration rather than changes to groundwater ph 4 2 3 additional operational considerations significant reductions of fluoride released from cfa due to the injection of low ionic strength water amended with cacl2 nacl or sea salt can be achieved at moderate dosages of 1 10 3 m while the greatest reductions of fluoride generally occurred for the cacl2 amendments v1 1 1 5 the declining performance of the 1 10 3 m cacl2 v1 3 dosage with time may preclude cacl2 being considered the best option at moderate dosages fig 5 as a small amount of fluoride is considered beneficial for health sazakli et al 2007 who 2017 complete suppression of fluoride release during mar is not desired consequently dosage of injectant with nacl or sea salt at 1 10 3 m would achieve the best cost effective approach for a 30 40 reduction of maximum fluoride fig 5 while costs of implementing the sea salt and nacl amendments are expected to be similar the amendment of sea salt has the additional advantage of adding magnesium which is considered a health benefit birnhack et al 2011 as well as sulphate which increases corrosion protection from metal pipes tang et al 2006a tang et al 2006b 5 conclusions reactive transport modelling was used to assess different pre treatment amendments for highly purified recycled wastewater with respect to their effectiveness at reducing fluoride mobility during large scale groundwater replenishment the model results indicate that amendments that increase dissolved calcium concentrations either by direct addition of calcium bearing chemicals or by manipulating sediment exchange reactions are effective at reducing cfa dissolution and therefore fluoride release on the other hand pre treatment strategies attempting to increase the ph of the injectate was shown not to be an effective approach due to the strong ph buffering effects of the native cation exchanger sites cfa and fap are by far the most common phosphate minerals and are components of most rocks and sediments filippelli 2002 föllmi 1996 hughes 2015 hughes and rakovan 2015 kholodov 2014 ruttenberg 2003 consequently mar projects which use ro treated low ionic strength source water or source water that is low in calcium relative to the receiving aquifer should consider the risk of fluoride mobilisation from cfa or fap and consider mitigating this risk by manipulating the awt process with specific amendments as the present study illustrates the selection of an effective amendment and an appropriate amendment dose requires an advanced understanding of the geochemical conditions and prevailing mechanisms process based reactive transport modelling showed to be a powerful interpretive tool to study the various options and to develop the mechanistic insights that are required in cases where several intertwined processes affect the aqueous concentrations of a groundwater constituent declaration of competing interest the

17173,fluoride bearing apatite minerals such as fluorapatite fap ca10 po4 6f2 and related carbonate rich fluorapatites cfa ca10 po4 5 co3 f f2 which occur ubiquitously as trace components of rocks and sediments may act as sources for geogenic groundwater fluoride contamination cfa dissolution often occurs in conjunction with declining dissolved calcium concentrations therefore managed aquifer recharge mar operations using deionised or low calcium source water are at risk of disturbing the naturally persisting geochemical equilibrium between cfa and the ambient groundwater and induce fluoride mobilisation in this study we employ reactive transport modelling to investigate how an engineered manipulation of the mar source water composition might mitigate such groundwater fluoride contamination based on a previously developed and calibrated model for australia s largest groundwater replenishment operation we investigate the efficiency of i raising aqueous calcium concentration through the addition of cacl2 or ca oh 2 amendment ii raising aqueous sodium concentrations through the addition of nacl or sea salt amendment and iii raising the ph the modelling results illustrate in detail how the geochemical zonation around injection boreholes evolves over time and how this affects fluoride release and attenuation for the different amendment types treatments involving the addition of calcium and sodium in the source water are both found to be effective at reducing maximum groundwater fluoride concentrations during mar with calcium generally producing the greatest reduction in maximum fluoride concentrations in contrast increasing the injectate ph was found to be inefficient in reducing fluoride concentrations significantly due to the strong ph buffering effect

and climate variability have caused aquifer depletion and seawater intrusion in australia and elsewhere csiro and bom 2015 fienen and arshad 2016 unesco 2016 managed aquifer recharge mar is an increasingly used tool to combat these problems burris 2018 casanova et al 2016 dillon et al 2018 ebrahim et al 2016 reichard and johnson 2005 mar involves the intentional infiltration or injection of various source water types into aquifers often for later recovery dillon 2005 dillon et al 2018 stefan and ansems 2018 with recent advances and cost reductions in water treatment technology reclaimed highly treated wastewater has become an attractive source water type to supplement existing resources in many water scarce areas burris 2018 casanova et al 2016 dillon et al 2018 ganot et al 2018 missimer et al 2014 reichard and johnson 2005 rodriguez et al 2009 stuyfzand et al 2017 compared to seawater desalinisation wastewater recycling requires several additional advanced treatment steps such as ultraviolet light uv and ozonation to remove the significantly higher pathogen and contaminant loading yuan et al 2019 nevertheless reclaimed wastewater is generally the economically more viable and environmentally more friendly option due to the often much lower salt load and energy consumption dillon et al 2018 missimer et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2009 zekri et al 2014 mar of reclaimed wastewater plays a central role for indirect water reuse schemes as it provides a much needed additional treatment buffer i e an aquifer where engineering risks and public perception issues preclude direct wastewater reuse dillon et al 2018 ganot et al 2018 gibson and burton 2014 ormerod 2015 rodriguez et al 2009 wester et al 2015 wester 2016 however the hydrochemical composition of the treated wastewater typically differs strongly from the native groundwater mar will therefore often trigger a pronounced geochemical disequilibrium within the target aquifer and induce various geochemical reactions between the injected water and the aquifer sediments previously reported water sediment reactions observed during mar include redox reactions mineral dissolution desorption of trace metals and metalloids cation exchange and mobilisation of colloids brown and misut 2010 descourvieres et al 2010 fakhreddine et al 2015 fakhreddine et al 2020 ganot et al 2018 jones and pichler 2007 mcnab et al 2009 rathi et al 2017 treumann et al 2014 vandenbohede et al 2013 wallis et al 2010 mar with treated wastewater may induce additional highly specific water sediment interactions as a result of the very low concentrations of divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 which are preferentially excluded during the reverse osmosis process compared to monovalent cations eisenberg and middlebrooks 1985 fakhreddine et al 2015 richards et al 2011 low concentrations of divalent cations in the recharged water have previously been shown to cause the release of adsorbed negatively charged contaminants during mar by decreasing the density of positive surface charge on phyllosilicate clay minerals fakhreddine et al 2015 alternatively they may trigger the enhanced dissolution of minerals such as calcite and dolomite of which divalent cations are a major component ganot et al 2018 vandenbohede et al 2013 those reactions may be exacerbated with low ionic strength injectant because divalent cations preferentially partition onto sediment exchanger sites relative to monovalent cations thus increasing the degree of disequilibrium appelo and postma 2005 vandenbohede et al 2013 the long term success of mar schemes requires a thorough understanding of concomitant water sediment interactions which may affect water quality or scheme operation while ample attention has been given to the removal of contaminants prior to injection jokela et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 as well as the potential for the aquifer to remove pathogens and dissolved organic pollutants betancourt et al 2014 händel and fichtner 2019 henzler et al 2014 kolehmainen et al 2007 kortelainen and karhu 2006 sidhu et al 2015 wiese et al 2011 less attention has been given to a systematic optimisation of water treatment options to proactively prevent water sediment interactions that release geogenic contaminants fakhreddine et al 2021 in cases where the geochemical mechanisms that control the release of geogenic contaminants are well understood mitigation strategies involving the targeted modification of the injectant composition through water treatment can be developed for example prommer et al 2018 demonstrated that pre treatment involving deoxygenation could prevent pyrite oxidation and associated arsenic release during reinjection of co produced water from coal seam gas production sun et al 2020 showed through reactive transport modelling how changes in the water treatment processes affect long term groundwater ph changes during groundwater replenishment with reclaimed wastewater also fakhreddine et al 2015 investigated experimentally at the laboratory scale a series of amendments of divalent cations to deionised reclaimed water and how this would reduce the release of arsenate from phyllosilicate clay minerals in shallow aquifer sediments with the present study we systematically investigate how the release of fluoride which can occur during the injection of low ionic strength water can be mitigated to identify possible water treatment options at the selected study site the fluoride bearing apatite mineral carbonate rich fluorapatite cfa ca10 po4 5 co3f f2 has been identified as a source of geogenic release of fluoride in response to replenishing the aquifer with highly purified wastewater schafer et al 2018 fluoride in aquifers used for drinking water abstraction needs to be closely monitored as both deficiency and excess of fluoride can lead to human and animal health problems brahman et al 2013 knappett et al 2020 the world health organisation drinking water quality guidelines considers that fluoride concentration 0 5 mg l 26 µm is beneficial for human health while concentrations exceeding the guideline value of 1 5 mg l 79 µm may lead to health problems such as dental and skeletal fluorosis who 2017 excessive fluoride may also lead to learning difficulties in children yu et al 2018 here we use a process based reactive transport modelling framework to provide deeper insights into the critical geochemical mechanisms that control the mobility of fluoride in a deep siliciclastic aquifer that is now targeted by a large scale groundwater replenishment operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located approximately 25 km north of the perth metropolitan area western australia fig 1 where the feasibility of recycling wastewater through a combination of advanced water treatment awt and mar was comprehensively investigated over the last 15 years the initial feasibility study phase included a detailed hydrogeological and geochemical characterisation campaign and most importantly a groundwater replenishment trial gwrt during which 3 9 gl of highly purified recycled wastewater sourced from the adjacent beenyup wastewater treatment plant was injected over a four year period from 2010 to 2014 into the deep siliciclastic leederville aquifer the interpretation of the site characterisation and the hydrochemical data collected during the gwrt higginson and martin 2012 was supported by a suite of geochemical descourvieres et al 2010a b solute heat seibert et al 2014 and reactive transport modelling studies seibert et al 2016 schafer et al 2020 based on the success of the gwrt it was decided to pursue a staged implementation of large scale groundwater replenishment gwr the first stage of the infrastructure construction was completed in 2017 and injection with a rate of 14gl year has since commenced donn et al 2017 sun et al 2020 injection currently occurs through three wells lrb1 lrb2 and lrb3 that are screened in the leederville aquifer max injection rate 10 13 ml day bore and an additional well yrb1 that is screened in the deeper yarragadee aquifer fig 1 similar to the gwrt the source water for the full scale gwr implementation is recycled wastewater highly purified by three sequential treatment steps i e ultra filtration reverse osmosis and uv disinfection higginson and martin 2012 moscovis 2013 the infrastructure for stage 2 is currently under construction which will shortly add another 14gl year to the overall capacity the additional capacity is provided by two wells screened in the leederville aquifer lrb4 and lrb5 and two additional wells yrb2 and yrb3 screened in the yarragadee aquifer fig 1 the scheme forms now australia s largest awt mar operation 2 2 target aquifer and injectant characteristics the target injection interval comprises the interbedded sand and shale lenses of the wanneroo member of the cretaceous leederville formation leyland 2011 timms et al 2015 which is confined above and below by clayey units the sediments of the leederville formation are a mature siliciclastic sequence that consists predominantly of quartz kaolinite and k feldspar with trace coal fragments pyrite siderite muscovite biotite chlorite glauconite and cfa descourvieres et al 2011 schafer et al 2018 the native groundwater ngw increases in salinity with depth over the injection interval from approximately 400 to 1100 mg l table 1 its hydrochemical composition varies from na cl type groundwater near the top towards a na cl hco3 type groundwater at the base of the injection interval in contrast the highly purified wastewater is characterised by a very low ionic strength tds 33 mg l with particularly low divalent cation concentrations 2 5 µm ca2 5 0 µm mg2 and a dissolved oxygen concentration of 500 µm table 1 2 3 gwr induced groundwater flow and solute transport processes the hydrogeological characterisation and the monitoring data collected during both the gwrt seibert et al 2014 and gwr stage 1 sun et al 2020 suggest that at the local scale the injectant radially migrates away from the injection wells in strictly horizontal direction and preferentially in the sandy sections of the target aquifer while flow and solute transport in the silty and clayey sections is negligible the natural regional groundwater flow at the field site hydraulic gradient 0 0006 along with the potential impacts of seawater the deeper aquifer systems exhibit relatively fresh water extending far offshore are assumed negligible and therefore groundwater flow was controlled primarily by the mar reinjection scheme over time injectant transport is predicted to successively divert from the initially radial symmetric pattern and to be increasingly influenced by the regional groundwater flow patterns and hydrogeological features such as faults and groundwater extraction wells that impact groundwater flow rates and directions fig 1 the predictive model simulations performed by sun et al 2020 show that the injectant plume fronts migrate up to 4 km away from the respective injection locations in both the leederville and the yarragadee aquifer after 30 years of injection fig 1 the model simulations also illustrate the clear hydraulic separation of the two gwr target aquifers that is imposed by the south perth shale 2 4 major gwr induced geochemical changes and reactions gwr results in significant groundwater quality changes in the leederville aquifer the majority of the observed changes can be attributed to the successive displacement of the native water by the injectant however the displacement of the native water causes a geochemical dis equilibrium and therefore triggers a whole range of geochemical reactions underpinned by results from laboratory scale incubation and column experiments descourvieres et al 2010a b as well as detailed field observations higginson and martin 2012 the model based analysis of the gwrt demonstrated that pyrite oxidation was the primary geochemical reaction that was triggered by the injection pyrite oxidation is primarily triggered by the dissolved oxygen that is contained in the injectant prommer and stuyfzand 2005 seibert et al 2016 1 fe s 2 3 75 o 2 3 5 h 2 o fe oh 3 2 so 4 2 4 h and to some extent also by residual concentrations of nitrate that is also contained in the injectant 2 fe s 2 3 no 3 2 h 2 o fe oh 3 2 so 4 2 1 5 n 2 h with pyrite oxidation being accompanied by the release of acidity and the inherent buffering capacity of the injectant being low proton exchange on sediment exchanger sites and the dissolution of trace minerals including aluminosilicates and siderite showed to be the main reactions to prevent a ph decline in the target aquifer and potentially associated with it an increase in metal loid mobility seibert et al 2016 sun et al 2020 2 5 fluoride mobilisation during the gwrt and gwr stage 1 elevated fluoride up to 58 μm and phosphate concentrations up to 55 μm were observed at or near the injection plume front laboratory based experimental work schafer et al 2018 and the model based interpretation of the gwrt schafer et al 2020 identified that the source of both the fluoride and phosphate was the dissolution of cfa the fluoride and phosphate breakthrough behaviour that was observed during the gwrt is considered to be a result of the incongruent dissolution of cfa where i a rapid proton exchange reaction primarily released fluoride and calcium and ii a simultaneous equilibrium with a mineral water interface layer of hydrated dibasic calcium phosphate referred to as dcpsurface cahpo4 nh2o released phosphate atlas and pytkowicz 1977 chaïrat et al 2007a chaïrat et al 2007b christoffersen et al 1996 gómez morales et al 2013 guidry and mackenzie 2003 tribble et al 1995 based on the analysed cfa composition the two step reaction could be represented by schafer et al 2018 schafer et al 2020 3 ca 9 75 na 0 25 po 4

dissolution and thus fluoride and phosphate release was found to occur because the divalent calcium contained in the injectant preferentially partitions onto cation exchanger sites with the low aqueous calcium concentrations shifting the cfa equilibria that persisted with the ngw prior to gwr schafer et al 2020 3 model based assessment of awt process modifications 3 1 overview together with the induced spatially and temporally varying ph changes and other moving reaction fronts the controls on fluoride mobility are complex and highly nonlinear suggesting that any systematic exploration of the feasibility of successful and appropriately dosed awt process modifications is best achieved through a process based numerical modelling approach we therefore use predictive reactive transport modelling as a tool to assess and compare the efficiency of a suite of potential awt process modifications the simulations rely on our previously developed and comprehensively calibrated and evaluated reactive transport modelling framework sun et al 2020 which includes a process based simulation of the fluoride release and attenuation mechanisms the modelling framework relies on the conceptual hydrogeochemical model that fluoride mobilisation occurred as a result of cfa dissolution at locations where the arrival of the gwr induced injectant plume changed the persisting geochemical equilibrium between the ngw and the aquifer sediments the model based interpretation of fluoride mobility during the gwrt illustrated the complex interactions that occur as a result of i the low ionic strength of the injectant and ii the critical role that cation exchange can play on decreasing aqueous calcium concentrations and therefore inducing cfa dissolution schafer et al 2020 in the following we only provide a brief summary of the employed numerical model framework while the full details of the large scale flow solute and reactive transport simulations are provided in sun et al 2020 additional details of the conceptual numerical model aspects concerning fluoride mobility can be found in schafer et al 2018 and schafer et al 2020 in this study our model based assessment is focused on the leederville aquifer however our results will also be largely transferrable to the deeper yarragadee aquifer and more broadly to many other sites of similar geochemical characteristics that are subjected to awt mar 3 2 numerical model framework 3 2 1 groundwater flow and solute transport the site specific groundwater flow and solute transport behaviour at this awt mar study site has been intensively characterised at the local gwrt scale supported by a wide range of geophysical logging and other techniques higginson and martin 2012 at the gwrt scale the constructed numerical flow and solute transport models were set up at a high vertical resolution to capture the strong vertical heterogeneity of the leederville aquifer seibert et al 2014 each of the considered model layers was assumed to be hydrogeologically and geochemically homogeneous in the lateral direction over the gwrt scale this assumption was deemed to be reasonable supported by the solute transport modelling results that showed a good agreement with gwrt observations however for the simulations assessing the long term and larger scale solute and reactive transport behaviour the assumption that the layering assumed in the local scale models would be continuous fails to hold to overcome this limitation sun et al 2020 recently developed a pragmatic upscaling approach that allowed to perform computationally efficient large scale predictions of the gwr induced flow solute and reactive transport behaviour the upscaling process involved lumping the heterogenous solute transport behaviour into a vertically integrated surrogate model the key transport characteristics which are affected by a high fraction of silty clayey aquifer sections were successfully captured by invoking a dual domain mass transfer model ddmt feehley et al 2000 schweizer et al 2018 underwood et al 2018 which conceptually separates the model domain into a mobile and an immobile fraction with the former fraction capturing the preferential transport in the leederville aquifer s sandy layers and the latter fraction representing the silty clayey layers that make a negligible contribution to the aquifer s transmissivity and to the mass fluxes away from the injection wells the large scale groundwater flow behaviour is captured by downscaling the simulation results of the perth regional aquifer modelling system prams cymod systems 2009 2014 davidson and yu 2008 siade et al 2020 siade et al 2017 to the subdomain that was selected for the assessment of the large scale gwr impacts further details of the model construction and the up and down scaling procedures are provided in sun et al 2020 fig 1 illustrates the location of the model subdomain simulated groundwater head contours for the considered 28gl year gwr scheme and the simulated evolution of the injectant transport over a 30 year period 3 2 2 reaction transport model framework based on the insights gained from the gwrt scale flow and conservative transport simulations long term large scale reactive transport simulations were performed by sun et al 2020 to assess the two potentially most critical groundwater quality changes that could result from gwr these two critical issues were i to develop a quantitative estimate of the longevity of the previously identified ph buffering mechanism thus minimising the risk of metal mobilisation and ii to understand the long term large scale mobility of fluoride specifically on whether there could be any accumulative snow plough effects starr and parlange 1979 at the injection plume front that could lead to successively increasing fluoride concentrations at increasing distance from the injection wells to simulate the key reactions impacting the fate of fluoride incongruent cfa dissolution reaction 3 was incorporated as an equilibrium exchange reaction and the dcpsurface reaction 4 was considered as an equilibrium mineral reaction the associated equilibrium constants and some other important reaction parameters are provided in table 2 further details of the developed reaction network its implementation into the reaction database and its evaluation against a wide range of field data are discussed in seibert et al 2016 schafer et al 2018 and sun et al 2020 the model simulation results obtained by sun et al 2020 suggested that the maximum fluoride concentrations would not rise above the levels that were already observed at the local scale during the gwr for the present assessment of potential awt process modifications that could minimise fluoride mobilization these model simulations were used as the base case against which the efficiency of any injectant modification was benchmarked 3 3 investigated injectant modifications a total of five different options for modifying the injectant composition were tested to evaluate whether they were effective in minimising the release of fluoride during long term large scale gwr into the leederville formation table 3 the selected scenarios either involve i a direct increase of calcium concentrations through the amendment of calcium bearing chemicals during awt ii an indirect increase of aqueous calcium concentrations by promoting cation exchange or iii injectant treatment that is aimed at causing a ph increase within the targeted aquifer zones as a way to suppress fluoride release eq 3 each of the five amendment variants is described in more detail below and the corresponding hypothetical injectant water compositions for the different model variants are listed in table 3 the investigated amendments were tested for different amendment doses from those that caused only minor reduction in fluoride to those that almost completely prevented fluoride concentrations to rise above background levels 3 3 1 calcium chloride the effectiveness of amending the injectant with calcium chloride cacl2 was explored by model variants v1 1 v1 5 cacl2 was selected because it has the benefit of directly adding calcium ions to the injectant and therefore to potentially suppress cfa dissolution the potential for cacl2 to be effective is underpinned by earlier experimental work by borgnino et al 2013 that showed that the addition of calcium successfully inhibited fluorapatite dissolution at circumneutral ph five different calcium amendment doses i e 1 10 4 m 5 10 4 m 5 10 3 m 3 10 3 m and 5 10 3 m cacl2 were tested in model variants v1 1 1 5 respectively 3 3 2 calcium hydroxide the model variants v2 1 and v2 2 involved the amendment of calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 it has the potential benefit of directly adding calcium ions while also elevating the injectant ph both of which would be expected to suppress cfa dissolution ca oh 2 is currently being applied as an amendment for the mar of low ionic strength water in orange county california where it is mainly applied to limit the potential corrosion of concrete pipes fakhreddine et al 2015 two different calcium hydroxide amendment doses i e 1 10 4 m and 3 10 4 m were tested in model variants v2 1 and v2 2 respectively note that the amount of ca oh 2 that can be added is limited by the potential for calcite precipitation fakhreddine et al 2015 which is estimated to occur at a concentration of 3 10 4 m ca oh 2 under atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure 3 3 3 sodium chloride the model variants v3 1 v3 5 involved the addition of nacl addition of sodium was expected to displace calcium ions from sediment exchanger sites causing an increase in aqueous calcium concentrations and thus suppress cfa dissolution five doses i e 1 10 4 m 5 10 4 m 5 10 3 m 3 10 3 m and 5 10 3 m nacl were trialled in model variants v3 1 v3 5 3 3 4 synthetic sea salt the amendment of synthetic sea salt was explored as it has the benefit of i the direct addition of calcium ions into the injectant and ii adding sodium which can displace calcium from sediment exchanger sites or prevent the partitioning of aqueous calcium onto the exchanger sites the tested synthetic sea salt concentrations were 1 10 4 m 5 10 4 m 5 10 3 m 3 10 3 m and 5 10 3 m chloride for v4 1 v4 5 respectively where the stoichiometric ratio of the major ions chloride sodium bicarbonate magnesium sulphate potassium calcium and fluoride that occurs in standard seawater doe 1997 was applied to the current base injectant composition table 3 note that seawater has been found to be in equilibrium with the surface of cfa atlas and pytkowicz 1977 atlas 1975 3 3 5 deoxygenation the final model variant v5 involved the hypothetical complete deoxygenation of the injectant this model variant was included to test whether the reduction of the electron acceptor capacity with the injectant nitrate would still be present could minimise the release of acidity sufficiently to have indirect benefits on reducing the level of fluoride mobilisation 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulated long term geochemical response to gwr and associated fluoride behaviour the large scale reactive transport simulation for the base case v0 illustrates the anticipated long term behaviour of fluoride in the leederville aquifer for a 28 gl year gwr scheme fig 2 shows 2d contour plots of groundwater fluoride concentrations after 5 10 and 30 years as well as the corresponding concentrations of calcium and the groundwater ph while fig 3 shows simulated breakthrough curves at selected locations at increasing radial distances from injection well lrb1 as can be seen in fig 2 the injection plumes initially grow radially but the shapes of the injection plumes are successively changing as the influence of the background groundwater flow increases and the influence of the gwr induced flow decreases with increasing distance from the various injection well locations the simulations show the development of four distinct geochemical zones along the radial direction which evolve as the injectant plumes grow these four zones z1 z4 numbered from the injection front towards the injection well right to left are marked in the concentration length profiles in fig 4 by different shadings the zonation identified in this study is largely consistent with the zonation that was found to evolve during the gwrt which was discussed in more detail by schafer et al 2020 understanding the key mechanisms that underly the formation of these zones is critical for deciphering the variations in the response to the tested modifications in the hydrochemical composition of the injectant therefore salient features of the evolution of geochemical zones for the base case are discussed below the first zone z1 marks the mixing zone at the injectant plume front in this zone chloride concentrations drop sharply from the elevated ngw concentrations towards the much lower chloride concentrations of the injectant fig 4a c despite its chemically inert behaviour at larger radial distances the simulated chloride concentrations do not decline completely to the level of the injectant concentrations this is explained by the chloride enrichment that occurs through the simulated kinetically controlled physical ddmt process which is driven by the chloride concentration gradient between the mobile domain and immobile domains the ddmt process represents the more gradual displacement of ngw from the leederville aquifer s low permeability zones immobile domain compared to that of the sandy permeable layers mobile domain by the low ionic strength injectant due to the kinetic control of the ddmt process and the groundwater flow velocities that decrease with increasing distance from injection wells the impact of the ddmt gradually becomes more pronounced at larger radial distances which results in increased tapering of chloride at the injection front fig 4a c within z1 calcium concentrations also abruptly decrease with distance from lrb1 which disturb the cfa equilibrium condition thereby inducing a rise in groundwater fluoride concentrations the fluoride concentrations within z1 increase from their ngw concentrations levels towards their maximum concentrations at the z1 z2 interface fig 4d f within z1 the ph rises to 7 3 during the early years of gwr as a result of proton exchange with ca fig 4j l and thus above the ph within both the injectant and the ngw the adjacent zone z2 is characterized by the peaking fluoride concentrations at the interface with z1 which then decrease within z2 towards z3 fig 4d f in this zone the much lower ionic strength of the injectant results in a higher proportion of calcium on exchanger sites compared to that occurring in z1 and in the native aquifer fig 4y aa as the calcium concentration in the injectant is below detection tables 2 and 3 calcium in this zone is derived from ddmt and more importantly from the dissolution of cfa which decreases towards the injection front insets fig 4v x calcium on the cation exchanger sites x therefore increases within this zone towards the injection well insets fig 4m o exchanging for both sodium insets in fig 4p r and protons insets in fig 4s u at later times when the injectant plume has become much larger the proportion of calcium derived via mass transfer from low permeability layers dominates over the calcium derived from cfa dissolution fig 4g i ddmt also affects all other groundwater constituents in that it causes a successive mixing of the injectant with ngw at the injection front causing the concentrations of all species to more gradually increase towards ngw concentrations zone z3 is characterized by significant calcium removal from the groundwater due to greater cation exchange fig 4g i m o accordingly the fraction of calcium occupying the cation exchanger sites cax2 is increased in this zone fig 4m o y aa while sodium fig 4p r and proton concentrations fig 4s u on the exchanger site nax and hx are lower in this zone ph is also elevated compared to the ph of the injectant table 3 as well as the ngw fig 4j l the ratio of hydrogen activity to calcium activity is lower in this zone compared to the adjacent z2 red shading fig 4ab ad and fluoride concentrations are relatively low and significantly below ngw concentrations the geochemical zone z4 resides in the vicinity of the injection well and is the only zone where pyrite oxidation occurs as all oxidants are exhausted at larger travel distances this zone is characterized by a lower ph relative to the ph of the injectant fig 4j l and high calcium concentrations considering the deionized injectant started with negligible calcium tables 2 and 3 note calcium concentrations are plotted on a logarithmic scale in this zone protons generated from pyrite oxidation displace calcium fig 4m o and sodium fig 4p r from the cation exchanger and dissolve cfa eq 3 fig 4v x consequently fluoride concentrations are low in this zone fig 4d f and are similar to the concentrations in the deionized injectant of 4 µm table 3 4 2 performance and mechanisms controlling amendment efficacy for fluoride attenuation 4 2 1 performance of different amendments the reactive transport model was used to assess whether cfa dissolution could be suppressed through the modification of the injectant composition all the simulated scenarios for injectant modifications except for the deoxygenation scenario v5 were found to reduce maximum fluoride concentrations compared to the base case v0 as shown by selected breakthrough curves for radially increasing distances from the injection location lrb1 fig 3 the efficacy of the different amendments in reducing maximum fluoride concentrations for varying dosages is summarized in fig 5 it can be seen that for the lowest dose 1 10 4 m all amendment types had negligible impact on reducing maximum fluoride concentrations relative to the base case v0 however the maximum fluoride concentrations decreased consistently for all amendment types with increasing dosage the release of fluoride can be almost entirely suppressed once dosages reach and exceed concentrations of 1 10 3 m cacl2 nacl or sea salt amendment of the injectant with cacl2 v1 1 1 5 produced the greatest reduction of maximum fluoride concentrations at all dosages except for 1 10 3 m where nacl v3 3 and sea salt v4 3 perform slightly better fig 5 unsurprisingly the performance of sea salt v4 1 4 5 and nacl v3 1 3 5 are similar with sea salt consistently producing slightly lower maximum fluoride concentrations for the investigated range of dosages the amendment of ca oh 2 v2 1 2 2 performs similarly to nacl and sea salt however as discussed above the application of ca oh 2 is limited by the solubility of calcite precluding the application of sufficiently high dosages with the maximum applicable dosage of ca oh 2 3 10 4 m v2 2 only a relatively modest reduction in the maximum fluoride concentration is achieved fig 5 4 2 2 geochemical mechanisms controlling amendment efficacy for fluoride attenuation the aqueous calcium concentration was a major control for regulating cfa solubility to illustrate the role of calcium two of the investigated variants both of similar dosing i e 1 10 3 m cacl2 v1 3 and 1 10 3 m nacl v3 3 are compared with the base case v0 in fig 4 both variants v1 3 and v3 3 develop a similar geochemical zonation pattern to v0 however throughout the different geochemical zones both v1 3 and v3 3 maintain consistently higher groundwater calcium concentrations than v0 fig 4g i either due to direct addition v1 3 or due to sodium displacing calcium from sediment exchanger sites in either case the higher calcium concentration decreases cfa solubility and consequently suppresses fluoride release eq 3 despite calcium playing a central role in controlling fluoride release the direct addition of cacl2 does not necessarily yield the best long term results for all dosages considered variant v3 3 with nacl performed marginally better than v1 3 with cacl2 after 30 years this is due to a greater reduction in ph in v1 3 which induces some additional cfa dissolution and consequently fluoride release the lower ph is the result of higher calcium concentrations in v1 3 displacing more hydrogen from sediment exchanger sites the effect of reduced ph in z3 for v1 3 is not significant at higher dosages e g v1 4 and 1 5 fig 6 j l from the result of v1 4 it can be seen that due to the much higher calcium concentrations in the injectant the proportion of calcium on exchanger cax2 sites decreases significantly to well below that occurring under ngw conditions fig 6j l as the proportion of calcium attenuated on exchanger sites decreases higher calcium concentrations were able to propagate closer to the injection front where they more effectively suppress cfa dissolution fig 6d f m o as mentioned before the performance of the sea salt amendments v4 1 4 5 were similar to the nacl amendments v3 1 3 5 fig 5 this similarity results from the sodium concentrations for each of the corresponding variants being similar thus causing an equivalent extent of competitive exchange with calcium on sediment exchange sites however the sea salt amendments v4 1 4 5 consistently produced slightly lower maximum fluoride compared to nacl v3 1 3 5 amendments demonstrating that the relatively small amount of additional calcium in the sea salt amendments table 3 has an appreciable effect the ph is also a strong control that regulates the release and attenuation of fluoride nevertheless the variants designed to increase that ph either by addition of ca oh 2 v2 1 v2 2 or minimising pyrite oxidation via deoxygenation v5 were found to be less efficient at reducing fluoride concentrations fig 7 despite the injectant ph for v2 1 and v2 2 being elevated to 7 71 and 8 04 respectively the substantial ph buffering effect of the sediment s cation exchanger site x prevented any significant rise of the ph fig 7d e as calcium displaced protons on the exchanger sites these model variants v2 1 v2 2 produced similar calcium concentration profiles and consequently the release of fluoride was similar to the base case the small reduction in fluoride by the 3 10 4 m ca oh 2 v2 2 amendment figs 6 and 7b is primarily due to the increased calcium concentration rather than changes to groundwater ph 4 2 3 additional operational considerations significant reductions of fluoride released from cfa due to the injection of low ionic strength water amended with cacl2 nacl or sea salt can be achieved at moderate dosages of 1 10 3 m while the greatest reductions of fluoride generally occurred for the cacl2 amendments v1 1 1 5 the declining performance of the 1 10 3 m cacl2 v1 3 dosage with time may preclude cacl2 being considered the best option at moderate dosages fig 5 as a small amount of fluoride is considered beneficial for health sazakli et al 2007 who 2017 complete suppression of fluoride release during mar is not desired consequently dosage of injectant with nacl or sea salt at 1 10 3 m would achieve the best cost effective approach for a 30 40 reduction of maximum fluoride fig 5 while costs of implementing the sea salt and nacl amendments are expected to be similar the amendment of sea salt has the additional advantage of adding magnesium which is considered a health benefit birnhack et al 2011 as well as sulphate which increases corrosion protection from metal pipes tang et al 2006a tang et al 2006b 5 conclusions reactive transport modelling was used to assess different pre treatment amendments for highly purified recycled wastewater with respect to their effectiveness at reducing fluoride mobility during large scale groundwater replenishment the model results indicate that amendments that increase dissolved calcium concentrations either by direct addition of calcium bearing chemicals or by manipulating sediment exchange reactions are effective at reducing cfa dissolution and therefore fluoride release on the other hand pre treatment strategies attempting to increase the ph of the injectate was shown not to be an effective approach due to the strong ph buffering effects of the native cation exchanger sites cfa and fap are by far the most common phosphate minerals and are components of most rocks and sediments filippelli 2002 föllmi 1996 hughes 2015 hughes and rakovan 2015 kholodov 2014 ruttenberg 2003 consequently mar projects which use ro treated low ionic strength source water or source water that is low in calcium relative to the receiving aquifer should consider the risk of fluoride mobilisation from cfa or fap and consider mitigating this risk by manipulating the awt process with specific amendments as the present study illustrates the selection of an effective amendment and an appropriate amendment dose requires an advanced understanding of the geochemical conditions and prevailing mechanisms process based reactive transport modelling showed to be a powerful interpretive tool to study the various options and to develop the mechanistic insights that are required in cases where several intertwined processes affect the aqueous concentrations of a groundwater constituent declaration of competing interest the

17174,a highly active and selective electrode is essential in electrochemical denitrification although the emerging cu based electrode has attracted intensive attentions in electrochemical no3 reduction the issues such as restricted activity and selectivity are still unresolved in our work a binder free composite electrode cu3p cf was first prepared by direct growth of copper phosphide on copper foam and then applied to electrochemical no3 reduction the resulting cu3p cf electrode showed enhanced electrochemical performance for no3 reduction 84 3 with high n2 selectivity 98 01 under the initial conditions of 1500 mg l 1 cl and 50 mg n l 1 no3 the cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectra eis demonstrated that electrochemical no3 reduction was achieved through electron transfer between no3 and cu0 originated from cf the in situ grown cu3p served as the bifunctional catalyst the electron mediator or bridge to facilitate the electron transfer for no3 reduction and the stable catalyst to produce atomic h toward no2 conversion meanwhile the cu3p cf remained its electrocatalytic activity even after eight cyclic experiments finally a 2 stage treatment

abstract image graphical abstract keywords binder free electrode copper foam copper phosphide electrochemical denitrification reaction mechanism 1 introduction for the wide applications of agricultural fertilizer and urban surface rainwater runoff as well as discharge of industrial wastewater the contamination of nitrate no3 in water has been a threat to ecological balance and human health gruber and galloway 2008 pennino et al 2017 particularly its incomplete conversion by product nitrite no2 is thought to be cancerogenic because it can induce liver damage and methaemoglobinaemia addiscott and benjamin 2004 ward et al 2018 therefore the united states environmental protection agency us epa and world health organization who all declare that the maximum

denitrification can achieve the selective conversion of no3 to ammonium nh4 or nitrogen gas n2 and has been regarded as a promising method for no3 removal from water due to its high efficiency no chemicals input and moderate operating conditions shih et al 2020a yao et al 2019a besides this method is very appropriate to treat the real wastewater containing no3 duan et al 2019 su et al 2017 generally there are a great quantity of coexisting soluble inorganic ions in real wastewater for example chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and nh4 which can decrease the external addition of electrolyte during electrochemical denitrification gu et al 2020 the electrochemical no3 reduction is really related to the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of electrode materials so researches have made effort to develop high performance electrode to date noble metal based materials represented by pd pdcu pdir pdsn etc are more active and durable however its low abundance and high cost are disadvantageous in the practical wastewater treatment guo et al 2018 shu et al 2019 su et al 2019a wang et al 2006 zhou et al 2017 hence exploring non precious metal electrode materials with high efficiency becomes the research hotspots in our previous study we investigated the indirect reduction of no3 by a zero valent titanium zvt anode yao et al 2019a however the consumption of zvt anode and the generation of solid by products tio2 4cl0 2n0 1 significantly restricted the practical application of such technology recently cu a common non noble metal has been applied as cathode for electrochemical no3 reduction duan et al 2019 kim and pak 2019 li et al 2020 su et al 2017 teng et al 2018 however the reduction products of no3 are no2 and nh4 using these electrodes for example shih et al 2020b found that the main by products with cu metal electrode were no2 47 1 and nh4 42 9 how to increase the n2 selectivity of cu based electrode it is well known that no2 can be effectively reduced to n2 or nh4 by atomic h gao et al 2020 seraj et al 2017 furthermore the atomic h also can reduce cu2o to cu facilitating the electrochemical denitrification chen et al 2019 copper phosphide cu3p is a common catalytic material for hydrogen evolution reaction her han et al 2017 reported that h was catalytically generated on cu3p based nickel foam electrode at a certain cathodic potential meanwhile it also can serve as an electron mediator or bridge to improve the electron transfer processes alexopoulou et al 2019 inspired by aforementioned aspects combination of cu and cu3p may be a better strategy to construct the electrode material with high activity and selectivity for electrochemical no3 reduction how to combine cu and cu3p as the composite electrode material through a facile and cost effective way is a key issue the simplest solution is using the polymer e g polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride as binder to immobilize powder catalysts onto the support surface liu et al 2020 su et al 2019b wang et al 2020 but the polymer unavoidably inhibits the electrocatalytic activity and also affects the stability and conductivity of composite electrodes to solve these problems researches have been committed to developing efficient binder free electrode chen et al 2020a yao et al 2019b yao et al 2020a after overall considerations a binder free integrated cu and cu3p composite electrode was prepared in our work cu foam cf with 3d network structure is employed for both cu sources and support owing to its low cost preferable electrical conductivity and rich adsorptive or reactive sites mao et al 2016 then cu3p was fabricated on cf via one step phosphidation process to form the binder free electrode cu3p cf to our best knowledge there is rare report on such electrode material for electrochemical denitrification moreover the detailed mechanisms of electrochemical denitrification over this constructed electrode are still unclear for example what role does the cu3p and cf play in electrochemical denitrification and what are essential reaction parameters that affect the no3 removal in this work a binder free copper phosphide self supported copper foam cu3p cf electrode was prepared via a facile phosphidation process and its electrocatalytic properties for electrochemical reduction of no3 were evaluated the effects of preparation temperature cathodic potential initial no3 concentration initial solution ph and initial cl concentration on electrochemical no3 reduction were investigated the mechanism of electrochemical no3

and experiments 2 1 preparation of cu3p cf cathode a piece of cf 4 cm 1 cm 0 1 cm was cleaned ultrasonically several times with 1 m hcl acetone ethanol and water respectively to remove the impurities on its surface copper phosphide was self supported on copper foam cu3p cf via one step in situ phosphidation method pfeiffer et al 2004 typically 0 25 g red p the cleaned cf and 0 25 g red p were placed at three rail boat in order with distance of 5 cm and calcined at 300 450 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere in the horizontal tube furnace otf 1200x hf kejing china the cu3p cf obtained at 300 350 400 and 450 c was labeled as cu3p cf 300 350 400 and 450 respectively the loading amount of cu3p on cf was calculated according to previous work yao et al 2019b and the details listed in text s2 2 2 electrochemical no3 reduction the electrochemical no3 reduction was carried out in a cylindrical three electrode electrochemical cell with an effective volume of 100 ml and the cathodic potential was controlled by an electrochemical workstation chi760e shanghai chenhua china the resulting cu3p cf ir ru ti and ag agcl were used as the working counter and reference electrode respectively the gap between the each electrode was set to 1 5 cm 80 ml of 50 mm na2so4 solution containing no3 was electrolyzed and stirred at 600 rpm the cathodic potential was maintained in the range of 0 8 1 4 v vs ag agcl 2 ml of solution was taken from the reaction cell every one hour and then filtered for analyzing the concentration of no3 no2 and nh4 for cyclic experiments the integrated electrode after reaction was thoroughly cleaned with water and dried at 60 c under vacuum for 8 h then the experiment was carried out under same conditions again to evaluate the feasibility of as prepared electrode in real wastewater treatment its electrochemical denitrification performance was investigated using the actual pharmaceutical wastewater ningbo zhejiang province of china the characteristics of wastewater were listed in table 2 before electrochemical no3 reduction the cod and organic nitrogen in wastewater were electrochemically oxidized by ir ru ti anode at 80 ma cm 2 of 8 h 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of no3 no2 cl and nh4 were determined by dionex ion exchange chromatography ics 900 dionex usa and the detailed procedures were listed in text s4 the contents of n2o and no in gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography gc 2010 plus gas shimadzu japan and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride spectrophotometric method 722g shengke shanghai china respectively

initial and final reaction time respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and structural properties of cu3p cf the cu3p cf composite electrode was synthesized by direct phosphorization of cf using red p as a phosphorus source in this process commercial cf not only served as the cu source to produce cu3p but also acted as a conductive support of cu3p obviously this artful in situ growth route resulted in an intimate contact between cu3p and cf which increased the charge transfer efficiency in electrochemical redox reactions yuan et al 2017 and further enhanced the electrochemical performances compared the sem images of cf fig 1 a and cu3p cf 400 fig 1b it could be found that the macro porous framework of cu foam still retained after high temperature phosphorization simultaneously cu3p with bamboo leaves morphology was uniformly integrated into the surface of cf inset of fig 1b which might result from the red p volatilization and the structural collapse and reconsolidation of cf at certain temperature pfeiffer et al 2004 the elemental analysis fig 1c clearly confirmed that p and cu elements were homogeneously distributed in this material the presence of o element in electrode materials should be attributed to the superficial oxidation of cu in air during the preparation and analysis process the growth of cu3p onto cf surface was further verified by x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 1d the intensity of three peaks at 43 26 50 22 and 74 03 for cu jcpds no 04 0836 vividly decreased after phosphorization at 400 c shih et al 2020b simultaneously three new diffraction peaks at 36 37 38 87 and 73 49 were observed which corresponded to 112 202 and 322 planes for cu3p respectively jcpds no 71 2261 kim et al 2019 indicating that cu3p successfully grew on the cf surface in addition two peaks at 42 28 and 61 36 suggested the presence of cu2o jcpds no 05 0667 which was in accordance with elemental mapping the surface elemental compositions and valence of cu3p cf 400 were analyzed by the xps in the xps spectrum of cu 2p fig 1e the peaks at 932 2 and 952 0 ev were attributed to cu in cu3p and cu2o those at 935 0 and 954 9 ev were assigned to cu2 states the two satellite peaks with binding energy observed at 943 7 and 962 6 ev were indexed to the oxidized cu species the oxidized cu species confirmed by xrd and xps might result from the superficial oxidation of cu during the preparation and analysis process there was a peak at 129 8 ev in the xps spectrum of p 2p which was attributed to the p bonded to cu fig 1f wei et al 2016 energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis further demonstrated the existence of copper phosphorus and oxygen elements on the resulting electrode surface and the molar ratio of cu p o is about 46 7 16 9 34 19 fig 1g 3 2 performance of cu3p cf on electrochemical no3 reduction the performances of an electrode material on electrochemical no3 reduction are closely related to its physicochemical and electrochemical characteristics in this work the phosphidation temperature was the key factor text s6 and s7 a series of electrode materials prepared at different phosphidation temperature 300 450 c were used as cathode for electrochemical denitrification fig 2 among them cu3p cf 400 exhibited the highest no3 removal efficiency 97 7 and rate constant 0 727 h 1 within 5 h electrolysis obviously different phosphidation temperature resulted in the difference of physicochemical and electrochemical characteristics of electrode materials for cu3p cf 300 a very small fraction of cu was converted to cu3p and the cu content was 9 92 mg g 1 fig s1 and table s1 correspondingly no3 removal efficiency and rate constant were only 78 5 and 0 294 h 1 respectively but still higher than those of bare copper foam 61 8 and 0 227 h 1 which indicated that the direct growth of cu3p on cf enhanced the electrochemical no3 reduction with the phosphidation temperature increasing to 450 c the cu on the cf surface was almost entirely transformed to cu3p and the cu loading mass reached up to 36 33 mg g 1 however the interfacial electron transfer efficiency and electrochemical active surface area ecsa of cu3p cf 450 declined compared to cu3p cf 300 350 and 400 text s6 and s7 chen et al 2020b as a consequence no3 removal efficiency and rate constant also decreased to 66 9 and 0 232 h 1 respectively in addition on the basis of cu 2p xps survey spectra fig 1e some cu2 oxidized species were formed during the electrode preparation process it is unknown whether cu2 oxidized species could serve as electrocatalytic active centers for no3 reduction however lower no3 removal efficiency 40 0 and rate constant 0 1 h 1 was induced by cuo cf fig 3 suggesting the governing role of cu3p and cu in copper foam for no3 reduction instead of cu2 oxidized species these results demonstrated that the suitable composition and crystallization and high ecsa and interfacial electron transfer efficiency were essential to ensure sufficient electrochemical active sites and super electron transfer rate for electrocatalytic no3 reduction by cu3p cf composite electrode the conversion of main products from electrochemical denitrification by cf and cu3p cf were analyzed comparatively fig 2b in cf electrode reactor two typical products no2 and nh4 were generated which were in accordance with the previous findings that most of the no3 was transferred to no2 and nh4 for cu cathode shih et al 2020b however nh4 was the main product in cu3p cf electrode reactor especially when the phosphidation temperature exceeded 400 c in detail no2 generation decreased from 28 2 to 0 8 as the calcination temperature increased from 300 to 450 c simultaneously nh4 production increased from 57 6 to 82 3 besides the rate constant of no2 reduction on cu3p cf 400 0 985 h 1 was 8 65 times higher than that on cf 0 114 h 1 fig s5 it could be speculated that cu3p directly grew on cu foam was in favor of no2 conversion in addition the gap mass balance of n element 19 1 for cu3p cf 400 might be attributed to the n2 release because the production of other gaseous products including no 0 215 mg l 1 and n2o 0 174 mg l 1 were negligible text s4 the binder free electrode materials have remarkable advantages compared to powdery materials since they can directly serve the electrocatalysts and effectively avoid interface electron transfer resistance and coverage of electrocatalytic active sites led by the polymer yuan et al 2017 the cu3p powder was prepared and then immobilized on the copper foam by a binder polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf labeled as cu3pb cf text s8 only ca 76 8 of no3 was reduced by this binder cathode fig 3b the eis analysis suggested that the arc radius of nyquist plots for cu3p cf 400 was lower than that of cu3pb cf indicating that cu3p cf 400 had higher electron transfer efficiency for electrochemical no3 reduction fig 3c chen et al 2020c meanwhile no2 generation of cu3p cf was only 0 6 whereas 7 8 of no2 generation was observed for cu3pb cf because the catalytic active sites for no2 conversion were covered by the polymer fig 3d on the basis of such findings the resulting integrated electrode cu3p cf 400 is an ideal cathode for electrochemical denitrification due to superior electrocatalytic activity and higher average current efficiency η 3 3 effect of operating parameters on electrochemical no3 reduction 3 4 effect of applied cathodic potential electrochemical redox reactions are greatly electrode potential dependent several overpotential 0 8 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 v vs ag agcl were applied to disclose the effect of cathodic potential on electrochemical denitrification the cv curves of cu3p cf 400 in fig 4 a indicated that the reduction peak rn around 1 05 v should be attributed to the electron transfer for no3 reduction because it did not arise in the absence of no3 shih et al 2020b however about 19 8 and 73 6 of no3 were reduced at 0 8 and 1 0 v fig 4b respectively which were positive than the reduction peak potential 1 05 v obtained from cv the feature form of cv is a result of the potential dependent variation of the surface concentrations in redox system and the simultaneous diffusion processes the redox potential is attained when the substances exposed on the electrode surface have been oxidized or reduced sugimoto et al 2005 so no3 could undergo electrochemical reduction even if the applied bias potential was positive than the reduction peak potential of rn similar results were also discovered in electrochemical trichloroacetic acid dechlorination by graphene cu foam electrode mao et al 2016 as the cathodic potential became more negative no3 removal efficiency increased and reached a maximum 97 7 at 1 2 v while it was slight decrease at 1 3 v 97 0 and 1 4 v 94 8 fig 4b similarly the rate constant k also rose from 0 04 to 0 727 h 1 when the applied bias potential decreased from 0 8 to 1 2 v but a slight decrease was observed at 1 3 0 701 h 1 and 1 4 v 0 584 h 1 table 1 actually the more negative bias potential was applied the more electrons and atomic h was generated which could promote no3 reduction via direct and indirect pathway nonetheless numerous hydrogen bubbles were observed at lower potential 1 3 and 1 4 v which might hinder the transportation of electrons and no3 to the electrode surface gao et al 2019 resulting in the inhibition of electrochemical no3 reduction as the power consumption indicator average current efficiency η was calculated according to our previous work yao et al 2019a and the details were shown in text s9 as listed in table 1 the η of cu3p cf 400 at 1 2 v was 26 24 while it was 20 53 and 16 34 at 1 3 and 1 4 v respectively these results suggested that more electrical energy was consumed for water electrolysis at lower bias potential 2h2o o2 anode 2h2 cathode hence the 1 2 v vs ag agcl was a favorable cathodic potential for electrochemical no3 reduction 3 5 effect of initial no3 concentration the concentration of no3 in diverse water system is different particularly for real wastewater to better understand the effect of initial no3 concentration on electrochemical denitrification experiments were operated at various initial no3 concentration ranging from 20 to 460 mg n l 1 results showed that higher initial no3 concentration led to the gradual decrease of no3 removal efficiency fig 5 a and rate constant k fig s6a however the absolute removed amount of no3 within 5 h electrolysis was 1 49 3 78 6 77 10 81 and 16 90 mg n for 20 50 100 200 and 460 mg n l 1 respectively fig s6b indicating that more no3 was reduced at higher initial concentration based on the cv curves the peak current of rn no3 reduction was enhanced as the initial no3 concentration increased fig 6 a and it was also linearly correlated with the square root of scan rate fig 6b suggesting that electrochemical no3 reduction by cu3p cf cathode was a diffusion controlled process shih et al 2020b besides the diffusion rate of contaminant to the cathode surface is related to its concentration in solution yao et al 2020b accordingly more no3 was adsorbed on the electrocatalytic active sites under higher no3 concentration leading to more no3 removal and higher average current efficiency fig s6b in addition the no2 generation was 37 6 within 5 h electrolysis when initial no3 concentration was 460 mg n l 1 fig 5b but only 1 58 mg n l 1 no2 was detected after 12 h simultaneously no3 removal and nh4 production efficiency increased to 82 7 and 75 2 respectively data not shown 3 6 effect of initial solution ph fig 5c showed the influence of initial reaction ph 3 11 on electrochemical no3 reduction by cu3p cf 400 cathode the no3 removal efficiency kept above 90 under all initial reaction ph reflecting that electrochemical denitrification led by this binder free cathode could be performed in a broad ph range nonetheless compared to ph 11 no3 reduction rate constant at ph 3 was strengthened by a 2 29 fold fig s7 as shown in fig s8 the voltammetric behavior of cu3p cf 400 in 50 mm na2so4 solution exhibited an oxidation peak around 0 1 v o1 and a reduction peak around 0 8 v r1 corresponding to the oxidation of cu0 to cu2o and cu oxide reduction respectively eqs 5 6 indicating the redox of cu0 cu occurred shih et al 2020b furthermore this reversible peak of r1 and o1 as a linear function of square root of the scan rate implied that this redox was limited by proton diffusion shih et al 2020b 5 2 c u 0 h 2 o c u 2 o 2 h 2 e 6 c u 2 o 2 h 2 e 2 c u 0 h 2 o the r1 and rn improved by increasing no3 concentration fig 6a which demonstrated that no3 was reduced through the redox reaction of cu0 no3 badea et al 2009 noticeably the no2 generation decreased from 10 2 to 0 26 when the initial reaction ph decreased from 11 to 3 because more atomic h was produced at lower ph zhang et al 2019 therefore lower initial solution ph was beneficial to the no3 and no2 reduction by cu3p cf electrode 3 7 effect of initial cl concentration and stability of cu3p cf electrode to achieve complete conversion of no3 into n2 electrochemical no3 reduction experiments were performed in the presence of cl a part of cl in solution might be converted into cl2 by ir ru ti anode which immediately reacts with h2o to form hypochlorite clo eqs 7 9 yao et al 2020c 7 2 c l 2 e c l 2 8 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o h c l 9 h c l o c l o h clo a typical strong oxidizing agent can oxidize various substances such as cr ⅲ nh4 and no2 yao et al 2020c anglada et al 2010a in this work the produced nh4 and no2 can be oxidized to n2 and no3 by clo respectively eqs 10 12 10 2 n h 4 3 c l o n 2 3 h 2 o 3 c l 2 h 11 n h 4 3 c l o n o 2 3 c l 2 h h 2 o 12 n o 2 c l o n o 3 c l as shown in fig 7 a no3 removal efficiency decreased from 97 7 to 78 6 with the initial cl concentration increasing from 0 to 2000 mg l 1 likely due to the secondary formation of no3 eqs 11 12 and the occupation of electrochemical active sites by cl duan et al 2019 in contrast the n2 selectivity increased from 18 9 to 98 6 fig 7b the η of electrochemical no3 reduction in the presence of 2000 mg l 1 cl 10 60 was lower than that in the absence of cl 26 24 trade off the no3 reduction n2 selectivity as well as η 1500 mg l 1 cl was the optimal dosage for complete no3 removal the stability of electrode is a very important indicator for electrochemical reaction in order to evaluate the reusability of cu3p cf electrochemical no3 reduction was repeated eight times under optimal conditions and the results illustrated in fig 7c no3 removal efficiency mildly decreased from 97 7 to 84 4 after the first cycle and then maintained almost constant 75 7 82 5 in the following cyclic experiments in addition chloride is a common halide ion that may cause the corrosion of metal especially at higher concentration wang et al 2009 fig 7d exhibited that no3 removal efficiency maintained above 62 in presence of cl 1500 mg l 1 after eight cycles the n2 selectivity kept about 98 and few no2 and nh4 were detected in each test phosphorus is an aqueous pollutant of great concerns we determined the concentration of tp and phosphate po4 before and after treatment using the as prepared electrode cu3p cf and the results illustrated in fig s15 the concentration of tp and po4 after the first reaction was 0 57 and 0 54 mg l 1 respectively however their concentrations decreased to 0 12 and 0 11 mg l 1 respectively after three cycles with the increased number of cycles they were below the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 the results indicated that the dissolution of phosphorus from electrode was not the great concern these findings fully suggested that the as prepared electrode had excellent stability and electrocatalytic activity in the long term performance 3 8 proposed reaction mechanism electrochemical denitrification is an intricate course accomplished by direct and indirect reduction of various intermediates with broad valence from 5 to 3 yao et al 2019a as mentioned above no3 could be reduced through the redox of cu0 no3 however considering that no3 might also be reduced via the h mediated indirect process eqs 13 16 gao et al 2020 bulk electrolysis with cu3p cf 400 as the cathode was performed out in presence of tba a specific scavenger of atomic h negligible effects on electrochemical denitrification were observed even tba concentration reached up to 10 mm fig s10 indicating atomic h was not the main reducing agent for no3 reduction similar phenomena were also observed in electrochemical denitrification by other noble or non precious metal electrode such as co3o4 ti and pd gao et al 2019 hamid et al 2016 in this study we speculated that no3 was primarily reduced through the redox reaction between cu0 and no3 instead of indirect reduction by atomic h noticeably no2 generation increased from 0 6 to 31 9 with the tba concentration increasing from 0 to 10 mm fig s10 besides electrochemical no2 reduction using cf electrode was not impacted by 10 mm tba while the impact was significant for cu3p cf 400 fig s11 therefore cu3p played an electrocatalyst for enhanced generation of atomic h which influenced the no2 conversion 13 c u 3 p h 2 o e c u 3 p h o h v o l m e r 14 h 2 o c u 3 p h e h 2 o

surface provided the electrons for no3 reduction but did the copper involved in the reactions come from cu3p or cf in order to answer this question the characteristics of cu3p cf 400 after reaction were analyzed by xrd and xps the phase of cu3p and its crystallization degree slightly decreased after first reaction fig s12 s13 and the cuox generated during the preparation process transformed to cu0 or cu shih et al 2020b however the content and crystallization of cu3p cf were not further changed in the following cycles which were also demonstrated by the sem results fig s14 besides no3 removal efficiency did not significantly decrease after first reaction and then maintained almost constant in the following cycles fig 7c these suggested that 1 the cuox species were not principally active sites for no3 reduction 2 the copper involved in the redox reaction of cu0 no3 was originated from cf and 3 cu3p not only served as an electron mediator or bridge to promote the electron transfer efficiency for no3 reduction but also participated as a stable electrocatalyst for generating atomic h toward no2 conversion the mechanism of electrochemical no3 reduction with cu3p cf electrode was proposed in fig 8 no3 first adsorbed on the surface of cu3p cf the cu3p played an electron transfer mediator for no3 reduction to no2 via redox reaction between cu0 and no3 eqs 17 19 similarly the generated no2 was sequentially reduced to n2 or nh4 eqs 20 21 it might also be reduced to no and n2o and further transformed into n2 eqs 22 24 in addition no2 could be reduced to n2 or nh4 through hydrogenation pathway eqs 25 27 due to the continuous generation of atomic h on the cu3p surface eq 13 based on the break point chlorination the nh4 generated from no3 conversion was oxidized into n2 by clo produced from the oxidation of cl on anode eq 10 inevitably a small amount of nh4 were oxidized to no2 and further converted to no3 resulting in the slight inhibition of

treatment of actual wastewater in general nitrogen pollutants in real wastewater include inorganic and organic nitrogen and some organic nitrogen might be oxidized to no3 anglada et al 2010a anglada et al 2011 thus electrocatalytic activity of resulting electrode was evaluated in terms of total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod removal from actual wastewater the characteristics of wastewater and the percentage of tn and cod removal were shown in table 2 and fig s14 only 48 4 of tn and 45 1 of cod were removed by cu3p cf 400 cathode after 5 h electrolysis at the cathodic potential 1 2 v vs ag agcl however they increased to 80 3 and 91 4 respectively when the real wastewater was pretreated by electrochemical oxidation by ir ru ti anode it was worth noting that no3 increased to 98 4 mg n l 1 and nh4 concentration decreased to 2 7 mg n l 1 after the pre oxidation obviously the nh4 and organic nitrogen in water was transferred into no3 anglada et al 2010b these findings suggested that the organics in the solution showed an adverse effect on tn and no3 removal owing to the occupation of adsorptive and electrocatalytic active sites yao et al 2019b the operational cost of this method coperation is determined by the electrical energy consumption cenergy and the details were shown in text s9 the electrical energy consumption for both cod and tn removal was about 18 45 kwh m3 the electrical energy cost in china is 0 1974 kwh so the coperation was 3 64 m3 the advantages and disadvantages of different electrodes for no3 removal were compared in table 3 pre oxidation by ir ru ti anode combined with post reduction by cu3p cf 400 displayed remarkable advantages in term of high activity and n2 selectivity simple preparation operation process and eco friendly for no3 removal from real wastewater 4 conclusions in this work we confirmed that cu3p cf composite obtained via a facile in situ phosphidation process was a promising binder free electrode material with high activity and selectivity for electrochemical denitrification the electrochemical properties of this resulting material were greatly related to its composition and crystallization which were controlled by the phosphidation temperature although efficient electrocatalytic no3 reduction by cu3p cf could be realized under different initial solution ph and no3 concentration lower initial ph and no3 concentration were in favor of no3 reduction the n2 selectivity increased with the initial cl concentration increasing as the initial no3 concentration was 50 mg n l 1 84 3 of no3 was removed with 98 01 n2 selectivity after 5 h electrolysis in the presence of 1500 mg l 1 cl at the bias potential 1 2 v vs ag agcl the prominent electrocatalytic performances for electrochemical no3 reduction of cu3p cf electrode mainly resulted from the intrinsic catalytic properties of cu3p and the intimate contact between cu3p and highly conductive cu foam based on the cv and eis analysis no3 was mainly reduced through the reaction between cu0 and adsorbed no3 species the cu3p not only served as an electron mediator or bridge to accelerate electron transfer for no3 reduction but also acted as a catalytic platform for atomic h generation to transform no2 into nh4 the obtained electrode could maintain its electrocatalytic activity even after eight cycles finally a new two stage treatment strategy pre oxidation by ir ru ti anode and post reduction by cu3p cf was designed and achieved effective cod and tn removal from real industrial wastewater with the results in the study a more practical binder free electrocatalyst could be fabricated and applied in the electrochemical removal of pollutants from wastewater however this work was conducted at the lab scale

17174,a highly active and selective electrode is essential in electrochemical denitrification although the emerging cu based electrode has attracted intensive attentions in electrochemical no3 reduction the issues such as restricted activity and selectivity are still unresolved in our work a binder free composite electrode cu3p cf was first prepared by direct growth of copper phosphide on copper foam and then applied to electrochemical no3 reduction the resulting cu3p cf electrode showed enhanced electrochemical performance for no3 reduction 84 3 with high n2 selectivity 98 01 under the initial conditions of 1500 mg l 1 cl and 50 mg n l 1 no3 the cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectra eis demonstrated that electrochemical no3 reduction was achieved through electron transfer between no3 and cu0 originated from cf the in situ grown cu3p served as the bifunctional catalyst the electron mediator or bridge to facilitate the electron transfer for no3 reduction and the stable catalyst to produce atomic h toward no2 conversion meanwhile the cu3p cf remained its electrocatalytic activity even after eight cyclic experiments finally a 2 stage treatment strategy pre oxidation by ir ru ti anode and post reduction by cu3p cf cathode was designed for electrochemical chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn removal from real wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords binder free electrode copper foam copper phosphide electrochemical denitrification reaction mechanism 1 introduction for the wide applications of agricultural fertilizer and urban surface rainwater runoff as well as discharge of industrial wastewater the contamination of nitrate no3 in water has been a threat to ecological balance and human health gruber and galloway 2008 pennino et al 2017 particularly its incomplete conversion by product nitrite no2 is thought to be cancerogenic because it can induce liver damage and methaemoglobinaemia addiscott and benjamin 2004 ward et al 2018 therefore the united states environmental protection agency us epa and world health organization who all declare that the maximum contaminant levels mcl of no3 in drinking water should be controlled to below 10 0 mg n l 1 united states environmental protection agency 1991 world health organization 2011 electrochemical denitrification can achieve the selective conversion of no3 to ammonium nh4 or nitrogen gas n2 and has been regarded as a promising method for no3 removal from water due to its high efficiency no chemicals input and moderate operating conditions shih et al 2020a yao et al 2019a besides this method is very appropriate to treat the real wastewater containing no3 duan et al 2019 su et al 2017 generally there are a great quantity of coexisting soluble inorganic ions in real wastewater for example chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and nh4 which can decrease the external addition of electrolyte during electrochemical denitrification gu et al 2020 the electrochemical no3 reduction is really related to the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of electrode materials so researches have made effort to develop high performance electrode to date noble metal based materials represented by pd pdcu pdir pdsn etc are more active and durable however its low abundance and high cost are disadvantageous in the practical wastewater treatment guo et al 2018 shu et al 2019 su et al 2019a wang et al 2006 zhou et al 2017 hence exploring non precious metal electrode materials with high efficiency becomes the research hotspots in our previous study we investigated the indirect reduction of no3 by a zero valent titanium zvt anode yao et al 2019a however the consumption of zvt anode and the generation of solid by products tio2 4cl0 2n0 1 significantly restricted the practical application of such technology recently cu a common non noble metal has been applied as cathode for electrochemical no3 reduction duan et al 2019 kim and pak 2019 li et al 2020 su et al 2017 teng et al 2018 however the reduction products of no3 are no2 and nh4 using these electrodes for example shih et al 2020b found that the main by products with cu metal electrode were no2 47 1 and nh4 42 9 how to increase the n2 selectivity of cu based electrode it is well known that no2 can be effectively reduced to n2 or nh4 by atomic h gao et al 2020 seraj et al 2017 furthermore the atomic h also can reduce cu2o to cu facilitating the electrochemical denitrification chen et al 2019 copper phosphide cu3p is a common catalytic material for hydrogen evolution reaction her han et al 2017 reported that h was catalytically generated on cu3p based nickel foam electrode at a certain cathodic potential meanwhile it also can serve as an electron mediator or bridge to improve the electron transfer processes alexopoulou et al 2019 inspired by aforementioned aspects combination of cu and cu3p may be a better strategy to construct the electrode material with high activity and selectivity for electrochemical no3 reduction how to combine cu and cu3p as the composite electrode material through a facile and cost effective way is a key issue the simplest solution is using the polymer e g polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride as binder to immobilize powder catalysts onto the support surface liu et al 2020 su et al 2019b wang et al 2020 but the polymer unavoidably inhibits the electrocatalytic activity and also affects the stability and conductivity of composite electrodes to solve these problems researches have been committed to developing efficient binder free electrode chen et al 2020a yao et al 2019b yao et al 2020a after overall considerations a binder free integrated cu and cu3p composite electrode was prepared in our work cu foam cf with 3d network structure is employed for both cu sources and support owing to its low cost preferable electrical conductivity and rich adsorptive or reactive sites mao et al 2016 then cu3p was fabricated on cf via one step phosphidation process to form the binder free electrode cu3p cf to our best knowledge there is rare report on such electrode material for electrochemical denitrification moreover the detailed mechanisms of electrochemical denitrification over this constructed electrode are still unclear for example what role does the cu3p and cf play in electrochemical denitrification and what are essential reaction parameters that affect the no3 removal in this work a binder free copper phosphide self supported copper foam cu3p cf electrode was prepared via a facile phosphidation process and its electrocatalytic properties for electrochemical reduction of no3 were evaluated the effects of preparation temperature cathodic potential initial no3 concentration initial solution ph and initial cl concentration on electrochemical no3 reduction were investigated the mechanism of electrochemical no3 reduction by this binder free composite electrode was also proposed and demonstrated finally the feasibility of the resulting electrode for no3 removal from actual wastewater was assessed 2 materials and experiments 2 1 preparation of cu3p cf cathode a piece of cf 4 cm 1 cm 0 1 cm was cleaned ultrasonically several times with 1 m hcl acetone ethanol and water respectively to remove the impurities on its surface copper phosphide was self supported on copper foam cu3p cf via one step in situ phosphidation method pfeiffer et al 2004 typically 0 25 g red p the cleaned cf and 0 25 g red p were placed at three rail boat in order with distance of 5 cm and calcined at 300 450 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere in the horizontal tube furnace otf 1200x hf kejing china the cu3p cf obtained at 300 350 400 and 450 c was labeled as cu3p cf 300 350 400 and 450 respectively the loading amount of cu3p on cf was calculated according to previous work yao et al 2019b and the details listed in text s2 2 2 electrochemical no3 reduction the electrochemical no3 reduction was carried out in a cylindrical three electrode electrochemical cell with an effective volume of 100 ml and the cathodic potential was controlled by an electrochemical workstation chi760e shanghai chenhua china the resulting cu3p cf ir ru ti and ag agcl were used as the working counter and reference electrode respectively the gap between the each electrode was set to 1 5 cm 80 ml of 50 mm na2so4 solution containing no3 was electrolyzed and stirred at 600 rpm the cathodic potential was maintained in the range of 0 8 1 4 v vs ag agcl 2 ml of solution was taken from the reaction cell every one hour and then filtered for analyzing the concentration of no3 no2 and nh4 for cyclic experiments the integrated electrode after reaction was thoroughly cleaned with water and dried at 60 c under vacuum for 8 h then the experiment was carried out under same conditions again to evaluate the feasibility of as prepared electrode in real wastewater treatment its electrochemical denitrification performance was investigated using the actual pharmaceutical wastewater ningbo zhejiang province of china the characteristics of wastewater were listed in table 2 before electrochemical no3 reduction the cod and organic nitrogen in wastewater were electrochemically oxidized by ir ru ti anode at 80 ma cm 2 of 8 h 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of no3 no2 cl and nh4 were determined by dionex ion exchange chromatography ics 900 dionex usa and the detailed procedures were listed in text s4 the contents of n2o and no in gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography gc 2010 plus gas shimadzu japan and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride spectrophotometric method 722g shengke shanghai china respectively the concentration of cu ion in the solution after the reaction was detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 5300dv perkin eimer usa in this work the production of n2o and no were negligible hence no3 removal efficiency r no3 no2 generation s no2 nh4 generation s nh4 and n2 selectivity s n2 were calculated according to the followings eqs 1 4 1 r n

initial and final reaction time respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and structural properties of cu3p cf the cu3p cf composite electrode was synthesized by direct phosphorization of cf using red p as a phosphorus source in this process commercial cf not only served as the cu source to produce cu3p but also acted as a conductive support of cu3p obviously this artful in situ growth route resulted in an intimate contact between cu3p and cf which increased the charge transfer efficiency in electrochemical redox reactions yuan et al 2017 and further enhanced the electrochemical performances compared the sem images of cf fig 1 a and cu3p cf 400 fig 1b it could be found that the macro porous framework of cu foam still retained after high temperature phosphorization simultaneously cu3p with bamboo leaves morphology was uniformly integrated into the surface of cf inset of fig 1b which might result from the red p volatilization and the structural collapse and reconsolidation of cf at certain temperature pfeiffer et al 2004 the elemental analysis fig 1c clearly confirmed that p and cu elements were homogeneously distributed in this material the presence of o element in electrode materials should be attributed to the superficial oxidation of cu in air during the preparation and analysis process the growth of cu3p onto cf surface was further verified by x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 1d the intensity of three peaks at 43 26 50 22 and 74 03 for cu jcpds no 04 0836 vividly decreased after phosphorization at 400 c shih et al 2020b simultaneously three new diffraction peaks at 36 37 38 87 and 73 49 were observed which corresponded to 112 202 and 322 planes for cu3p respectively jcpds no 71 2261 kim et al 2019 indicating that cu3p successfully grew on the cf surface in addition two peaks at 42 28 and 61 36 suggested the presence of cu2o jcpds no 05 0667 which was in accordance with elemental mapping the surface elemental compositions and valence of cu3p cf 400 were analyzed by the xps in the xps spectrum of cu 2p fig 1e the peaks at 932 2 and 952 0 ev were attributed to cu in cu3p and cu2o those at 935 0 and 954 9 ev were assigned to cu2 states the two satellite peaks with binding energy observed at 943 7 and 962 6 ev were indexed to the oxidized cu species the oxidized cu species confirmed by xrd and xps might result from the superficial oxidation of cu during the preparation and analysis process there was a peak at 129 8 ev in the xps spectrum of p 2p which was attributed to the p bonded to cu fig 1f wei et al 2016 energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis further demonstrated the existence of copper phosphorus and oxygen elements on the resulting electrode surface and the molar ratio of cu p o is about 46 7 16 9 34 19 fig 1g 3 2 performance of cu3p cf on electrochemical no3 reduction the performances of an electrode material on electrochemical no3 reduction are closely related to its physicochemical and electrochemical characteristics in this work the phosphidation temperature was the key factor text s6 and s7 a series of electrode materials prepared at different phosphidation temperature 300 450 c were used as cathode for electrochemical denitrification fig 2 among them cu3p cf 400 exhibited the highest no3 removal efficiency 97 7 and rate constant 0 727 h 1 within 5 h electrolysis obviously different phosphidation temperature resulted in the difference of physicochemical and electrochemical characteristics of electrode materials for cu3p cf 300 a very small fraction of cu was converted to cu3p and the cu content was 9 92 mg g 1 fig s1 and table s1 correspondingly no3 removal efficiency and rate constant were only 78 5 and 0 294 h 1 respectively but still higher than those of bare copper foam 61 8 and 0 227 h 1 which indicated that the direct growth of cu3p on cf enhanced the electrochemical no3 reduction with the phosphidation temperature increasing to 450 c the cu on the cf surface was almost entirely transformed to cu3p and the cu loading mass reached up to 36 33 mg g 1 however the interfacial electron transfer efficiency and electrochemical active surface area ecsa of cu3p cf 450 declined compared to cu3p cf 300 350 and 400 text s6 and s7 chen et al 2020b as a consequence no3 removal efficiency and rate constant also decreased to 66 9 and 0 232 h 1 respectively in addition on the basis of cu 2p xps survey spectra fig 1e some cu2 oxidized species were formed during the electrode preparation process it is unknown whether cu2 oxidized species could serve as electrocatalytic active centers for no3 reduction however lower no3 removal efficiency 40 0 and rate constant 0 1 h 1 was induced by cuo cf fig 3 suggesting the governing role of cu3p and cu in copper foam for no3 reduction instead of cu2 oxidized species these results demonstrated that the suitable composition and crystallization and high ecsa and interfacial electron transfer efficiency were essential to ensure sufficient electrochemical active sites and super electron transfer rate for electrocatalytic no3 reduction by cu3p cf composite electrode the conversion of main products from electrochemical denitrification by cf and cu3p cf were analyzed comparatively fig 2b in cf electrode reactor two typical products no2 and nh4 were generated which were in accordance with the previous findings that most of the no3 was transferred to no2 and nh4 for cu cathode shih et al 2020b however nh4 was the main product in cu3p cf electrode reactor especially when the phosphidation temperature exceeded 400 c in detail no2 generation decreased from 28 2 to 0 8 as the calcination temperature increased from 300 to 450 c simultaneously nh4 production increased from 57 6 to 82 3 besides the rate constant of no2 reduction on cu3p cf 400 0 985 h 1 was 8 65 times higher than that on cf 0 114 h 1 fig s5 it could be speculated that cu3p directly grew on cu foam was in favor of no2 conversion in addition the gap mass balance of n element 19 1 for cu3p cf 400 might be attributed to the n2 release because the production of other gaseous products including no 0 215 mg l 1 and n2o 0 174 mg l 1 were negligible text s4 the binder free electrode materials have remarkable advantages compared to powdery materials since they can directly serve the electrocatalysts and effectively avoid interface electron transfer resistance and coverage of electrocatalytic active sites led by the polymer yuan et al 2017 the cu3p powder was prepared and then immobilized on the copper foam by a binder polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf labeled as cu3pb cf text s8 only ca 76 8 of no3 was reduced by this binder cathode fig 3b the eis analysis suggested that the arc radius of nyquist plots for cu3p cf 400 was lower than that of cu3pb cf indicating that cu3p cf 400 had higher electron transfer efficiency for electrochemical no3 reduction fig 3c chen et al 2020c meanwhile no2 generation of cu3p cf was only 0 6 whereas 7 8 of no2 generation was observed for cu3pb cf because the catalytic active sites for no2 conversion were covered by the polymer fig 3d on the basis of such findings the resulting integrated electrode cu3p cf 400 is an ideal cathode for electrochemical denitrification due to superior electrocatalytic activity and higher average current efficiency η 3 3 effect of operating parameters on electrochemical no3 reduction 3 4 effect of applied cathodic potential electrochemical redox reactions are greatly electrode potential dependent several overpotential 0 8 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 v vs ag agcl were applied to disclose the effect of cathodic potential on electrochemical denitrification the cv curves of cu3p cf 400 in fig 4 a indicated that the reduction peak rn around 1 05 v should be attributed to the electron transfer for no3 reduction because it did not arise in the absence of no3 shih et al 2020b however about 19 8 and 73 6 of no3 were reduced at 0 8 and 1 0 v fig 4b respectively which were positive than the reduction peak potential 1 05 v obtained from cv the feature form of cv is a result of the potential dependent variation of the surface concentrations in redox system and the simultaneous diffusion processes the redox potential is attained when the substances exposed on the electrode surface have been oxidized or reduced sugimoto et al 2005 so no3 could undergo electrochemical reduction even if the applied bias potential was positive than the reduction peak potential of rn similar results were also discovered in electrochemical trichloroacetic acid dechlorination by graphene cu foam electrode mao et al 2016 as the cathodic potential became more negative no3 removal efficiency increased and reached a maximum 97 7 at 1 2 v while it was slight decrease at 1 3 v 97 0 and 1 4 v 94 8 fig 4b similarly the rate constant k also rose from 0 04 to 0 727 h 1 when the applied bias potential decreased from 0 8 to 1 2 v but a slight decrease was observed at 1 3 0 701 h 1 and 1 4 v 0 584 h 1 table 1 actually the more negative bias potential was applied the more electrons and atomic h was generated which could promote no3 reduction via direct and indirect pathway nonetheless numerous hydrogen bubbles were observed at lower potential 1 3 and 1 4 v which might hinder the transportation of electrons and no3 to the electrode surface gao et al 2019 resulting in the inhibition of electrochemical no3 reduction as the power consumption indicator average current efficiency η was calculated according to our previous work yao et al 2019a and the details were shown in text s9 as listed in table 1 the η of cu3p cf 400 at 1 2 v was 26 24 while it was 20 53 and 16 34 at 1 3 and 1 4 v respectively these results suggested that more electrical energy was consumed for water electrolysis at lower bias potential 2h2o o2 anode 2h2 cathode hence the 1 2 v vs ag agcl was a favorable cathodic potential for electrochemical no3 reduction 3 5 effect of initial no3 concentration the concentration of no3 in diverse water system is different particularly for real wastewater to better understand the effect of initial no3 concentration on electrochemical denitrification experiments were operated at various initial no3 concentration ranging from 20 to 460 mg n l 1 results showed that higher initial no3 concentration led to the gradual decrease of no3 removal efficiency fig 5 a and rate constant k fig s6a however the absolute removed amount of no3 within 5 h electrolysis was 1 49 3 78 6 77 10 81 and 16 90 mg n for 20 50 100 200 and 460 mg n l 1 respectively fig s6b indicating that more no3 was reduced at higher initial concentration based on the cv curves the peak current of rn no3 reduction was enhanced as the initial no3 concentration increased fig 6 a and it was also linearly correlated with the square root of scan rate fig 6b suggesting that electrochemical no3 reduction by cu3p cf cathode was a diffusion controlled process shih et al 2020b besides the diffusion rate of contaminant to the cathode surface is related to its concentration in solution yao et al 2020b accordingly more no3 was adsorbed on the electrocatalytic active sites under higher no3 concentration leading to more no3 removal and higher average current efficiency fig s6b in addition the no2 generation was 37 6 within 5 h electrolysis when initial no3 concentration was 460 mg n l 1 fig 5b but only 1 58 mg n l 1 no2 was detected after 12 h simultaneously no3 removal and nh4 production efficiency increased to 82 7 and 75 2 respectively data not shown 3 6 effect of initial solution ph fig 5c showed the influence of initial reaction ph 3 11 on electrochemical no3 reduction by cu3p cf 400 cathode the no3 removal efficiency kept above 90 under all initial reaction ph reflecting that electrochemical denitrification led by this binder free cathode could be performed in a broad ph range nonetheless compared to ph 11 no3 reduction rate constant at ph 3 was strengthened by a 2 29 fold fig s7 as shown in fig s8 the voltammetric behavior of cu3p cf 400 in 50 mm na2so4 solution exhibited an oxidation peak around 0 1 v o1 and a reduction peak around 0 8 v r1 corresponding to the oxidation of cu0 to cu2o and cu oxide reduction respectively eqs 5 6 indicating the redox of cu0 cu occurred shih et al 2020b furthermore this reversible peak of r1 and o1 as a linear function of square root of the scan rate implied that this redox was limited by proton diffusion shih et al 2020b 5 2 c u 0 h 2 o c u 2 o 2 h 2 e 6 c u 2 o 2 h 2 e 2 c u 0 h 2 o the r1 and rn improved by increasing no3 concentration fig 6a which demonstrated that no3 was reduced through the redox reaction of cu0 no3 badea et al 2009 noticeably the no2 generation decreased from 10 2 to 0 26 when the initial reaction ph decreased from 11 to 3 because more atomic h was produced at lower ph zhang et al 2019 therefore lower initial solution ph was beneficial to the no3 and no2 reduction by cu3p cf electrode 3 7 effect of initial cl concentration and stability of cu3p cf electrode to achieve complete conversion of no3 into n2 electrochemical no3 reduction experiments were performed in the presence of cl a part of cl in solution might be converted into cl2 by ir ru ti anode which immediately reacts with h2o to form hypochlorite clo eqs 7 9 yao et al 2020c 7 2 c l 2 e c l 2 8 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o h c l 9 h c l o c l o h clo a typical strong oxidizing agent can oxidize various substances such as cr ⅲ nh4 and no2 yao et al 2020c anglada et al 2010a in this work the produced nh4 and no2 can be oxidized to n2 and no3 by clo respectively eqs 10 12 10 2 n h 4 3 c l o n 2 3 h 2 o 3 c l 2 h 11 n h 4 3 c l o n o 2 3 c l 2 h h 2 o 12 n o 2 c l o n o 3 c l as shown in fig 7 a no3 removal efficiency decreased from 97 7 to 78 6 with the initial cl concentration increasing from 0 to 2000 mg l 1 likely due to the secondary formation of no3 eqs 11 12 and the occupation of electrochemical active sites by cl duan et al 2019 in contrast the n2 selectivity increased from 18 9 to 98 6 fig 7b the η of electrochemical no3 reduction in the presence of 2000 mg l 1 cl 10 60 was lower than that in the absence of cl 26 24 trade off the no3 reduction n2 selectivity as well as η 1500 mg l 1 cl was the optimal dosage for complete no3 removal the stability of electrode is a very important indicator for electrochemical reaction in order to evaluate the reusability of cu3p cf electrochemical no3 reduction was repeated eight times under optimal conditions and the results illustrated in fig 7c no3 removal efficiency mildly decreased from 97 7 to 84 4 after the first cycle and then maintained almost constant 75 7 82 5 in the following cyclic experiments in addition chloride is a common halide ion that may cause the corrosion of metal especially at higher concentration wang et al 2009 fig 7d exhibited that no3 removal efficiency maintained above 62 in presence of cl 1500 mg l 1 after eight cycles the n2 selectivity kept about 98 and few no2 and nh4 were detected in each test phosphorus is an aqueous pollutant of great concerns we determined the concentration of tp and phosphate po4 before and after treatment using the as prepared electrode cu3p cf and the results illustrated in fig s15 the concentration of tp and po4 after the first reaction was 0 57 and 0 54 mg l 1 respectively however their concentrations decreased to 0 12 and 0 11 mg l 1 respectively after three cycles with the increased number of cycles they were below the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 the results indicated that the dissolution of phosphorus from electrode was not the great concern these findings fully suggested that the as prepared electrode had excellent stability and electrocatalytic activity in the long term performance 3 8 proposed reaction mechanism electrochemical denitrification is an intricate course accomplished by direct and indirect reduction of various intermediates with broad valence from 5 to 3 yao et al 2019a as mentioned above no3 could be reduced through the redox of cu0 no3 however considering that no3 might also be reduced via the h mediated indirect process eqs 13 16 gao et al 2020 bulk electrolysis with cu3p cf 400 as the cathode was performed out in presence of tba a specific scavenger of atomic h negligible effects on electrochemical denitrification were observed even tba concentration reached up to 10 mm fig s10 indicating atomic h was not the main reducing agent for no3 reduction similar phenomena were also observed in electrochemical denitrification by other noble or non precious metal electrode such as co3o4 ti and pd gao et al 2019 hamid et al 2016 in this study we speculated that no3 was primarily reduced through the redox reaction between cu0 and no3 instead of indirect reduction by atomic h noticeably no2 generation increased from 0 6 to 31 9 with the tba concentration increasing from 0 to 10 mm fig s10 besides electrochemical no2 reduction using cf electrode was not impacted by 10 mm tba while the impact was significant for cu3p cf 400 fig s11 therefore cu3p played an electrocatalyst for enhanced generation of atomic h which influenced the no2 conversion 13 c u 3 p h 2 o e c u 3 p h o h v o l m e r 14 h 2 o c u 3 p h e h 2 o

surface provided the electrons for no3 reduction but did the copper involved in the reactions come from cu3p or cf in order to answer this question the characteristics of cu3p cf 400 after reaction were analyzed by xrd and xps the phase of cu3p and its crystallization degree slightly decreased after first reaction fig s12 s13 and the cuox generated during the preparation process transformed to cu0 or cu shih et al 2020b however the content and crystallization of cu3p cf were not further changed in the following cycles which were also demonstrated by the sem results fig s14 besides no3 removal efficiency did not significantly decrease after first reaction and then maintained almost constant in the following cycles fig 7c these suggested that 1 the cuox species were not principally active sites for no3 reduction 2 the copper involved in the redox reaction of cu0 no3 was originated from cf and 3 cu3p not only served as an electron mediator or bridge to promote the electron transfer efficiency for no3 reduction but also participated as a stable electrocatalyst for generating atomic h toward no2 conversion the mechanism of electrochemical no3 reduction with cu3p cf electrode was proposed in fig 8 no3 first adsorbed on the surface of cu3p cf the cu3p played an electron transfer mediator for no3 reduction to no2 via redox reaction between cu0 and no3 eqs 17 19 similarly the generated no2 was sequentially reduced to n2 or nh4 eqs 20 21 it might also be reduced to no and n2o and further transformed into n2 eqs 22 24 in addition no2 could be reduced to n2 or nh4 through hydrogenation pathway eqs 25 27 due to the continuous generation of atomic h on the cu3p surface eq 13 based on the break point chlorination the nh4 generated from no3 conversion was oxidized into n2 by clo produced from the oxidation of cl on anode eq 10 inevitably a small amount of nh4 were oxidized to no2 and further converted to no3 resulting in the slight inhibition of electrochemical no3 reduction eqs 10 12 17 n o 3 2 c u 0 c u 3 p n o 2 c u 2 o 18 c u 2 o 2 e 2 h c u 3 p c u 0 h 2 o 19 c u 2 o 2 c u 3 p h 2 c u 0 2 c u 3 p h 2 o 20 2 n o 2 6 c u 0 2 h c u 3 p n 2

treatment of actual wastewater in general nitrogen pollutants in real wastewater include inorganic and organic nitrogen and some organic nitrogen might be oxidized to no3 anglada et al 2010a anglada et al 2011 thus electrocatalytic activity of resulting electrode was evaluated in terms of total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod removal from actual wastewater the characteristics of wastewater and the percentage of tn and cod removal were shown in table 2 and fig s14 only 48 4 of tn and 45 1 of cod were removed by cu3p cf 400 cathode after 5 h electrolysis at the cathodic potential 1 2 v vs ag agcl however they increased to 80 3 and 91 4 respectively when the real wastewater was pretreated by electrochemical oxidation by ir ru ti anode it was worth noting that no3 increased to 98 4 mg n l 1 and nh4 concentration decreased to 2 7 mg n l 1 after the pre oxidation obviously the nh4 and organic nitrogen in water was transferred into no3 anglada et al 2010b these findings suggested that the organics in the solution showed an adverse effect on tn and no3 removal owing to the occupation of adsorptive and electrocatalytic active sites yao et al 2019b the operational cost of this method coperation is determined by the electrical energy consumption cenergy and the details were shown in text s9 the electrical energy consumption for both cod and tn removal was about 18 45 kwh m3 the electrical energy cost in china is 0 1974 kwh so the coperation was 3 64 m3 the advantages and disadvantages of different electrodes for no3 removal were compared in table 3 pre oxidation by ir ru ti anode combined with post reduction by cu3p cf 400 displayed remarkable advantages in term of high activity and n2 selectivity simple preparation operation process and eco friendly for no3 removal from real wastewater 4 conclusions in this work we confirmed that cu3p cf composite obtained via a facile in situ phosphidation process was a promising binder free electrode material with high activity and selectivity for electrochemical denitrification the electrochemical properties of this resulting material were greatly related to its composition and crystallization which were controlled by the phosphidation temperature although efficient electrocatalytic no3 reduction by cu3p cf could be realized under different initial solution ph and no3 concentration lower initial ph and no3 concentration were in favor of no3 reduction the n2 selectivity increased with the initial cl concentration increasing as the initial no3 concentration was 50 mg n l 1 84 3 of no3 was removed with 98 01 n2 selectivity after 5 h electrolysis in the presence of 1500 mg l 1 cl at the bias potential 1 2 v vs ag agcl the prominent electrocatalytic performances for electrochemical no3 reduction of cu3p cf electrode mainly resulted from the intrinsic catalytic properties of cu3p and the intimate contact between cu3p and highly conductive cu foam based on the cv and eis analysis no3 was mainly reduced through the reaction between cu0 and adsorbed no3 species the cu3p not only served as an electron mediator or bridge to accelerate electron transfer for no3 reduction but also acted as a catalytic platform for atomic h generation to transform no2 into nh4 the obtained electrode could maintain its electrocatalytic activity even after eight cycles finally a new two stage treatment strategy pre oxidation by ir ru ti anode and post reduction by cu3p cf was designed and achieved effective cod and tn removal from real industrial wastewater with the results in the study a more practical binder free electrocatalyst could be fabricated and applied in the electrochemical removal of pollutants from wastewater however this work was conducted at the lab scale
