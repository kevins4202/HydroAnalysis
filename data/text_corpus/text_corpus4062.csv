20310,in this numerical study vortex induced vibrations vivs of two elastically mounted tandem circular cylinders with attached splitter plate are simulated at r e 150 m r 2 and damping ratio of ζ 0 the cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both streamwise and transverse directions three different configurations including splitter plate attached to only upstream cylinder attached to only downstream cylinder and attached to both cylinders are investigated results show that in many of the examined cases the galloping response occurs which led to large values of vibration amplitudes moreover in tandem cylinders with a large spacing ratio adding a plate to the downstream cylinder does not change the vibrations of the upstream cylinder at small to medium reduced velocities for this case the galloping vibration occurs at medium reduced velocities for downstream cylinder plate assembly cp and at high reduced velocity for downstream cylinder furthermore adding a plate to the upstream cylinder greatly affects the vibrations of both cylinders causing the galloping vibration of the upstream cylinder at low reduced velocity and the galloping vibration of upstream cp at medium reduced velocity during the galloping response various wake patterns behind downstream cylinder plate body including p s 2p 2d t p 2t q t and 2q are observed keywords tandemly arranged cylinders splitter plate vortex induced vibration galloping flow wake 1 introduction in a cross flow over cylindrical structures vortex shedding phenomenon exerts fluctuating hydrodynamic forces on these structures if these structures are flexible or mounted flexibly the hydrodynamic forces can cause streamwise and transverse vibrations in theses cylindrical structures this kind of flow induced vibration fiv is so called vortex induced vibration viv and frequently observed in many engineering applications such as heat exchanger tubes marine risers offshore platform structures submarine pipelines and transmission electric lines viv of a single flexibly mounted cylinder in a cross flow has been extensively studied in the literature by investigating the effects of reynolds number reduced velocity and damping ratio on amplitude of displacement heat transfer rate and wake structure amini et al 2020 ashouri et al 2021 bearman 2011 chen et al 2018 2020a 2020b guo et al 2021 izadpanah et al 2018 liu et al 2020 sang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 when the frequency of vortex shedding synchronizes with the natural frequency of the system a large amplitude oscillation happens which is called the lock in phenomenon during the lock in phenomenon high periodic forces act on cylindrical structures which leads to fatigue failure in them trim et al 2005 zheng et al 2014 therefore viv suppression of cylindrical structures has been extensively studied in the past decades different control techniques which proposed for viv suppression can be divided into two main classifications active and passive methods active methods generally need exterior energy supplier and monitoring systems such as rotating rods zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2015 and suction blowing on surface of the cylinder chen et al 2013 as opposed to active methods passive techniques do not require the external energy and suppress vivs by changing the geometry and topology of structures or adding some devices the passive approaches usually have some advantages such as simple design less costly and easy installation consequently various devices have been proposed as a passive technique for vivs suppression such as control rods alam et al 2003 zhu and yao 2015 wire tripping wire meshes huera huarte 2017 quadrante and nishi 2014 helical strakes sui et al 2016 coating porous material ebrahimi et al 2021 and so on among the different devices for the passive technique splitter plates have been received more attentions due to its simplicity and effectiveness assi et al 2009 gao et al 2019 2020a ozkan et al 2017 sahu et al 2019 studied fiv of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate and investigated effects of mass ratio and reduced velocity on the response of the cylinder they recognized three different regimes of fiv including viv steady flow and galloping in their studies also they concluded that reduced velocity related to the onset of the lock in regime increases with increasing of mass ratio and reduced velocity related to termination of this regime is independent of mass ratio moreover galloping regime happens for all values of mass ratio for small values of mass ratio galloping occurs immediately after the viv regime for high values of mass ratio beyond the viv regime at first a steady regime and then the galloping regime are occurred in a similar study sun et al 2020 studied the fiv of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate at re 100 they found that by increasing the plate length three fiv modes including viv coupled viv and galloping and separated viv and galloping can be distinguished liang et al 2018 found that viv of a circular cylinder can be well controlled by an attached flexible splitter plate for l d 1 1 where l is length of the splitter plates and d is diameter of the cylinder zhu and liu 2020 suppressed the vortex shedding of a circular cylinder by using of a wavy splitter plate they observed that the wavy splitter plate could reduce the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of the lift coefficient up to 27 5 and 54 9 respectively they also found an optimized value for wavelength of the wavy splitter plate in order to control viv of the cylinder zhu et al 2020 studied the effects of length and position of detached splitter plates downstream or upstream of the cylinder on hydrodynamic forces and vibration response of a circular cylinder izadpanah et al 2019 examined 14 cases of an oscillating finned cylinder in laminar flow and investigated the effects of fins on the heat transfer enhancement vortex shedding pattern and the vibration amplitude of the cylinder they found that in comparison to stationary cylinder viv can increase the heat transfer rate up to 50 4 in various engineering applications such as tube bundles of heat exchanger marine drilling risers submarine pipelines and electrical transmission lines fluid flows over a group of cylinders instead of a single cylinder these cylinders are placed at specified distances from each other and they may be located in different arrangements for flow over two stationary cylinders zdravkovich 1977 classified three different regimes based on the location of the cylinders with respect to the flow direction in the proximity interference side by side and the wake interference tandem regimes cylinders are located in transverse and streamwise directions respectively in the later one the downstream cylinder is partially or completely located in the wake of the upstream cylinder in the overlapping regime staggered arrangement cylinders were distanced from each other in both directions and therefore effects of both proximity and wake interferences are combined for flow past two stationary cylinders in tandem arrangement sumner 2010 identified three different regimes including extended body reattachment and co shedding based on the spacing ratio l d where l is the center to center distance and d is the diameter of the cylinders these regimes can be recognized based on the lower and upper limits of spacing ratio with ranges of r l 1 2 1 8 and r u 3 4 3 8 respectively where the spacing ration are l d r l r l l d r u and l d r u the corresponding regimes are extended body reattachment and co shedding respectively in the extended body and reattachment regimes the shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder wrapped and reattach to the surface of the downstream cylinder respectively in the co shedding regime vortices shed from the upstream cylinder develop between the two cylinders when multiple cylinders are elastically mounted the fluctuating hydrodynamic forces applied on these cylinders lead to transvers and streamwise vibrations in recent years widespread investigations were performed on the viv of multiple cylinders in comparison with an isolated cylinder viv of multiple cylinders is much more complex as a result of strong wake interferences between the cylinders particularly when the distances among the cylinders are small since the simplest group of cylinders comprised only two cylinders most of the previous studies have focused on the viv of two tandem cylinders either in the transverse direction 1dof or in both the transverse and streamwise directions 2dof the flow induced vibration fiv of two tandem cylinders may happen in two forms viv and galloping also may be named as wake galloping or wake induced vibration unlike viv where high amplitude displacement occurs only in the lock in regime in the galloping vibration the amplitude of displacement increases monotonously with increasing reduced velocity furthermore galloping is a low frequency vibration although galloping does not occur in fiv of a single circular cylinder it may happen in fiv of multiple tandem cylinders noncircular isolated cylinder and isolated circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate papaioannou et al 2008 showed that at large values of spacing ratio l d 5 and high re number the vibration behaviors of the upstream cylinder are similar to viv of an isolated cylinder however the downstream cylinder indicates three vibration behaviors including the viv galloping and combined viv and galloping bokaian and geoola 1984 papaioannou et al 2008 chen et al 2018 numerically studied the viv of three tandem cylinders in a low re number by using the immersed boundary method their results reveal that three cylinders have galloping vibration for spacing ratio of 1 2 but for larger spacing ratio the vibration behavior of the cylinders is similar to the classical viv qin et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 experimentally located a circular cylinder in the wake of a smaller cylinder they studied effects of the cylinder diameters ratio on the displacements and hydrodynamic forces of cylinders janocha et al 2020 placed two cylinders with different diameters in the side by side arrangement they investigated influence of the smaller cylinder location on hydrodynamic forces and vibration amplitude of the larger cylinder huera huarte et al 2016 experimentally examined a flexibly mounted cylinder behind a stationary cylinder at different distances bao et al 2012 numerically simulated two tandem elastically mounted circular cylinders at fixed values of reynolds number re 150 and spacing ratio l d 5 0 they investigated the influence of natural frequency ratio on viv behavior of both cylinders for a broad range of reduced velocity they concluded that for these values of reynolds number and spacing ratio viv of the upstream cylinder is similar to the classical viv of an isolated cylinder however response of the downstream cylinder and especially its streamwise viv is strongly influenced by the natural frequency ratio xu et al 2019 experimentally examined fiv of two tandem cylinders at different values of spacing ratios and subcritical reynolds numbers in a turbulent flow the dynamic behaviors of the upstream cylinder such as displacements and vibration frequencies remain unaffected by the downstream cylinder for spacing ratios larger than 1 57 and reduced velocities smaller than 12 0 that is the displacement of upstream cylinder is similar to an isolated cylinder for large spacing ratios for spacing ratios smaller than 1 57 the upstream cylinder presents a galloping vibration however the vibrations of the downstream cylinder significantly affected by the upstream cylinder for all spacing ratios recently viv response of three chen et al 2018 gao et al 2020b yu et al 2016 and four wang et al 2019 circular cylinders and two square cylinders in the tandem arrangement nepali et al 2020 were also investigated based on the above literature effects of attached or detached splitter on the fiv of an elastically mounted single cylinder have been extensively studied both experimentally and numerically however effects of splitter plates on the elastically mounted multi cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangements are not investigated yet in present study fiv of two flexible circular cylinders with attached splitter plate in tandem arrangement are investigated numerically the cylinders are free to vibrate in both streamwise and transverse directions in order to study both viv and galloping responses a wide range of reduced velocity 3 u r 23 is considered the effect of splitter plate length and spacing ratio in three different configurations are investigated in the first configuration splitter plate attached only to the upstream cylinder in the second one splitter plate attached to the downstream cylinder and in the last configuration splitter plate attached to both cylinders 2 problem description fig 1 displays the computational domain used in the current study for numerical simulation of two flexible tandem cylinders with attached splitter plates this computational domain is a rectangle with dimensions of 45d and 30d in streamwise and transverse directions respectively where d is the diameter of the cylinder in the stationary condition the distances of the cylinder s center from inlet upper and lower boundaries are equal to 15d the cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both transverse and streamwise directions independently mass spring damper system with two degree of freedom 2dof is used for vibration modeling of the cylinders the geometric details of two tandemly cylinders with attached splitter plates are shown in fig 2 in this figure l 1 l 2 l and g denote respectively length of the first plate length of the second plate center to center distance of two cylinders and gap between two cylinder plate assemblies the length ratio of first and second splitter plates are defined as l 1 d and l 2 d respectively also the spacing ratio and gap ratio is described by λ l d and γ g d respectively in the present study three different configurations of cylinder and splitter plate assembly are considered in the first configuration the upstream structure is an isolated cylinder without splitter plate and downstream structure is a cylinder plate assembly in the second configuration upstream and downstream structures are cylinder plate assembly and isolated cylinder respectively in the last configurations both structures are cylinder plate assembly in the following sections first second and third configurations respectively are denoted by c c p l 2 d l λ c p l 1 d c l λ and c p l 1 d c p l 2 d l λ where l 1 d and l 2 d are the length ratio of the first and second splitter plates respectively 3 governing equations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations of incompressible flow the governing equations of two dimensional 2 d laminar unsteady and incompressible flow are the navier stokes equations including the continuity and momentum equations which are expressed as follows white and chul 2016 the continuity equation 1 u u ˆ 0 the momentum equation 2 ρ u t u u ˆ u p μ 2 u where ρ u u ˆ and p are the fluid density velocity vector mesh velocity vector and the pressure respectively 3 2 the equations of motion for the cylinders the vibrations of elastically mounted cylinders are modeled by mass spring damping system with considering two degrees of freedom 2dof the cylinders are free to oscillate in both streamwise and transverse directions therefore the non dimensional equations of motion of the cylinders are given as follow rao and griffin 2017 3 x 4 π ζ u r x 4 π 2 u r 2 x 2 c d π m r 4 y 4 π ζ u r y 4 π 2 u r 2 y 2 c l π m r where y y and y represent the transverse displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder normalized by d u and u 2 d respectively x x and x stand for the similar variables corresponding to the streamwise direction i e x x d x x u and x d x u 2 u r u f n d is the reduced velocity where f n 1 2 π k e q m e q is the natural frequency and k e q and m e q are the equivalent stiffness and mass of the system respectively m r 4 m e q π ρ f d 2 is the mass ratio and ζ c e q 2 m e q k e q is the damping ratio the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients are defined as follows 5 c d f x 1 2 ρ f u 2 d 6 c l f y 1 2 ρ f u 2 d where f x and f y are the streamwise and transverse force components respectively in the above two equations the force components f x and f y contain the effect of pressure and viscous forces the average drag coefficient c d m e a n is calculated as follows 7 c d m e a n 1 γ t t γ c d d t for the lift coefficient the root mean square rms value of the lift coefficient c l r m s is calculated as follows 8 c l r m s 1 γ t t γ c l 2 d t the simple semi implicit method for the pressure linked equations algorithm is used for coupling between the pressure and the velocity vector the value of 10 6 is adopted for convergence criteria of continuity and momentum equations moreover the second order upwind and the least squares cell based schemes are used for discretization of the convective and gradient terms respectively the first order explicit scheme is adopted for the temporal term and the maximum courant number of 1 0 is used in the transient simulation 3 3 validation of the numerical method in order to validate the present numerical simulations fiv of a flexibly supported circular cylinder with attached splitter plate with length of 1 5d at re 100 mass ratio of 10 and zero damping ratio is simulated in fig 3 the obtained normalized displacement amplitude in transverse direction a y y m a x y m i n 2 d is compared with those of given by sun et al 2020 as seen from this figure the results of the present study are in good agreement with those of reported by sun et al 2020 fig 4 compares the normalized response frequency f y f y f n of cylinder plate body in vertical direction obtained from the present study to that given by sun et al 2020 the lock in region occurs in the reduced velocity range of 5 u r 7 and the galloping response occurs for u r 10 it can be concluded that the normalized response frequencies of current study are in good agreement with those available in the literature in the second validation test case the hydrodynamic characteristics of laminar flow over a fixed cylinder at re 200 was compared with previous numerical and experimental studies in table 1 as can be observed the present results are in good agreement with the results of other researchers the time averaged pressure coefficient around this fixed cylinder at re 200 is also compared with previous experimental norberg 2002 results in fig 5 again the present results are in good agreement with the results of given by norberg 2002 4 results and discussions in the current work flow induced vibrations of two cylinder plate assemblies in tandem arrangement are considered at re 150 m r 2 and ζ 0 0 the effects of different parameters such as reduced velocity length ratio of plates and spacing ratio on the vibration amplitude frequency characteristics and hydrodynamic forces are investigated the diameter of both cylinders is assumed to be identical and thickness of plates is kept constant to 0 1d in this study a wide range of reduced velocity 3 u r 23 two different values of spacing ratio 3 5 and three different values of the length ratio 1 1 5 and 2 are considered 4 1 grid independence study to verify the mesh independence of presented simulations the case of cp1 c l5 0 in u r 10 is solved with six different meshes from very coarse mesh g1 to very fine mesh g6 with cell numbers of 14 864 27 926 50 037 72 450 162 764 and 240 196 the maximum amplitude of displacements and hydrodynamic coefficients in streamwise and transverse directions obtained by these meshes are compared in table 2 as seen the results obtained from g4 g5 and g6 meshes are very close to each other therefore the g4 mesh is used in all simulations of this work for the sake of computational efficiency for example the computational grid corresponding to cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 is shown in fig 6 as observed in order to capture flow characteristics including the vortex shedding and boundary layer the grids near cylinder plate bodies and behind them are refined 4 2 streamwise and transverse amplitude responses the normalized streamwise and transverse vibration amplitudes are expressed as a x x m a x x m i n 2 d and a y y m a x y m i n 2 d respectively where the subscripts max and min represent the maximum and minimum displacements of structures in figures of this section the onset reduced velocity of galloping u r g is displayed by a yellow marker and also a yellow thick arrow fig 7 shows variations of these normalized amplitudes with respect to reduced velocity at different values of spacing ratio and plate length for the cp c configuration for cp c structures simulations up to u r 19 are performed unless collision occurs between upstream and downstream objects due to high displacement in the longitudinal direction for cp1 0 c l3 0 and cp2 0 c l5 0 structures collision occurs at u r 10 and u r 13 respectively in order to provide a better comparison of results the vibration amplitudes of an isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 and two tandemly arranged cylinders with spacing ratio of 5 0 c c l5 0 are involved in this figure in the cp1 0 c l5 0 case the transverse amplitudes of upstream and downstream bodies are smaller than that of cylinder with similar location in the c c l5 0 case for the ranges of u r 5 and u r 8 respectively for all investigated spacing ratios transverse and streamwise amplitudes of cp1 5 case are smaller than similar amplitudes of upstream and downstream bodies in the cp1 0 c l5 0 case in the upstream structure of the cp1 0 c l5 0 case a viv response is seen for the reduced velocity smaller than 4 and the amplitude in this viv response is approximately constant and equal to a y 0 125 for u r 4 the upstream structure shows a galloping response and its transverse amplitude increases with increasing of the reduced velocities the downstream structure of this case bare cylinder shows a viv response for the reduced velocity smaller than 14 and its amplitude increases gradually to a y 0 954 at u r 8 then its amplitude approximately remains constant until u r 14 at this reduced velocity wake induced galloping response is began and by increasing the reduced velocity the amplitude of cylinder increases generally compared with an isolated cp structure or two tandem cylinders fiv amplitudes of both structures of cp c configuration in both streamwise and transverse directions are increased greatly fig 8 compares the streamwise and the transverse normalized amplitudes versus reduced velocity for different cases of c cp configuration single cylinder plate structure and two tandem cylinders as observed in the c cp2 0 l5 0 case for small to moderate reduced velocities u r 18 fiv amplitudes of upstream cylinder are similar to those of upstream cylinder in the c c l5 case the same conclusion can be obtained for the c cp1 0 l5 0 case only except for u r 4 where the vibration of upstream cylinder is stabilized in the presence of the downstream cp1 0 structure generally it can be concluded that in tandem cylinders with large values of spacing ratio adding the splitter plate with any length to the downstream cylinder does not affect vibration responses of the upstream cylinder for small to moderate values of reduced velocity in these cases the upstream cylinder shows a viv response in a vast range of the reduced velocity the lock in regime is occurred in reduced velocity ranges from 4 0 to 9 0 and maximum of transverse amplitude happens in u r 5 with value of a y 0 636 finally the upstream cylinder shows the galloping vibration at reduced velocities of 20 and 21 for the c cp1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases respectively in cases with small spacing ratio i e c cp2 0 l3 0 and c cp1 0 l3 0 the amplitude variations of the upstream cylinder with reduced velocity are similar to that of upstream cylinder of c c configuration until u r 7 and u r 8 for plate length of d and 2d respectively by more increasing of the reduced velocity to the onset of galloping response vibration amplitudes monotonically decrease the onset of galloping for the upstream cylinder of c cp2 0 l3 0 and c cp1 0 l3 0 cases are u r 11 and u r 12 respectively in comparison with dynamic response of downstream cylinder of the c c configuration the splitter plate attached to the downstream cylinder in c cp cases significantly influenced its vibration responses in both in line and cross flow directions for the spacing ratio of λ 5 0 and all examined plate length by increasing the reduced velocity from u r 3 transverse amplitude of downstream cp bodies decreases and reaches to a minimum point at u r 5 and then increases and reaches to a maximum point at u r 8 in the c cp1 0 l5 0 case the values of the transverse amplitude at minimum and maximum points are equal to a y m i n 0 137 and a y m a x 0 52 respectively for the c cp2 0 l5 0 case these values are a y m i n 0 07 and a y m a x 0 35 respectively with further increasing of the reduced velocity from u r 8 to the onset of the galloping the transverse amplitude of cp bodies remains approximately constant for the c cp1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases the galloping vibrations of downstream cp bodies occur at reduced velocities of 20 and 21 respectively similar to spacing ratio of 5 the transverse amplitude of cp bodies with spacing ratio of 3 has a minimum point at reduced velocity of u r 5 by increasing reduced velocity from 5 to the values corresponding the onset of galloping the transverse amplitudes increase monotonically for the c cp1 0 l3 0 and c cp2 0 l3 0 cases the reduced velocities correspond to the galloping vibrations of downstream cp bodies are u r 8 and u r 11 respectively fig 9 illustrates the normalized amplitudes in both directions versus reduced velocity for the cp cp configuration with different plate length and λ 5 single cp1 5 structure and the c c l5 configuration it can be seen that in all reduced velocities a y and a x of the cp cp cases are larger than those of the cp1 5 case specially in higher values of reduced velocity where the galloping vibration occurs this means that the cp structures in tandem arrangement intensify their fiv with respect to an isolated cp body by comparison amplitudes of the cp cp cases and c c l5 case it can be concluded that in some small values of reduced velocities a y and a x of the cp cp cases are smaller than those of c c l5 case in other word adding the spilites plate to the cylinders leads to stabilization of the structure in these values of u r this stabilization for the cp1 0 cp1 0 case occurs in u r 4 and for two other cases are occurs in reduced velocity ranges from 4 to 5 at the end of these stabilized range of reduced velocities u r 4 for the cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 0 case and u r 5 for two other cases the galloping vibration occurs and leads to very high amplitudes of vibration in comparison with the bare cylinders c c case 4 3 frequency characteristics in order to distinguish different flow regimes including the lock in and galloping in the above introduced configurations the dominant response frequencies in the transverse direction f y are calculated by the fast fourier transform fft based on the vibration displacements the normalized response frequencies f f y f n for the cases of the cp c configuration versus reduced velocity are shown in fig 10 as can be seen in all examined plate length for the upstream cp body the galloping vibration shown by yellow markers and arrow occurs at a small value of the reduced velocity whereas for the downstream clean cylinder the onset of galloping u r g is delayed to a significant higher value of reduced velocity for both upstream and downstream bodies in all cases the normalized frequency during the galloping vibration approximately remains constant also in all cases expect the cylinder body in the c cp1 l3 and c cp2 l3 this constant normalized frequency is significantly smaller than those of related before galloping vibration the normalized frequency of upstream cp structure at reduced velocity smaller than u r g follows the strouhal frequency line of s t 0 23 this region where normalized frequency matches to the strouhal line is called the initial branch ib and during that structure displays a small amplitude vibration by contrast the downstream cylinder immediately does not follow the strouhal line for reduced velocities smaller than u r g for the downstream cylinder a desynchronization regime between the initial branch and galloping regimes is observed where the normalized frequency separates from the strouhal line for the cp1 c l3 cp1 c l5 and cp2 c l5 the onset reduced velocity of galloping of downstream cylinder are u r 3 u r 4 and u r 5 respectively in the cp1 c l3 case for reduced velocity greater than 11 the collision between the cp body and clean cylinder occurs due to their large displacements in the in line direction therefore we could not find the onset reduced velocity of galloping for downstream cylinder in this case for downstream cylinder in the cp1 c l5 case the galloping occurs at reduced velocity of 14 the constant value of normalized frequency during the galloping response depends only on the plate length and it is independent from the spacing ratio this constant for the plate length of d and 2d are f 0 62 and f 1 15 respectively another important conclusion is that in the initial branch associated with low reduced velocities both the upstream and downstream structures have the same normalized frequencies the normalized response frequencies f f y f n for the cases of the c cp configuration as a function of reduced velocity are shown in fig 11 for the spacing ratio of 3 0 the frequency response of both upstream cylinder and downstream cp body can be categorized into three regimes viv transition and galloping the viv regime is further divided into initial branch ib and lower branch lb or lock in regime the initial branch occurs at low values of reduced velocity in which the normalized frequencies of the cylinder and the cp body follow the strouhal number of the stationary cylinder therefore the normalized frequency approximately increases linearly with increasing of reduced velocity similar to viv of an isolated cylinder the lower branch is related to the lock in phenomenon and it is started after the initial branch in this branch the normalized frequency is almost equal to f 1 and amplitude of vibration increases significantly the lower branch follows by a transition branch tb where the normalized frequency in neither equal to f 1 nor to strouhal number during this transition regime the normalized amplitude gradually decreases and at the end of it the galloping vibration gv occurs which is shown by yellow marker and yellow arrow in figures during the galloping response normalized frequency remains constant whereas the normalized amplitude monotonically increases with increase in reduced velocity furthermore this constant value of normalized frequency for downstream cp body f 0 6 is considerably smaller than that of upstream cylinder f 1 6 for the c cp case with λ 5 the frequency response is similar to that of λ 3 except that the transition branch is replaced by desynchronization branch db that is the frequency response for the c cp case with spacing ratio of 5 includes the ib lb db and gv in fig 12 the normalized response frequencies for the cp cp configuration with spacing ratio of 5 and different plate length are plotted as a function of reduced velocity in this configuration for all examined plate length the upstream and downstream cp bodies have identical normalized frequencies furthermore the normalized frequency of this configuration at a specified value of plate length contains only the initial branch and galloping regime that is after the initial branch the normalized frequency suddenly drops to a significantly smaller value and does not change with further increase of reduced velocity also frequency in the galloping regime decreases with increase in the length of splitter plate 4 4 orbital trajectories of structures motion trajectories of the upstream and downstream structures for the cp1 0 c l5 0 and cp2 0 c l5 0 cases at reduced velocities of 3 6 9 12 and 15 are plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively it is observed that the vibration trajectories of a single cylinder are typically similar to the figure eight pattern due to fact that the value of dominant response frequency in the streamwise direction is twice of its value in the transverse direction fig 13 shows that the upstream cp body in the cp1 0 c l5 0 case at displayed reduced velocities moves in a regular or irregular figure eight orbit however due to vortex shedding phenomenon of the upstream cp structure the downstream cylinder exhibits chaotic orbital trajectories by increasing the plate length from d to 2d in the cp2 0 c l5 case the motion orbits of both upstream cp and downstream cylinder bodies become more complicated in this case the orbital shapes of the upstream cp structure changes from regular figure eight pattern to irregular figure eight one also the trajectories of the downstream cylinder become more chaotic compared with that of downstream cylinder in cp1 0 c l5 case motion orbits of the upstream and downstream structures for the c c p1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases at reduced velocities of 3 6 9 12 and 15 are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively as can be seen for the upstream cylinder of both c c p1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases the amplitude of vibration is relatively large for u r 6 due to the lock in regime that occurs in reduced velocity range from 4 0 to 9 0 in the c c p1 0 l5 0 case trajectories of both upstream and downstream structures are regular thin figure eight shape moreover they are mainly symmetric about horizontal and vertical axes by increasing the plate length of the downstream cp structure from d to 2d c c p2 0 l5 0 case the motion orbits of the upstream cylinder at reduced velocity smaller than 14 preserve their regular thin figure eight shape however at large values of reduced velocity irregular trajectories appear for downstream structure the figure eight shape is preserved at reduced velocity smaller than 12 and for larger values of u r again irregular trajectories appear which is induced by the wake interference effect fig 17 shows the motion orbits of two tandem cylinder plate structures at different values of reduced velocity it is seen that the trajectories of upstream structure are mostly symmetric and regular figure eight shape however the downstream structure undergoes a chaotic motion due to wake induced interference effect 4 5 hydrodynamic force coefficients in fig 18 the time averaged drag coefficient c d m e a n and the root mean square lift coefficient c l r m s for three cases of the cp c configuration are compared with those of an isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 and two tandem cylinders c c 5 0 as a function of the reduced velocity in all cases of cp c configuration c l r m s on the upstream cp body enhances significantly close to the onset reduced velocity of galloping response and then reduces nearly linearly in the galloping regime resulting in the maximum values of c l r m s 2 07 1 92 and 1 41 for cp1 0 c l5 0 cp1 0 c l5 0 and cp2 0 c l3 0 respectively however the drag coefficients of upstream body do not vary greatly with the reduced velocity and exhibits a similar behavior with cp1 5 structure moreover in comparison with the c c l5 0 case c d m e a n of upstream body reduces significantly the lift coefficient of downstream cylinder shows different features i e the maximum value of the c l r m s for the cp1 0 c l5 0 cp1 0 c l5 0 cases occurs at u r 3 and u r 4 respectively and then it almost linearly decreases in fig 19 the hydrodynamic force coefficients c d m e a n and c l r m s for different cases of the c cp configuration are plotted versus the reduced velocity for better comparison lift and drag coefficients of an isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 and two tandem cylinders c c 5 0 are also included in the cases with λ 5 changes of c d m e a n and c l r m s with reduced velocity for upstream cylinder at different plate length are similar to those of two tandem bare cylinders except for very large values of u r where high values of hydrodynamic coefficient are observed due to galloping response due to the wake induced interference effect the drag coefficients of the downstream cp structure are significantly decreased compared with that of a single cylinder plate structure with plate length of 1 5d cp1 5 furthermore at u r 10 the value of c d m e a n is considerably smaller than that of downstream cylinder in the c c 5 0 case for the c cp1 0 l5 0 c cp2 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l3 0 minimum drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder occurs at u r 4 with negative value of 0 1 for all the examined cases at high reduced velocities u r 10 lift and drag coefficients of upstream cylinder are almost remain constant with values of 0 2 and 1 2 the drag coefficients of downstream cp structure in different cases are also maintained with value around 0 75 furthermore it is worth to note that at low reduced velocity of u r 3 the value of the c l r m s on the downstream cp structure is considerably large which is also reported by bao et al 2012 for viv of two tandem cylinders with large values of spacing ratio in fig 20 the c d m e a n and c l r m s coefficients of three different cases of the cp cp configuration are compared with the those of the cp1 5 and c c 5 0 cases for all examined plate lengths c l r m s of the upstream body significantly increases at reduced velocity corresponded to the beginning of the galloping response i e u r 4 4 and 5 for the plate lengths of d 1 5d and 2d respectively during the galloping response the lift coefficient reduces gradually with the reduced velocity similar behavior is observed for the isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 the drag coefficient of upstream body on the cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 0 case shows a peak at reduced velocity of u r 7 and by further increasing of reduced velocity the c d m e a n decreases at first for 7 u r 9 and then becomes constant for higher plate length the drag coefficient is approximately constant for all examined values of reduced velocity for plate length of d and 1 5d the drag coefficient of downstream body shows a similar behavior with drag coefficient of upstream body at the same plate length similar to the c cp configuration the c l r m s of the downstream cp structure has significantly large value at low reduced velocity of u r 3 and by increasing reduced velocity to u r 10 its value decreases and then becomes constant 5 wake patterns the 2 dof modeling of tandem cylinder with attached splitter plates reveals a vast change in the wake patterns behind the cylinder plate bodies depend on the spacing ratio length ratios of plates and reduced velocity the classical 2s mode 2 single vortices with opposite rotation are shed in each cycle of vibration is the main vortex shedding pattern during the viv responses however more complicated patterns were observed in the wake behind the cylinders when it experienced galloping vibration with very large transverse displacements during the galloping response various wake patterns behind cp bodies including p s 2p 2d t p 2t q t and 2q are observed here s p t and q represent single vortex pair vortices with oppose rotation double vortices with same rotation triple vortex group and quadruple vortex group respectively the wake patterns for different cases of the c cp configuration are cited in table 3 and plotted in figs 19 22 as shown in fig 21 vortex pattern of the c cp1 l3 case at u r 5 and u r 6 are 2s and 2p respectively in u r 9 to u r 14 the wake pattern is 2t and in u r 15 the wake pattern is q t fig 22 shows the wake patterns behind the cylinders of c cp1 l5 case at different values of reduced velocity vortex shedding patterns of this case for reduced velocity smaller than 19 follow the classical 2s mode because of small amplitude oscillation of the cylinders as plotted in fig 23 the wake structure of c cp2 l3 varies with the reduced velocity when reduced velocity increases from 3 0 to 7 0 the wake pattern keeps the 2s mode however at u r 3 the wake evolves into a single row configuration while at larger values of u r it develops into a double row configuration by further increasing of the reduced velocity from 8 to 11 a new wake pattern is observed and named 2d mode in this paper in this mode two vortices with same direction of rotation are shed per each cycle for 12 u r 14 the wake pattern is 2t mode and two triple vortex groups are shed per each cycle upon closer examination it can be observed that the vortices of a group approximately have equal strength of vorticity also this vortex group contains of a clockwise rotating vortex blue color and two counter clockwise rotating vortices red color it seems that the counter clockwise rotating vortex is dislocated from the lower side the wake patterns for c cp2 l5 are shown in fig 24 as can be seen up to reduced velocity of 12 the wake pattern is the classical 2s mode however the p s wake pattern is detected for 13 u r 19 in this range of reduced velocity the cylinders shed a single vortex on one side and a pair vortex on the other side at u r 20 the wake pattern changes to 2p mode the wake patterns for different cases of the cp c configuration are cited in table 4 and plotted in fig 25 and fig 26 in all cases the 2s mode is observed in reduced velocities of 3 and 4 in the cp1 c l3 case at u r 3 0 and u r 4 the downstream cylinder is entirely upstream surrounded by the wakes shed from the upstream cp body and a 2s wake is detected in the far wake region furthermore the 2p and t p modes are detected at u r 5 and u r 6 respectively the t p mode is identified such that a triple vortex group is formed at the upper side while a vortex pair sheds on the lower side with further increasing of u r the wake transforms to the 2t mode where two groups of triple vortex are shed per cycle of vibration fig 26 displays the wake patterns for the cp1 c l5 case at small values of reduced velocity u r 4 vortices with the 2s mode shed in the far downstream of cylinder with increasing reduced velocity from 5 to 6 the wake pattern changes from 2s to 2p mode the 2p mode remains until to ur 6 at ur 7 a new wake pattern ore observed which contain a triple vortex and a pair vortex this mode is named t p in this paper for reduced velocity from 8 to 14 the wake pattern changes to 2t mode and with further increase in reduced velocity two new modes of wake patter are observed for 15 u r 17 the q t mode and for 18 u r 20 the 2q mode is observed in the 2q mode each cylinder simultaneously sheds a pair of vortices 6 conclusion in this research flow induced vibrations of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders with attached splitter plate at reynolds number of 150 low mass ratio of m r 2 and a structural damping of ζ 0 are studied numerically the vibrations of cp bodies are simulated by 2dof model three different configurations including c cp cp c and cp cp are investigated in each configuration two spacing ratios λ 3 λ 5 and different plate length are considered the effects of considered parameters on the motion trajectories vibration frequency amplitudes and wake pattern are examined the results showed that in all investigated cases both upstream and downstream structures in a certain reduced velocity shows the galloping response this is in contrast to the two bare cylinders which show the galloping vibration only for very small spacing ratio for example for the c cp2 0 l5 0 c cp1 0 l5 0 c cp2 0 l3 0 and c cp1 0 l3 0 cases the upstream cylinder shows the galloping vibration at reduced velocities of 17 22 11 and 12 respectively also for the cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 0 cp1 5 cp1 2 l5 0 and cp2 0 cp2 0 l5 0 both upstream and downstream cylinders start galloping vibration at reduced velocity of 4 5 and 5 respectively at the onset reduced velocity of galloping the normalized frequency suddenly drops to a significant lower value and remains constant at higher values of reduced velocity during the galloping response various wake patterns behind cp bodies including p s 2p 2d t p 2t q t and 2q are observed credit authorship contribution statement

20310,in this numerical study vortex induced vibrations vivs of two elastically mounted tandem circular cylinders with attached splitter plate are simulated at r e 150 m r 2 and damping ratio of ζ 0 the cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both streamwise and transverse directions three different configurations including splitter plate attached to only upstream cylinder attached to only downstream cylinder and attached to both cylinders are investigated results show that in many of the examined cases the galloping response occurs which led to large values of vibration amplitudes moreover in tandem cylinders with a large spacing ratio adding a plate to the downstream cylinder does not change the vibrations of the upstream cylinder at small to medium reduced velocities for this case the galloping vibration occurs at medium reduced velocities for downstream cylinder plate assembly cp and at high reduced velocity for downstream cylinder furthermore adding a plate to the upstream cylinder greatly affects the vibrations of both cylinders causing the galloping vibration of the upstream cylinder at low reduced velocity and the galloping vibration of upstream cp at medium reduced velocity during the galloping response various wake patterns behind downstream cylinder plate body including p s 2p 2d t p 2t q t and 2q are observed keywords tandemly arranged cylinders splitter plate vortex induced vibration galloping flow wake 1 introduction in a cross flow over cylindrical structures vortex shedding phenomenon exerts fluctuating hydrodynamic forces on these structures if these structures are flexible or mounted flexibly the hydrodynamic forces can cause streamwise and transverse vibrations in theses cylindrical structures this kind of flow induced vibration fiv is so called vortex induced vibration viv and frequently observed in many engineering applications such as heat exchanger tubes marine risers offshore platform structures submarine pipelines and transmission electric lines viv of a single flexibly mounted cylinder in a cross flow has been extensively studied in the literature by investigating the effects of reynolds number reduced velocity and damping ratio on amplitude of displacement heat transfer rate and wake structure amini et al 2020 ashouri et al 2021 bearman 2011 chen et al 2018 2020a 2020b guo et al 2021 izadpanah et al 2018 liu et al 2020 sang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 when the frequency of vortex shedding synchronizes with the natural frequency of the system a large amplitude oscillation happens which is called the lock in phenomenon during the lock in phenomenon high periodic forces act on cylindrical structures which leads to fatigue failure in them trim et al 2005 zheng et al 2014 therefore viv suppression of cylindrical structures has been extensively studied in the past decades different control techniques which proposed for viv suppression can be divided into two main classifications active and passive methods active methods generally need exterior energy supplier and monitoring systems such as rotating rods zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2015 and suction blowing on surface of the cylinder chen et al 2013 as opposed to active methods passive techniques do not require the external energy and suppress vivs by changing the geometry and topology of structures or adding some devices the passive approaches usually have some advantages such as simple design less costly and easy installation consequently various devices have been proposed as a passive technique for vivs suppression such as control rods alam et al 2003 zhu and yao 2015 wire tripping wire meshes huera huarte 2017 quadrante and nishi 2014 helical strakes sui et al 2016 coating porous material ebrahimi et al 2021 and so on among the different devices for the passive technique splitter plates have been received more attentions due to its simplicity and effectiveness assi et al 2009 gao et al 2019 2020a ozkan et al 2017 sahu et al 2019 studied fiv of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate and investigated effects of mass ratio and reduced velocity on the response of the cylinder they recognized three different regimes of fiv including viv steady flow and galloping in their studies also they concluded that reduced velocity related to the onset of the lock in regime increases with increasing of mass ratio and reduced velocity related to termination of this regime is independent of mass ratio moreover galloping regime happens for all values of mass ratio for small values of mass ratio galloping occurs immediately after the viv regime for high values of mass ratio beyond the viv regime at first a steady regime and then the galloping regime are occurred in a similar study sun et al 2020 studied the fiv of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate at re 100 they found that by increasing the plate length three fiv modes including viv coupled viv and galloping and separated viv and galloping can be distinguished liang et al 2018 found that viv of a circular cylinder can be well controlled by an attached flexible splitter plate for l d 1 1 where l is length of the splitter plates and d is diameter of the cylinder zhu and liu 2020 suppressed the vortex shedding of a circular cylinder by using of a wavy splitter plate they observed that the wavy splitter plate could reduce the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of the lift coefficient up to 27 5 and 54 9 respectively they also found an optimized value for wavelength of the wavy splitter plate in order to control viv of the cylinder zhu et al 2020 studied the effects of length and position of detached splitter plates downstream or upstream of the cylinder on hydrodynamic forces and vibration response of a circular cylinder izadpanah et al 2019 examined 14 cases of an oscillating finned cylinder in laminar flow and investigated the effects of fins on the heat transfer enhancement vortex shedding pattern and the vibration amplitude of the cylinder they found that in comparison to stationary cylinder viv can increase the heat transfer rate up to 50 4 in various engineering applications such as tube bundles of heat exchanger marine drilling risers submarine pipelines and electrical transmission lines fluid flows over a group of cylinders instead of a single cylinder these cylinders are placed at specified distances from each other and they may be located in different arrangements for flow over two stationary cylinders zdravkovich 1977 classified three different regimes based on the location of the cylinders with respect to the flow direction in the proximity interference side by side and the wake interference tandem regimes cylinders are located in transverse and streamwise directions respectively in the later one the downstream cylinder is partially or completely located in the wake of the upstream cylinder in the overlapping regime staggered arrangement cylinders were distanced from each other in both directions and therefore effects of both proximity and wake interferences are combined for flow past two stationary cylinders in tandem arrangement sumner 2010 identified three different regimes including extended body reattachment and co shedding based on the spacing ratio l d where l is the center to center distance and d is the diameter of the cylinders these regimes can be recognized based on the lower and upper limits of spacing ratio with ranges of r l 1 2 1 8 and r u 3 4 3 8 respectively where the spacing ration are l d r l r l l d r u and l d r u the corresponding regimes are extended body reattachment and co shedding respectively in the extended body and reattachment regimes the shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder wrapped and reattach to the surface of the downstream cylinder respectively in the co shedding regime vortices shed from the upstream cylinder develop between the two cylinders when multiple cylinders are elastically mounted the fluctuating hydrodynamic forces applied on these cylinders lead to transvers and streamwise vibrations in recent years widespread investigations were performed on the viv of multiple cylinders in comparison with an isolated cylinder viv of multiple cylinders is much more complex as a result of strong wake interferences between the cylinders particularly when the distances among the cylinders are small since the simplest group of cylinders comprised only two cylinders most of the previous studies have focused on the viv of two tandem cylinders either in the transverse direction 1dof or in both the transverse and streamwise directions 2dof the flow induced vibration fiv of two tandem cylinders may happen in two forms viv and galloping also may be named as wake galloping or wake induced vibration unlike viv where high amplitude displacement occurs only in the lock in regime in the galloping vibration the amplitude of displacement increases monotonously with increasing reduced velocity furthermore galloping is a low frequency vibration although galloping does not occur in fiv of a single circular cylinder it may happen in fiv of multiple tandem cylinders noncircular isolated cylinder and isolated circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate papaioannou et al 2008 showed that at large values of spacing ratio l d 5 and high re number the vibration behaviors of the upstream cylinder are similar to viv of an isolated cylinder however the downstream cylinder indicates three vibration behaviors including the viv galloping and combined viv and galloping bokaian and geoola 1984 papaioannou et al 2008 chen et al 2018 numerically studied the viv of three tandem cylinders in a low re number by using the immersed boundary method their results reveal that three cylinders have galloping vibration for spacing ratio of 1 2 but for larger spacing ratio the vibration behavior of the cylinders is similar to the classical viv qin et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 experimentally located a circular cylinder in the wake of a smaller cylinder they studied effects of the cylinder diameters ratio on the displacements and hydrodynamic forces of cylinders janocha et al 2020 placed two cylinders with different diameters in the side by side arrangement they investigated influence of the smaller cylinder location on hydrodynamic forces and vibration amplitude of the larger cylinder huera huarte et al 2016 experimentally examined a flexibly mounted cylinder behind a stationary cylinder at different distances bao et al 2012 numerically simulated two tandem elastically mounted circular cylinders at fixed values of reynolds number re 150 and spacing ratio l d 5 0 they investigated the influence of natural frequency ratio on viv behavior of both cylinders for a broad range of reduced velocity they concluded that for these values of reynolds number and spacing ratio viv of the upstream cylinder is similar to the classical viv of an isolated cylinder however response of the downstream cylinder and especially its streamwise viv is strongly influenced by the natural frequency ratio xu et al 2019 experimentally examined fiv of two tandem cylinders at different values of spacing ratios and subcritical reynolds numbers in a turbulent flow the dynamic behaviors of the upstream cylinder such as displacements and vibration frequencies remain unaffected by the downstream cylinder for spacing ratios larger than 1 57 and reduced velocities smaller than 12 0 that is the displacement of upstream cylinder is similar to an isolated cylinder for large spacing ratios for spacing ratios smaller than 1 57 the upstream cylinder presents a galloping vibration however the vibrations of the downstream cylinder significantly affected by the upstream cylinder for all spacing ratios recently viv response of three chen et al 2018 gao et al 2020b yu et al 2016 and four wang et al 2019 circular cylinders and two square cylinders in the tandem arrangement nepali et al 2020 were also investigated based on the above literature effects of attached or detached splitter on the fiv of an elastically mounted single cylinder have been extensively studied both experimentally and numerically however effects of splitter plates on the elastically mounted multi cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangements are not investigated yet in present study fiv of two flexible circular cylinders with attached splitter plate in tandem arrangement are investigated numerically the cylinders are free to vibrate in both streamwise and transverse directions in order to study both viv and galloping responses a wide range of reduced velocity 3 u r 23 is considered the effect of splitter plate length and spacing ratio in three different configurations are investigated in the first configuration splitter plate attached only to the upstream cylinder in the second one splitter plate attached to the downstream cylinder and in the last configuration splitter plate attached to both cylinders 2 problem description fig 1 displays the computational domain used in the current study for numerical simulation of two flexible tandem cylinders with attached splitter plates this computational domain is a rectangle with dimensions of 45d and 30d in streamwise and transverse directions respectively where d is the diameter of the cylinder in the stationary condition the distances of the cylinder s center from inlet upper and lower boundaries are equal to 15d the cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both transverse and streamwise directions independently mass spring damper system with two degree of freedom 2dof is used for vibration modeling of the cylinders the geometric details of two tandemly cylinders with attached splitter plates are shown in fig 2 in this figure l 1 l 2 l and g denote respectively length of the first plate length of the second plate center to center distance of two cylinders and gap between two cylinder plate assemblies the length ratio of first and second splitter plates are defined as l 1 d and l 2 d respectively also the spacing ratio and gap ratio is described by λ l d and γ g d respectively in the present study three different configurations of cylinder and splitter plate assembly are considered in the first configuration the upstream structure is an isolated cylinder without splitter plate and downstream structure is a cylinder plate assembly in the second configuration upstream and downstream structures are cylinder plate assembly and isolated cylinder respectively in the last configurations both structures are cylinder plate assembly in the following sections first second and third configurations respectively are denoted by c c p l 2 d l λ c p l 1 d c l λ and c p l 1 d c p l 2 d l λ where l 1 d and l 2 d are the length ratio of the first and second splitter plates respectively 3 governing equations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations of incompressible flow the governing equations of two dimensional 2 d laminar unsteady and incompressible flow are the navier stokes equations including the continuity and momentum equations which are expressed as follows white and chul 2016 the continuity equation 1 u u ˆ 0 the momentum equation 2 ρ u t u u ˆ u p μ 2 u where ρ u u ˆ and p are the fluid density velocity vector mesh velocity vector and the pressure respectively 3 2 the equations of motion for the cylinders the vibrations of elastically mounted cylinders are modeled by mass spring damping system with considering two degrees of freedom 2dof the cylinders are free to oscillate in both streamwise and transverse directions therefore the non dimensional equations of motion of the cylinders are given as follow rao and griffin 2017 3 x 4 π ζ u r x 4 π 2 u r 2 x 2 c d π m r 4 y 4 π ζ u r y 4 π 2 u r 2 y 2 c l π m r where y y and y represent the transverse displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder normalized by d u and u 2 d respectively x x and x stand for the similar variables corresponding to the streamwise direction i e x x d x x u and x d x u 2 u r u f n d is the reduced velocity where f n 1 2 π k e q m e q is the natural frequency and k e q and m e q are the equivalent stiffness and mass of the system respectively m r 4 m e q π ρ f d 2 is the mass ratio and ζ c e q 2 m e q k e q is the damping ratio the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients are defined as follows 5 c d f x 1 2 ρ f u 2 d 6 c l f y 1 2 ρ f u 2 d where f x and f y are the streamwise and transverse force components respectively in the above two equations the force components f x and f y contain the effect of pressure and viscous forces the average drag coefficient c d m e a n is calculated as follows 7 c d m e a n 1 γ t t γ c d d t for the lift coefficient the root mean square rms value of the lift coefficient c l r m s is calculated as follows 8 c l r m s 1 γ t t γ c l 2 d t the simple semi implicit method for the pressure linked equations algorithm is used for coupling between the pressure and the velocity vector the value of 10 6 is adopted for convergence criteria of continuity and momentum equations moreover the second order upwind and the least squares cell based schemes are used for discretization of the convective and gradient terms respectively the first order explicit scheme is adopted for the temporal term and the maximum courant number of 1 0 is used in the transient simulation 3 3 validation of the numerical method in order to validate the present numerical simulations fiv of a flexibly supported circular cylinder with attached splitter plate with length of 1 5d at re 100 mass ratio of 10 and zero damping ratio is simulated in fig 3 the obtained normalized displacement amplitude in transverse direction a y y m a x y m i n 2 d is compared with those of given by sun et al 2020 as seen from this figure the results of the present study are in good agreement with those of reported by sun et al 2020 fig 4 compares the normalized response frequency f y f y f n of cylinder plate body in vertical direction obtained from the present study to that given by sun et al 2020 the lock in region occurs in the reduced velocity range of 5 u r 7 and the galloping response occurs for u r 10 it can be concluded that the normalized response frequencies of current study are in good agreement with those available in the literature in the second validation test case the hydrodynamic characteristics of laminar flow over a fixed cylinder at re 200 was compared with previous numerical and experimental studies in table 1 as can be observed the present results are in good agreement with the results of other researchers the time averaged pressure coefficient around this fixed cylinder at re 200 is also compared with previous experimental norberg 2002 results in fig 5 again the present results are in good agreement with the results of given by norberg 2002 4 results and discussions in the current work flow induced vibrations of two cylinder plate assemblies in tandem arrangement are considered at re 150 m r 2 and ζ 0 0 the effects of different parameters such as reduced velocity length ratio of plates and spacing ratio on the vibration amplitude frequency characteristics and hydrodynamic forces are investigated the diameter of both cylinders is assumed to be identical and thickness of plates is kept constant to 0 1d in this study a wide range of reduced velocity 3 u r 23 two different values of spacing ratio 3 5 and three different values of the length ratio 1 1 5 and 2 are considered 4 1 grid independence study to verify the mesh independence of presented simulations the case of cp1 c l5 0 in u r 10 is solved with six different meshes from very coarse mesh g1 to very fine mesh g6 with cell numbers of 14 864 27 926 50 037 72 450 162 764 and 240 196 the maximum amplitude of displacements and hydrodynamic coefficients in streamwise and transverse directions obtained by these meshes are compared in table 2 as seen the results obtained from g4 g5 and g6 meshes are very close to each other therefore the g4 mesh is used in all simulations of this work for the sake of computational efficiency for example the computational grid corresponding to cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 is shown in fig 6 as observed in order to capture flow characteristics including the vortex shedding and boundary layer the grids near cylinder plate bodies and behind them are refined 4 2 streamwise and transverse amplitude responses the normalized streamwise and transverse vibration amplitudes are expressed as a x x m a x x m i n 2 d and a y y m a x y m i n 2 d respectively where the subscripts max and min represent the maximum and minimum displacements of structures in figures of this section the onset reduced velocity of galloping u r g is displayed by a yellow marker and also a yellow thick arrow fig 7 shows variations of these normalized amplitudes with respect to reduced velocity at different values of spacing ratio and plate length for the cp c configuration for cp c structures simulations up to u r 19 are performed unless collision occurs between upstream and downstream objects due to high displacement in the longitudinal direction for cp1 0 c l3 0 and cp2 0 c l5 0 structures collision occurs at u r 10 and u r 13 respectively in order to provide a better comparison of results the vibration amplitudes of an isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 and two tandemly arranged cylinders with spacing ratio of 5 0 c c l5 0 are involved in this figure in the cp1 0 c l5 0 case the transverse amplitudes of upstream and downstream bodies are smaller than that of cylinder with similar location in the c c l5 0 case for the ranges of u r 5 and u r 8 respectively for all investigated spacing ratios transverse and streamwise amplitudes of cp1 5 case are smaller than similar amplitudes of upstream and downstream bodies in the cp1 0 c l5 0 case in the upstream structure of the cp1 0 c l5 0 case a viv response is seen for the reduced velocity smaller than 4 and the amplitude in this viv response is approximately constant and equal to a y 0 125 for u r 4 the upstream structure shows a galloping response and its transverse amplitude increases with increasing of the reduced velocities the downstream structure of this case bare cylinder shows a viv response for the reduced velocity smaller than 14 and its amplitude increases gradually to a y 0 954 at u r 8 then its amplitude approximately remains constant until u r 14 at this reduced velocity wake induced galloping response is began and by increasing the reduced velocity the amplitude of cylinder increases generally compared with an isolated cp structure or two tandem cylinders fiv amplitudes of both structures of cp c configuration in both streamwise and transverse directions are increased greatly fig 8 compares the streamwise and the transverse normalized amplitudes versus reduced velocity for different cases of c cp configuration single cylinder plate structure and two tandem cylinders as observed in the c cp2 0 l5 0 case for small to moderate reduced velocities u r 18 fiv amplitudes of upstream cylinder are similar to those of upstream cylinder in the c c l5 case the same conclusion can be obtained for the c cp1 0 l5 0 case only except for u r 4 where the vibration of upstream cylinder is stabilized in the presence of the downstream cp1 0 structure generally it can be concluded that in tandem cylinders with large values of spacing ratio adding the splitter plate with any length to the downstream cylinder does not affect vibration responses of the upstream cylinder for small to moderate values of reduced velocity in these cases the upstream cylinder shows a viv response in a vast range of the reduced velocity the lock in regime is occurred in reduced velocity ranges from 4 0 to 9 0 and maximum of transverse amplitude happens in u r 5 with value of a y 0 636 finally the upstream cylinder shows the galloping vibration at reduced velocities of 20 and 21 for the c cp1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases respectively in cases with small spacing ratio i e c cp2 0 l3 0 and c cp1 0 l3 0 the amplitude variations of the upstream cylinder with reduced velocity are similar to that of upstream cylinder of c c configuration until u r 7 and u r 8 for plate length of d and 2d respectively by more increasing of the reduced velocity to the onset of galloping response vibration amplitudes monotonically decrease the onset of galloping for the upstream cylinder of c cp2 0 l3 0 and c cp1 0 l3 0 cases are u r 11 and u r 12 respectively in comparison with dynamic response of downstream cylinder of the c c configuration the splitter plate attached to the downstream cylinder in c cp cases significantly influenced its vibration responses in both in line and cross flow directions for the spacing ratio of λ 5 0 and all examined plate length by increasing the reduced velocity from u r 3 transverse amplitude of downstream cp bodies decreases and reaches to a minimum point at u r 5 and then increases and reaches to a maximum point at u r 8 in the c cp1 0 l5 0 case the values of the transverse amplitude at minimum and maximum points are equal to a y m i n 0 137 and a y m a x 0 52 respectively for the c cp2 0 l5 0 case these values are a y m i n 0 07 and a y m a x 0 35 respectively with further increasing of the reduced velocity from u r 8 to the onset of the galloping the transverse amplitude of cp bodies remains approximately constant for the c cp1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases the galloping vibrations of downstream cp bodies occur at reduced velocities of 20 and 21 respectively similar to spacing ratio of 5 the transverse amplitude of cp bodies with spacing ratio of 3 has a minimum point at reduced velocity of u r 5 by increasing reduced velocity from 5 to the values corresponding the onset of galloping the transverse amplitudes increase monotonically for the c cp1 0 l3 0 and c cp2 0 l3 0 cases the reduced velocities correspond to the galloping vibrations of downstream cp bodies are u r 8 and u r 11 respectively fig 9 illustrates the normalized amplitudes in both directions versus reduced velocity for the cp cp configuration with different plate length and λ 5 single cp1 5 structure and the c c l5 configuration it can be seen that in all reduced velocities a y and a x of the cp cp cases are larger than those of the cp1 5 case specially in higher values of reduced velocity where the galloping vibration occurs this means that the cp structures in tandem arrangement intensify their fiv with respect to an isolated cp body by comparison amplitudes of the cp cp cases and c c l5 case it can be concluded that in some small values of reduced velocities a y and a x of the cp cp cases are smaller than those of c c l5 case in other word adding the spilites plate to the cylinders leads to stabilization of the structure in these values of u r this stabilization for the cp1 0 cp1 0 case occurs in u r 4 and for two other cases are occurs in reduced velocity ranges from 4 to 5 at the end of these stabilized range of reduced velocities u r 4 for the cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 0 case and u r 5 for two other cases the galloping vibration occurs and leads to very high amplitudes of vibration in comparison with the bare cylinders c c case 4 3 frequency characteristics in order to distinguish different flow regimes including the lock in and galloping in the above introduced configurations the dominant response frequencies in the transverse direction f y are calculated by the fast fourier transform fft based on the vibration displacements the normalized response frequencies f f y f n for the cases of the cp c configuration versus reduced velocity are shown in fig 10 as can be seen in all examined plate length for the upstream cp body the galloping vibration shown by yellow markers and arrow occurs at a small value of the reduced velocity whereas for the downstream clean cylinder the onset of galloping u r g is delayed to a significant higher value of reduced velocity for both upstream and downstream bodies in all cases the normalized frequency during the galloping vibration approximately remains constant also in all cases expect the cylinder body in the c cp1 l3 and c cp2 l3 this constant normalized frequency is significantly smaller than those of related before galloping vibration the normalized frequency of upstream cp structure at reduced velocity smaller than u r g follows the strouhal frequency line of s t 0 23 this region where normalized frequency matches to the strouhal line is called the initial branch ib and during that structure displays a small amplitude vibration by contrast the downstream cylinder immediately does not follow the strouhal line for reduced velocities smaller than u r g for the downstream cylinder a desynchronization regime between the initial branch and galloping regimes is observed where the normalized frequency separates from the strouhal line for the cp1 c l3 cp1 c l5 and cp2 c l5 the onset reduced velocity of galloping of downstream cylinder are u r 3 u r 4 and u r 5 respectively in the cp1 c l3 case for reduced velocity greater than 11 the collision between the cp body and clean cylinder occurs due to their large displacements in the in line direction therefore we could not find the onset reduced velocity of galloping for downstream cylinder in this case for downstream cylinder in the cp1 c l5 case the galloping occurs at reduced velocity of 14 the constant value of normalized frequency during the galloping response depends only on the plate length and it is independent from the spacing ratio this constant for the plate length of d and 2d are f 0 62 and f 1 15 respectively another important conclusion is that in the initial branch associated with low reduced velocities both the upstream and downstream structures have the same normalized frequencies the normalized response frequencies f f y f n for the cases of the c cp configuration as a function of reduced velocity are shown in fig 11 for the spacing ratio of 3 0 the frequency response of both upstream cylinder and downstream cp body can be categorized into three regimes viv transition and galloping the viv regime is further divided into initial branch ib and lower branch lb or lock in regime the initial branch occurs at low values of reduced velocity in which the normalized frequencies of the cylinder and the cp body follow the strouhal number of the stationary cylinder therefore the normalized frequency approximately increases linearly with increasing of reduced velocity similar to viv of an isolated cylinder the lower branch is related to the lock in phenomenon and it is started after the initial branch in this branch the normalized frequency is almost equal to f 1 and amplitude of vibration increases significantly the lower branch follows by a transition branch tb where the normalized frequency in neither equal to f 1 nor to strouhal number during this transition regime the normalized amplitude gradually decreases and at the end of it the galloping vibration gv occurs which is shown by yellow marker and yellow arrow in figures during the galloping response normalized frequency remains constant whereas the normalized amplitude monotonically increases with increase in reduced velocity furthermore this constant value of normalized frequency for downstream cp body f 0 6 is considerably smaller than that of upstream cylinder f 1 6 for the c cp case with λ 5 the frequency response is similar to that of λ 3 except that the transition branch is replaced by desynchronization branch db that is the frequency response for the c cp case with spacing ratio of 5 includes the ib lb db and gv in fig 12 the normalized response frequencies for the cp cp configuration with spacing ratio of 5 and different plate length are plotted as a function of reduced velocity in this configuration for all examined plate length the upstream and downstream cp bodies have identical normalized frequencies furthermore the normalized frequency of this configuration at a specified value of plate length contains only the initial branch and galloping regime that is after the initial branch the normalized frequency suddenly drops to a significantly smaller value and does not change with further increase of reduced velocity also frequency in the galloping regime decreases with increase in the length of splitter plate 4 4 orbital trajectories of structures motion trajectories of the upstream and downstream structures for the cp1 0 c l5 0 and cp2 0 c l5 0 cases at reduced velocities of 3 6 9 12 and 15 are plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively it is observed that the vibration trajectories of a single cylinder are typically similar to the figure eight pattern due to fact that the value of dominant response frequency in the streamwise direction is twice of its value in the transverse direction fig 13 shows that the upstream cp body in the cp1 0 c l5 0 case at displayed reduced velocities moves in a regular or irregular figure eight orbit however due to vortex shedding phenomenon of the upstream cp structure the downstream cylinder exhibits chaotic orbital trajectories by increasing the plate length from d to 2d in the cp2 0 c l5 case the motion orbits of both upstream cp and downstream cylinder bodies become more complicated in this case the orbital shapes of the upstream cp structure changes from regular figure eight pattern to irregular figure eight one also the trajectories of the downstream cylinder become more chaotic compared with that of downstream cylinder in cp1 0 c l5 case motion orbits of the upstream and downstream structures for the c c p1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases at reduced velocities of 3 6 9 12 and 15 are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively as can be seen for the upstream cylinder of both c c p1 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l5 0 cases the amplitude of vibration is relatively large for u r 6 due to the lock in regime that occurs in reduced velocity range from 4 0 to 9 0 in the c c p1 0 l5 0 case trajectories of both upstream and downstream structures are regular thin figure eight shape moreover they are mainly symmetric about horizontal and vertical axes by increasing the plate length of the downstream cp structure from d to 2d c c p2 0 l5 0 case the motion orbits of the upstream cylinder at reduced velocity smaller than 14 preserve their regular thin figure eight shape however at large values of reduced velocity irregular trajectories appear for downstream structure the figure eight shape is preserved at reduced velocity smaller than 12 and for larger values of u r again irregular trajectories appear which is induced by the wake interference effect fig 17 shows the motion orbits of two tandem cylinder plate structures at different values of reduced velocity it is seen that the trajectories of upstream structure are mostly symmetric and regular figure eight shape however the downstream structure undergoes a chaotic motion due to wake induced interference effect 4 5 hydrodynamic force coefficients in fig 18 the time averaged drag coefficient c d m e a n and the root mean square lift coefficient c l r m s for three cases of the cp c configuration are compared with those of an isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 and two tandem cylinders c c 5 0 as a function of the reduced velocity in all cases of cp c configuration c l r m s on the upstream cp body enhances significantly close to the onset reduced velocity of galloping response and then reduces nearly linearly in the galloping regime resulting in the maximum values of c l r m s 2 07 1 92 and 1 41 for cp1 0 c l5 0 cp1 0 c l5 0 and cp2 0 c l3 0 respectively however the drag coefficients of upstream body do not vary greatly with the reduced velocity and exhibits a similar behavior with cp1 5 structure moreover in comparison with the c c l5 0 case c d m e a n of upstream body reduces significantly the lift coefficient of downstream cylinder shows different features i e the maximum value of the c l r m s for the cp1 0 c l5 0 cp1 0 c l5 0 cases occurs at u r 3 and u r 4 respectively and then it almost linearly decreases in fig 19 the hydrodynamic force coefficients c d m e a n and c l r m s for different cases of the c cp configuration are plotted versus the reduced velocity for better comparison lift and drag coefficients of an isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 and two tandem cylinders c c 5 0 are also included in the cases with λ 5 changes of c d m e a n and c l r m s with reduced velocity for upstream cylinder at different plate length are similar to those of two tandem bare cylinders except for very large values of u r where high values of hydrodynamic coefficient are observed due to galloping response due to the wake induced interference effect the drag coefficients of the downstream cp structure are significantly decreased compared with that of a single cylinder plate structure with plate length of 1 5d cp1 5 furthermore at u r 10 the value of c d m e a n is considerably smaller than that of downstream cylinder in the c c 5 0 case for the c cp1 0 l5 0 c cp2 0 l5 0 and c cp2 0 l3 0 minimum drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder occurs at u r 4 with negative value of 0 1 for all the examined cases at high reduced velocities u r 10 lift and drag coefficients of upstream cylinder are almost remain constant with values of 0 2 and 1 2 the drag coefficients of downstream cp structure in different cases are also maintained with value around 0 75 furthermore it is worth to note that at low reduced velocity of u r 3 the value of the c l r m s on the downstream cp structure is considerably large which is also reported by bao et al 2012 for viv of two tandem cylinders with large values of spacing ratio in fig 20 the c d m e a n and c l r m s coefficients of three different cases of the cp cp configuration are compared with the those of the cp1 5 and c c 5 0 cases for all examined plate lengths c l r m s of the upstream body significantly increases at reduced velocity corresponded to the beginning of the galloping response i e u r 4 4 and 5 for the plate lengths of d 1 5d and 2d respectively during the galloping response the lift coefficient reduces gradually with the reduced velocity similar behavior is observed for the isolated cylinder plate body cp1 5 the drag coefficient of upstream body on the cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 0 case shows a peak at reduced velocity of u r 7 and by further increasing of reduced velocity the c d m e a n decreases at first for 7 u r 9 and then becomes constant for higher plate length the drag coefficient is approximately constant for all examined values of reduced velocity for plate length of d and 1 5d the drag coefficient of downstream body shows a similar behavior with drag coefficient of upstream body at the same plate length similar to the c cp configuration the c l r m s of the downstream cp structure has significantly large value at low reduced velocity of u r 3 and by increasing reduced velocity to u r 10 its value decreases and then becomes constant 5 wake patterns the 2 dof modeling of tandem cylinder with attached splitter plates reveals a vast change in the wake patterns behind the cylinder plate bodies depend on the spacing ratio length ratios of plates and reduced velocity the classical 2s mode 2 single vortices with opposite rotation are shed in each cycle of vibration is the main vortex shedding pattern during the viv responses however more complicated patterns were observed in the wake behind the cylinders when it experienced galloping vibration with very large transverse displacements during the galloping response various wake patterns behind cp bodies including p s 2p 2d t p 2t q t and 2q are observed here s p t and q represent single vortex pair vortices with oppose rotation double vortices with same rotation triple vortex group and quadruple vortex group respectively the wake patterns for different cases of the c cp configuration are cited in table 3 and plotted in figs 19 22 as shown in fig 21 vortex pattern of the c cp1 l3 case at u r 5 and u r 6 are 2s and 2p respectively in u r 9 to u r 14 the wake pattern is 2t and in u r 15 the wake pattern is q t fig 22 shows the wake patterns behind the cylinders of c cp1 l5 case at different values of reduced velocity vortex shedding patterns of this case for reduced velocity smaller than 19 follow the classical 2s mode because of small amplitude oscillation of the cylinders as plotted in fig 23 the wake structure of c cp2 l3 varies with the reduced velocity when reduced velocity increases from 3 0 to 7 0 the wake pattern keeps the 2s mode however at u r 3 the wake evolves into a single row configuration while at larger values of u r it develops into a double row configuration by further increasing of the reduced velocity from 8 to 11 a new wake pattern is observed and named 2d mode in this paper in this mode two vortices with same direction of rotation are shed per each cycle for 12 u r 14 the wake pattern is 2t mode and two triple vortex groups are shed per each cycle upon closer examination it can be observed that the vortices of a group approximately have equal strength of vorticity also this vortex group contains of a clockwise rotating vortex blue color and two counter clockwise rotating vortices red color it seems that the counter clockwise rotating vortex is dislocated from the lower side the wake patterns for c cp2 l5 are shown in fig 24 as can be seen up to reduced velocity of 12 the wake pattern is the classical 2s mode however the p s wake pattern is detected for 13 u r 19 in this range of reduced velocity the cylinders shed a single vortex on one side and a pair vortex on the other side at u r 20 the wake pattern changes to 2p mode the wake patterns for different cases of the cp c configuration are cited in table 4 and plotted in fig 25 and fig 26 in all cases the 2s mode is observed in reduced velocities of 3 and 4 in the cp1 c l3 case at u r 3 0 and u r 4 the downstream cylinder is entirely upstream surrounded by the wakes shed from the upstream cp body and a 2s wake is detected in the far wake region furthermore the 2p and t p modes are detected at u r 5 and u r 6 respectively the t p mode is identified such that a triple vortex group is formed at the upper side while a vortex pair sheds on the lower side with further increasing of u r the wake transforms to the 2t mode where two groups of triple vortex are shed per cycle of vibration fig 26 displays the wake patterns for the cp1 c l5 case at small values of reduced velocity u r 4 vortices with the 2s mode shed in the far downstream of cylinder with increasing reduced velocity from 5 to 6 the wake pattern changes from 2s to 2p mode the 2p mode remains until to ur 6 at ur 7 a new wake pattern ore observed which contain a triple vortex and a pair vortex this mode is named t p in this paper for reduced velocity from 8 to 14 the wake pattern changes to 2t mode and with further increase in reduced velocity two new modes of wake patter are observed for 15 u r 17 the q t mode and for 18 u r 20 the 2q mode is observed in the 2q mode each cylinder simultaneously sheds a pair of vortices 6 conclusion in this research flow induced vibrations of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders with attached splitter plate at reynolds number of 150 low mass ratio of m r 2 and a structural damping of ζ 0 are studied numerically the vibrations of cp bodies are simulated by 2dof model three different configurations including c cp cp c and cp cp are investigated in each configuration two spacing ratios λ 3 λ 5 and different plate length are considered the effects of considered parameters on the motion trajectories vibration frequency amplitudes and wake pattern are examined the results showed that in all investigated cases both upstream and downstream structures in a certain reduced velocity shows the galloping response this is in contrast to the two bare cylinders which show the galloping vibration only for very small spacing ratio for example for the c cp2 0 l5 0 c cp1 0 l5 0 c cp2 0 l3 0 and c cp1 0 l3 0 cases the upstream cylinder shows the galloping vibration at reduced velocities of 17 22 11 and 12 respectively also for the cp1 0 cp1 0 l5 0 cp1 5 cp1 2 l5 0 and cp2 0 cp2 0 l5 0 both upstream and downstream cylinders start galloping vibration at reduced velocity of 4 5 and 5 respectively at the onset reduced velocity of galloping the normalized frequency suddenly drops to a significant lower value and remains constant at higher values of reduced velocity during the galloping response various wake patterns behind cp bodies including p s 2p 2d t p 2t q t and 2q are observed credit authorship contribution statement

20311,this paper focuses on the problem of coordinated path following for underactuated unmanned surface vehicles usvs based on distributed control with directed topologies first a finite time extended state observer is presented to estimate the velocities and model uncertainties simultaneously second a finite time line of sight based guidance law is proposed for individual usv in kinematic loop to track the desired path specifically a cooperative update law for the path variable is designed under one way communication such that all usvs maintain the same distance from each other along one curve following a virtual leader then a control subsystem is proposed by combining a novel auxiliary dynamic system and sliding mode technique for each vehicle at the kinetic level where the auxiliary dynamic system is developed to ensure the finite time stability of the entire system while to solve saturation problem the closed loop system is verified to be uniformly global finite time stable finally the numerical simulations substantiates the feasibility of the proposed coordinated path following strategy graphical abstract keywords coordinated path following sliding mode finite time control actuator saturation 1 introduction with the rapid development of the economy land resources are increasingly scarce while the ocean which accounts for two thirds of the earth s surface is rich in minerals and biological resources melikoglu 2018 the ocean is a strategic resource base for human survival and sustainable development in the future therefore much effort has been made by scholars to handle the problem of unmanned surface vehicles usvs ranging from dynamic positioning du et al 2016a bidikli et al 2016 and path following yu et al 2019a borhaug et al 2008 fossen and lekkas 2017 miao and wang 2017 to trajectory tracking blondel et al 2020 elmokadem et al 2016 as one of the basic motion control strategies path following aims to force an object to track a parameterized path without time information although path following is a mature technology the operational capacity of a single usv is limited and the operation time of a single usv is relatively short due to energy limitations if multiple usvs work together in a certain formation the task efficiency can be significantly improved to achieve an expected formation coordinated path following has drawn intensive attention there are three methods of coordinated control according to the communication mode centralized control skjetne et al 2002 decentralized control liu et al 2018 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2013 and distributed control ihle et al 2007 almeida et al 2010 wang et al 2013 gu et al 2020 almeida et al 2012 bibuli et al 2014a wang et al 2014 xargay et al 2013 liu et al 2017 2016 in ihle et al 2007 a passivity based coordinated path following scheme with synchronized path variables was proposed where the path variables were derived from a feedback control law for the synchronization and position errors in almeida et al 2010 a cooperative problem under unknown current velocities and model uncertainties was investigated in wang et al 2013 cooperative path following of usvs under communication constraints was designed by using a fast learning technique in gu et al 2020 a cooperative path following scheme was proposed for usvs with a cyber attack in which a novel corrective law was integrated into the path update law to compensate for the attack in addition to the above control schemes there have been many other studies that set multiple parameterized paths simultaneously based on a synchronization approach almeida et al 2012 bibuli et al 2014a wang et al 2014 xargay et al 2013 however in practice we may not be able to plan multiple parameterized paths for multiple usvs due to the collision problem and the limited navigation environment a common solution is to steer multiple usvs to follow one curve in some specific circumstances while maintaining an equidistant formation along the path liu et al 2017 2016 another approach is the swarm based cooperative controller proposed in bibuli et al 2014b which combines path following and the potential energy function technique note that the aforementioned results dai et al 2018 ihle et al 2007 almeida et al 2010 wang et al 2013 gu et al 2020 almeida et al 2012 bibuli et al 2014a wang et al 2014 xargay et al 2013 liu et al 2017 2016 bibuli et al 2014b were based on bidirectional communication i e two neighbouring usvs can obtain information from each other in reality the cost and computer burden of communication are urgent problems to be solved to this end it is necessary to consider a coordinated path following strategy based on one way communication within the kinetic loop of an individual usv a significant challenge is that most usvs are underactuated i e there is no propulsion in the sway direction an effective technique is backstepping control yu et al 2019a gu et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zuo et al 2019 additionally sliding mode control smc elmokadem et al 2016 yu et al 2019b trajectory linearization control qiu et al 2020 mu et al 2019 and active disturbance rejection control yao et al 2020 xia et al 2018 techniques have been used extensively in usv kinetic modules moreover to achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness the finite time control technique has drawn tremendous attention and has been widely applied in recent years wang et al 2018 2019 liang et al 2020 jin 2016 du et al 2019 in wang et al 2018 a finite time line of sight los based path following scheme was proposed in wang et al 2019 a terminal sliding mode path following controller was presented where only the velocity and heading tracking errors converge to zero in finite time in liang et al 2020 a finite time multi velocity guidance coordinated path following problem was investigated in which the guidance signals could be tracked within finite time under physical restrictions via barrier lyapunov functions however the aforementioned methods only guarantee the finite time stability of some subsystems the other difficulties of the usv control system are mainly due to the fact that on the one hand model uncertainties are unknown in practice fuzzy logic systems wang et al 2017 hwang et al 2009 azimi and koofigar 2015 and neural networks gu et al 2020 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2017 peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 are usually introduced to estimate the unknown dynamics due to their strong approximation capability however the accuracy is highly dependent on the number of approximators furthermore the computational burden and the tuning difficulty of the parameters cannot be ignored the extended state observer eso was first presented in han 1995 and is a powerful tool to identify unknown dynamics on the other hand the input signals of usvs are restricted by the physical characteristics of the propeller and rudder i e the actuator saturation which can strongly influence the stability of systems several approaches have been proposed to attenuate or eliminate the saturation problem such as the hyperbolic tangent function liu et al 2016 mu et al 2020 anti windup system hua et al 2009 cui et al 2016 saturation compensator hu et al 2019 and auxiliary dynamic system qiu et al 2020 du et al 2016b 2020 zheng and sun 2016 however the finite time convergence of state tracking errors and auxiliary terms cannot be guaranteed with these methods motivated by the above discussion we propose a global finite time based coordinated path following scheme for multiple usvs along one curve with unknown velocities model uncertainties and actuator saturation an eso is introduced to extract the velocities and model uncertainties simultaneously by using the position information from the global navigation satellite system gnss in the guidance loop an los based finite time virtual velocity control law and a cooperative update law for the path variable are presented under directed topologies meanwhile the finite time control laws are developed by incorporating the auxiliary dynamic system into the sliding mode method for individual usv within the control loop the uniformly global finite time stability of the closed loop system is proved simulation studies are constructed to verify the availability of the developed scheme the salient features of this paper are as follows 1 compared with previous studies liu et al 2017 2016 where each usv must obtain information from its two neighbours the control scheme in this paper is based on directed topologies i e one way communication and can greatly reduce the communication burden while maintaining a formation pattern 2 in contrast to the common auxiliary system utilized to solve the saturation problem in qiu et al 2020 du et al 2016b 2020 zheng and sun 2016 where only uniformly ultimately boundedness of state tracking errors were ensured the auxiliary dynamic system designed in this paper can not only eliminate actuator saturation but also guarantee the finite time convergence of all state tracking errors 3 unlike yu et al 2019a elmokadem et al 2016 hwang et al 2009 cui et al 2016 the integral sliding surface with fractional power terms is utilized in this paper to ensure the finite time convergence of error signals on the sliding surface moreover in contrast to the existing works wang et al 2018 2019 liang et al 2020 where only the control subsystem or state observer can reach finite time stability the global finite time stability of the guidance control cascade system can be guaranteed via the developed method and the regulating time of the coordinated system is relatively short the remainder of this paper is structured as follows some necessary lemmas and explanations are presents in section 2 section 3 provides the cooperative guidance law section 4 focuses on the control module design for each usv in section 5 the stability of the closed loop system is analysed section 6 simulates the proposed scheme and section 7 provides the conclusion and directions for our research 2 preliminaries and problem formulation notation denote the euclidean norm λ is the

is bounded remark 1 the usv states x i y i ψ i can be precisely identified by gnss but velocity components information can only be obtained by using other instruments that are expensive and rarely installed in usv bevly et al 2001 assumption 1 is practical the inertia coefficient matrix m i can be obtained via hydrodynamic calculations or semi empirical methods skjetne et al 2005 assumption 2 is reasonable assumption 3 is a common assumption and is justified by the following analysis δ i contains ν i τ w i τ i and their derivatives the energy of external disturbances and the usv control input are limited and there is no signal mutation in addition the usv velocities are naturally bounded due to the characteristics of the actuator similar theories can be found in yu et al 2019a guo and zhao 2011 and gu et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the i th usv should be steered to follow the red reference path parameterized by x k ω y k ω with tangential angle ζ i k atan2 y k ω i x k ω i where x

denotes the vehicle course angle and β i φ i ψ i atan2 v i u i is the sideslip angle when the usv is driven to x i y i at a certain time the along and cross tracking errors between x k ω i y k ω i and x i y i can be expressed as 14 z i x z i y cos ζ i k sin ζ i k sin ζ i k cos ζ i k t x i x k ω i y i y k ω i for convenience we use x i k y i k for x k ω i y k ω i in this paper 2 4 control objective the objective consists of two tasks an individual task and a cooperative task the individual task is to force each usv to follow the reference path in a finite time i e lim t t 1 z i x σ x and lim t t 2 z i y σ y where t 1 and t 2 are bounded and σ x σ y are positive constants close to zero as illustrated in fig 2 the cooperative task is to steer n usvs along one curve with a desired formation pattern each usv maintains the same distance d to its neighbours including the virtual leader specifically to reach the formation pattern one can force the path variables to satisfy lim t t 3 ω i ω i 1 d σ ω with the positive constants t 3 σ ω and d where d denotes the fixed error of two adjacent path variables remark 2 note that d and d are significantly different in physics d represents the path variable error defined by people while d is the actual distance between two neighbours on the premise that the individual task can be completed one can directly tune the value of d to adjust the distance d 3 guidance and coordinated systems design as depicted in fig 3 the coordinated path following architecture primarily contains kinematic kinetic and identification modules where the kinematic module consists of guidance and coordinated systems and aims to generate the virtual control law u i d r i d ψ i d and the cooperative update law ω i the kinetic module computes control inputs τ i u τ i r to force the actual usv states to track the guidance signals and the identification module provides the unmeasured velocity information as well as the lumped uncertainties in this section u i d r i d ψ i d and ω i are proposed to guarantee the stability of the kinematic system 3 1 eso design to identify the unmeasured velocities ν i and the lumped uncertainties δ i the

path variable update law of the virtual leader to reduce the communication burden one way communication is considered in this paper that is the i th usv can only receive information from the i 1th usv take for example a group consisting of four usvs and one virtual leader the communication logic diagram is given in fig 4 where the control centre usually refers to the shore based system that

inevitably be disturbed when communication is interrupted let ω i u r and the formation pattern will be affected the cooperative algorithm will start to work again until communication is restored in this case the formation can remain unaffected by incorporating an adaptive corrective signal into the control law see gu et al 2020 let x 1 x 11 x n 1 t x 2 x 12 x n 2 t represent the kinematic and

the actuator can provide 4 1 surge control choose the sliding surface as 35 s i u t u ˆ i e t 0 t c i 1 u ˆ i e τ c i 2 sig γ 3 u ˆ i e τ d τ where c i 1 c i 2 0 and 0 γ 3 1 differentiating both sides

and ξ i p 0 is a small design constant and can be chosen as 0 01 remark 4 if there are no hard limiters or τ i u 0 will not exceed the limitation the stability of surge control subsystem can be guaranteed with the input being τ i u 0 via lyapunov method when δ τ i u 0 τ i u 0 can still ensure the system stability but the actual input signal becomes τ i u obviously it will bring degraded performance and even instability of the control system when adding δ τ i u to τ i u 0 therefore the additional term c i u ξ i u is included in command input to ensure the system stability the update law of ξ i u is to ensure the finite time stability of s i u and ξ i u remark 5 note that ξ i p can avoid the singularity of system 38 if ξ i u ξ i p it means that there is no saturation i e δ τ i u 0 but the state ξ i u 0 cannot be excited when the next δ τ i u 0 occurs that is ξ i u will always be zero if there is no external excitation therefore an excitation ξ i u ξ i q must be set when δ τ i u

incorporated into the system the additional terms can make the state tracking errors converge to zero in a finite time theorem 2 the usv surge velocity u i can track the guidance signal u i d in a

ξ i u ξ i p it means that there is no saturation in the system and thus ξ i u 0 ξ i u 0 and δ τ i u 0 the lfc becomes v i 2 1 2 s i u 2 then the derivative of v i 2 is 42 v i 2 s i u s i u k i 6 s i u γ 3 1 2 γ 3 1 2 k i 6 v i 2 γ 3 1 2 from 41 and 42 it renders that s i u can converge to zero in a finite time t i γ 3 satisfies 43 t i γ 3 max 2 1 γ 3 2 v i 2 1 γ 3 2 0 μ i 2 1 γ 3 2 1 γ 3 2 v i 2 1

stability of the closed loop system to facilitate the stability analysis of the closed loop system the following assumption is introduced assumption 4 considering that the estimates of ν i and δ i can be identified quickly we suppose ν ˆ i ν i and δ ˆ i δ i remark 6 the eso 15 is based on finite time theory and the settling time is very short in addition compared with the guidance and control systems the estimation errors do not have an obvious impact on the entire system therefore assumption 4 is reasonable nevertheless it is not quite rigorous that we assume the settling time t i γ 1 0 we will take ν i and δ i into account and devote attention to the finite time stability of the three subsystems including the eso in our future work the stability of subsystem x i 2 f 2 t x i 2 has

theorems 1 3 next the satisfiability of conditions 3 4 is verified 1 select the lfc v 1 1 2 x 1 2 under assumption 4 we have 54 v 1 t x 1 x 1 x 1 v 1 x 1 f t x 1 t x 1 λ μ 1 x 1 1 γ 2 then there

addition the eso 15 and the normal auxiliary dynamic system presented in zheng and sun 2016 are applied in the nca and all error signals are ensured to be uniformly ultimately bounded of nca method the usvs are driven to follow a desired path parameterized by x k 200 cos 0 01 ω 200 y k 200 sin 0 01 ω set the initial positions of the four usvs as x 1 0 y 1 0 ψ 1 0 60 m 0 m 0 rad x 2 0 y 2 0 ψ 2 0

the external disturbances as τ i w u 0 1 cos 0 05 t 0 15 sin 0 03 t τ i w r 0 15 sin 0 05 t the simulation results are shown in figs 5 15 figs 5 6 depict the coordinated path following performance of the ftca and nca methods and figs 7 8 illustrate the position tracking errors as illustrated in these four figures the proposed ftca method and the nca method can both force the usvs to follow the reference path and reach the desired formation pattern but the proposed ftc method performs best due to its fast transient response that is the convergence time of z i y is much shorter than that of the nca method in addition there is no obvious oscillation in the steady periods of z i x and z i y the path variable curves are displayed in figs 9 10 in which the four variables can achieve synergy with the virtual leader the settling time needed to reach the final synergy is much longer for the nca method which further shows that the desired formation pattern has not yet been achieved yet when t 300 s in fig 6 figs 11 12 indicate that the usv states can track the guidance signals within a short time via the sliding mode technique in the control subsystem the commanded surge velocities u i d are all in an appropriate range and converge to a constant u i c within approximately 100 s where u i c is related to the update speed of the path variables and u i c u i p u r figs 13 14 indicate that the unmeasured velocities and the lumped uncertainties can be precisely and quickly extracted using the eso of usv 4 the estimated effect of the other three usvs are similar to that of the fourth usv so these estimation curves of usv 1 3 are omitted for space finally the control input signals are depicted in fig 15 in which τ i u and τ i r are restricted in 0 n 2 n and 5 nm 5 nm respectively and the developed auxiliary dynamic systems can guarantee the stability of the entire system 7 conclusions this paper presents a finite time based coordinated path following scheme for multiple usvs with directed topologies first the eso accurately identifies the unmeasured velocities as well as the uncertainties second the finite time los cooperative guidance law can provide proper guidance signals including the update law for the path variables then the control subsystem can force the usv states to track the reference signals quickly and accurately meanwhile the saturation problem can be handled by the proposed auxiliary dynamic systems the closed loop system is verified to be ugfts and all error signals converge to the origin within a finite time finally the availability and superiority of the proposed method are confirmed in our future work we will learn from wang et al 2021 and chen et al 2020 to build the experimental platform the experiment should be carried out to

20311,this paper focuses on the problem of coordinated path following for underactuated unmanned surface vehicles usvs based on distributed control with directed topologies first a finite time extended state observer is presented to estimate the velocities and model uncertainties simultaneously second a finite time line of sight based guidance law is proposed for individual usv in kinematic loop to track the desired path specifically a cooperative update law for the path variable is designed under one way communication such that all usvs maintain the same distance from each other along one curve following a virtual leader then a control subsystem is proposed by combining a novel auxiliary dynamic system and sliding mode technique for each vehicle at the kinetic level where the auxiliary dynamic system is developed to ensure the finite time stability of the entire system while to solve saturation problem the closed loop system is verified to be uniformly global finite time stable finally the numerical simulations substantiates the feasibility of the proposed coordinated path following strategy graphical abstract keywords coordinated path following sliding mode finite time control actuator saturation 1 introduction with the rapid development of the economy land resources are increasingly scarce while the ocean which accounts for two thirds of the earth s surface is rich in minerals and biological resources melikoglu 2018 the ocean is a strategic resource base for human survival and sustainable development in the future therefore much effort has been made by scholars to handle the problem of unmanned surface vehicles usvs ranging from dynamic positioning du et al 2016a bidikli et al 2016 and path following yu et al 2019a borhaug et al 2008 fossen and lekkas 2017 miao and wang 2017 to trajectory tracking blondel et al 2020 elmokadem et al 2016 as one of the basic motion control strategies path following aims to force an object to track a parameterized path without time information although path following is a mature technology the operational capacity of a single usv is limited and the operation time of a single usv is relatively short due to energy limitations if multiple usvs work together in a certain formation the task efficiency can be significantly improved to achieve an expected formation coordinated path following has drawn intensive attention there are three methods of coordinated control according to the communication mode centralized control skjetne et al 2002 decentralized control liu et al 2018 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2013 and distributed control ihle et al 2007 almeida et al 2010 wang et al 2013 gu et al 2020 almeida et al 2012 bibuli et al 2014a wang et al 2014 xargay et al 2013 liu et al 2017 2016 in ihle et al 2007 a passivity based coordinated path following scheme with synchronized path variables was proposed where the path variables were derived from a feedback control law for the synchronization and position errors in almeida et al 2010 a cooperative problem under unknown current velocities and model uncertainties was investigated in wang et al 2013 cooperative path following of usvs under communication constraints was designed by using a fast learning technique in gu et al 2020 a cooperative path following scheme was proposed for usvs with a cyber attack in which a novel corrective law was integrated into the path update law to compensate for the attack in addition to the above control schemes there have been many other studies that set multiple parameterized paths simultaneously based on a synchronization approach almeida et al 2012 bibuli et al 2014a wang et al 2014 xargay et al 2013 however in practice we may not be able to plan multiple parameterized paths for multiple usvs due to the collision problem and the limited navigation environment a common solution is to steer multiple usvs to follow one curve in some specific circumstances while maintaining an equidistant formation along the path liu et al 2017 2016 another approach is the swarm based cooperative controller proposed in bibuli et al 2014b which combines path following and the potential energy function technique note that the aforementioned results dai et al 2018 ihle et al 2007 almeida et al 2010 wang et al 2013 gu et al 2020 almeida et al 2012 bibuli et al 2014a wang et al 2014 xargay et al 2013 liu et al 2017 2016 bibuli et al 2014b were based on bidirectional communication i e two neighbouring usvs can obtain information from each other in reality the cost and computer burden of communication are urgent problems to be solved to this end it is necessary to consider a coordinated path following strategy based on one way communication within the kinetic loop of an individual usv a significant challenge is that most usvs are underactuated i e there is no propulsion in the sway direction an effective technique is backstepping control yu et al 2019a gu et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zuo et al 2019 additionally sliding mode control smc elmokadem et al 2016 yu et al 2019b trajectory linearization control qiu et al 2020 mu et al 2019 and active disturbance rejection control yao et al 2020 xia et al 2018 techniques have been used extensively in usv kinetic modules moreover to achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness the finite time control technique has drawn tremendous attention and has been widely applied in recent years wang et al 2018 2019 liang et al 2020 jin 2016 du et al 2019 in wang et al 2018 a finite time line of sight los based path following scheme was proposed in wang et al 2019 a terminal sliding mode path following controller was presented where only the velocity and heading tracking errors converge to zero in finite time in liang et al 2020 a finite time multi velocity guidance coordinated path following problem was investigated in which the guidance signals could be tracked within finite time under physical restrictions via barrier lyapunov functions however the aforementioned methods only guarantee the finite time stability of some subsystems the other difficulties of the usv control system are mainly due to the fact that on the one hand model uncertainties are unknown in practice fuzzy logic systems wang et al 2017 hwang et al 2009 azimi and koofigar 2015 and neural networks gu et al 2020 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2017 peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 are usually introduced to estimate the unknown dynamics due to their strong approximation capability however the accuracy is highly dependent on the number of approximators furthermore the computational burden and the tuning difficulty of the parameters cannot be ignored the extended state observer eso was first presented in han 1995 and is a powerful tool to identify unknown dynamics on the other hand the input signals of usvs are restricted by the physical characteristics of the propeller and rudder i e the actuator saturation which can strongly influence the stability of systems several approaches have been proposed to attenuate or eliminate the saturation problem such as the hyperbolic tangent function liu et al 2016 mu et al 2020 anti windup system hua et al 2009 cui et al 2016 saturation compensator hu et al 2019 and auxiliary dynamic system qiu et al 2020 du et al 2016b 2020 zheng and sun 2016 however the finite time convergence of state tracking errors and auxiliary terms cannot be guaranteed with these methods motivated by the above discussion we propose a global finite time based coordinated path following scheme for multiple usvs along one curve with unknown velocities model uncertainties and actuator saturation an eso is introduced to extract the velocities and model uncertainties simultaneously by using the position information from the global navigation satellite system gnss in the guidance loop an los based finite time virtual velocity control law and a cooperative update law for the path variable are presented under directed topologies meanwhile the finite time control laws are developed by incorporating the auxiliary dynamic system into the sliding mode method for individual usv within the control loop the uniformly global finite time stability of the closed loop system is proved simulation studies are constructed to verify the availability of the developed scheme the salient features of this paper are as follows 1 compared with previous studies liu et al 2017 2016 where each usv must obtain information from its two neighbours the control scheme in this paper is based on directed topologies i e one way communication and can greatly reduce the communication burden while maintaining a formation pattern 2 in contrast to the common auxiliary system utilized to solve the saturation problem in qiu et al 2020 du et al 2016b 2020 zheng and sun 2016 where only uniformly ultimately boundedness of state tracking errors were ensured the auxiliary dynamic system designed in this paper can not only eliminate actuator saturation but also guarantee the finite time convergence of all state tracking errors 3 unlike yu et al 2019a elmokadem et al 2016 hwang et al 2009 cui et al 2016 the integral sliding surface with fractional power terms is utilized in this paper to ensure the finite time convergence of error signals on the sliding surface moreover in contrast to the existing works wang et al 2018 2019 liang et al 2020 where only the control subsystem or state observer can reach finite time stability the global finite time stability of the guidance control cascade system can be guaranteed via the developed method and the regulating time of the coordinated system is relatively short the remainder of this paper is structured as follows some necessary lemmas and explanations are presents in section 2 section 3 provides the cooperative guidance law section 4 focuses on the control module design for each usv in section 5 the stability of the closed loop system is analysed section 6 simulates the proposed scheme and section 7 provides the conclusion and directions for our research 2 preliminaries and problem formulation notation denote the euclidean norm λ is the

communication structure between the usvs can be described by g v e where v n 1 n n denotes the node set and each point corresponds to a single usv the edge set e n i n j v v is an unordered pair set of two nodes and n i n j represents the communication between i and j the adjacency matrix of graph a a i j r n n satisfies 1 a i j 1 if n j n i e 0 else the laplacian matrix also called admittance matrix is an important tool used in graph theory and is defined as l d a ceragioli et al 2011 li 2018 where d diag d 1 d n is the degree matrix with d i j 1 n a i j being the number of edges associated with node n i in graph g the laplacian matrix can be utilized to find much useful information of a graph and can be used to identify the number of spanning trees for a specific graph 2 2

kinematic and 3 degree kinetic model of the i th usv can be formulated as 11 x i u i cos ψ i v i sin ψ i y i u i sin ψ i v i cos ψ i ψ i r i and 12 m i 11 u i m i 22 v i r i d i 11 u i k 2 3 d i u k u

where x i y i and ψ i denote the usv position and attitude in earth fixed frame i u i v i and r i are the surge sway velocity and yaw rate respectively in body fixed frame b the terms m i 11 m i 22 m

as 13 η i r ψ i ν i ν i δ i m 1 τ i assumption 1 the usv position and yaw angle information can be obtained while the velocity components u i and v i and the yaw rate r i are unmeasurable assumption 2 the usv inertia matrix m i is known but the lumped dynamics f i including internal dynamics and external disturbances are unknown assumption 3 the lumped uncertainty vector δ i satisfies δ i δ where δ is bounded remark 1 the usv states x i y i ψ i can be precisely identified by gnss but velocity components information can only be obtained by using other instruments that are expensive and rarely installed in usv bevly et al 2001 assumption 1 is practical the inertia coefficient matrix m i can be obtained via hydrodynamic calculations or semi empirical methods skjetne et al 2005 assumption 2 is reasonable assumption 3 is a common assumption and is justified by the following analysis δ i contains ν i τ w i τ i and their derivatives the energy of external disturbances and the usv control input are limited and there is no signal mutation in addition the usv velocities are naturally bounded due to the characteristics of the actuator similar theories can be found in yu et al 2019a guo and zhao 2011 and gu et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the i th usv should be steered to follow the red reference path parameterized by x k ω y k ω with tangential angle ζ i k atan2 y k ω i x k ω i where x k ω i x k ω i ω i and y k ω i y k ω i ω i the x k y k frame is established on the reference path and the unit vector of x k and y k are cos ζ i k sin ζ i k t and sin ζ i k cos ζ i k t respectively φ i denotes the vehicle course angle and β i φ i ψ i atan2 v i u i is the sideslip angle when the usv is driven to x i y i at a certain time the along and cross tracking errors between x k ω i y k ω i and x i y i can be expressed as 14 z i x z i y cos ζ i k sin ζ i k sin ζ i k cos ζ i k t x i x k ω i y i y k ω i for convenience we use x i k y i k for x k ω i y k ω i in this paper 2 4 control objective the objective consists of two tasks an individual task and a cooperative task the individual task is to force each usv to follow the reference path in a finite time i e lim t t 1 z i x σ x and lim t t 2 z i y σ y where t 1 and t 2 are bounded and σ x σ y are positive constants close to zero as illustrated in fig 2 the cooperative task is to steer n usvs along one curve with a desired formation pattern each usv maintains the same distance d to its neighbours including the virtual leader specifically to reach the formation pattern one can force the path variables to satisfy lim t t 3 ω i ω i 1 d σ ω with the positive constants t 3 σ ω and d where d denotes the fixed error of two adjacent path variables remark 2 note that d and d are significantly different in physics d represents the path variable error defined by people while d is the actual distance between two neighbours on the premise that the individual task can be completed one can directly tune the value of d to adjust the distance d 3 guidance and coordinated systems design as depicted in fig 3 the coordinated path following architecture primarily contains kinematic kinetic and identification modules where the kinematic module consists of guidance and coordinated systems and aims to generate the virtual control law u i d r i d ψ i d and the cooperative update law ω i the kinetic module computes control inputs τ i u τ i r to force the actual usv states to track the guidance signals and the identification module provides the unmeasured velocity information as well as the lumped uncertainties in this section u i d r i d ψ i d and ω i are proposed to guarantee the stability of the kinematic system 3 1 eso design to identify the unmeasured velocities ν i and the lumped uncertainties δ i the

guidance law the time derivative of z i x and z i y can be determined from 14 as 16 z i x x i cos ζ i k y i sin ζ i k x i k cos ζ i k y i k sin ζ i k ζ i k x i x i k sin ζ i k y i y i k cos ζ i k z i

ω i u r ϖ i where u i p x i k 2 y i k 2 u r denotes the reference speed and ϖ i is a variable to be designed substituting 11 into 16 yields 17 z i x u i cos ψ i ζ i k v i sin ψ i ζ i k ζ i k z i y u i p u r ϖ i z i y u i sin ψ i ζ i k v i cos ψ i ζ i k ζ i k z i x define the attitude tracking error ψ i e ψ i ψ i d where ψ i d is the guidance yaw angle calculated from the los method then the position error dynamics can be rewritten as 18 z i x u i 2 u i sin 2 ψ i ζ i k 2 v i sin ψ i ζ i k ζ i k z i y u i p u r ϖ i z i y u i sin ψ i d β i ζ i k u i γ i ζ i k z i x ψ i e r i ψ i d where γ i

sig γ 2 ψ i e z i y u ˆ i γ i ψ i e ψ i d ψ i d ζ i k β i atan z i y α i δ i where k i 2 k i 3 γ 2 are positive design parameters and 0 γ 2 1 α i sig γ 2 z i y z i y u ˆ i u ˆ i 2 v ˆ i 2 substituting 19 into 18 yields 20 z i x k i 2 sig γ 2 z i x ζ i k z i y u i p ϖ i 2 u i sin 2 ψ i ζ i k 2 v i sin ψ i ζ i k u i e z i y u i sig γ 2 z i y u i γ i ζ i k z i x ψ i e k i 3 sig γ 2 ψ i e z i y u ˆ i γ

zero 3 3 coordinated system design suppose that the usvs are dominated by a virtual leader which is directly controlled by a shore based system and marked as n 1 let the reference speed u r be the path variable update law of the virtual leader to reduce the communication burden one way communication is considered in this paper that is the i th usv can only receive information from the i 1th usv take for example a group consisting of four usvs and one virtual leader the communication logic diagram is given in fig 4 where the control centre usually refers to the shore based system that directly sends control instructions let the graph g describe the communication logic according to section 2 1 l can be obtained as follows 22 l 5 5 l f l v 0 1 4 0 1 1 where 23 l f 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0

to the particularity of one way communication 25 can be rewritten as 26 e i ϖ i ϖ i 1 note that ϖ i 1 is the design variable of the i 1th usv and ϖ n 1 0 design the update law ϖ i as follows 27 ϖ i k

where θ i z i x u i p k i 4 sig γ 2 e i ϖ i 1 k i 5 0 and ɛ is a very small positive design parameter remark 3 the continuous communication mode is considered in this paper but this process will inevitably be disturbed when communication is interrupted let ω i u r and the formation pattern will be affected the cooperative algorithm will start to work again until communication is restored in this case the formation can remain unaffected by incorporating an adaptive corrective signal into the control law see gu et al 2020 let x 1 x 11 x n 1 t x 2 x 12 x n 2 t represent the kinematic and

guaranteed with the input being τ i u 0 via lyapunov method when δ τ i u 0 τ i u 0 can still ensure the system stability but the actual input signal becomes τ i u obviously it will bring degraded performance and even instability of the control system when adding δ τ i u to τ i u 0 therefore the additional term c i u ξ i u is included in command input to ensure the system stability the update law of ξ i u is to ensure the finite time stability of s i u and ξ i u remark 5 note that ξ i p can avoid the singularity of system 38 if ξ i u ξ i p it means that there is no saturation i e δ τ i u 0 but the state ξ i u 0 cannot be excited when the next δ τ i u 0 occurs that is ξ i u will always be zero if there is no external excitation therefore an excitation ξ i u ξ i q must be set when δ τ i u

stability of the closed loop system to facilitate the stability analysis of the closed loop system the following assumption is introduced assumption 4 considering that the estimates of ν i and δ i can be identified quickly we suppose ν ˆ i ν i and δ ˆ i δ i remark 6 the eso 15 is based on finite time theory and the settling time is very short in addition compared with the guidance and control systems the estimation errors do not have an obvious impact on the entire system therefore assumption 4 is reasonable nevertheless it is not quite rigorous that we assume the settling time t i γ 1 0 we will take ν i and δ i into account and devote attention to the finite time stability of the three subsystems including the eso in our future work the stability of subsystem x i 2 f 2 t x i 2 has

addition the eso 15 and the normal auxiliary dynamic system presented in zheng and sun 2016 are applied in the nca and all error signals are ensured to be uniformly ultimately bounded of nca method the usvs are driven to follow a desired path parameterized by x k 200 cos 0 01 ω 200 y k 200 sin 0 01 ω set the initial positions of the four usvs as x 1 0 y 1 0 ψ 1 0 60 m 0 m 0 rad x 2 0 y 2 0 ψ 2 0

the external disturbances as τ i w u 0 1 cos 0 05 t 0 15 sin 0 03 t τ i w r 0 15 sin 0 05 t the simulation results are shown in figs 5 15 figs 5 6 depict the coordinated path following performance of the ftca and nca methods and figs 7 8 illustrate the position tracking errors as illustrated in these four figures the proposed ftca method and the nca method can both force the usvs to follow the reference path and reach the desired formation pattern but the proposed ftc method performs best due to its fast transient response that is the convergence time of z i y is much shorter than that of the nca method in addition there is no obvious oscillation in the steady periods of z i x and z i y the path variable curves are displayed in figs 9 10 in which the four variables can achieve synergy with the virtual leader the settling time needed to reach the final synergy is much longer for the nca method which further shows that the desired formation pattern has not yet been achieved yet when t 300 s in fig 6 figs 11 12 indicate that the usv states can track the guidance signals within a short time via the sliding mode technique in the control subsystem the commanded surge velocities u i d are all in an appropriate range and converge to a constant u i c within approximately 100 s where u i c is related to the update speed of the path variables and u i c u i p u r figs 13 14 indicate that the unmeasured velocities and the lumped uncertainties can be precisely and quickly extracted using the eso of usv 4 the estimated effect of the other three usvs are similar to that of the fourth usv so these estimation curves of usv 1 3 are omitted for space finally the control input signals are depicted in fig 15 in which τ i u and τ i r are restricted in 0 n 2 n and 5 nm 5 nm respectively and the developed auxiliary dynamic systems can guarantee the stability of the entire system 7 conclusions this paper presents a finite time based coordinated path following scheme for multiple usvs with directed topologies first the eso accurately identifies the unmeasured velocities as well as the uncertainties second the finite time los cooperative guidance law can provide proper guidance signals including the update law for the path variables then the control subsystem can force the usv states to track the reference signals quickly and accurately meanwhile the saturation problem can be handled by the proposed auxiliary dynamic systems the closed loop system is verified to be ugfts and all error signals converge to the origin within a finite time finally the availability and superiority of the proposed method are confirmed in our future work we will learn from wang et al 2021 and chen et al 2020 to build the experimental platform the experiment should be carried out to

20312,wave forces severely damage low lying coastal bridges during hurricanes in this study a model for analyzing hydrodynamic wave forces acting on a bridge superstructure with a box girder behind a trench or breakwater was developed first the boundary value problem was defined based on necessary assumptions and simplifications next an analytical solution of wave forces on the bridge superstructure was obtained using the potential flow theory and the eigenfunction matching method the validity and convergence of the analytical model were verified against the results of an experimental hydrodynamic study and a limiting case with the proposed method the effects of the trench and breakwater on the wave loads were investigated finally a parametric analysis was conducted to reveal the hydrodynamic characteristics that influenced the wave bridge interaction the parametric study shows that both the trench and breakwater are useful in mitigating wave forces a specialized design of the wave structure system configuration is required to reduce the wave forces acting on bridge decks effectively keywords wave forces coastal bridges box girder trench breakwater analytical solution 1 introduction in 2004 2005 hurricane generated waves damaged many coastal bridges along the gulf of mexico most of those damaged bridges were low lying and had simply supported spans without adequate connections between the superstructure and the bent caps the failure of coastal bridges leads to significant economic losses and delays the rescue and reconstruction of hurricane stricken areas after the catastrophic hurricane disasters in 2004 and 2005 two wave force estimation methods were developed douglass et al 2006 proposed an empirical approach for wave forces on bridge superstructures based on the model of wave loads on decks mcconnell et al 2004 the douglass method adopts the equivalent hydrostatic pressure as a reference for calculating the loads on the bridge superstructure and it is convenient and straightforward without the need for complex calculations subsequently the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto 2008 published a guideline for estimating the wave forces acting on coastal bridges the aashto guideline was developed using a physics based method based on a 1 8 scale model test performed by marin 2010 both methods mentioned above can reliably predict the wave loads on bridge superstructures some limitations even exist for submerged conditions guo et al 2015b jin and meng 2011 xu et al 2016 several researchers have investigated the wave forces on bridge superstructures owing to their complex nature hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2016 qeshta et al 2019 bradner et al 2011 and istrati et al 2018 used a facility at the oregon state university to analyze the wave forces on bridge decks at a 1 5 scale generated by regular and unbroken broken solitary waves respectively the wave forces on coastal bridges have also been experimentally investigated using physical models at different scales cuomo et al 2009 fang et al 2019 guo et al 2015b hayatdavoodi et al 2014 huang et al 2018b mcpherson 2008 the wave forces on an elevated bridge superstructure contain a slowly varying and impulsive component as an alternative approach for assessing the wave structure interaction computational fluid dynamics cfd provides further details about the fluid field during wave impact on the bridge superstructure huang and xiao 2009 simulated the hurricane generated waves interacting with the escambia bay bridge deck using incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and k ε equations the effect of the submersion depth on the wave lift force was analyzed jin and meng 2011 used commercial cfd software flow 3d to compute the wave forces on a submerged bridge deck and compared the numerical results with the results calculated using a potential flow model furthermore the effects of the deck skewness winter et al 2018 twin bridge deck xu et al 2016 lateral restraints xu and cai 2017 and coexisting current huang et al 2018a on wave forces have been evaluated based on the stormwater level hurricane waves acting on bridge superstructures can be categorized into elevated semi submerged and submerged scenarios the submerged scenario occurs when the elevation of the stormwater level is higher than the bottom of the bridge deck this case was observed to be the general condition of the us 90 bridge across biloxi bay damaged during hurricane katrina chen et al 2009 for the submerged scenario analytical methods are comparatively more efficient than the hydrodynamic experiment and numerical simulation approaches hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015a applied the green naghdi theory and calculated the forces on a submerged thin slab induced by solitary and cnoidal waves hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015b guo et al 2015a evaluated the wave forces on a submerged bridge deck with a t girder using the potential flow theory and developed a simple method for wave force estimation based on the analytical results oblique wave forces on a submerged bridge deck were analyzed by fang et al 2018 moreover the potential flow theory is regularly employed to investigate the interaction between gravity waves and different types of structures such as the fixed rectangular obstacle mei and black 1969 submerged platform breakwater cheong et al 1996 and floating bridge kaligatla and sahoo 2019 for the submerged scenario the potential flow method may be applied to assess the wave forces on bridge superstructures as the wave structure interaction problem is similar to that of the rectangular obstacle or breakwater this study focuses on the wave forces on bridge superstructures with a box girder behind a trench or breakwater an analytical solution for estimating the wave force was obtained based on the potential flow theory the trench and breakwater effects on the wave forces were examined using the validated analytical model the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows first the boundary value problem is defined based on certain assumptions and simplifications next the mathematical formula is solved using the eigenfunction matching method subsequently the analytical model is validated with the findings of a previous experimental hydrodynamic study and limiting cases finally the effects of the trench and breakwater on the wave forces were compared and analyzed parametrically and the concluding remarks are provided 2 analytical formulation and solution 2 1 problem definition most coastal bridges built in recent years have box girders to achieve high flexural and torsional stiffness a typical bridge superstructure consists of a slab and a box girder in this study the wave forces on the semisubmerged box girder type bridge decks behind a trench or breakwater were simplified as a boundary value problem fig 1 the following assumptions are made to simplify the problem 1 the fluid undergoes inviscid incompressible and irrotational flow which makes it a potential flow 2 the box girder is a rectangular section and the inclinations of the webs are neglected 3 the bridge superstructure is a rigid body and fixed on the cap beam 4 the monochromatic incident waves are perpendicular to the bridge deck 5 the bridge and the trench or breakwater are infinitely long the effects of the dynamic structural properties on the wave forces are neglected in this study chen et al 2016 reported that a moving bridge superstructure is subjected to minor wave forces wave forces reach their maximum values when the waves are propagated perpendicular to the superstructure fang et al 2018 based on the above assumptions the proposed model results are conservative from the perspective of engineering practice the wave topography structure system can be simplified to a two dimensional problem a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is defined with the origin coinciding with the centerline of the bridge deck the x axis follows the wave propagation direction lying on the still water level whereas the z axis follows the upward direction depending on the boundary conditions the entire fluid domain can be divided into seven separate regions fig 1 the inlet region ω 1 region ω 2 over the trench or breakwater transitive region ω 3 structure covered regions ω 4 6 and outlet region ω 7 the spatial component φ x z of the velocity potential φ x z t stratifies the governing continuous

as displayed in eqs 14 17 are the eigenfunctions in the vertical direction for each region and k n γ n τ n and ν n are the corresponding eigenvalues the velocity potentials φ 1 and φ 7 consist of progressive and evanescent modes in eq 7 the first item represents the indecent potential the first terms of the infinite series in eqs 7 and 13 are the reflected and transmitted waves respectively for the same boundary conditions regions ω 1 ω 3 and ω 7 share vertical eigenfunctions as follows 14 z n z 2 cosh k 0 h z h g sinh 2 k 0 h ω 2 n 0 2 cos k n h z h g sin 2 k n h ω 2 n 1 2 where h is the water depth fig 1 k 0 and k n n 1 2 are the positive real root and the imaginary part of purely imaginary roots of the dispersion equation ω 2 g k tanh k h 0 in k respectively similarly the vertical eigenfunctions for region ω 2 are obtained using eq 15 15 g n z 2 cosh γ 0 h 2 z h 2 g sinh 2 γ 0 h 2 ω 2 n 0 2 cos γ n h 2 z h 2 g sin 2 γ n h 2 ω 2 n 1 2 where h 2 is the water depth over the trench or breakwater and it is equal to h h 1 and h h 1 for the trench and breakwater respectively eigenvalues k 0 and k n n 1 2 are the positive real root and the imaginary part of purely imaginary roots of the dispersion equation ω 2 g γ tanh γ h 2 0 in γ respectively the vertical eigenfunctions for regions ω 4 ω 5 and ω 6 are defined as follows 16 p n z 1 h d 1 n 0 2 cos τ n z h h d 1 n 1 2 n 0 1 2 17 v n z 1 h d 2 n 0 2 cos ν n z h h d 2 n 1 2 n 0 1 2 where eigenvalues τ n and ν n can be calculated using τ n n π h d 1 for n 0 1 2 and ν n n π h d 2 for n 0 1 2 respectively d 1 and d 2 are the submergence parameters of the bridge deck and box girder respectively fig 1 the vertical eigenfunctions expressed in eqs 14 17 are orthogonal to each other in the water depth of each

3 m o m o 0 5 ρ g a w 3 2 3 validation and limiting case 3 1 validation zhang et al 2020 conducted a series of tests on box girder type bridge decks to analyze the wave forces on the bridges considering coexisting currents the bridge model consisted of a slab and a box girder fig 2 a zhang et al 2020 determined the hydrodynamic loads on the bridge deck under regular waves the wave periods of the incident waves were 1 31 1 68 and 2 05 s and the wave height changed from 0 033 to 0 133 m in intervals of 0 033 m the wave loads on the bridge deck were measured using a three dimensional load cell at a sample rate of 50 hz during the experimental tests five different submergence scenarios were investigated considering the effect of the current for more details of the experiment the readers can refer to zhang et al 2020 for a constant water depth of 0 713 m the submerged case was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model without loss of generality the web of the box girder and the bottom of the slab were simplified as the vertical and horizontal parts respectively the schematic of the simplified boundary value problem is shown in fig 2 b in the analytical procedure the depth of the trench h 1 was set as a minimal value for example 0 001 m to match the flat bottom of the wave flume employed by zhang et al 2020 fig 3 shows the comparison between the calculated and measured wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck each wave trial was repeated three times during the experiment to minimize accidental errors zhang et al 2020 the maximum and minimum values of the wave forces in both the horizontal and vertical directions were employed for the first several wave cycles to validate the proposed analytical model in fig 3 kb is the dimensionless wavenumber which is equal to wavenumber k multiplied by the half width of the bridge deck b fig 1 and it is related to the wave period of the incident waves the solid blue line represents the calculated results and the scatter points are the measured results obtained by zhang et al 2020 the maximum horizontal wave force rapidly increased with the wavenumber in the range of 0 kb 0 2 fig 3 a for kb 0 2 the maximum horizontal wave force first slowly increased and decreased slightly after peaking at kb 0 6 the measured maximum horizontal wave force exhibited a similar trend as kb comparatively the maximum vertical wave force increased sharply and then declined continuously after peaking at approximately kb 0 2 fig 3 b the bridge deck resists the minimum wave forces during the wave trough passing by the structure the comparison between the calculated and measured minimum wave forces are shown in fig 3 c and d by comparing the calculated and measured results it was concluded that the proposed model could yield an acceptable estimation of the wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck it should be noted that the measured results were extracted from several wave trials with different wave heights significant oscillations were observed for the measured wave forces which could not be reflected using the proposed analytical model during the experiment the wave overtopped and exerted a downward force on the bridge deck reducing the measured upward vertical forces the proposed model was developed based on the linear potential theory in which the wave forces are assumed to have a linear relationship with the wave amplitude however nonlinear effects such as wave overtopping and air trapping occur in experiments for extended wave height cases which cannot be reflected using the proposed model overall the proposed analytical model could acceptably calculate the wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck as only positive wave forces were considered in this study 3 2 limiting case the wave structure system depicted in fig 1 converts to wave forces on rectangular obstacles in waters assuming that d 2 d 1 and h 1 0 waves acting on fixed rectangular obstacles in the water is a classical hydrodynamic problem investigated extensively mei and black 1969 investigated the scattering of surface waves by rectangular obstacles in the water of finite depth by splitting the velocity potential into symmetric and asymmetric parts fig 4 shows a comparison of the hydrodynamic coefficients between the solutions obtained in this study and mei and black 1969 the reflection coefficient c r increased from 0 0 to 1 0 as kb varied from 0 to 2 4 while the transmission coefficient c t decreased from 1 0 to approximately 0 0 the reflection and transmission coefficients must satisfy c r 2 c t 2 1 to ensure the conservation of wave energy within the fluid domains the results obtained using the proposed model were consistent with those of mei and black 1969 indicating that the proposed model with complex structural boundary and bottom topography could converge to the case of a simply fixed box 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between trench and breakwater cases the wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck were determined for three scenarios using the validated analytical model behind a trench behind a breakwater and over a flat bottom fig 5 shows the dimensionless wave forces and hydrodynamic coefficients for the three different scenarios the depth of the trench was h 2 h 0 13 which was the same as the height of the breakwater the flat bottom case was simulated by setting h 2 to a minimal value the horizontal wave force on the bridge superstructure over the flat bottom was similar to that behind a trench fig 5 a the only slight difference with the horizontal force was observed for kb 0 1 between the flat bottom and the trench scenarios for the breakwater case the horizontal force showed a similar tendency in the wavenumber with the other two cases except for significant oscillations the breakwater decreased the horizontal force for an incident wave with wavenumbers approximately 0 7 and 1 4 but enlarge horizontal forces for wavenumbers around 1 0 and 1 9 the calculated values of the vertical forces on the bridge superstructure are shown in fig 5 b the f z rapidly increased with kb and then steadily decreased after attaining the maximum value the maximum value of f z reached 0 970 when kb was approximately 0 07 for the flat bottom scenario for the trench and breakwater scenarios the maximum f z values reached 0 896 and 0 849 respectively which correspondingly occurred at kb values of approximately 0 17 and 0 35 the trench and breakwater could reduce the maximum wave force by 7 6 and 12 5 respectively moreover fluctuations were observed in the declining stage of f z for the breakwater scenario it can be concluded that a trench and a breakwater help mitigate vertical forces acting on bridge superstructures fig 5 c shows the variation in kb with the overturning moment m o acting on the bridge superstructure m o initially increased and then decreased with kb and was seldom influenced by the topography for long waves with kb 0 4 similar to f x and f z the appearance of breakwater resulted in fluctuations in m o the effect of bottom undulation was also measured in terms of hydrodynamic coefficients of the wave structure system fig 5 d 4 2 bridge superstructure behind a trench in this subsection the effect of the trench configuration on the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system is discussed fig 6 depicts the influence of the trench width on the wave forces on the bridge deck limited fluctuations were observed for the horizontal wave force as the relative trench width changed from 0 0 to 2 5 fig 6 a within the range of kb 0 4 to kb 1 0 f x was slightly influenced by the relative trench width the vertical force and moment exhibited a similar variation trend with the relative trench width for the hydrodynamic coefficients wide trenches resulted in less reflection and more transmission explaining the increase in f z at kb 0 2 fig 7 depicts the effect of the relative trench depth on the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system the relative trench depth h 1 h ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 the variations in the wave forces with the wavenumber were similar even for different relative trench depths fig 7 a c as h 1 h increased from 0 to 1 0 three different regions were observed at kb 0 35 the bridge superstructure behind a shallow trench was subjected to large wave forces however this dangerous condition transformed to a deep trench for incident waves at 0 35 kb 0 65 for short waves with kb 0 65 the trench depth did not influence the wave forces on the bridge superstructure the results for the wave forces on the bridge superstructure behind the trench with different spaces are shown in fig 8 the wave forces f x and m o were rarely influenced by w 2 fig 8 a and c only slight fluctuations were observed for 0 2 kb 0 8 moreover the vertical force f z varied significantly with w 2 w 3 at approximately kb 0 25 fig 8 b for kb 0 1 and 0 8 f z was almost stable fig 8 b the large space between the trench and bridge superstructure resulted in more transmission at approximately kb 0 2 fig 8 d fig 9 and fig 10 show the effect of structural geometry on the wave forces on the bridge superstructure behind the trench the bridge superstructure with a narrower box girder received a higher f x for incident waves with kb 0 35 but received a lower f x when 0 35 kb 0 7 fig 9 a similarly a wide box girder decreased f z and m o for long waves with kb 0 35 but increase the parameters for incident waves with 0 35 kb 0 7 fig 9 b and c for short incident waves with kb 0 7 the wave forces were seldom influenced by the box girder width the wave forces on the bridge superstructure converged to the same value when w 4 w 3 0 5 the effect of the box girder height on the hydrodynamic performance is depicted in fig 10 the results presented in fig 10 were calculated for a constant box girder width w 4 w 3 0 6 as the relative box girder height increased from 0 00 to 2 00 f x slightly increased when kb 0 4 but decreased significantly when kb 0 4 the box girder thickness decreased the vertical force generated by long waves with kb 1 2 fig 10 b with an increase in the relative box girder height from 0 00 to 2 00 the maximum m o acting on the bridge superstructure increased from 0 12 to 0 14 at approximately kb 0 65 thicker box girder resulted in more reflection and less transmission fig 10 d 4 3 bridge superstructure behind breakwater the breakwater is an alternative technique for mitigating the wave forces on coastal bridges a parametric analysis was performed to investigate the influence of trench configuration on the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system fig 11 shows the effect of the breakwater width on the wave forces and hydrodynamic coefficients the breakwater was maintained at height h 1 h 0 13 and space w 2 w 3 1 0 to the bridge superstructure the configurations of the bridge superstructure were d 2 h 0 13 and d 1 d 2 0 41 f x on the bridge superstructure behind the breakwater with different trench widths exhibited a similar tendency with the change in wavenumber for long waves with kb 0 4 f x increased with kb and remained relatively stable at various breakwater widths when kb 0 4 significant oscillations of f x were observed f x peaked at several values with variation in wavenumber a narrower breakwater width resulted in a slower but larger amplitude oscillation of f x generally the breakwater width only changed the wavenumber of the secondary peaks of f z but minimally influenced the maximum f z on the bridge superstructure the maximum m o occurred at lower kb values and attained higher values for wider breakwaters it should be noted that the breakwater could not be neglected even when the width was very narrow because it was assumed to be a rigid body in this study the effect of breakwater height on the wave forces on the bridge superstructure is shown in fig 12 the horizontal wave force was significantly influenced by the relative breakwater height h 1 h fig 12 a significant f x oscillations occurred when kb 0 4 compared to the flat bottom conditions with an increase in h 1 h from 0 0 to 0 74 two f x peaks appeared at kb 1 0 and 2 0 indicating that the breakwater increased the f x values under specific wave conditions the breakwater with h 1 h 0 22 significantly mitigated the vertical force on the bridge superstructure generated by the long waves except that some fluctuations arose under short waves fig 12 b the change in the overturning moment with relative breakwater height was similar to the variation in f x furthermore breakwaters with heights h 1 h 0 22 could effectively decrease m o except under particular wave conditions the space between the breakwater and the bridge influenced the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system the effect of w 2 on the wave forces is shown in fig 13 the geometric configurations of the wave structure system are w 1 w 3 1 0 h 1 h 0 13 w 4 w 3 0 6 d 2 h 0 13 and d 1 d 2 0 41 it was observed that 1 an increase in w 2 w 3 decreased f x and m o at a kb value of approximately 0 8 but increased them when kb 1 0 2 a larger space resulted in a larger vertical wave force 3 a significant increase in transmitted waves occurred for high w 2 w 3 values figs 14 and 15 depict the effect of the box girder on the wave forces the geometry of the box girder modulated the amplitude of the wave force on the bridge superstructure but slightly influenced c r and c t figs 14 and 15 generally a narrow but thick box girder is useful for mitigating wave forces under most wave conditions 5 conclusions in this study a model for analyzing the wave forces on abridge superstructure with a box girder behind a trench or breakwater was established analytical solutions were obtained based on the potential flow theory and the eigenfunction matching method the results of a previous experimental hydrodynamic study were employed to validate the proposed analytical model the proposed model precisely converged to the limiting case the validated analytical model was used to calculate the wave forces on the bridge superstructure for different configurations the effect of topography on the wave forces was analyzed parametrically the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the mitigation of wave forces on coastal bridges is a challenge for bridge engineers owing to the catastrophic failure of coastal bridges caused by hurricane generated waves the trench and the breakwater are relatively feasible options for mitigating wave forces on coastal bridges during hurricanes therefore wave forces on an immersed bridge deck located behind a trench or breakwater can be analyzed using the potential flow theory 2 the parametric analysis results indicate that a deep trench located close to the bridge is useful for reducing the wave forces acting on the bridge superstructure particularly for long waves a high breakwater close to the bridge can significantly mitigate wave forces compared to the flat bottom the breakwater effectively modulates the sensitive wave conditions of the bridge structure a narrow but thick box girder is a good choice for bridges located behind a breakwater to minimize severe wave forces 3 the proposed analytical model was developed within the limits of linear potential flow hence it can only provide a basic solution to this wave structure interaction problem a more accurate model and specialized experiment should be set up in future research to analyze the mechanism of wave force mitigation further credit authorship contribution statement huixing gao methodology investigation

design of the wave structure system configuration is required to reduce the wave forces acting on bridge decks effectively keywords wave forces coastal bridges box girder trench breakwater analytical solution 1 introduction in 2004 2005 hurricane generated waves damaged many coastal bridges along the gulf of mexico most of those damaged bridges were low lying and had simply supported spans without adequate connections between the superstructure and the bent caps the failure of coastal bridges leads to significant economic losses and delays the rescue and reconstruction of hurricane stricken areas after the catastrophic hurricane disasters in 2004 and 2005 two wave force estimation methods were developed douglass et al 2006 proposed an empirical approach for wave forces on bridge superstructures based on the model of wave loads on decks mcconnell et al 2004 the douglass method adopts the equivalent hydrostatic pressure as a reference for calculating the loads on the bridge superstructure and it is convenient and straightforward without the need for complex calculations subsequently the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto 2008 published a guideline for estimating the wave forces acting on coastal bridges the aashto guideline was developed using a physics based method based on a 1 8 scale model test performed by marin 2010 both methods mentioned above can reliably predict the wave loads on bridge superstructures some limitations even exist for submerged conditions guo et al 2015b jin and meng 2011 xu et al 2016 several researchers have investigated the wave forces on bridge superstructures owing to their complex nature hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2016 qeshta et al 2019 bradner et al 2011 and istrati et al 2018 used a facility at the oregon state university to analyze the wave forces on bridge decks at a 1 5 scale generated by regular and unbroken broken solitary waves respectively the wave forces on coastal bridges have also been experimentally investigated using physical models at different scales cuomo et al 2009 fang et al 2019 guo et al 2015b hayatdavoodi et al 2014 huang et al 2018b mcpherson 2008 the wave forces on an elevated bridge superstructure contain a slowly varying and impulsive component as an alternative approach for assessing the wave structure interaction computational fluid dynamics cfd provides further details about the fluid field during wave impact on the bridge superstructure huang and xiao 2009 simulated the hurricane generated waves interacting with the escambia bay bridge deck using incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and k ε equations the effect of the submersion depth on the wave lift force was analyzed jin and meng 2011 used commercial cfd software flow 3d to compute the wave forces on a submerged bridge deck and compared the numerical results with the results calculated using a potential flow model furthermore the effects of the deck skewness winter et al 2018 twin bridge deck xu et al 2016 lateral restraints xu and cai 2017 and coexisting current huang et al 2018a on wave forces have been evaluated based on the stormwater level hurricane waves acting on bridge superstructures can be categorized into elevated semi submerged and submerged scenarios the submerged scenario occurs when the elevation of the stormwater level is higher than the bottom of the bridge deck this case was observed to be the general condition of the us 90 bridge across biloxi bay damaged during hurricane katrina chen et al 2009 for the submerged scenario analytical methods are comparatively more efficient than the hydrodynamic experiment and numerical simulation approaches hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015a applied the green naghdi theory and calculated the forces on a submerged thin slab induced by solitary and cnoidal waves hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015b guo et al 2015a evaluated the wave forces on a submerged bridge deck with a t girder using the potential flow theory and developed a simple method for wave force estimation based on the analytical results oblique wave forces on a submerged bridge deck were analyzed by fang et al 2018 moreover the potential flow theory is regularly employed to investigate the interaction between gravity waves and different types of structures such as the fixed rectangular obstacle mei and black 1969 submerged platform breakwater cheong et al 1996 and floating bridge kaligatla and sahoo 2019 for the submerged scenario the potential flow method may be applied to assess the wave forces on bridge superstructures as the wave structure interaction problem is similar to that of the rectangular obstacle or breakwater this study focuses on the wave forces on bridge superstructures with a box girder behind a trench or breakwater an analytical solution for estimating the wave force was obtained based on the potential flow theory the trench and breakwater effects on the wave forces were examined using the validated analytical model the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows first the boundary value problem is defined based on certain assumptions and simplifications next the mathematical formula is solved using the eigenfunction matching method subsequently the analytical model is validated with the findings of a previous experimental hydrodynamic study and limiting cases finally the effects of the trench and breakwater on the wave forces were compared and analyzed parametrically and the concluding remarks are provided 2 analytical formulation and solution 2 1 problem definition most coastal bridges built in recent years have box girders to achieve high flexural and torsional stiffness a typical bridge superstructure consists of a slab and a box girder in this study the wave forces on the semisubmerged box girder type bridge decks behind a trench or breakwater were simplified as a boundary value problem fig 1 the following assumptions are made to simplify the problem 1 the fluid undergoes inviscid incompressible and irrotational flow which makes it a potential flow 2 the box girder is a rectangular section and the inclinations of the webs are neglected 3 the bridge superstructure is a rigid body and fixed on the cap beam 4 the monochromatic incident waves are perpendicular to the bridge deck 5 the bridge and the trench or breakwater are infinitely long the effects of the dynamic structural properties on the wave forces are neglected in this study chen et al 2016 reported that a moving bridge superstructure is subjected to minor wave forces wave forces reach their maximum values when the waves are propagated perpendicular to the superstructure fang et al 2018 based on the above assumptions the proposed model results are conservative from the perspective of engineering practice the wave topography structure system can be simplified to a two dimensional problem a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is defined with the origin coinciding with the centerline of the bridge deck the x axis follows the wave propagation direction lying on the still water level whereas the z axis follows the upward direction depending on the boundary conditions the entire fluid domain can be divided into seven separate regions fig 1 the inlet region ω 1 region ω 2 over the trench or breakwater transitive region ω 3 structure covered regions ω 4 6 and outlet region ω 7 the spatial component φ x z of the velocity potential φ x z t stratifies the governing continuous

progressive and evanescent modes in eq 7 the first item represents the indecent potential the first terms of the infinite series in eqs 7 and 13 are the reflected and transmitted waves respectively for the same boundary conditions regions ω 1 ω 3 and ω 7 share vertical eigenfunctions as follows 14 z n z 2 cosh k 0 h z h g sinh 2 k 0 h ω 2 n 0 2 cos k n h z h g sin 2 k n h ω 2 n 1 2 where h is

and d 2 are the submergence parameters of the bridge deck and box girder respectively fig 1 the vertical eigenfunctions expressed in eqs 14 17 are orthogonal to each other in the water depth of each region the orthogonality of the vertical eigenfunctions simplifies the process of calculating the unknown coefficients the continuity of the velocity potential between regions ω 1 and ω 2 transforms

3 m o m o 0 5 ρ g a w 3 2 3 validation and limiting case 3 1 validation zhang et al 2020 conducted a series of tests on box girder type bridge decks to analyze the wave forces on the bridges considering coexisting currents the bridge model consisted of a slab and a box girder fig 2 a zhang et al 2020 determined the hydrodynamic loads on the bridge deck under regular waves the wave periods of the incident waves were 1 31 1 68 and 2 05 s and the wave height changed from 0 033 to 0 133 m in intervals of 0 033 m the wave loads on the bridge deck were measured using a three dimensional load cell at a sample rate of 50 hz during the experimental tests five different submergence scenarios were investigated considering the effect of the current for more details of the experiment the readers can refer to zhang et al 2020 for a constant water depth of 0 713 m the submerged case was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model without loss of generality the web of the box girder and the bottom of the slab were simplified as the vertical and horizontal parts respectively the schematic of the simplified boundary value problem is shown in fig 2 b in the analytical procedure the depth of the trench h 1 was set as a minimal value for example 0 001 m to match the flat bottom of the wave flume employed by zhang et al 2020 fig 3 shows the comparison between the calculated and measured wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck each wave trial was repeated three times during the experiment to minimize accidental errors zhang et al 2020 the maximum and minimum values of the wave forces in both the horizontal and vertical directions were employed for the first several wave cycles to validate the proposed analytical model in fig 3 kb is the dimensionless wavenumber which is equal to wavenumber k multiplied by the half width of the bridge deck b fig 1 and it is related to the wave period of the incident waves the solid blue line represents the calculated results and the scatter points are the measured results obtained by zhang et al 2020 the maximum horizontal wave force rapidly increased with the wavenumber in the range of 0 kb 0 2 fig 3 a for kb 0 2 the maximum horizontal wave force first slowly increased and decreased slightly after peaking at kb 0 6 the measured maximum horizontal wave force exhibited a similar trend as kb comparatively the maximum vertical wave force increased sharply and then declined continuously after peaking at approximately kb 0 2 fig 3 b the bridge deck resists the minimum wave forces during the wave trough passing by the structure the comparison between the calculated and measured minimum wave forces are shown in fig 3 c and d by comparing the calculated and measured results it was concluded that the proposed model could yield an acceptable estimation of the wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck it should be noted that the measured results were extracted from several wave trials with different wave heights significant oscillations were observed for the measured wave forces which could not be reflected using the proposed analytical model during the experiment the wave overtopped and exerted a downward force on the bridge deck reducing the measured upward vertical forces the proposed model was developed based on the linear potential theory in which the wave forces are assumed to have a linear relationship with the wave amplitude however nonlinear effects such as wave overtopping and air trapping occur in experiments for extended wave height cases which cannot be reflected using the proposed model overall the proposed analytical model could acceptably calculate the wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck as only positive wave forces were considered in this study 3 2 limiting case the wave structure system depicted in fig 1 converts to wave forces on rectangular obstacles in waters assuming that d 2 d 1 and h 1 0 waves acting on fixed rectangular obstacles in the water is a classical hydrodynamic problem investigated extensively mei and black 1969 investigated the scattering of surface waves by rectangular obstacles in the water of finite depth by splitting the velocity potential into symmetric and asymmetric parts fig 4 shows a comparison of the hydrodynamic coefficients between the solutions obtained in this study and mei and black 1969 the reflection coefficient c r increased from 0 0 to 1 0 as kb varied from 0 to 2 4 while the transmission coefficient c t decreased from 1 0 to approximately 0 0 the reflection and transmission coefficients must satisfy c r 2 c t 2 1 to ensure the conservation of wave energy within the fluid domains the results obtained using the proposed model were consistent with those of mei and black 1969 indicating that the proposed model with complex structural boundary and bottom topography could converge to the case of a simply fixed box 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between trench and breakwater cases the wave forces on the box girder type bridge deck were determined for three scenarios using the validated analytical model behind a trench behind a breakwater and over a flat bottom fig 5 shows the dimensionless wave forces and hydrodynamic coefficients for the three different scenarios the depth of the trench was h 2 h 0 13 which was the same as the height of the breakwater the flat bottom case was simulated by setting h 2 to a minimal value the horizontal wave force on the bridge superstructure over the flat bottom was similar to that behind a trench fig 5 a the only slight difference with the horizontal force was observed for kb 0 1 between the flat bottom and the trench scenarios for the breakwater case the horizontal force showed a similar tendency in the wavenumber with the other two cases except for significant oscillations the breakwater decreased the horizontal force for an incident wave with wavenumbers approximately 0 7 and 1 4 but enlarge horizontal forces for wavenumbers around 1 0 and 1 9 the calculated values of the vertical forces on the bridge superstructure are shown in fig 5 b the f z rapidly increased with kb and then steadily decreased after attaining the maximum value the maximum value of f z reached 0 970 when kb was approximately 0 07 for the flat bottom scenario for the trench and breakwater scenarios the maximum f z values reached 0 896 and 0 849 respectively which correspondingly occurred at kb values of approximately 0 17 and 0 35 the trench and breakwater could reduce the maximum wave force by 7 6 and 12 5 respectively moreover fluctuations were observed in the declining stage of f z for the breakwater scenario it can be concluded that a trench and a breakwater help mitigate vertical forces acting on bridge superstructures fig 5 c shows the variation in kb with the overturning moment m o acting on the bridge superstructure m o initially increased and then decreased with kb and was seldom influenced by the topography for long waves with kb 0 4 similar to f x and f z the appearance of breakwater resulted in fluctuations in m o the effect of bottom undulation was also measured in terms of hydrodynamic coefficients of the wave structure system fig 5 d 4 2 bridge superstructure behind a trench in this subsection the effect of the trench configuration on the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system is discussed fig 6 depicts the influence of the trench width on the wave forces on the bridge deck limited fluctuations were observed for the horizontal wave force as the relative trench width changed from 0 0 to 2 5 fig 6 a within the range of kb 0 4 to kb 1 0 f x was slightly influenced by the relative trench width the vertical force and moment exhibited a similar variation trend with the relative trench width for the hydrodynamic coefficients wide trenches resulted in less reflection and more transmission explaining the increase in f z at kb 0 2 fig 7 depicts the effect of the relative trench depth on the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system the relative trench depth h 1 h ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 the variations in the wave forces with the wavenumber were similar even for different relative trench depths fig 7 a c as h 1 h increased from 0 to 1 0 three different regions were observed at kb 0 35 the bridge superstructure behind a shallow trench was subjected to large wave forces however this dangerous condition transformed to a deep trench for incident waves at 0 35 kb 0 65 for short waves with kb 0 65 the trench depth did not influence the wave forces on the bridge superstructure the results for the wave forces on the bridge superstructure behind the trench with different spaces are shown in fig 8 the wave forces f x and m o were rarely influenced by w 2 fig 8 a and c only slight fluctuations were observed for 0 2 kb 0 8 moreover the vertical force f z varied significantly with w 2 w 3 at approximately kb 0 25 fig 8 b for kb 0 1 and 0 8 f z was almost stable fig 8 b the large space between the trench and bridge superstructure resulted in more transmission at approximately kb 0 2 fig 8 d fig 9 and fig 10 show the effect of structural geometry on the wave forces on the bridge superstructure behind the trench the bridge superstructure with a narrower box girder received a higher f x for incident waves with kb 0 35 but received a lower f x when 0 35 kb 0 7 fig 9 a similarly a wide box girder decreased f z and m o for long waves with kb 0 35 but increase the parameters for incident waves with 0 35 kb 0 7 fig 9 b and c for short incident waves with kb 0 7 the wave forces were seldom influenced by the box girder width the wave forces on the bridge superstructure converged to the same value when w 4 w 3 0 5 the effect of the box girder height on the hydrodynamic performance is depicted in fig 10 the results presented in fig 10 were calculated for a constant box girder width w 4 w 3 0 6 as the relative box girder height increased from 0 00 to 2 00 f x slightly increased when kb 0 4 but decreased significantly when kb 0 4 the box girder thickness decreased the vertical force generated by long waves with kb 1 2 fig 10 b with an increase in the relative box girder height from 0 00 to 2 00 the maximum m o acting on the bridge superstructure increased from 0 12 to 0 14 at approximately kb 0 65 thicker box girder resulted in more reflection and less transmission fig 10 d 4 3 bridge superstructure behind breakwater the breakwater is an alternative technique for mitigating the wave forces on coastal bridges a parametric analysis was performed to investigate the influence of trench configuration on the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system fig 11 shows the effect of the breakwater width on the wave forces and hydrodynamic coefficients the breakwater was maintained at height h 1 h 0 13 and space w 2 w 3 1 0 to the bridge superstructure the configurations of the bridge superstructure were d 2 h 0 13 and d 1 d 2 0 41 f x on the bridge superstructure behind the breakwater with different trench widths exhibited a similar tendency with the change in wavenumber for long waves with kb 0 4 f x increased with kb and remained relatively stable at various breakwater widths when kb 0 4 significant oscillations of f x were observed f x peaked at several values with variation in wavenumber a narrower breakwater width resulted in a slower but larger amplitude oscillation of f x generally the breakwater width only changed the wavenumber of the secondary peaks of f z but minimally influenced the maximum f z on the bridge superstructure the maximum m o occurred at lower kb values and attained higher values for wider breakwaters it should be noted that the breakwater could not be neglected even when the width was very narrow because it was assumed to be a rigid body in this study the effect of breakwater height on the wave forces on the bridge superstructure is shown in fig 12 the horizontal wave force was significantly influenced by the relative breakwater height h 1 h fig 12 a significant f x oscillations occurred when kb 0 4 compared to the flat bottom conditions with an increase in h 1 h from 0 0 to 0 74 two f x peaks appeared at kb 1 0 and 2 0 indicating that the breakwater increased the f x values under specific wave conditions the breakwater with h 1 h 0 22 significantly mitigated the vertical force on the bridge superstructure generated by the long waves except that some fluctuations arose under short waves fig 12 b the change in the overturning moment with relative breakwater height was similar to the variation in f x furthermore breakwaters with heights h 1 h 0 22 could effectively decrease m o except under particular wave conditions the space between the breakwater and the bridge influenced the hydrodynamic performance of the wave structure system the effect of w 2 on the wave forces is shown in fig 13 the geometric configurations of the wave structure system are w 1 w 3 1 0 h 1 h 0 13 w 4 w 3 0 6 d 2 h 0 13 and d 1 d 2 0 41 it was observed that 1 an increase in w 2 w 3 decreased f x and m o at a kb value of approximately 0 8 but increased them when kb 1 0 2 a larger space resulted in a larger vertical wave force 3 a significant increase in transmitted waves occurred for high w 2 w 3 values figs 14 and 15 depict the effect of the box girder on the wave forces the geometry of the box girder modulated the amplitude of the wave force on the bridge superstructure but slightly influenced c r and c t figs 14 and 15 generally a narrow but thick box girder is useful for mitigating wave forces under most wave conditions 5 conclusions in this study a model for analyzing the wave forces on abridge superstructure with a box girder behind a trench or breakwater was established analytical solutions were obtained based on the potential flow theory and the eigenfunction matching method the results of a previous experimental hydrodynamic study were employed to validate the proposed analytical model the proposed model precisely converged to the limiting case the validated analytical model was used to calculate the wave forces on the bridge superstructure for different configurations the effect of topography on the wave forces was analyzed parametrically the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the mitigation of wave forces on coastal bridges is a challenge for bridge engineers owing to the catastrophic failure of coastal bridges caused by hurricane generated waves the trench and the breakwater are relatively feasible options for mitigating wave forces on coastal bridges during hurricanes therefore wave forces on an immersed bridge deck located behind a trench or breakwater can be analyzed using the potential flow theory 2 the parametric analysis results indicate that a deep trench located close to the bridge is useful for reducing the wave forces acting on the bridge superstructure particularly for long waves a high breakwater close to the bridge can significantly mitigate wave forces compared to the flat bottom the breakwater effectively modulates the sensitive wave conditions of the bridge structure a narrow but thick box girder is a good choice for bridges located behind a breakwater to minimize severe wave forces 3 the proposed analytical model was developed within the limits of linear potential flow hence it can only provide a basic solution to this wave structure interaction problem a more accurate model and specialized experiment should be set up in future research to analyze the mechanism of wave force mitigation further credit authorship contribution statement huixing gao methodology investigation

20313,ship performance is largely influenced by roughness on immersed surfaces which is mostly inhomogeneous therefore the prediction of the effects of roughness on ship performance is of crucial importance even though it has several drawbacks the granville similarity law scaling method is widely reported in the literature for predicting the frictional resistance coefficient of a rough surface lately the cfd approach based on a modified wall function approach has also been used since it allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of roughness in this paper a novel method for assessing the frictional resistance coefficient for rough surfaces is proposed the proposed method can take into account the non uniform distribution of friction velocity as well as the roughness reynolds number and thus the non uniform distribution of roughness function values can be predicted along a rough surface additionally the proposed method can consider the non uniform distribution of roughness and its effect on the frictional coefficient of a flat plate based on the proposed method an in house numerical code is developed allowing for the rapid and accurate assessment of the frictional resistance coefficient for a rough surface the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with the cfd approach for several surface conditions defined with different roughness function models and the longitudinal position of roughness a comparison is made of two flat plates representing one containership and one tanker at two different speeds the obtained relative deviations in the predicted frictional resistance coefficients for all surface conditions are lower than 2 5 therefore it is demonstrated that the proposed method can be used for estimating the frictional resistance coefficient of various surface conditions defined with roughness function models and the longitudinal positions of roughness keywords frictional resistance coefficient friction velocity roughness inhomogeneous roughness homogeneous roughness 1 introduction the presence of roughness and the analysis of its influence is important in various engineering applications it can cause an increase in the frictional resistance coefficient which represents the ratio between frictional resistance and the product of hydrodynamic pressure and a wetted surface in this way the presence of roughness affects the performance of the ship propeller turbine wave energy device etc however a roughness coefficient and its determination also represent an essential step in the numerical modelling of flow and sediment transport in channels and natural streams the roughness coefficient causes a retardation of the flow and it is included in the flow resistance equation niazkar et al 2019 through the flow resistance coefficient which describes the relationship between the pressure drop and the corresponding flow rate ship performance is largely affected by the presence of roughness on immersed surfaces hull roughness can be caused by numerous processes which are often divided into those that occur during the predelivery stage and in processes which occur during the service of the ship yeginbayeva and atlar 2018 over the last few years with increasing emphasis on the need to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions the importance of reducing hull roughness during the predelivery phase has been highlighted improvements in antifouling coatings af as well as in their application have led to a reduction of hull roughness which leads to a reduction of the ship total resistance seok and park 2020 consequently drag characterization studies of af coatings in newly applied and clean conditions are becoming more frequent and are gaining in importance erbas 2019 studied mean velocity profiles frictional resistance roughness functions δ u and correlations between roughness and frictional resistance for new generation af coatings ünal et al 2012 investigated the relative boundary layer and the roughness and drag characteristics of some novel nanostructured coatings the authors demonstrated the importance of developing new correlations for the prediction of the frictional resistance of af coatings as the δ u values of af coatings are non zero regardless of their very low roughness reynolds numbers k ünal 2015 presented a new correlation for the determination of the roughness length scale k and some roughness parameters for af coatings ünal also discussed the differences between various af coatings the impact of different roughness calculation methods as well as the impact of the application of af coatings on frictional resistance li et al 2018 investigated the impact of cu2o particle size which is a common biocide in af coatings on the roughness of af coatings as well as on the frictional resistance properties of af coatings it was found that for particles higher than 12 μm the roughness characteristics as well as frictional resistance increased as the particle size increased while for lower particle sizes this trend is not the same and frictional resistance was higher than expected yeginbayeva and atlar 2018 carried out a drag characterization study for af coatings which were applied on plates with different initial surface roughness conditions the authors proposed various correlations for the prediction of k based on the various roughness parameters and demonstrated the benefits in the terms of the frictional resistance of fouling release fr coatings which have lower roughness over biocidal coatings the development of coatings with lower roughness can be noticed if the recommended roughness value from the ittc performance prediction method ppm ittc 2017 for average hull roughness ahr i e 150 μm is analysed for example seok and park 2020 demonstrated that the average hull roughness ahr of a newly built car ferry is significantly lower than the ahr recommended by ittc 2017 the importance of a new method for the estimation of an increase in the frictional resistance coefficient δ c f through the application of certain coatings has been highlighted several times yeginbayeva and atlar 2018 however currently the ittc procedure for correlating between roughness and drag only accounts for a single roughness amplitude parameter ittc 2011a this procedure depends on the application of a practical equation for roughness allowance in terms of ahr the requirement for further testing and correlation studies for additional support regarding this correlation is underlined in ittc 2011b recently the method for the determination of δ c f due to the application of certain af coatings i e the modelling of hull roughness has been proposed in andersson et al 2020 speranza et al 2019 namely andersson et al 2020 reviewed the application of various δ u and different strategies to determine k in addition the authors highlighted the importance of a drag characterization study for the appropriate selection of adequate δ u for certain rough surfaces speranza et al 2019 presented a guideline for the estimation of the frictional resistance of a ship covered with various af coatings the authors outlined and discussed the similarities and dissimilarities with other methods besides roughness which occurs in the predelivery stage roughness which occurs during the service of a ship is even more important and is caused by many processes including mechanical chemical and electrochemical ones as well as the settling of biofouling organisms song et al 2021 b due to an increase in roughness the frictional resistance of a ship is increased which significantly affects ship performance i e there is an increase in fuel consumption and engine stress as well as a decrease in ship speed bixler and bhushan 2012 the importance of improving the hull fouling condition is emphasized in schultz et al 2011 where the authors demonstrated significant economic savings related to this improvement the cleaning of the hull and propeller will cause an increase in ship energy efficiency however it is very important to accurately determine the optimal time for such cleaning it is very useful to predict the impact of roughness on the ship performance which can demonstrate the significance of hull and propeller cleaning and which may be useful in the optimization of maintenance schedules song et al 2020 a the impact of roughness on ship performance can be determined using various approaches which are summarised in farkas et al 2020 e these approaches can be divided into statistical studies performance monitoring and investigations related to the roughness effect on flow the iso 19030 procedure represents the current best practice for an approach based on performance monitoring nevertheless this procedure has several drawbacks the correction of scattered measured data which is a very difficult procedure the rather strict filtering of the measured data and the fact that waves due to swell are not filtered additionally there are problems related to the difference of reported averaged values accidental errors and intentional false reporting of the noon reports regardless of these disadvantages an approach based on performance monitoring has been widely adopted nowadays procedures based on investigations related to the roughness effect on flow have also gained in importance lately in the literature there are several methods for the prediction of the effect of roughness on ship hydrodynamic performance throughout its history the ittc has recommended several approaches for the analysis of roughness allowance in the ittc 1978 ppm the bowden and davison 1974 equation was proposed to determine roughness allowance based on the sea trials of real ships although this formulation was criticized just after its adoption it remained within the ittc ppm until 1990 in 1990 this equation was replaced with an equation proposed by townsin and dey 1990 in 2011 the ittc differentiated roughness allowance from correlation allowance ittc 2011a and this estimation has remained the same until now thus the ittc 1978 ppm ittc 2017 considers roughness effects through roughness allowance with the townsin and dey equation based on the roughness measurements of rough painted surfaces and their statistical analysis townsin 2003 which consequently cannot consider the effects of biofouling kresic and haskell 1983 proposed an approach which can examine biofouling effects on the ship hydrodynamic characteristics through fouling equivalent roughness which depends on the hull roughness factor the number of port days the coating effectiveness factor and factor c which considers whether the biofouling is located at the bottom or on the side of a hull however the main drawback of their approach lies in the estimation of roughness heights for surfaces fouled with biofouling which is based on historical correlations the granville similarity law scaling method granville 1958 represents an important method which can be used for the prediction of the impact of roughness on δ c f the method is based on the wall similarity hypothesis which is proven to be valid if the relative roughness is sufficiently small castro 2007 demonstrated that this hypothesis holds if the ratio between the boundary layer thickness and the roughness length scale is above 5 although the application of the granville similarity law scaling method can be observed in several studies in the literature schultz 2004 2007 demirel et al 2019 uzun et al 2020 this method has several drawbacks which are discussed in song et al 2019 thus although it allows for a rapid assessment the granville method can only assess the roughness effect on δ c f of a flat plate having the same length as the ship and it cannot determine the roughness effect on other ship hydrodynamic characteristics furthermore it considers only one value of friction velocity u τ and consequently only one value of δ u over the entire flat plate which is a simplification since it is known that u τ varies even on a flat plate farkas et al 2020c proposed a novel ppm for fouled surfaces which can account for the effects of roughness on the ship hydrodynamic performance the applicability of this method is demonstrated for the prediction of propeller performance in open water conditions farkas et al 2021b as well as for the prediction of the ship s hydrodynamic performance farkas et al 2021a the main limitation of this method is that the roughness effect on wave resistance is neglected and that the prediction of δ c f is carried out using the granville method lately the application of the cfd approach based on the implementation of the δ u model within the wall function for the problems related to ship hydrodynamics has expanded farkas et al 2020a 2020d garcia et al 2020 song et al 2020 c thus farkas et al 2020a assessed the impact of hard fouling on the resistance characteristics of two merchant ships while the impact of hard fouling on the open water characteristics and self propulsion characteristics of three propellers and three merchant ships has also been investigated farkas et al 2020d song et al 2020c utilized the cfd approach based on the modified wall function for an estimation of the fouling effect on the resistance characteristics of different ship forms garcia et al 2020 investigated the resistance characteristics of initial and in service roughness using the cfd approach based on the modified wall function the authors demonstrated that the cfd approach can be a very effective tool for the determination of the impact of biofouling on ship performance this approach currently represents the most comprehensive approach for the prediction of the roughness effects on the ship hydrodynamic performance it has also been validated in song et al 2020 b for modelling the effects of roughness on ship resistance however the main drawback of the cfd approach is related to the computational cost and to the fact that for each ship or surface condition a new cfd simulation should be performed song et al 2021 a thus the cfd approach requires significantly more time to determine the effects of roughness on ship performance in comparison with the granville method or the ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2021a which could be of importance in the optimization of the maintenance schedule it is important to note that almost all studies in the literature related to ship hydrodynamics have considered uniformly distributed roughness over an immersed surface since roughness on immersed surfaces is non uniform primarily due to the non uniform distribution of biofouling the effect of heterogeneous roughness should be taken into account in order to reduce inaccuracies in the prediction of δ c f demirel et al 2017 experimental studies regarding the response of a turbulent boundary layer to a step change in surface roughness are presented in antonia and luxton 1971 1972 wood 1982 proposed a simple correlation for the growth of the internal layer after a step change in surface roughness based on a dimensional analysis hanson and ganapathisubramani 2016 experimentally analysed the development of a boundary layer past a change in surface roughness the authors proposed new mixed scaling for the near wall peak based on the corrected wake deficit and u τ li et al 2019 conducted an experimental and numerical study on the recovery of the wall shear stress of a turbulent boundary layer after an abrupt change from a rough to a smooth surface the authors found that any estimation of the wall shear stress based on the mean velocity profile in the buffer region or further away from the wall will likely underestimate its magnitude near the region where the change from the rough to the smooth surface condition occurs the longitudinal location of roughness affects δ c f and thus it is important to analyse heterogeneous roughness and its effect on frictional resistance song et al 2021b 2021c suastika et al 2021 song et al 2021c proposed a method based on the granville similarity law scaling method for the prediction of δ c f as a result of heterogeneous roughness however the proposed method can only consider the percentage of surface coverage with roughness and not the longitudinal position of roughness therefore the main objective of this paper is the development of a novel method to provide a more reliable assessment of the frictional resistance coefficient for a flat plate covered with a non uniform distribution of roughness to the best of the authors knowledge there is no universal method to take into account the effect of heterogeneous roughness on an increase in frictional resistance the present study adds to the current literature a novel method to consider the non uniform distribution of roughness and its effect on the frictional resistance of a flat plate this is of particular importance since roughness on an immersed surface is primarily non uniform the application of the proposed method can enable a more reliable prediction of the frictional resistance coefficient than the granville method further the proposed method can consider the non uniform distribution of u τ and in this way k and δ u values as well consequently the proposed method represents a more comprehensive method than the granville method even for uniformly distributed roughness 2 method and materials 2 1 background the wall similarity hypothesis claims that the outer layer of the turbulent boundary layer is not affected by the presence of roughness and all predictive models are based on this hypothesis chung et al 2021 thus the contribution of roughness is usually accounted for with δ u which is defined as follows chung et al 2021 1 δ u u s u r where u s and u r are the non dimensional velocity profiles for a smooth and rough surface respectively which are determined as follows schultz and flack 2007 2 u s u u τ 1 κ ln y π κ w y δ a 3 u r u u τ 1 κ ln y π κ w y δ δ u a where u is the velocity κ is the von karman constant y is the non dimensional wall distance π is the coles wake factor w is the wake function and a is the offset constant it should be noted that in equations 2 and 3 the contribution to mass and momentum transport across the whole boundary layer from the viscous sublayer and the buffer layer or a possible roughness sublayer is neglected since the influence of these regions is small if the reynolds number r n is large pullin et al 2017 the drag characterization of a rough surface can be defined as the determination of velocity decrement caused by the frictional resistance of a rough surface as a function of k every type of roughness has its own unique δ u as a function of k yeginbayeva et al 2019 and once it is experimentally assessed it can be utilized to determine the effects of roughness on the resistance of any arbitrary body covered with that type of roughness schultz et al 2003 the relation between u τ and the local frictional resistance coefficient c f is defined as follows ünal et al 2012 4 u τ c f 2 u where u is the velocity of the freestream velocity at the outer edge of the boundary layer granville 1987 proposed the determination of δ u values with the local method without displacement thickness which includes measurements of c f and r n of the smooth and rough surfaces using the following equation 5 δ u 2 c f s 2 c f r 19 7 c f 2 s c f 2 r at the same value of r n x c f r n x is defined as follows pullin et al 2017 6 r n x x u ν where x is the streamwise location and ν is the kinematic viscosity 2 2 method the proposed method is based on equating the certain δ u model with equation 5 and thereafter the iterative finding of u τ the δ u model depends on k which is defined as follows granville 1987 7 k k u τ ν where k is the roughness length scale which is chosen in a way that δ u values fall on the predefined δ u model demirel et al 2017 within this paper two different δ u models are used however it should be noted that the proposed method is applicable to any δ u model the first one is the grigson δ u model which represents the colebrook type of δ u model and it is defined as follows grigson 1992 8 δ u 1 κ ln 1 k the grigson δ u model has been used for the description of several roughness types such as af coatings andersson et al 2020 schultz 2004 barnacles demirel et al 2017 song et al 2019 2020a and hard fouling schultz 2004 farkas et al 2020a 2020d along with the appropriate k the second one is the cebeci and bradshaw δ u model which represents the nikuradse type of δ u model defined as follows cebeci and bradshaw 1977 9 δ u 0 k 2 25 1 κ 0 253 k sin π 2 log k 2 25 log 90 2 25 2 25 k 90 1 κ 0 253 k k 90 the cebeci and bradshaw δ u model was used to describe a sand grit surface song et al 2021a 2021c as claimed in demirel et al 2019 δ u models of real surfaces are bounded with the monotonic colebrook and inflectional nikuradse type δ u in order to determine u τ iteratively at a certain x c f for a smooth surface condition for this particular x should be calculated schoenherr proposed a friction line as follows schoenherr 1932 10 0 242 c f log r n c f where c f is the frictional resistance coefficient of a flat plate by differentiating equation 10 the equation for c f is derived speranza et al 2019 11 c f 0 558 c f 0 558 2 c f the proposed method is based on the longitudinal discretization of a flat plate for every x coordinate c f r is calculated after the iterative determination of u τ r thereafter r n x r for the determined c f r is calculated using the following equation 12 r n x r r n x s c f s c f r where r n x s and c f s are the reynolds number and the local frictional coefficient determined for the x coordinate respectively c f r is the local frictional resistance coefficient for a rough surface and r n x r is the reynolds number for which c f r is determined finally c f is calculated using the following equation pullin et al 2017 13 c f 1 l 0 l c f d x where l is the length of a flat plate equation 12 is solved numerically using the trapezoidal rule for a non uniform grid as follows 14 c f 1 l k 1 n c f x k 1 c f x k 2 δ x k it should be noted that the proposed method allows for an analysis of the effect of streamwise inhomogeneous roughness as the δ u value can be set at zero in the areas where roughness is not present i e at this x c f for a smooth surface condition will be used the flowchart of the proposed method can be seen in fig 1 as can be seen from the flowchart firstly longitudinal discretization of a flat plate is done which is followed by the calculation of r n x c f and c f for every x i thereafter u τ r is iteratively determined by equating equation 5 and the equation for the δ u model this is followed by the calculation of c f r for a certain x i using equation 4 and with the determination of the corresponding r n x r i e x r using equation 12 if the value of x r is lower than the length of a flat plate l the procedure is repeated for the next x i otherwise c f r is determined using equation 14 it should be noted that c f using the schoenherr friction line as well as the determination of u τ r is performed iteratively for every x i if a flat plate is discretized with a higher number of intervals spacings segments the computational time will increase as will the possibility for errors in order to prevent user error as well as to reduce computational time a numerical code has been developed within python the numerical code is written using the libraries scipy and numpy and the input parameters for this code are the water characteristics κ l ship speed v the number of segments k the type of δ u model and the starting position of roughness x a as well as the ending position of roughness x b thereafter the code allows for the rapid calculation of c f for the investigated flat plate and the u τ or k distributions as well since the developed code enables the rapid and accurate calculation of c f for the investigated flat plate the longitudinal discretization of a flat plate can be easily performed with a higher number of intervals in this paper it was decided to subdivide the smooth flat plate uniformly into 1000 intervals i e the δ x for the calculation of c f for smooth plates is equal to l 1000 with longitudinal discretization which includes 1000 intervals relative deviation calculated using equation 15 between c f obtained using a novel method and the schoenherr friction line for a smooth flat plate was lower than 0 25 which was considered to be accurate enough based on this it was decided to keep the same number of intervals for the longitudinal discretization of a rough flat plate as well nevertheless one can monitor the obtained results with a different number of intervals and calculate the difference between the obtained c f for a rough flat plate in this way once this difference is below a certain level which the user sets the sufficient number of intervals is determined 2 3 case study verification and validation studies the applicability of the proposed method for the determination of c f for a rough flat plate is demonstrated using the example of two flat plates representing a containership kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 the main particulars including l plate breadth b edge radius r and wetted surface s of the investigated flat plates are presented in table 1 the plates are investigated at two speeds v 1 corresponding to the design speed of the investigated ship i e flat plate and v 2 corresponding to the slow steaming speed of the investigated ship five cases with a different roughness distribution are analysed in order to investigate the applicability of the proposed method for the prediction of c f for a rough flat plate for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness fig 2 in addition the method was tested for two types of δ u models the grigson equation 8 and cebeci and bradshaw equation 9 models for the grigson δ u model two rough conditions are analysed one corresponding to a surface coated with a fouling release fr coating with an initial surface condition quantified as high roughness k 5 1 μm and one corresponding to a surface coated with a controlled depletion polymer cdp coating with an initial surface condition quantified as high roughness k 14 98 μm these k values are taken from table 3 from the paper andersson et al 2020 and are obtained using the grigson δ u model for a surface condition which can be related to an approximate ahr of 250 μm for the cebeci and bradshaw δ u model one rough condition is analysed which corresponds to a 60 80 grit sand grain surface k 610 69 μm song et al 2021 c in the remaining part of the paper abbreviations for rough surface conditions are used for example gfr1 which corresponds to a flat plate coated over the entire surface with an fr coating with an initial surface condition quantified as high roughness the obtained values of c f for a rough flat plate for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness are compared with those obtained using the cfd approach based on the modified wall function approach in addition the obtained c f for rough flat plate for homogeneous roughness is compared with the results obtained using the granville method while the obtained c f for a smooth flat plate are validated with the schoenherr friction line i e equation 10 relative deviations are calculated as follows 15 r d c f nm c f sfl c f sfl where c f nm and c f sfl are the frictional resistance coefficients obtained using the novel method and equation 10 respectively it should be noted that the r d between c f nm and c f obtained using the granville method or the cfd approach are calculated analogously beside r d additional performance evaluation criteria are used to compare the obtained c f using the cfd approach and a new method these criteria include the root mean square error r m s e the mean absolute relative error m a r e the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mean absolute error m a e which are determined as follows niazkar et al 2019 16 r m s e 1 n i 1 n c f nm c f cfd 2 17 m a r e 1 n i 1 n c f nm c f cfd c f cfd 18 r 2 i 1 n c f cfd i 1 n c f cfd n c f nm i 1 n c f nm n i 1 n c f cfd i 1 n c f cfd n 2 c f nm i 1 n c f nm n 2 2 19 m a e 1 n i 1 n c f nm c f cfd where n is the number of investigated cases which in this study amounts to 16 one smooth surface condition and 15 rough surface conditions the cfd approach is based on rans equations and on the implementation of δ u models presented with equations 8 and 9 within the wall function more details on the cfd approach can be found in farkas et al 2020a cfd simulations are carried out for a flat plate entirely immersed in water and where only a quarter of the computational domain is discretized i e the symmetry boundary condition is applied on both the symmetry plane and the top boundary the remaining boundary conditions are as follows the velocity inlet for the inlet boundary the pressure outlet for the outlet boundary the slip wall for the side boundary and no slip wall for the plate surface the k ω sst turbulence model is applied for the turbulence closure problem and the finite volume method is applied for the discretization of governing equations the governing equations are solved with a segregated solver and a second order upwind scheme is used for the convective terms the solution procedure is based on the simple algorithm the computational domain is discretized carefully using an unstructured hexahedral mesh with special attention paid to the discretization of the prism layer and plate edges fig 3 thus the first cell height is set according to conditions y k and y 50 farkas et al 2020a in order to estimate a sufficient number of cells for the discretization of the computational domain as well as to calculate numerical uncertainty a verification study is performed using three different mesh resolutions thus coarse mesh for a kcs plate has approximately 1 m cells medium mesh around 1 7 m cells and fine mesh around 2 9 m cells while for a kvlcc2 plate coarse mesh has around 0 8 m cells medium mesh around 1 2 m and fine mesh around 2 1 m cells the grid convergence index gci method is used for the calculation of grid uncertainties u g and iteration uncertainty is considered to be negligible more details on the gci method can be found in farkas et al 2020b it should be noted that the verification study is performed for the smooth kcs and kvlcc2 flat plates as demonstrated in farkas et al 2020a 2020d 2020e the implementation of the δ u model does not cause an increase in numerical uncertainty in table 2 the obtained grid uncertainties in the prediction of frictional resistance r f are shown as can be seen low values of u g are obtained i e 1 377 for the kcs plate and 0 693 for the kvlcc2 plate it should be noted that the remaining numerical simulations are carried out using fine mesh 3 results and discussion a detailed analysis of the obtained results using the proposed method is presented in this section the effects of roughness are analysed using both the integral c f value and c f distribution over the flat plate this section is divided into homogeneous roughness and inhomogeneous roughness to demonstrate the effect of spatially varying roughness the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness through a comparison of the obtained results using the proposed method with the cfd results or results obtained using the granville similarity law scaling method 3 1 smooth flat plates first the obtained results using the novel method and the cfd approach for smooth flat plates are analysed the obtained c f for smooth plates are presented in table 3 along with r d calculated using equation 15 it should be noted that the proposed method calculates c f using equation 14 and the c f values for a certain x which are determined according to equation 11 as can be seen from table 3 the obtained c f cfd and c f nm have low r d from c f sfl the highest r d between the cfd results and the results obtained using equation 10 amounts to 1 019 while the highest r d between the results obtained using the novel method nm and the results obtained using equation 10 is equal to 0 232 3 2 homogeneous roughness after a comparison of the obtained c f for smooth plates the homogeneous roughness denoted with 1 is analysed fig 2 the impact of the homogeneous roughness on the flow is analysed through the integral c f values the c f distribution over the flat plate as well as the integral k values and k distribution over the flat plate the obtained c f using the novel method the cfd approach and the granville similarity law scaling method for homogeneously rough plates are presented in table 4 in addition r d between c f nm and c f granville as well as r d between c f nm and c f cfd are presented in table 4 as can be seen the obtained values of r d are low which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method the highest r d between c f nm and c f granville is obtained for kcs cb1 at 24 kn which is equal to 1 234 while the highest r d between c f nm and c f cfd is obtained for kcs cb1 at 19 kn and is equal to 2 328 it can be seen from the obtained c f values that the values of c f nm are slightly higher than those of c f cfd for all investigated cases on the other hand the values of c f nm are slightly lower than c f granville for the investigated cases of cb1 which represents rougher condition than gfr1 or gcdp1 the integral k values obtained using the cfd approach and the novel method along with r d are presented in table 5 it is clear that the k values are accurately assessed using the proposed method and the highest r d for the investigated cases is obtained for kvlcc2 cb1 at 12 kn which is equal to 5 832 for all investigated cases slightly higher k values are obtained using the proposed method in comparison with the cfd approach since integral k values are very similar for the proposed method and the cfd approach it can be concluded that the average δ u values are also similar however it is very important to determine whether the k distribution along the rough flat plate is also accurately predicted therefore the k distribution along kcs gcdp1 at 24 kn is analysed fig 4 it should be noted that for the cfd approach the k distribution along kcs gcdp1 is assessed at the plane z 2 25 m as can be seen from fig 4 the k distribution along kcs gcdp1 at 24 kn is accurately predicted using nm in comparison with the cfd approach from this figure it can be seen that higher k values are obtained using the cfd approach compared to nm at the beginning and at the end of the flat plate this is expected since at the plate edges in the cfd simulations the higher values of c f and thus of u τ as well are obtained even for smooth plate in comparison to c f predicted using equation 11 fig 5 higher c f values at the plate edges occurred due to the influence of the leading and trailing plate edges on the flow which can be predicted using the cfd approach similar peaks of c f at the leading and trailing edges of a flat plate are also noticed in song et al 2021 c on the other hand slightly higher k values are obtained using nm in comparison to the cfd approach for x 50 m which can be observed in fig 4 this can also be explained by a slightly different prediction of c f with the cfd approach and equation 11 and thus a slightly different prediction of u τ in this region thus it can be concluded that if the numerical friction line for c f s is used instead of equation 11 a lower r d between k nm and k cfd as well as between c f nm and c f cfd would be obtained nevertheless equation 11 can be used for the prediction of c f s at the given x since the obtained r d presented in tables 4 and 5 are low and in this way additional analysis regarding the numerical friction line for smooth flat plate is not required an accurate prediction of u τ and k distributions along the rough plate which is allowed using nm represents an important advantage over the granville similarity law scaling method which can take into account only one k value over the entire rough plate length nm can take into account various δ u values over the rough plate while the granville method can consider only one δ u value this is highlighted as a significant drawback of the granville method song et al 2019 which can obviously be overcome with nm after the analysis regarding the k distribution along the flat plate length c f distributions over kcs gcdp1 at 24 kn obtained using the cfd approach and nm are compared fig 6 from this figure it is clear that the c f distribution is accurately predicted using nm in comparison to the c f distribution obtained using the cfd approach the obtained c f distribution is in line with previous findings song et al 2021 c where the authors also obtained a peak in the c f distribution near the leading edge of the plate after this position the c f values gradually decline until the trailing edge of the plate where another peak in c f distribution occurs it should be noted that nm did not predict this peak near the trailing edge of the plate since the c f function obtained using equation 11 represents a monotonically decreasing function however since the c f value is of interest for the engineering community which represents the average value of c f over the entire flat plate and since this second peak in the c f distribution near the trailing edge of the plate occurs only in the small portion of the flat plate the c f value is adequately predicted using nm table 4 it is clear that this peak would be adequately predicted using nm if the numerical friction line for the c f s distribution is applied as already noted due to the simplicity of equation 11 and due to the low r d between c f nm and c f cfd as well as between c f nm and c f granville it can be concluded that nm can be used for the accurate prediction of c f for a homogeneously rough plate 3 3 inhomogeneous roughness after the applicability of nm has been demonstrated for homogeneous roughness the applicability of nm in the prediction of c f for a plate of inhomogeneous roughness is analysed firstly it is important to analyse the c f distribution along the plate which is covered by homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness in fig 7 the obtained c f distributions along the smooth kcs kcs gcdp1 kcs gcdp2 and kcs gcdp3 plates at 24 kn obtained using the cfd approach are presented as can be seen the c f distributions along the plates covered with inhomogeneous roughness gcdp2 and gcdp3 deviate from the c f distributions along the homogeneously rough gcdp1 and smooth plates for x l 2 the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp2 plate is the same as the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp1 plate and the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp3 plate is the same as the c f distribution along the smooth kcs plate however for x l 2 a sudden jump in c f occurs where the roughness either ends gcdp2 or starts gcdp3 thus for x l 2 the c f distributions along the kcs gcdp2 and kcs gcdp3 plates deviate from the c f distributions along the kcs gcdp1 and smooth plates for example the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp2 plate immediately after l 2 is reduced not only below the rough c f distribution gcdp1 but below the smooth c f distribution downstream on the other hand the c f distribution along the kcs cdp3 plate immediately after l 2 increases not only above the smooth c f distribution but above the rough c f distribution downstream the same behaviour of the c f distribution due to inhomogeneous roughness is observed in suastika et al 2021 and examined in hanson et al 2016 li et al 2019 wood 1982 smits and wood 1985 the jumps in the c f distribution i e the overshoot or undershoot of the c f values are explained with a change in the local r n and the occurrence of sudden roughness thus if the flow passes from a smooth to rough wall gcdp3 due to the occurrence of sudden roughness after l 2 a new internal boundary layer will be formed this results in a large momentum flux away from the wall since the surface accommodates to this condition before relaxing to the equilibrium with the new surface and a step up jump in c f distribution occurs on the other hand if the flow passes from a rough to a smooth wall gcdp2 due to a sudden change from the rough to the smooth wall an undershoot in c f occurs this undershoot in a turbulent flow can be explained by the mixing behaviour due to the presence of roughness the turbulent intensity of the flow is higher in comparison to the smooth plate therefore after l 2 the flow does not require more mixing up and the turbulent intensity as well as the reynolds stress in the fluid are reduced which causes the undershoot in c f suastika et al 2021 due to the undershoot or overshoot in the c f distribution caused by inhomogeneous roughness the c f values obtained for gcdp1 or for a smooth flat plate after l 2 cannot be utilized in equation 14 for the calculation of c f for gcdp3 or gcdp2 respectively without any correction if the c f values are applied without any correction c f for gcdp2 will be overpredicted and c f for gcdp3 will be underpredicted therefore the calculation of c f for the flat plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness is slightly modified within the novel method firstly the c f s and c f r distributions are determined in the same way as explained in section 2 in order to take into account the undershoot or overshoot in the c f distribution the longitudinal integration which is defined in equation 14 is slightly modified the undershoot in the c f distribution which occurs for example in the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp2 plate is taken into account in such a way that for x r l 2 the c f r k and c f r k 1 values along with δ x r k x r k x r k 1 are applied and for x r l 2 the c f s k and c f s k 1 values along with δ x r k x r k x r k 1 are applied in equation 14 however for x r l 2 the method uses shifted c f s values for example for the first x k higher than l 2 the c f s value obtained for x s which corresponds to x r l 2 along with δ x r k x r k x r k 1 is applied the remaining part of the c f distribution along the flat plate after l 2 is integrated in the same way thus the influence of roughness in the first half of the flat plate is reflected in an increase in r n x s for the remaining half of the flat plate the overshoot in the c f distribution which occurs for example in the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp3 plate is taken into account in such a way that for x s l 2 the c f s k and c f s k 1 values along with δ x s k x s k x s k 1 are applied and for x s l 2 the c f r k and c f r k 1 values along with δ x s k x s k x s k 1 are applied in equation 14 the method for x s l 2 uses shifted the c f r values for example for the first x k higher than l 2 the c f r value obtained for x r which corresponds to x s l 2 along with δ x s k x s k x s k 1 is applied the remaining part of the c f distribution along the flat plate after l 2 is integrated in the same way consequently the influence of the presence of roughness in the second half of the flat plate which results in a large momentum flux away from the wall is reflected in the increased u τ s values and in this way in the increased u τ r values for the remaining half of the flat plate in comparison to those that would occur if the flat plate was homogeneously rough the obtained c f for plates covered with inhomogeneous roughness using the nm and the cfd approach as well as r d are presented in tables 6 and 7 as can be seen satisfactory agreement between c f obtained using the nm and the cfd approach is achieved in addition it can be seen that the obtained values of c f using the nm are slightly higher than those obtained using the cfd approach for all cases the highest r d is obtained for the kcs cb2 plate at 19 kn which is equal to 2 576 the obtained r d for plates covered with roughness in only a quarter of the length are lower and the highest r d is obtained for the kvlcc2 cb4 plate at 12 kn which amounts to 1 399 it should be noted that the obtained c f for smooth plates using the nm are also slightly higher than those obtained using the cfd approach from c f obtained using the nm it is clear that the proposed method can account for the longitudinal position of the roughness thus the values of c f obtained using the nm are higher for roughness condition 2 than for 3 and for roughness condition 4 than for 5 even though the percentage of surface coverage with roughness for those conditions is the same i e 50 and 25 this represents an important benefit of the proposed method because it was demonstrated that the surface roughness in the forward part of the surface causes higher δ c f than the surface roughness in the rear part of the surface song et al 2021b 2021c suastika et al 2021 apart from the integral values of c f the obtained values of δ c f are also important as those values are used in the ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c the obtained values of δ c f due to the presence of roughness at a higher speed v 1 obtained using the nm and the cfd approach are presented in fig 8 while fig 9 presents the obtained values of δ c f at a lower speed v 2 it should be noted that the values of δ c f in figs 8 and 9 are given as percentages which are calculated using the following equation 20 δ c f c f r c f s c f s 100 as can be seen from figs 8 and 9 satisfactory agreement between δ c f obtained using the nm and the cfd approach is achieved for all investigated cases it should be noted that the values of δ c f obtained using the nm are slightly higher than those obtained using the cfd approach in all investigated cases higher values of δ c f are obtained for the kcs plate than for the kvlcc2 plate using both methods this is expected since the k l values for the kcs plate are higher than those for the kvlcc2 plate farkas et al 2020a in addition the kcs plate is investigated at a higher speed meaning that the c f s for the kcs plate is lower than the c f s for the kvlcc2 plate which then causes higher δ c f from figs 8 and 9 it can be also seen that higher values of δ c f are obtained at v 1 using both methods which can be explained by the lower c f s values at v 1 than at v 2 as well as by the higher k values after the integral values of c f and δ c f are analysed the c f distributions along the plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness are investigated in fig 10 the obtained c f distributions for the kcs gcdp2 and s plates at 24 kn using the nm and the cfd approach are presented from fig 10 it can be seen that the proposed method can take into account the undershoot in the c f distribution which is caused by the presence of roughness in the first part of the flat plate the obtained c f distribution of the kcs gcdp2 plate after l 2 is below the c f distribution of the kcs s plate it should be noted that the jump in the c f distribution immediately after the change in the surface condition i e from the rough to the smooth surface for gcdp2 at x l 2 cannot be accounted for using the proposed method nevertheless this jump in the c f distribution occurs only in the small portion of the plate and since the integral value of c f is of interest this will not cause a significant r d from the cfd result fig 11 presents the obtained c f distributions for the kcs gcdp3 and gcdp1 plates at 24 kn using the nm and the cfd approach fig 11 shows that the proposed method can take into account the overshoot in the c f distribution which is caused by the presence of roughness in the second part of the flat plate the obtained c f distribution of the kcs gcdp3 plate after l 2 is above the c f distribution of the kcs cdp1 plate the jump in the c f distribution immediately after the change in the surface condition i e from the smooth to the rough surface for gcdp3 at x l 2 cannot be accounted for using the proposed method nevertheless as for gcdp2 this jump in the c f distribution occurs only in the small portion of the plate and therefore will not cause significant r d from the cfd result thus it can be concluded that after the sudden jump in the c f distribution at x l 2 which is not accurately accounted for using the nm compared to the cfd approach the c f distribution is accurately described for both the kcs gcdp2 and kcs gcdp3 plates in comparison with the cfd approach therefore in the largest part of the plate the c f values are adequately determined using the nm compared to the cfd approach which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method for the prediction of c f for the rough flat plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness finally additional performance evaluation criteria are analysed in order to make an additional comparison of the obtained c f using the proposed method and the cfd approach the obtained results are given in table 8 as can be seen low values of r m s e m a r e and m a e are obtained while r 2 is very high which demonstrates that the proposed method can predict c f reliably i e the predicted c f values are almost the same as those obtained using the cfd approach which represents the most comprehensive approach for the prediction of the roughness effects on the ship hydrodynamic performance 4 conclusions the flow around the surface covered with inhomogeneous roughness represents a complex phenomenon and the c f distribution along the plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness cannot be simply predicted using the c f distribution of a homogeneously rough plate since an overshoot and undershoot in c f distribution occur there are a variety of causes of hull roughness which is mostly inhomogeneous which highlights the importance of determining c f for an inhomogeneous rough surface within the optimization of a maintenance schedule it is important to predict the effect of roughness on ship performance accurately and rapidly thus in the literature the granville similarity law scaling method has imposed itself as a valuable prediction method for the determination of c f within ppm farkas et al 2020c 2021a or for an estimation of the equivalent sand grain roughness height which is thereafter used as a performance indicator oliveira et al 2020 however the drawbacks of the granville method are highlighted within the literature and using this method the c f of the plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness cannot be predicted the main aim of this study was to propose a novel method to represent a more comprehensive method than the granville method and which could be used for the prediction of c f for a plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness the applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated for smooth homogeneously rough and inhomogeneously rough surface conditions in this paper inhomogeneous roughness was analysed using a simplified roughness pattern with a step change from a smooth to a rough surface condition or vice versa the main findings of the performed research are a novel method for the prediction of c f for rough surfaces the proposed method can consider the non uniform distribution of u τ and in this way the roughness reynolds number k and δ u values as well which represents an important benefit over the granville similarity law scaling method even for homogeneously rough surfaces the method can take into account the non uniform distribution of roughness and its effect on the c f of a flat plate an in house numerical code is developed based on the proposed method which allows for the rapid and accurate assessment of c f for rough surfaces the applicability of the proposed method in the prediction of c f for rough surfaces is demonstrated the proposed method is applicable to various surface conditions defined with δ u models and longitudinal positions of roughness the proposed method can be easily implemented using the ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c and in this way can upgrade the ppm for a more comprehensive determination of δ c f future research will focus on undertaking several studies the development of a numerical line for the c f distribution of smooth plates would be of importance utilizing this line for c f distribution would allow for a comparison between the cfd approach and the novel method using the same input data additional studies regarding the overshoot and undershoot in the c f distribution due to a step change in the surface condition would be of great interest the findings from these studies could be implemented in the proposed method in order to allow for a more accurate assessment of the c f distribution for plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness since the fouling of the marine propeller is also inhomogeneous future studies will focus on estimating the propeller performance in open water conditions and behind the hull for a propeller fouled with inhomogeneous roughness in this way it will be possible to make a more reliable performance

20313,ship performance is largely influenced by roughness on immersed surfaces which is mostly inhomogeneous therefore the prediction of the effects of roughness on ship performance is of crucial importance even though it has several drawbacks the granville similarity law scaling method is widely reported in the literature for predicting the frictional resistance coefficient of a rough surface lately the cfd approach based on a modified wall function approach has also been used since it allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of roughness in this paper a novel method for assessing the frictional resistance coefficient for rough surfaces is proposed the proposed method can take into account the non uniform distribution of friction velocity as well as the roughness reynolds number and thus the non uniform distribution of roughness function values can be predicted along a rough surface additionally the proposed method can consider the non uniform distribution of roughness and its effect on the frictional coefficient of a flat plate based on the proposed method an in house numerical code is developed allowing for the rapid and accurate assessment of the frictional resistance coefficient for a rough surface the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with the cfd approach for several surface conditions defined with different roughness function models and the longitudinal position of roughness a comparison is made of two flat plates representing one containership and one tanker at two different speeds the obtained relative deviations in the predicted frictional resistance coefficients for all surface conditions are lower than 2 5 therefore it is demonstrated that the proposed method can be used for estimating the frictional resistance coefficient of various surface conditions defined with roughness function models and the longitudinal positions of roughness keywords frictional resistance coefficient friction velocity roughness inhomogeneous roughness homogeneous roughness 1 introduction the presence of roughness and the analysis of its influence is important in various engineering applications it can cause an increase in the frictional resistance coefficient which represents the ratio between frictional resistance and the product of hydrodynamic pressure and a wetted surface in this way the presence of roughness affects the performance of the ship propeller turbine wave energy device etc however a roughness coefficient and its determination also represent an essential step in the numerical modelling of flow and sediment transport in channels and natural streams the roughness coefficient causes a retardation of the flow and it is included in the flow resistance equation niazkar et al 2019 through the flow resistance coefficient which describes the relationship between the pressure drop and the corresponding flow rate ship performance is largely affected by the presence of roughness on immersed surfaces hull roughness can be caused by numerous processes which are often divided into those that occur during the predelivery stage and in processes which occur during the service of the ship yeginbayeva and atlar 2018 over the last few years with increasing emphasis on the need to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions the importance of reducing hull roughness during the predelivery phase has been highlighted improvements in antifouling coatings af as well as in their application have led to a reduction of hull roughness which leads to a reduction of the ship total resistance seok and park 2020 consequently drag characterization studies of af coatings in newly applied and clean conditions are becoming more frequent and are gaining in importance erbas 2019 studied mean velocity profiles frictional resistance roughness functions δ u and correlations between roughness and frictional resistance for new generation af coatings ünal et al 2012 investigated the relative boundary layer and the roughness and drag characteristics of some novel nanostructured coatings the authors demonstrated the importance of developing new correlations for the prediction of the frictional resistance of af coatings as the δ u values of af coatings are non zero regardless of their very low roughness reynolds numbers k ünal 2015 presented a new correlation for the determination of the roughness length scale k and some roughness parameters for af coatings ünal also discussed the differences between various af coatings the impact of different roughness calculation methods as well as the impact of the application of af coatings on frictional resistance li et al 2018 investigated the impact of cu2o particle size which is a common biocide in af coatings on the roughness of af coatings as well as on the frictional resistance properties of af coatings it was found that for particles higher than 12 μm the roughness characteristics as well as frictional resistance increased as the particle size increased while for lower particle sizes this trend is not the same and frictional resistance was higher than expected yeginbayeva and atlar 2018 carried out a drag characterization study for af coatings which were applied on plates with different initial surface roughness conditions the authors proposed various correlations for the prediction of k based on the various roughness parameters and demonstrated the benefits in the terms of the frictional resistance of fouling release fr coatings which have lower roughness over biocidal coatings the development of coatings with lower roughness can be noticed if the recommended roughness value from the ittc performance prediction method ppm ittc 2017 for average hull roughness ahr i e 150 μm is analysed for example seok and park 2020 demonstrated that the average hull roughness ahr of a newly built car ferry is significantly lower than the ahr recommended by ittc 2017 the importance of a new method for the estimation of an increase in the frictional resistance coefficient δ c f through the application of certain coatings has been highlighted several times yeginbayeva and atlar 2018 however currently the ittc procedure for correlating between roughness and drag only accounts for a single roughness amplitude parameter ittc 2011a this procedure depends on the application of a practical equation for roughness allowance in terms of ahr the requirement for further testing and correlation studies for additional support regarding this correlation is underlined in ittc 2011b recently the method for the determination of δ c f due to the application of certain af coatings i e the modelling of hull roughness has been proposed in andersson et al 2020 speranza et al 2019 namely andersson et al 2020 reviewed the application of various δ u and different strategies to determine k in addition the authors highlighted the importance of a drag characterization study for the appropriate selection of adequate δ u for certain rough surfaces speranza et al 2019 presented a guideline for the estimation of the frictional resistance of a ship covered with various af coatings the authors outlined and discussed the similarities and dissimilarities with other methods besides roughness which occurs in the predelivery stage roughness which occurs during the service of a ship is even more important and is caused by many processes including mechanical chemical and electrochemical ones as well as the settling of biofouling organisms song et al 2021 b due to an increase in roughness the frictional resistance of a ship is increased which significantly affects ship performance i e there is an increase in fuel consumption and engine stress as well as a decrease in ship speed bixler and bhushan 2012 the importance of improving the hull fouling condition is emphasized in schultz et al 2011 where the authors demonstrated significant economic savings related to this improvement the cleaning of the hull and propeller will cause an increase in ship energy efficiency however it is very important to accurately determine the optimal time for such cleaning it is very useful to predict the impact of roughness on the ship performance which can demonstrate the significance of hull and propeller cleaning and which may be useful in the optimization of maintenance schedules song et al 2020 a the impact of roughness on ship performance can be determined using various approaches which are summarised in farkas et al 2020 e these approaches can be divided into statistical studies performance monitoring and investigations related to the roughness effect on flow the iso 19030 procedure represents the current best practice for an approach based on performance monitoring nevertheless this procedure has several drawbacks the correction of scattered measured data which is a very difficult procedure the rather strict filtering of the measured data and the fact that waves due to swell are not filtered additionally there are problems related to the difference of reported averaged values accidental errors and intentional false reporting of the noon reports regardless of these disadvantages an approach based on performance monitoring has been widely adopted nowadays procedures based on investigations related to the roughness effect on flow have also gained in importance lately in the literature there are several methods for the prediction of the effect of roughness on ship hydrodynamic performance throughout its history the ittc has recommended several approaches for the analysis of roughness allowance in the ittc 1978 ppm the bowden and davison 1974 equation was proposed to determine roughness allowance based on the sea trials of real ships although this formulation was criticized just after its adoption it remained within the ittc ppm until 1990 in 1990 this equation was replaced with an equation proposed by townsin and dey 1990 in 2011 the ittc differentiated roughness allowance from correlation allowance ittc 2011a and this estimation has remained the same until now thus the ittc 1978 ppm ittc 2017 considers roughness effects through roughness allowance with the townsin and dey equation based on the roughness measurements of rough painted surfaces and their statistical analysis townsin 2003 which consequently cannot consider the effects of biofouling kresic and haskell 1983 proposed an approach which can examine biofouling effects on the ship hydrodynamic characteristics through fouling equivalent roughness which depends on the hull roughness factor the number of port days the coating effectiveness factor and factor c which considers whether the biofouling is located at the bottom or on the side of a hull however the main drawback of their approach lies in the estimation of roughness heights for surfaces fouled with biofouling which is based on historical correlations the granville similarity law scaling method granville 1958 represents an important method which can be used for the prediction of the impact of roughness on δ c f the method is based on the wall similarity hypothesis which is proven to be valid if the relative roughness is sufficiently small castro 2007 demonstrated that this hypothesis holds if the ratio between the boundary layer thickness and the roughness length scale is above 5 although the application of the granville similarity law scaling method can be observed in several studies in the literature schultz 2004 2007 demirel et al 2019 uzun et al 2020 this method has several drawbacks which are discussed in song et al 2019 thus although it allows for a rapid assessment the granville method can only assess the roughness effect on δ c f of a flat plate having the same length as the ship and it cannot determine the roughness effect on other ship hydrodynamic characteristics furthermore it considers only one value of friction velocity u τ and consequently only one value of δ u over the entire flat plate which is a simplification since it is known that u τ varies even on a flat plate farkas et al 2020c proposed a novel ppm for fouled surfaces which can account for the effects of roughness on the ship hydrodynamic performance the applicability of this method is demonstrated for the prediction of propeller performance in open water conditions farkas et al 2021b as well as for the prediction of the ship s hydrodynamic performance farkas et al 2021a the main limitation of this method is that the roughness effect on wave resistance is neglected and that the prediction of δ c f is carried out using the granville method lately the application of the cfd approach based on the implementation of the δ u model within the wall function for the problems related to ship hydrodynamics has expanded farkas et al 2020a 2020d garcia et al 2020 song et al 2020 c thus farkas et al 2020a assessed the impact of hard fouling on the resistance characteristics of two merchant ships while the impact of hard fouling on the open water characteristics and self propulsion characteristics of three propellers and three merchant ships has also been investigated farkas et al 2020d song et al 2020c utilized the cfd approach based on the modified wall function for an estimation of the fouling effect on the resistance characteristics of different ship forms garcia et al 2020 investigated the resistance characteristics of initial and in service roughness using the cfd approach based on the modified wall function the authors demonstrated that the cfd approach can be a very effective tool for the determination of the impact of biofouling on ship performance this approach currently represents the most comprehensive approach for the prediction of the roughness effects on the ship hydrodynamic performance it has also been validated in song et al 2020 b for modelling the effects of roughness on ship resistance however the main drawback of the cfd approach is related to the computational cost and to the fact that for each ship or surface condition a new cfd simulation should be performed song et al 2021 a thus the cfd approach requires significantly more time to determine the effects of roughness on ship performance in comparison with the granville method or the ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2021a which could be of importance in the optimization of the maintenance schedule it is important to note that almost all studies in the literature related to ship hydrodynamics have considered uniformly distributed roughness over an immersed surface since roughness on immersed surfaces is non uniform primarily due to the non uniform distribution of biofouling the effect of heterogeneous roughness should be taken into account in order to reduce inaccuracies in the prediction of δ c f demirel et al 2017 experimental studies regarding the response of a turbulent boundary layer to a step change in surface roughness are presented in antonia and luxton 1971 1972 wood 1982 proposed a simple correlation for the growth of the internal layer after a step change in surface roughness based on a dimensional analysis hanson and ganapathisubramani 2016 experimentally analysed the development of a boundary layer past a change in surface roughness the authors proposed new mixed scaling for the near wall peak based on the corrected wake deficit and u τ li et al 2019 conducted an experimental and numerical study on the recovery of the wall shear stress of a turbulent boundary layer after an abrupt change from a rough to a smooth surface the authors found that any estimation of the wall shear stress based on the mean velocity profile in the buffer region or further away from the wall will likely underestimate its magnitude near the region where the change from the rough to the smooth surface condition occurs the longitudinal location of roughness affects δ c f and thus it is important to analyse heterogeneous roughness and its effect on frictional resistance song et al 2021b 2021c suastika et al 2021 song et al 2021c proposed a method based on the granville similarity law scaling method for the prediction of δ c f as a result of heterogeneous roughness however the proposed method can only consider the percentage of surface coverage with roughness and not the longitudinal position of roughness therefore the main objective of this paper is the development of a novel method to provide a more reliable assessment of the frictional resistance coefficient for a flat plate covered with a non uniform distribution of roughness to the best of the authors knowledge there is no universal method to take into account the effect of heterogeneous roughness on an increase in frictional resistance the present study adds to the current literature a novel method to consider the non uniform distribution of roughness and its effect on the frictional resistance of a flat plate this is of particular importance since roughness on an immersed surface is primarily non uniform the application of the proposed method can enable a more reliable prediction of the frictional resistance coefficient than the granville method further the proposed method can consider the non uniform distribution of u τ and in this way k and δ u values as well consequently the proposed method represents a more comprehensive method than the granville method even for uniformly distributed roughness 2 method and materials 2 1 background the wall similarity hypothesis claims that the outer layer of the turbulent boundary layer is not affected by the presence of roughness and all predictive models are based on this hypothesis chung et al 2021 thus the contribution of roughness is usually accounted for with δ u which is defined as follows chung et al 2021 1 δ u u s u r where u s and u r are the non dimensional velocity profiles for a smooth and rough surface respectively which are determined as follows schultz and flack 2007 2 u s u u τ 1 κ ln y π κ w y δ a 3 u r u u τ 1 κ ln y π κ w y δ δ u a where u is the velocity κ is the von karman constant y is the non dimensional wall distance π is the coles wake factor w is the wake function and a is the offset constant it should be noted that in equations 2 and 3 the contribution to mass and momentum transport across the whole boundary layer from the viscous sublayer and the buffer layer or a possible roughness sublayer is neglected since the influence of these regions is small if the reynolds number r n is large pullin et al 2017 the drag characterization of a rough surface can be defined as the determination of velocity decrement caused by the frictional resistance of a rough surface as a function of k every type of roughness has its own unique δ u as a function of k yeginbayeva et al 2019 and once it is experimentally assessed it can be utilized to determine the effects of roughness on the resistance of any arbitrary body covered with that type of roughness schultz et al 2003 the relation between u τ and the local frictional resistance coefficient c f is defined as follows ünal et al 2012 4 u τ c f 2 u where u is the velocity of the freestream velocity at the outer edge of the boundary layer granville 1987 proposed the determination of δ u values with the local method without displacement thickness which includes measurements of c f and r n of the smooth and rough surfaces using the following equation 5 δ u 2 c f s 2 c f r 19 7 c f 2 s c f 2 r at the same value of r n x c f r n x is defined as follows pullin et al 2017 6 r n x x u ν where x is the streamwise location and ν is the kinematic viscosity 2 2 method the proposed method is based on equating the certain δ u model with equation 5 and thereafter the iterative finding of u τ the δ u model depends on k which is defined as follows granville 1987 7 k k u τ ν where k is the roughness length scale which is chosen in a way that δ u values fall on the predefined δ u model demirel et al 2017 within this paper two different δ u models are used however it should be noted that the proposed method is applicable to any δ u model the first one is the grigson δ u model which represents the colebrook type of δ u model and it is defined as follows grigson 1992 8 δ u 1 κ ln 1 k the grigson δ u model has been used for the description of several roughness types such as af coatings andersson et al 2020 schultz 2004 barnacles demirel et al 2017 song et al 2019 2020a and hard fouling schultz 2004 farkas et al 2020a 2020d along with the appropriate k the second one is the cebeci and bradshaw δ u model which represents the nikuradse type of δ u model defined as follows cebeci and bradshaw 1977 9 δ u 0 k 2 25 1 κ 0 253 k sin π 2 log k 2 25 log 90 2 25 2 25 k 90 1 κ 0 253 k k 90 the cebeci and bradshaw δ u model was used to describe a sand grit surface song et al 2021a 2021c as claimed in demirel et al 2019 δ u models of real surfaces are bounded with the monotonic colebrook and inflectional nikuradse type δ u in order to determine u τ iteratively at a certain x c f for a smooth surface condition for this particular x should be calculated schoenherr proposed a friction line as follows schoenherr 1932 10 0 242 c f log r n c f where c f is the frictional resistance coefficient of a flat plate by differentiating equation 10 the equation for c f is derived speranza et al 2019 11 c f 0 558 c f 0 558 2 c f the proposed method is based on the longitudinal discretization of a flat plate for every x coordinate c f r is calculated after the iterative determination of u τ r thereafter r n x r for the determined c f r is calculated using the following equation 12 r n x r r n x s c f s c f r where r n x s and c f s are the reynolds number and the local frictional coefficient determined for the x coordinate respectively c f r is the local frictional resistance coefficient for a rough surface and r n x r is the reynolds number for which c f r is determined finally c f is calculated using the following equation pullin et al 2017 13 c f 1 l 0 l c f d x where l is the length of a flat plate equation 12 is solved numerically using the trapezoidal rule for a non uniform grid as follows 14 c f 1 l k 1 n c f x k 1 c f x k 2 δ x k it should be noted that the proposed method allows for an analysis of the effect of streamwise inhomogeneous roughness as the δ u value can be set at zero in the areas where roughness is not present i e at this x c f for a smooth surface condition will be used the flowchart of the proposed method can be seen in fig 1 as can be seen from the flowchart firstly longitudinal discretization of a flat plate is done which is followed by the calculation of r n x c f and c f for every x i thereafter u τ r is iteratively determined by equating equation 5 and the equation for the δ u model this is followed by the calculation of c f r for a certain x i using equation 4 and with the determination of the corresponding r n x r i e x r using equation 12 if the value of x r is lower than the length of a flat plate l the procedure is repeated for the next x i otherwise c f r is determined using equation 14 it should be noted that c f using the schoenherr friction line as well as the determination of u τ r is performed iteratively for every x i if a flat plate is discretized with a higher number of intervals spacings segments the computational time will increase as will the possibility for errors in order to prevent user error as well as to reduce computational time a numerical code has been developed within python the numerical code is written using the libraries scipy and numpy and the input parameters for this code are the water characteristics κ l ship speed v the number of segments k the type of δ u model and the starting position of roughness x a as well as the ending position of roughness x b thereafter the code allows for the rapid calculation of c f for the investigated flat plate and the u τ or k distributions as well since the developed code enables the rapid and accurate calculation of c f for the investigated flat plate the longitudinal discretization of a flat plate can be easily performed with a higher number of intervals in this paper it was decided to subdivide the smooth flat plate uniformly into 1000 intervals i e the δ x for the calculation of c f for smooth plates is equal to l 1000 with longitudinal discretization which includes 1000 intervals relative deviation calculated using equation 15 between c f obtained using a novel method and the schoenherr friction line for a smooth flat plate was lower than 0 25 which was considered to be accurate enough based on this it was decided to keep the same number of intervals for the longitudinal discretization of a rough flat plate as well nevertheless one can monitor the obtained results with a different number of intervals and calculate the difference between the obtained c f for a rough flat plate in this way once this difference is below a certain level which the user sets the sufficient number of intervals is determined 2 3 case study verification and validation studies the applicability of the proposed method for the determination of c f for a rough flat plate is demonstrated using the example of two flat plates representing a containership kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 the main particulars including l plate breadth b edge radius r and wetted surface s of the investigated flat plates are presented in table 1 the plates are investigated at two speeds v 1 corresponding to the design speed of the investigated ship i e flat plate and v 2 corresponding to the slow steaming speed of the investigated ship five cases with a different roughness distribution are analysed in order to investigate the applicability of the proposed method for the prediction of c f for a rough flat plate for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness fig 2 in addition the method was tested for two types of δ u models the grigson equation 8 and cebeci and bradshaw equation 9 models for the grigson δ u model two rough conditions are analysed one corresponding to a surface coated with a fouling release fr coating with an initial surface condition quantified as high roughness k 5 1 μm and one corresponding to a surface coated with a controlled depletion polymer cdp coating with an initial surface condition quantified as high roughness k 14 98 μm these k values are taken from table 3 from the paper andersson et al 2020 and are obtained using the grigson δ u model for a surface condition which can be related to an approximate ahr of 250 μm for the cebeci and bradshaw δ u model one rough condition is analysed which corresponds to a 60 80 grit sand grain surface k 610 69 μm song et al 2021 c in the remaining part of the paper abbreviations for rough surface conditions are used for example gfr1 which corresponds to a flat plate coated over the entire surface with an fr coating with an initial surface condition quantified as high roughness the obtained values of c f for a rough flat plate for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness are compared with those obtained using the cfd approach based on the modified wall function approach in addition the obtained c f for rough flat plate for homogeneous roughness is compared with the results obtained using the granville method while the obtained c f for a smooth flat plate are validated with the schoenherr friction line i e equation 10 relative deviations are calculated as follows 15 r d c f nm c f sfl c f sfl where c f nm and c f sfl are the frictional resistance coefficients obtained using the novel method and equation 10 respectively it should be noted that the r d between c f nm and c f obtained using the granville method or the cfd approach are calculated analogously beside r d additional performance evaluation criteria are used to compare the obtained c f using the cfd approach and a new method these criteria include the root mean square error r m s e the mean absolute relative error m a r e the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mean absolute error m a e which are determined as follows niazkar et al 2019 16 r m s e 1 n i 1 n c f nm c f cfd 2 17 m a r e 1 n i 1 n c f nm c f cfd c f cfd 18 r 2 i 1 n c f cfd i 1 n c f cfd n c f nm i 1 n c f nm n i 1 n c f cfd i 1 n c f cfd n 2 c f nm i 1 n c f nm n 2 2 19 m a e 1 n i 1 n c f nm c f cfd where n is the number of investigated cases which in this study amounts to 16 one smooth surface condition and 15 rough surface conditions the cfd approach is based on rans equations and on the implementation of δ u models presented with equations 8 and 9 within the wall function more details on the cfd approach can be found in farkas et al 2020a cfd simulations are carried out for a flat plate entirely immersed in water and where only a quarter of the computational domain is discretized i e the symmetry boundary condition is applied on both the symmetry plane and the top boundary the remaining boundary conditions are as follows the velocity inlet for the inlet boundary the pressure outlet for the outlet boundary the slip wall for the side boundary and no slip wall for the plate surface the k ω sst turbulence model is applied for the turbulence closure problem and the finite volume method is applied for the discretization of governing equations the governing equations are solved with a segregated solver and a second order upwind scheme is used for the convective terms the solution procedure is based on the simple algorithm the computational domain is discretized carefully using an unstructured hexahedral mesh with special attention paid to the discretization of the prism layer and plate edges fig 3 thus the first cell height is set according to conditions y k and y 50 farkas et al 2020a in order to estimate a sufficient number of cells for the discretization of the computational domain as well as to calculate numerical uncertainty a verification study is performed using three different mesh resolutions thus coarse mesh for a kcs plate has approximately 1 m cells medium mesh around 1 7 m cells and fine mesh around 2 9 m cells while for a kvlcc2 plate coarse mesh has around 0 8 m cells medium mesh around 1 2 m and fine mesh around 2 1 m cells the grid convergence index gci method is used for the calculation of grid uncertainties u g and iteration uncertainty is considered to be negligible more details on the gci method can be found in farkas et al 2020b it should be noted that the verification study is performed for the smooth kcs and kvlcc2 flat plates as demonstrated in farkas et al 2020a 2020d 2020e the implementation of the δ u model does not cause an increase in numerical uncertainty in table 2 the obtained grid uncertainties in the prediction of frictional resistance r f are shown as can be seen low values of u g are obtained i e 1 377 for the kcs plate and 0 693 for the kvlcc2 plate it should be noted that the remaining numerical simulations are carried out using fine mesh 3 results and discussion a detailed analysis of the obtained results using the proposed method is presented in this section the effects of roughness are analysed using both the integral c f value and c f distribution over the flat plate this section is divided into homogeneous roughness and inhomogeneous roughness to demonstrate the effect of spatially varying roughness the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness through a comparison of the obtained results using the proposed method with the cfd results or results obtained using the granville similarity law scaling method 3 1 smooth flat plates first the obtained results using the novel method and the cfd approach for smooth flat plates are analysed the obtained c f for smooth plates are presented in table 3 along with r d calculated using equation 15 it should be noted that the proposed method calculates c f using equation 14 and the c f values for a certain x which are determined according to equation 11 as can be seen from table 3 the obtained c f cfd and c f nm have low r d from c f sfl the highest r d between the cfd results and the results obtained using equation 10 amounts to 1 019 while the highest r d between the results obtained using the novel method nm and the results obtained using equation 10 is equal to 0 232 3 2 homogeneous roughness after a comparison of the obtained c f for smooth plates the homogeneous roughness denoted with 1 is analysed fig 2 the impact of the homogeneous roughness on the flow is analysed through the integral c f values the c f distribution over the flat plate as well as the integral k values and k distribution over the flat plate the obtained c f using the novel method the cfd approach and the granville similarity law scaling method for homogeneously rough plates are presented in table 4 in addition r d between c f nm and c f granville as well as r d between c f nm and c f cfd are presented in table 4 as can be seen the obtained values of r d are low which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method the highest r d between c f nm and c f granville is obtained for kcs cb1 at 24 kn which is equal to 1 234 while the highest r d between c f nm and c f cfd is obtained for kcs cb1 at 19 kn and is equal to 2 328 it can be seen from the obtained c f values that the values of c f nm are slightly higher than those of c f cfd for all investigated cases on the other hand the values of c f nm are slightly lower than c f granville for the investigated cases of cb1 which represents rougher condition than gfr1 or gcdp1 the integral k values obtained using the cfd approach and the novel method along with r d are presented in table 5 it is clear that the k values are accurately assessed using the proposed method and the highest r d for the investigated cases is obtained for kvlcc2 cb1 at 12 kn which is equal to 5 832 for all investigated cases slightly higher k values are obtained using the proposed method in comparison with the cfd approach since integral k values are very similar for the proposed method and the cfd approach it can be concluded that the average δ u values are also similar however it is very important to determine whether the k distribution along the rough flat plate is also accurately predicted therefore the k distribution along kcs gcdp1 at 24 kn is analysed fig 4 it should be noted that for the cfd approach the k distribution along kcs gcdp1 is assessed at the plane z 2 25 m as can be seen from fig 4 the k distribution along kcs gcdp1 at 24 kn is accurately predicted using nm in comparison with the cfd approach from this figure it can be seen that higher k values are obtained using the cfd approach compared to nm at the beginning and at the end of the flat plate this is expected since at the plate edges in the cfd simulations the higher values of c f and thus of u τ as well are obtained even for smooth plate in comparison to c f predicted using equation 11 fig 5 higher c f values at the plate edges occurred due to the influence of the leading and trailing plate edges on the flow which can be predicted using the cfd approach similar peaks of c f at the leading and trailing edges of a flat plate are also noticed in song et al 2021 c on the other hand slightly higher k values are obtained using nm in comparison to the cfd approach for x 50 m which can be observed in fig 4 this can also be explained by a slightly different prediction of c f with the cfd approach and equation 11 and thus a slightly different prediction of u τ in this region thus it can be concluded that if the numerical friction line for c f s is used instead of equation 11 a lower r d between k nm and k cfd as well as between c f nm and c f cfd would be obtained nevertheless equation 11 can be used for the prediction of c f s at the given x since the obtained r d presented in tables 4 and 5 are low and in this way additional analysis regarding the numerical friction line for smooth flat plate is not required an accurate prediction of u τ and k distributions along the rough plate which is allowed using nm represents an important advantage over the granville similarity law scaling method which can take into account only one k value over the entire rough plate length nm can take into account various δ u values over the rough plate while the granville method can consider only one δ u value this is highlighted as a significant drawback of the granville method song et al 2019 which can obviously be overcome with nm after the analysis regarding the k distribution along the flat plate length c f distributions over kcs gcdp1 at 24 kn obtained using the cfd approach and nm are compared fig 6 from this figure it is clear that the c f distribution is accurately predicted using nm in comparison to the c f distribution obtained using the cfd approach the obtained c f distribution is in line with previous findings song et al 2021 c where the authors also obtained a peak in the c f distribution near the leading edge of the plate after this position the c f values gradually decline until the trailing edge of the plate where another peak in c f distribution occurs it should be noted that nm did not predict this peak near the trailing edge of the plate since the c f function obtained using equation 11 represents a monotonically decreasing function however since the c f value is of interest for the engineering community which represents the average value of c f over the entire flat plate and since this second peak in the c f distribution near the trailing edge of the plate occurs only in the small portion of the flat plate the c f value is adequately predicted using nm table 4 it is clear that this peak would be adequately predicted using nm if the numerical friction line for the c f s distribution is applied as already noted due to the simplicity of equation 11 and due to the low r d between c f nm and c f cfd as well as between c f nm and c f granville it can be concluded that nm can be used for the accurate prediction of c f for a homogeneously rough plate 3 3 inhomogeneous roughness after the applicability of nm has been demonstrated for homogeneous roughness the applicability of nm in the prediction of c f for a plate of inhomogeneous roughness is analysed firstly it is important to analyse the c f distribution along the plate which is covered by homogeneous and inhomogeneous roughness in fig 7 the obtained c f distributions along the smooth kcs kcs gcdp1 kcs gcdp2 and kcs gcdp3 plates at 24 kn obtained using the cfd approach are presented as can be seen the c f distributions along the plates covered with inhomogeneous roughness gcdp2 and gcdp3 deviate from the c f distributions along the homogeneously rough gcdp1 and smooth plates for x l 2 the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp2 plate is the same as the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp1 plate and the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp3 plate is the same as the c f distribution along the smooth kcs plate however for x l 2 a sudden jump in c f occurs where the roughness either ends gcdp2 or starts gcdp3 thus for x l 2 the c f distributions along the kcs gcdp2 and kcs gcdp3 plates deviate from the c f distributions along the kcs gcdp1 and smooth plates for example the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp2 plate immediately after l 2 is reduced not only below the rough c f distribution gcdp1 but below the smooth c f distribution downstream on the other hand the c f distribution along the kcs cdp3 plate immediately after l 2 increases not only above the smooth c f distribution but above the rough c f distribution downstream the same behaviour of the c f distribution due to inhomogeneous roughness is observed in suastika et al 2021 and examined in hanson et al 2016 li et al 2019 wood 1982 smits and wood 1985 the jumps in the c f distribution i e the overshoot or undershoot of the c f values are explained with a change in the local r n and the occurrence of sudden roughness thus if the flow passes from a smooth to rough wall gcdp3 due to the occurrence of sudden roughness after l 2 a new internal boundary layer will be formed this results in a large momentum flux away from the wall since the surface accommodates to this condition before relaxing to the equilibrium with the new surface and a step up jump in c f distribution occurs on the other hand if the flow passes from a rough to a smooth wall gcdp2 due to a sudden change from the rough to the smooth wall an undershoot in c f occurs this undershoot in a turbulent flow can be explained by the mixing behaviour due to the presence of roughness the turbulent intensity of the flow is higher in comparison to the smooth plate therefore after l 2 the flow does not require more mixing up and the turbulent intensity as well as the reynolds stress in the fluid are reduced which causes the undershoot in c f suastika et al 2021 due to the undershoot or overshoot in the c f distribution caused by inhomogeneous roughness the c f values obtained for gcdp1 or for a smooth flat plate after l 2 cannot be utilized in equation 14 for the calculation of c f for gcdp3 or gcdp2 respectively without any correction if the c f values are applied without any correction c f for gcdp2 will be overpredicted and c f for gcdp3 will be underpredicted therefore the calculation of c f for the flat plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness is slightly modified within the novel method firstly the c f s and c f r distributions are determined in the same way as explained in section 2 in order to take into account the undershoot or overshoot in the c f distribution the longitudinal integration which is defined in equation 14 is slightly modified the undershoot in the c f distribution which occurs for example in the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp2 plate is taken into account in such a way that for x r l 2 the c f r k and c f r k 1 values along with δ x r k x r k x r k 1 are applied and for x r l 2 the c f s k and c f s k 1 values along with δ x r k x r k x r k 1 are applied in equation 14 however for x r l 2 the method uses shifted c f s values for example for the first x k higher than l 2 the c f s value obtained for x s which corresponds to x r l 2 along with δ x r k x r k x r k 1 is applied the remaining part of the c f distribution along the flat plate after l 2 is integrated in the same way thus the influence of roughness in the first half of the flat plate is reflected in an increase in r n x s for the remaining half of the flat plate the overshoot in the c f distribution which occurs for example in the c f distribution along the kcs gcdp3 plate is taken into account in such a way that for x s l 2 the c f s k and c f s k 1 values along with δ x s k x s k x s k 1 are applied and for x s l 2 the c f r k and c f r k 1 values along with δ x s k x s k x s k 1 are applied in equation 14 the method for x s l 2 uses shifted the c f r values for example for the first x k higher than l 2 the c f r value obtained for x r which corresponds to x s l 2 along with δ x s k x s k x s k 1 is applied the remaining part of the c f distribution along the flat plate after l 2 is integrated in the same way consequently the influence of the presence of roughness in the second half of the flat plate which results in a large momentum flux away from the wall is reflected in the increased u τ s values and in this way in the increased u τ r values for the remaining half of the flat plate in comparison to those that would occur if the flat plate was homogeneously rough the obtained c f for plates covered with inhomogeneous roughness using the nm and the cfd approach as well as r d are presented in tables 6 and 7 as can be seen satisfactory agreement between c f obtained using the nm and the cfd approach is achieved in addition it can be seen that the obtained values of c f using the nm are slightly higher than those obtained using the cfd approach for all cases the highest r d is obtained for the kcs cb2 plate at 19 kn which is equal to 2 576 the obtained r d for plates covered with roughness in only a quarter of the length are lower and the highest r d is obtained for the kvlcc2 cb4 plate at 12 kn which amounts to 1 399 it should be noted that the obtained c f for smooth plates using the nm are also slightly higher than those obtained using the cfd approach from c f obtained using the nm it is clear that the proposed method can account for the longitudinal position of the roughness thus the values of c f obtained using the nm are higher for roughness condition 2 than for 3 and for roughness condition 4 than for 5 even though the percentage of surface coverage with roughness for those conditions is the same i e 50 and 25 this represents an important benefit of the proposed method because it was demonstrated that the surface roughness in the forward part of the surface causes higher δ c f than the surface roughness in the rear part of the surface song et al 2021b 2021c suastika et al 2021 apart from the integral values of c f the obtained values of δ c f are also important as those values are used in the ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c the obtained values of δ c f due to the presence of roughness at a higher speed v 1 obtained using the nm and the cfd approach are presented in fig 8 while fig 9 presents the obtained values of δ c f at a lower speed v 2 it should be noted that the values of δ c f in figs 8 and 9 are given as percentages which are calculated using the following equation 20 δ c f c f r c f s c f s 100 as can be seen from figs 8 and 9 satisfactory agreement between δ c f obtained using the nm and the cfd approach is achieved for all investigated cases it should be noted that the values of δ c f obtained using the nm are slightly higher than those obtained using the cfd approach in all investigated cases higher values of δ c f are obtained for the kcs plate than for the kvlcc2 plate using both methods this is expected since the k l values for the kcs plate are higher than those for the kvlcc2 plate farkas et al 2020a in addition the kcs plate is investigated at a higher speed meaning that the c f s for the kcs plate is lower than the c f s for the kvlcc2 plate which then causes higher δ c f from figs 8 and 9 it can be also seen that higher values of δ c f are obtained at v 1 using both methods which can be explained by the lower c f s values at v 1 than at v 2 as well as by the higher k values after the integral values of c f and δ c f are analysed the c f distributions along the plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness are investigated in fig 10 the obtained c f distributions for the kcs gcdp2 and s plates at 24 kn using the nm and the cfd approach are presented from fig 10 it can be seen that the proposed method can take into account the undershoot in the c f distribution which is caused by the presence of roughness in the first part of the flat plate the obtained c f distribution of the kcs gcdp2 plate after l 2 is below the c f distribution of the kcs s plate it should be noted that the jump in the c f distribution immediately after the change in the surface condition i e from the rough to the smooth surface for gcdp2 at x l 2 cannot be accounted for using the proposed method nevertheless this jump in the c f distribution occurs only in the small portion of the plate and since the integral value of c f is of interest this will not cause a significant r d from the cfd result fig 11 presents the obtained c f distributions for the kcs gcdp3 and gcdp1 plates at 24 kn using the nm and the cfd approach fig 11 shows that the proposed method can take into account the overshoot in the c f distribution which is caused by the presence of roughness in the second part of the flat plate the obtained c f distribution of the kcs gcdp3 plate after l 2 is above the c f distribution of the kcs cdp1 plate the jump in the c f distribution immediately after the change in the surface condition i e from the smooth to the rough surface for gcdp3 at x l 2 cannot be accounted for using the proposed method nevertheless as for gcdp2 this jump in the c f distribution occurs only in the small portion of the plate and therefore will not cause significant r d from the cfd result thus it can be concluded that after the sudden jump in the c f distribution at x l 2 which is not accurately accounted for using the nm compared to the cfd approach the c f distribution is accurately described for both the kcs gcdp2 and kcs gcdp3 plates in comparison with the cfd approach therefore in the largest part of the plate the c f values are adequately determined using the nm compared to the cfd approach which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method for the prediction of c f for the rough flat plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness finally additional performance evaluation criteria are analysed in order to make an additional comparison of the obtained c f using the proposed method and the cfd approach the obtained results are given in table 8 as can be seen low values of r m s e m a r e and m a e are obtained while r 2 is very high which demonstrates that the proposed method can predict c f reliably i e the predicted c f values are almost the same as those obtained using the cfd approach which represents the most comprehensive approach for the prediction of the roughness effects on the ship hydrodynamic performance 4 conclusions the flow around the surface covered with inhomogeneous roughness represents a complex phenomenon and the c f distribution along the plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness cannot be simply predicted using the c f distribution of a homogeneously rough plate since an overshoot and undershoot in c f distribution occur there are a variety of causes of hull roughness which is mostly inhomogeneous which highlights the importance of determining c f for an inhomogeneous rough surface within the optimization of a maintenance schedule it is important to predict the effect of roughness on ship performance accurately and rapidly thus in the literature the granville similarity law scaling method has imposed itself as a valuable prediction method for the determination of c f within ppm farkas et al 2020c 2021a or for an estimation of the equivalent sand grain roughness height which is thereafter used as a performance indicator oliveira et al 2020 however the drawbacks of the granville method are highlighted within the literature and using this method the c f of the plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness cannot be predicted the main aim of this study was to propose a novel method to represent a more comprehensive method than the granville method and which could be used for the prediction of c f for a plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness the applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated for smooth homogeneously rough and inhomogeneously rough surface conditions in this paper inhomogeneous roughness was analysed using a simplified roughness pattern with a step change from a smooth to a rough surface condition or vice versa the main findings of the performed research are a novel method for the prediction of c f for rough surfaces the proposed method can consider the non uniform distribution of u τ and in this way the roughness reynolds number k and δ u values as well which represents an important benefit over the granville similarity law scaling method even for homogeneously rough surfaces the method can take into account the non uniform distribution of roughness and its effect on the c f of a flat plate an in house numerical code is developed based on the proposed method which allows for the rapid and accurate assessment of c f for rough surfaces the applicability of the proposed method in the prediction of c f for rough surfaces is demonstrated the proposed method is applicable to various surface conditions defined with δ u models and longitudinal positions of roughness the proposed method can be easily implemented using the ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c and in this way can upgrade the ppm for a more comprehensive determination of δ c f future research will focus on undertaking several studies the development of a numerical line for the c f distribution of smooth plates would be of importance utilizing this line for c f distribution would allow for a comparison between the cfd approach and the novel method using the same input data additional studies regarding the overshoot and undershoot in the c f distribution due to a step change in the surface condition would be of great interest the findings from these studies could be implemented in the proposed method in order to allow for a more accurate assessment of the c f distribution for plate covered with inhomogeneous roughness since the fouling of the marine propeller is also inhomogeneous future studies will focus on estimating the propeller performance in open water conditions and behind the hull for a propeller fouled with inhomogeneous roughness in this way it will be possible to make a more reliable performance

20314,a method is proposed for remotely detecting sulfur content in fuel oil used by ships in emission control areas ecas based on the direct collection of so2 emission data from the plume of the ship and numerical simulation models assuming a ship in the eca uses fuel oil with compliance fuel sulfur content fsc activity based ship emission assessment model is firstly utilized to calculate the so2 concentration emitted from the ship numerical simulation models are then used to estimate the theoretical so2 diffusion concentration at the location of the monitoring equipment the observed so2 concentration at the same time can then be integrated to estimate the fsc of the ship a sample of eleven ships was selected to verify the proposed method in yantian port shenzhen china in june 2018 the result illustrates that the method can remotely detect ships using fuel oil with the fsc greater than 0 146 m m in the ecas the relative error is 46 keywords ship emission fuel sulfur content so2 observation unmanned aerial vehicle emission control area 1 introduction ship exhaust emissions are gaining increasing concern from the international community with the rapid development of the marine industry they have become one of the negative impact factors of air quality and health of citizens especially in coastal waters tang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 the stricter regulations came into effect under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol annex vi regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships schinas and stefanakos 2014 imo 1997 to reduce the effect of greenhouse gases from ships covering emissions of sulfur oxides sox nitrogen oxide nox carbon dioxide co2 and particulate matters for ships in the emission control areas ecas defined under marpol annex vi for sox special mandatory measures are set to regulate emissions from ships ship navigating in international maritime organization imo designated ecas has to use fuel oil with the fuel sulfur content fsc lower than 0 1 m m from january 1 2015 van et al 2019 in china three ecas are defined to reduce the so2 and nox emissions from ships including the pearl river delta the yangtze river delta and the bohai bay the current limitation of the fsc of fuel oil used by ships is 0 5 within the ecas the fuel can be switched from high sulfur residual fuel oil hsrfo to low sulfur fuel oil lsfo to comply with the fsc restrictions iodice et al 2017 however the lsfo have adverse influences on the engine performance of ships ma et al 2020 ship owners can also choose alternative methods to meet the lower sulfur fuel requirements in the ecas such as using liquefied natural gas lng installing the flue gas desulfurization equipment on board international maritime organization 2018 langella et al 2016 and utilizing the shore side electronic power after berthing dai et al 2019 lng is a clean energy that can significantly reduce sox emission xu and yang 2020 however it has the disadvantages of inadequate infrastructure and higher costs compared to traditional fuels brynolf et al 2014 in terms of the flue gas desulfurization equipment two factors limit the its application and popularization of lng one reason is some old ships have no conditions to install the equipment and the other one is the stricter fsc restrictions will be implemented with unsatisfied installed equipment brynolf et al 2014 shore side electronic power equipments have been installed on more than 40 of the major ports to supply the engine for berthing ships yu et al 2019 the widespread application of these equipments remain limited by considerable cost on retrofiting ships therefore not all ships are willing to adopt the above actions due to the economic budget the manager of maritime safety administration msa used to collect the fuel oil samples on board and further tested the fsc in fuel oil by laboratory analysis aramkitphotha et al 2019 the manual inspection requires a higher labor and time costs which cannot meet the demand of real time exhaust emission monitoring of massive ships recently remote sensing monitoring technologies including the optical sensors and the sniffing sensors are developed to replace the manual inspection these monitoring sensors are installed on fixed or mobile platforms to remotely measure the concentrations of air pollutants emitted from the observed ship for fixed monitoring platform sniffing sensors are mainly appropriate for measuring the pollutant concentration emitted from ships nearby since their maximum monitoring range is generally about 2 3 km which is far less than the required range of 12 nautical miles about 22 224 km in ecas balzani lööv et al 2014 in contrast optical sensors with longer sensing range can directly measure the air pollutant concentration in the smoke plume emitted from ships in the distance the limitation is the optical sensor can only detect the concentration of air pollutant in its light path and fails to distinguish overlapped air pollutants from different ship smoke plumes besides the monitoring results of both sensors may also be affected by atmospheric conditions such as rain and fog the spatial relationship between the sensor and the observed ship including relative distance and relative height is another factor affecting the monitoring accuracy of ship emissions long distance and great height difference will lead to the failure of monitoring air pollutants emitted from the ship mobile platforms equipped with sniffers or optical sensors are employed in recent studies to enrich the extent and flexibility of ship emission monitoring mobile platforms with strong maneuvering ability like unmanned aerial vehicle uav and ocean monitoring ships can track the ship and measure air pollutant concentration with the maximum range of 10 km beecken et al 2014 when atmospheric conditions or ship movements change mobile platform can freely perform position adjustment and path planning therefore mobile monitoring platforms can satisfy the monitoring requirements of monitoring the fsc in fuel oil than fixed monitoring platforms the monitoring accuracy of the uav based mobile platform is higher than that of the other mobile platforms because the uav can approach the mouth of stacks of the detected ships but only close to the detected ships based on the vessel based mobile platform the endurance time of the most uav is about 1 h which is an important limitation for the uav to monitor ship emissions also it is difficult to face the 12 nm monitoring requirement in ecas the monitoring scope of the helicopter based mobile platform meets the monitoring requirement of ecas the helicopter based method is expensive to measure ship emissions relying on the manual operation thus this method is rarely used to monitor ship emissions berg et al 2012 some researchers popescu et al 2020 rutkauskas et al 2019 have improved the duration time of uav based on extending the battery life of uav using lightweight materials on the other side some researches optimized the tracking and monitoring path of the puffs emitted from ships to improve the monitoring capability of uav yuan et al 2020 lim et al 2020 xia et al 2019 in the 2016 european union directive and regulations the european union 2016 a method to calculate the fsc of ships was proposed based on the ratio of the observed so2 concentration and the observed co2 concentration this method has been utilized by some researchers anand et al 2020 pirjola et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019a b zhou et al 2020 the plume dilution affects the accuracy of fsc measurement because of the environment conditions such as wind speed and direction and ambient concentrations which will lead to the underestimation of fsc anand et al 2020 existing studies consider two kind of factors in the calculation model of fsc mellqvist et al 2017a b christensen et al 2019 rather than the influence of co2 ambient concentrations on the computational accuracy the observed concentration of co2 from the sensor is the sum of the co2 background concentration and co2 emission concentrations from ships the calculated fsc is underestimated based on the ratio of the observed concentrations of so2 and co2 meanwhile the co2 background concentration varies with height far higher than the concentration of co2 emission from ships sensors are difficult to accurately measure the concentration of co2 emission from ships therefore in the atmospheric conditions the navigational trajectories of ships should be considered to estimate the fsc then the illegal ships are identified with high fsc fuel oil it implements the limitation regulations of ship emissions and provides the evidence for capturing the illegal ships in eca in this work a noval method to remotely detect the fsc was proposed to for the on site compliance detection of fuel oil used in the ship by integrating so2 simulation and observation results it could be utilized to detect the illegal ships using high fsc fuel oil in eca assuming that the observed ship consumed the compliant fuel oil e g 0 1 and 0 5 m m the ship exhaust emission calculation model huang et al 2017 2020 was utilized to calculate the so2 emission concentration from ships the ship emission diffusion model peng et al 2021 was then employed to estimate the so2 diffusion concentration in the position where the sensor is located the fsc of the ship was estimated based on the ratio between the so2 observation and so2 diffusion concentrations normally the estimated fsc of the observed ship should keep consistent with the assumed fsc value if the high sulfur oil is in use the estimated fsc will become an effective indicator that exceeds the assumed fsc value the rest of the work is organized as follows the research motivation of the proposed method is analyzed in section 2 section 3 introduces the workflow of the proposed method for remote detecting the high fsc ships the estimating method of fsc the calculation method of ship exhaust emissions and the calculation method of the diffusion concentrations of air pollutants emitted from ship in ambient in section 4 a sniffing sensor is carried on the uav to monitor the concentration of so2 emitted from ship and then the proposed method is applied to estimate the fsc of ships and identify the high fsc ships in yantian port shenzhen china the evaluation and discussion of experimental results are performed the application of the proposed fsc remote detection method under different fsc limitation regulations is introduced in section 5 the results are discussed and concluded in section 6 and section 7 respectively presents discussion and section 7 provides a conclusion 2 research motivation it is necessary to obtain the effective monitoring concentrations of so2 and co2 emitted from ships when the fsc of fuel oil used by ships is remotely detected the monitoring device of air quality can provide the high accuracy monitoring concentrations of air pollutants the monitoring concentrations in the position of monitoring devices are the sum of the concentrations of air pollutants emitted from ships and the background concentrations the diffusion concentrations of ship exhaust emissions are influenced by many factors including the position of monitoring sensors the intensity of emission sources the position of emission sources and the atmospheric conditions in previous studies the diffusion characteristics of ship exhaust emissions are ignored to calculate the fsc based on the ratio of the so2 monitoring concentration to the co2 monitoring concentration anand et al 2020 pirjola et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019a b zhou et al 2020 and also the traditional calculation method is utilized to calculate fsc that is influenced by the monitoring concentrations of so2 and co2 the monitoring sensors are installed on different positions and the monitoring concentrations of so2 and co2 have a significant difference and verify it through matlab simulation the ship exhaust emission calculation model see section 3 2 and diffusion model see section 3 3 are utilized to simulate the diffusion concentrations of so2 emitted from a sample ship in different altitudes and in different times thus analyzing the diffusion characteristics of ship exhaust emissions figs 1 and 2 show the simulated results table 1 presents the parameters used in the models in figs 1 and 2 the black lines are the ship trajectories the white arrows represent the heading of the sample ship the heat maps represent the diffusion concentrations of so2 emitted from the sample ship during its navigating fig 1 shows that the so2 concentrations vary significantly with height the smaller distance between the influenced position and the stack mouth of ship the higher the so2 concentration in the influenced position the puffs emitted from the ship are not diffused to the position of the monitoring sensors rapidly fig 2 shows that with the increased diffusion time the so2 peak concentration decreased in the same influenced regional and the more distant effects the simulation results show that the monitoring concentrations of so2 emitted from the ship obtained in different positions have great difference and the calculation accuracy of fsc is influenced by the so2 monitoring concentration therefore the work considered the diffusion characteristics of ship exhaust emission to propose fsc remote detection method integrating the so2 monitoring concentration and numerical simulation models the method could improve the calculation accuracy of fsc and reduce the impacts of the monitoring position of sensors on the calculated fsc 3 methodology 3 1 workflow fig 3 shows the workflow of the detection method of high fsc ships in the eca which constitutes three parts 1 calculate the so 2 emission from the ship huang et al 2020 improved the traditional ship exhaust emission calculation method jalkanen et al 2009 to calculate the amount of so2 emitted from ships based on the ais automatic identification system data and the static data of ships the static data includes the designed maximum speed main engine power and auxiliary engine power when deciding the emission factors of so2 in the ship exhaust emission calculation model we assume the detected ship with the compliant fuel oil the fsc of which is the limitation value regulated by government the limitation value of the fsc is recorded as t f s c which is the ship exhaust emission diffusion model in the following steps 2 calculate the theory diffusion concentration of so 2 the theory value of so2 emission from the detected ship with compliant fuel oil calculated in step 1 is the input of the ship exhaust emission diffusion model then calculate the theory diffusion concentration of so2 emitted from the detected ship in the position of the observation device integrating the atmospheric observation data i e wind speed wind direction and temperature the calculated result is recorded as t s o 2 3 estimate the fsc of fuel oil used by the detected ship the observation device can provide the monitoring concentration of so2 emitted from ships recorded as m s o 2 the actual fsc can be estimated based on the calculated t s o 2 and the observed m s o 2 and the estimated result of fsc is recorded as a f s c the detailed description of the estimation method of a f s c is introduced in the section 3 4 when a f s c is greater than the fsc limitation value t f s c the observed ship is regarded as an illegal ship the maritime administrator should collect fuel samples on board as soon as possible and further test it in the laboratory 3 2 calculating the so2 emitted from the ship the navigating ships are the research objects in this work the main engine and the auxiliary engine are operated and the boil engine is closed when a ship is in the navigational state huang et al 2020 proposed the ship exhaust emission calculation method in real time based on the ais data and the calculation method is utilized to calculate the amount of so2 emitted from the navigational ships the calculation formulates icf international 2009 huang et al 2020 are described as 1 e s o 2 p m l f m s o 2 l l a m t m e f m s o 2 p a l f a t a e f a s o 2

o t 3 3 calculating the theory diffusion concentration of so2 the common simulation methods for ship emissions diffusion include gaussian method lagrangian method and euler method the atmospheric observation data obtained from an individual observation station can be utilized for the gaussian method to simulate the gas diffusion on the micro scale the three dimensional meteorological field is the basis of the lagrangian method and the euler method which are applied to the mesoscale and the large scale in general in this work the ship exhaust emission diffusion model was utilized to calculate the concentrations of the detected ship emits the so2 diffused to the positions of the so2 observation device in port waters the simulation area belongs to the micro scale therefore the gaussian method was the infrastructure reference model of the navigational ship exhaust emission diffusion the continuously so2 emitted from the ship are regarded as the multiple puffs from t 1 to t n

after having the preparation the uav takes off vertically and flights to the attitude of 60 m to detect the background concentration of so2 at last control the uav closes to the target puffs 2 tracking the target puffs the wind direction and speed are the main influence factors of the diffusion characteristics of ship emitting puffs e g the diffusion rate and the diffusion direction of

the eleven ships is obviously lower than r d 2 the calculation accuracy of estimated fsc using the proposed method is improved about 123 than the traditional calculation method of the fsc 5 application to different fsc regulatory policies the work proposed the method to detect high fsc ships which guaranteed the fsc limitation regulations in eca and improved the detection of ship fuel oil the berthing ships were limited to use fuel oil lower than 0 5 m m in the eca of china since january 2018 after that ships have been required to use the fsc lower than 0 5 m m fuel oil when ship entered eca waters in china since january 2019 in shenzhen port ship owners have been encouraged to use fuel oil with the fsc lower than 0 1 m m when the ships entered the shenzhen waters since august 2018 and the compliant ship owners would receive subsidies in this work there were eleven navigating ships detected based on the proposed method in june 2018 ten ships used fuel oil with the fsc greater than 0 5 m m and only one ship used fuel oil with the fsc lower than 0 5 m m the detection results of high fsc ships using the purposed method were consistent with the tested results in the laboratory the relative difference between the calculated fsc based on the proposed method and the tested fsc in the laboratory was 46 which was the mean value of rd 1 of eleven detected ships the relative difference between the 0 5 m m limitation of fsc and the 0 1 m m was 400 greater than the detection error 46 of the proposed method according to the current fsc limitation in the eca waters of shenzhen port and the proposed detecting method for high fsc ships when the calculated fsc of is lower than 0 146 m m the ship will be regarded as the compliance ships and subsidized by the government in order words when the calculated fsc of the detected ship is in the range of 0 146 0 5 m m the ship will be recognized as the compliant ship without the subsidy based on the proposed method when the calculated fsc is greater than 0 5 m m the ship will be identified as an illegal high fsc ship the proposed method for detecting illegal ship using high fsc fuel oil can be utilized to intelligently supervise ship fuel oil by the msa and detect the fsc of ships in eca waters of china 6 discussion the work proposed a method to detect the illegal ship using high fsc fuel oil in the eca considering the atmospheric conditions and so2 observation and simulation the proposed calculation method of fsc could reduce the impact of the monitored concentration of co2 on estimating the fsc and improving the calculation accuracy of the fsc the proposed method was verified by tests in yantian port shenzhen china there were different fsc limitation requirements in eca waters in the world therefore it is necessary to adjust the emission factors of so2 based on the local fsc limitation when the proposed method was used to detect the high fsc ships in other eca waters the calculation model of the theoretical diffused so2 concentration emitted from ships was employed to estimate the diffused concentration of so2 emitted from ships in the position of the observation devices however the three dimensional position of the mobile observation device of ship exhaust emission was dynamic and the wind directions and velocities were different in different positions and time the ship exhaust emission diffusion model is unsuitable for simulating so2 concentrations in the cases of the wind speed is smaller than 1 m s and the ship is situated on the upwind direction of the observation device the wrf weather research and forecasting model was utilized to establish the three dimensional wind field considering more meteorological factors to simulate the diffused so2 concentration in the following works thus reducing the effect of simulation model on the estimation of fsc the relevant information of the stacks of the eleven detected ships was obtained from the smsa in this work however the information was difficult to obtain in other application scenarios the emission temperatures of the stacks were estimated in the calculation processes of the theoretical diffused concentration of so2 emitted from ship in yantian port a typical sample of eleven ships was selected to verify the proposed method under different atmospheric conditions unfortunately yantian port is a container port and the sample ships are all container ships in the following works more experiments will be conducted in other ports to verify and improve the proposed method in the following research the remote infrared measuring thermometer can be installed on the mobile observation platforms to measure the temperature of puffs emitted from ships through the regression analysis using the data of stacks from the tests predicting formulas between some parameters of ships will be selected to predict the missing parameters of ships based on the obtained parameters the calculation model of the so2 emitted from ships and the calculation method of the theoretical diffused so2 concentration were utilized to estimate the actual fsc of fuel oil used by the detected ships in this work the uncertainty of the numerical models should be analyzed to improve the estimation accuracy of the fsc in the next work thereby meeting the stricter requirements of the fsc in eca waters the test scenarios referred to the individual ship emission during monitoring the eleven sample ships and the puffs emitted from the multiple ships were not considered in this work the proposed estimation method for fsc should be improved for estimating the fsc of multiple ships to improve the model performance 7 conclusions the observation device of ship exhaust emissions was utilized to monitor the diffusion concentration of the so2 emission from ships the tracking trajectories of the air pollutants mobile observation device should be adjusted with the atmospheric condition changes the traditional calculation method of the fsc relies on the ratio of the monitored so2 concentration and the monitored co2 concentration based on the sniffing gas sensors we proposed a simulation method to calculate the theory diffusion concentration of so2 emitted from ships in ambient thus reducing the influences of the tracking paths of the mobile observation device on monitoring the gaseous emission from ships and estimating the fsc and reducing the impact of monitored co2 concentration on estimating the fsc and improving the calculation accuracy of the fsc the proposed method included three parts 1 the ship exhaust emission calculation model was used to calculate the theoretical amount of so2 emission from the detected ship and the emission factors of so2 was 0 5 2 considering the meteorological conditions the ship exhaust emission diffusion model was utilized to calculate the theoretical concentrations of so2 emitted from the ships and diffused to the position of the observation device 3 the fsc was estimated based on the monitored so2 concentration provided by the observation device and the theoretical diffused so2 concentration in the position of the observation device the estimated fsc could identify the high fsc ships for the maritime safety administrators the so2 sniffing monitoring sensor was carried on the uav to monitor the concentration of so2 emitted from ships in yantian port shenzhen china eleven ships were selected as samples to test the efficiency of the proposed estimation method for the fsc the results showed that the proposed method could calculate the fsc of the detected ships by the mobile observation device and the calculation accuracy was 46 the traditional estimation method based on the ratio of the monitored so2 and co2 concentrations of ships was utilized to estimate the fsc of the eleven ships with the calculation accuracy of 169 the experimental results showed that the proposed method could improve the calculation accuracy of the fsc than the traditional method the proposed method for detecting illegal high fsc ships in eca was utilized to identify the ship using fuel oil with the fsc greater than 0 146 m m the proposed method could meet the monitoring requirements of the quality of fuel oil in eca waters of china credit authorship contribution statement xin peng conceptualization methodology

20314,a method is proposed for remotely detecting sulfur content in fuel oil used by ships in emission control areas ecas based on the direct collection of so2 emission data from the plume of the ship and numerical simulation models assuming a ship in the eca uses fuel oil with compliance fuel sulfur content fsc activity based ship emission assessment model is firstly utilized to calculate the so2 concentration emitted from the ship numerical simulation models are then used to estimate the theoretical so2 diffusion concentration at the location of the monitoring equipment the observed so2 concentration at the same time can then be integrated to estimate the fsc of the ship a sample of eleven ships was selected to verify the proposed method in yantian port shenzhen china in june 2018 the result illustrates that the method can remotely detect ships using fuel oil with the fsc greater than 0 146 m m in the ecas the relative error is 46 keywords ship emission fuel sulfur content so2 observation unmanned aerial vehicle emission control area 1 introduction ship exhaust emissions are gaining increasing concern from the international community with the rapid development of the marine industry they have become one of the negative impact factors of air quality and health of citizens especially in coastal waters tang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 the stricter regulations came into effect under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol annex vi regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships schinas and stefanakos 2014 imo 1997 to reduce the effect of greenhouse gases from ships covering emissions of sulfur oxides sox nitrogen oxide nox carbon dioxide co2 and particulate matters for ships in the emission control areas ecas defined under marpol annex vi for sox special mandatory measures are set to regulate emissions from ships ship navigating in international maritime organization imo designated ecas has to use fuel oil with the fuel sulfur content fsc lower than 0 1 m m from january 1 2015 van et al 2019 in china three ecas are defined to reduce the so2 and nox emissions from ships including the pearl river delta the yangtze river delta and the bohai bay the current limitation of the fsc of fuel oil used by ships is 0 5 within the ecas the fuel can be switched from high sulfur residual fuel oil hsrfo to low sulfur fuel oil lsfo to comply with the fsc restrictions iodice et al 2017 however the lsfo have adverse influences on the engine performance of ships ma et al 2020 ship owners can also choose alternative methods to meet the lower sulfur fuel requirements in the ecas such as using liquefied natural gas lng installing the flue gas desulfurization equipment on board international maritime organization 2018 langella et al 2016 and utilizing the shore side electronic power after berthing dai et al 2019 lng is a clean energy that can significantly reduce sox emission xu and yang 2020 however it has the disadvantages of inadequate infrastructure and higher costs compared to traditional fuels brynolf et al 2014 in terms of the flue gas desulfurization equipment two factors limit the its application and popularization of lng one reason is some old ships have no conditions to install the equipment and the other one is the stricter fsc restrictions will be implemented with unsatisfied installed equipment brynolf et al 2014 shore side electronic power equipments have been installed on more than 40 of the major ports to supply the engine for berthing ships yu et al 2019 the widespread application of these equipments remain limited by considerable cost on retrofiting ships therefore not all ships are willing to adopt the above actions due to the economic budget the manager of maritime safety administration msa used to collect the fuel oil samples on board and further tested the fsc in fuel oil by laboratory analysis aramkitphotha et al 2019 the manual inspection requires a higher labor and time costs which cannot meet the demand of real time exhaust emission monitoring of massive ships recently remote sensing monitoring technologies including the optical sensors and the sniffing sensors are developed to replace the manual inspection these monitoring sensors are installed on fixed or mobile platforms to remotely measure the concentrations of air pollutants emitted from the observed ship for fixed monitoring platform sniffing sensors are mainly appropriate for measuring the pollutant concentration emitted from ships nearby since their maximum monitoring range is generally about 2 3 km which is far less than the required range of 12 nautical miles about 22 224 km in ecas balzani lööv et al 2014 in contrast optical sensors with longer sensing range can directly measure the air pollutant concentration in the smoke plume emitted from ships in the distance the limitation is the optical sensor can only detect the concentration of air pollutant in its light path and fails to distinguish overlapped air pollutants from different ship smoke plumes besides the monitoring results of both sensors may also be affected by atmospheric conditions such as rain and fog the spatial relationship between the sensor and the observed ship including relative distance and relative height is another factor affecting the monitoring accuracy of ship emissions long distance and great height difference will lead to the failure of monitoring air pollutants emitted from the ship mobile platforms equipped with sniffers or optical sensors are employed in recent studies to enrich the extent and flexibility of ship emission monitoring mobile platforms with strong maneuvering ability like unmanned aerial vehicle uav and ocean monitoring ships can track the ship and measure air pollutant concentration with the maximum range of 10 km beecken et al 2014 when atmospheric conditions or ship movements change mobile platform can freely perform position adjustment and path planning therefore mobile monitoring platforms can satisfy the monitoring requirements of monitoring the fsc in fuel oil than fixed monitoring platforms the monitoring accuracy of the uav based mobile platform is higher than that of the other mobile platforms because the uav can approach the mouth of stacks of the detected ships but only close to the detected ships based on the vessel based mobile platform the endurance time of the most uav is about 1 h which is an important limitation for the uav to monitor ship emissions also it is difficult to face the 12 nm monitoring requirement in ecas the monitoring scope of the helicopter based mobile platform meets the monitoring requirement of ecas the helicopter based method is expensive to measure ship emissions relying on the manual operation thus this method is rarely used to monitor ship emissions berg et al 2012 some researchers popescu et al 2020 rutkauskas et al 2019 have improved the duration time of uav based on extending the battery life of uav using lightweight materials on the other side some researches optimized the tracking and monitoring path of the puffs emitted from ships to improve the monitoring capability of uav yuan et al 2020 lim et al 2020 xia et al 2019 in the 2016 european union directive and regulations the european union 2016 a method to calculate the fsc of ships was proposed based on the ratio of the observed so2 concentration and the observed co2 concentration this method has been utilized by some researchers anand et al 2020 pirjola et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019a b zhou et al 2020 the plume dilution affects the accuracy of fsc measurement because of the environment conditions such as wind speed and direction and ambient concentrations which will lead to the underestimation of fsc anand et al 2020 existing studies consider two kind of factors in the calculation model of fsc mellqvist et al 2017a b christensen et al 2019 rather than the influence of co2 ambient concentrations on the computational accuracy the observed concentration of co2 from the sensor is the sum of the co2 background concentration and co2 emission concentrations from ships the calculated fsc is underestimated based on the ratio of the observed concentrations of so2 and co2 meanwhile the co2 background concentration varies with height far higher than the concentration of co2 emission from ships sensors are difficult to accurately measure the concentration of co2 emission from ships therefore in the atmospheric conditions the navigational trajectories of ships should be considered to estimate the fsc then the illegal ships are identified with high fsc fuel oil it implements the limitation regulations of ship emissions and provides the evidence for capturing the illegal ships in eca in this work a noval method to remotely detect the fsc was proposed to for the on site compliance detection of fuel oil used in the ship by integrating so2 simulation and observation results it could be utilized to detect the illegal ships using high fsc fuel oil in eca assuming that the observed ship consumed the compliant fuel oil e g 0 1 and 0 5 m m the ship exhaust emission calculation model huang et al 2017 2020 was utilized to calculate the so2 emission concentration from ships the ship emission diffusion model peng et al 2021 was then employed to estimate the so2 diffusion concentration in the position where the sensor is located the fsc of the ship was estimated based on the ratio between the so2 observation and so2 diffusion concentrations normally the estimated fsc of the observed ship should keep consistent with the assumed fsc value if the high sulfur oil is in use the estimated fsc will become an effective indicator that exceeds the assumed fsc value the rest of the work is organized as follows the research motivation of the proposed method is analyzed in section 2 section 3 introduces the workflow of the proposed method for remote detecting the high fsc ships the estimating method of fsc the calculation method of ship exhaust emissions and the calculation method of the diffusion concentrations of air pollutants emitted from ship in ambient in section 4 a sniffing sensor is carried on the uav to monitor the concentration of so2 emitted from ship and then the proposed method is applied to estimate the fsc of ships and identify the high fsc ships in yantian port shenzhen china the evaluation and discussion of experimental results are performed the application of the proposed fsc remote detection method under different fsc limitation regulations is introduced in section 5 the results are discussed and concluded in section 6 and section 7 respectively presents discussion and section 7 provides a conclusion 2 research motivation it is necessary to obtain the effective monitoring concentrations of so2 and co2 emitted from ships when the fsc of fuel oil used by ships is remotely detected the monitoring device of air quality can provide the high accuracy monitoring concentrations of air pollutants the monitoring concentrations in the position of monitoring devices are the sum of the concentrations of air pollutants emitted from ships and the background concentrations the diffusion concentrations of ship exhaust emissions are influenced by many factors including the position of monitoring sensors the intensity of emission sources the position of emission sources and the atmospheric conditions in previous studies the diffusion characteristics of ship exhaust emissions are ignored to calculate the fsc based on the ratio of the so2 monitoring concentration to the co2 monitoring concentration anand et al 2020 pirjola et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019a b zhou et al 2020 and also the traditional calculation method is utilized to calculate fsc that is influenced by the monitoring concentrations of so2 and co2 the monitoring sensors are installed on different positions and the monitoring concentrations of so2 and co2 have a significant difference and verify it through matlab simulation the ship exhaust emission calculation model see section 3 2 and

application to different fsc regulatory policies the work proposed the method to detect high fsc ships which guaranteed the fsc limitation regulations in eca and improved the detection of ship fuel oil the berthing ships were limited to use fuel oil lower than 0 5 m m in the eca of china since january 2018 after that ships have been required to use the fsc lower than 0 5 m m fuel oil when ship entered eca waters in china since january 2019 in shenzhen port ship owners have been encouraged to use fuel oil with the fsc lower than 0 1 m m when the ships entered the shenzhen waters since august 2018 and the compliant ship owners would receive subsidies in this work there were eleven navigating ships detected based on the proposed method in june 2018 ten ships used fuel oil with the fsc

intelligently supervise ship fuel oil by the msa and detect the fsc of ships in eca waters of china 6 discussion the work proposed a method to detect the illegal ship using high fsc fuel oil in the eca considering the atmospheric conditions and so2 observation and simulation the proposed calculation method of fsc could reduce the impact of the monitored concentration of co2 on estimating the fsc and improving the calculation accuracy of the fsc the proposed method was verified by tests in yantian port shenzhen china there were different fsc limitation requirements in eca waters in the world therefore it is necessary to adjust the emission factors of so2 based on the local fsc limitation when the proposed method was used to detect the high fsc ships in other eca waters the calculation model of the theoretical diffused so2 concentration emitted from ships was employed to estimate the diffused concentration of so2 emitted from ships in the position of the observation devices however the three dimensional position of the mobile observation device of ship exhaust emission was dynamic and the wind directions and velocities were different in different positions and time the ship exhaust emission diffusion model is unsuitable for simulating so2 concentrations in the cases of the wind speed is smaller than 1 m s and the ship is situated on the upwind direction of the observation device the wrf weather research and forecasting model was utilized to establish the three dimensional wind field considering more meteorological factors to simulate the diffused so2 concentration in the following works thus reducing the effect of simulation model on the estimation of fsc the relevant information of the stacks of the eleven detected ships was obtained from the smsa in this work however the information was difficult to obtain in other application scenarios the emission temperatures of the stacks were estimated in the calculation processes of the theoretical diffused concentration of so2 emitted from ship in yantian port a typical sample of eleven ships was selected to verify the proposed method under different atmospheric conditions unfortunately yantian port is a container port and the sample ships are all container ships in the following works more experiments will be conducted in other ports to verify and improve the proposed method in the following research the remote infrared measuring thermometer can be installed on the mobile observation platforms to measure the temperature of puffs emitted from ships through the regression analysis using the data of stacks from the tests predicting formulas between some parameters of ships will be selected to predict the missing parameters of ships based on the obtained parameters the calculation model of the so2 emitted from ships and the calculation method of the theoretical diffused so2 concentration were utilized to estimate the actual fsc of fuel oil used by the detected ships in this work the uncertainty of the numerical models should be analyzed to improve the estimation accuracy of the fsc in the next work thereby meeting the stricter requirements of the fsc in eca waters the test scenarios referred to the individual ship emission during monitoring the eleven sample ships and the puffs emitted from the multiple ships were not considered in this work the proposed estimation method for fsc should be improved for estimating the fsc of multiple ships to improve the model performance 7 conclusions the observation device of ship exhaust emissions was utilized to monitor the diffusion concentration of the so2 emission from ships the tracking trajectories of the air pollutants mobile observation device should be adjusted with the atmospheric condition changes the traditional calculation method of the fsc relies on the ratio of the monitored so2 concentration and the monitored co2 concentration based on the sniffing gas sensors we proposed a simulation

of the observation device 3 the fsc was estimated based on the monitored so2 concentration provided by the observation device and the theoretical diffused so2 concentration in the position of the observation device the estimated fsc could identify the high fsc ships for the maritime safety administrators the so2 sniffing monitoring sensor was carried on the uav to monitor the concentration of so2 emitted from ships in yantian port shenzhen china eleven ships were selected as samples to test the efficiency of the proposed estimation method for the fsc the results showed that the proposed
