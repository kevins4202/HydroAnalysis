2365,the spring snowmelt period is an important time for organic matter mobilization and export in peatland and wetland dominated systems the hydrologic flowpaths that transport melting snow and soil water to surface waters can vary over relatively short time periods several days to weeks depending on the timing and rate of melt and the occurrence of freeze thaw cycles and rain on snow events dynamic flowpaths can alter dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and dissolved organic matter dom optical properties in surface waters due to differential melt and mobilization of snow ice and soil waters in 2018 and 2020 we measured the doc concentration and dom optical properties in a woody wetland dominated watershed in northern minnesota during spring snowmelt 2018 2020 and early growing season 2018 only events we examined patterns in riverine doc dom and hydrochemical tracers across event hydrographs to infer changes in hydrologic connectivity across this seasonal transition measurements of riverine dom optical properties calcium concentration and water isotopic composition indicated that dom shifted from a primarily groundwater source and more fresh character during the dormant season to a more shallow wetland soil source and recalcitrant character during the early growing season seasonal variations in dom optical properties and highly complex hysteresis patterns of dom indices e g fluorescence index humification index β α e250 e365 and the fluorescence peak ratio t c during individual events may reflect spatial heterogeneity in soil thawing throughout the watershed and temporal variations in water table elevation affecting flowpath depths and connectivity to dom pools within the soil profile this study provides an important seasonal and event scale baseline against which to evaluate potential changes in riverine dom quantity and quality associated with predicted changes in climate and snow cover in organic matter rich ecosystems keywords snowmelt event dom organic matter fluorescence eems data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a highly mobile component of organic matter pools dissolved organic matter dom plays a key role in many biotic and abiotic biogeochemical processes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems previous research has identified the importance of dom in the global partitioning of nutrients monteith et al 2007 taylor and townsend 2010 trace and toxic metals gandois et al 2020 lavoie et al 2019 and greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide methane and carbon dioxide fasching et al 2014 lapierre et al 2013 limpens et al 2008 vonk and gustafsson 2013 much of this previous work has focused on quantifying dissolved organic carbon doc availability i e concentration and its role in these and other biogeochemical cycles but it is important to note that doc represents only one component of the larger dom pool cory et al 2011 thurman 1985 in addition to carbon dom is composed of other elements including nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen and this heteroatomic composition makes it difficult to quantify accurately minor et al 2014 thurman 1985 this difficulty notwithstanding analytical approaches such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms d andrilli et al 2015 hertkorn et al 2007 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy hertkorn et al 2007 and hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic woods et al 2011 have been employed to characterize the chemical composition of dom in natural systems in addition techniques such as absorbance spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy applicable to the subset of dom that fluoresces have focused on the optical properties of the chromophoric fraction of dom to develop indices such as the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm weishaar et al 2003 spectral slope helms et al 2008 and various interpretations of fluorescence excitation emission matrices coble 1996 de haan and de boer 1987 mcknight et al 2001 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 zsolnay et al 1999 these and other indices have been widely used as proxies for the assessment of dom character and cycling in natural waters e g gabor et al 2014 and references therein fluorescence spectroscopy enables the differentiation of terrigenous microbial and amino acid dom pools cory et al 2011 permitting a more nuanced understanding of the factors that regulate the quantity of doc and properties of dom in natural systems and clarifying the role of dom in associated biotic and abiotic biogeochemical cycles cory et al 2011 liu and wang 2021 based on the optical properties of dom numerous proxy metrics and indices have been developed for its characterization in natural waters metrics such as the fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 the humification index hix zsolnay et al 1999 the freshness index β α wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the ratio of absorbances at 250 nm and 365 nm e250 e365 de haan and de boer 1987 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 weishaar et al 2003 and the ratio of specific fluorescence peak intensities e g t c coble 1996 have been applied in myriad systems on both seasonal and event time scales

sources burns et al 2016 cory and kaplan 2012 hood et al 2003 inamdar et al 2011 mcknight et al 2001 miller and mcknight 2010 while the degree of dom decomposition has been inferred from the

fluorescent dom types e g humic acid like fulvic acid like protein like molecules baker et al 2008 coble 1996 guarch ribot and butturini 2016 su et al 2021 depending on hydrologic biogeochemical and climatic drivers dom optical properties can be highly variable on event and longer timescales factors such as landscape stream connectivity and flowpath activation fellman et al 2009 hood et al 2003 sebestyen et al 2008 photodegradation dalzell et al 2009 macdonald and minor 2013 biotic demand andrews et al 2011 roth et al 2019 sebestyen et al 2021 and abiotic processes such as sorption and complexation in mineral soils kaiser and kalbitz 2012 can alter dom composition and optical properties during mobilization from terrestrial and aquatic source pools to surface waters the degree to which each of these drivers alters dom during transport depends on the strength of climatic e g temperature solar radiation and hydrologic e g source area connectivity flowpath mediated hysteresis conditions organic matter mobilization and cycling are highly transient across spatial and temporal domains ågren et al 2007 andrews et al 2011 the spatial variability of organic matter pools at the watershed scale is regulated by multiple factors including seasonality soil type and moisture content vegetation cover and hydrologic connectivity ågren et al 2007 andrews et al 2011 limpens et al 2008 raymond and saiers 2010 sebestyen et al 2021 in turn the spatial arrangement of these characteristics within a watershed affects the quantity and quality of dom ultimately reaching streams and rivers for example due to their extraordinary capacity to generate store and mobilize organic matter the location of wetlands in a watershed whether they are proximally or distally situated relative to surface waters can significantly affect organic matter mobilization from terrestrial to aquatic systems laudon et al 2011 2004 in the temporal domain researchers have reported a range of surface water doc concentrations and dom compositions on event and longer time scales seasonally the spring snowmelt period coincides with the highest annual stream doc concentrations in some watersheds andrews et al 2011 boyer et al 2000 perdrial et al 2014 and the lowest concentrations in others inamdar et al 2011 the sources and composition of surface water dom can also vary seasonally with terrestrially derived fulvic acid rich dom predominant during spring snowmelt and more non humic autochthonous dom prevalent during the summer and fall in some systems hood et al 2003 such seasonal differences in organic matter are driven by multiple factors including temporal variations in predominant hydrologic flowpaths plant and microbial activity ambient temperature and photochemistry ågren et al 2007 laudon et al 2004 macdonald and minor 2013 raymond and saiers 2010 dissolved organic matter also varies over the much shorter time scale of individual high flow events some researchers have reported greater fractions of hydrolyzable amino acid rich dom under high flows relative to baseflow speculating that event flows mobilize more bioavailable dom lu and liu 2019 however others have observed no difference in the degree of bioavailability across flow conditions buffam et al 2001 such variations in doc quantity and dom composition on event timescales have been attributed to the timing and duration of hydrologic connectivity between organic matter source areas and surface waters covino 2017 hornberger et al 1994 inamdar et al 2011 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 differences in doc concentrations among source areas inamdar et al 2011 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 and differential hydrologic transit times between watershed source areas and surface waters resulting in biogeochemical hysteresis mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 rose et al 2018 van verseveld et al 2008 when the concentrations of biogeochemical constituents e g organic and inorganic solutes stable isotopes differ across source areas characteristic patterns of solute concentration discharge hysteresis may arise reflecting the sequence timing and magnitude of connectivity between these hydro biogeochemical source areas and the channel during periods of high flow therefore the magnitude and directionality i e clockwise anti clockwise or both of hysteresis can inform our understanding of the relative source area contributions to surface waters rose et al 2018 rose and karwan 2021 for example an anti clockwise hysteresis pattern of doc i e lower concentrations on the rising hydrograph limb and higher concentrations on the falling limb may reflect organic matter sources that are distal to the stream channel and therefore require longer transport times vaughan et al 2017 or alternatively delayed connectivity between shallow organic matter rich soil layers as soils wet up during rainfall events rose et al 2018 likewise in areas where bedrock is rich in weathering solutes such as calcium or magnesium higher concentrations on the rising limb compared to the falling limb i e clockwise hysteresis may indicate greater relative contributions of groundwater to the stream during early stormflow lower concentrations on the falling limb might signal a gradual increase in the connectivity of hydrologic sources characterized by lower concentrations of weathering solutes e g direct precipitation overland flow stored soil water resulting in a clockwise hysteresis pattern as groundwater becomes a less dominant source on the falling limb in this way temporal changes in surface water biogeochemical signals across the hydrograph may indicate variations in source area connectivity and contributions to surface waters this study combines measurements of riverine doc concentration dom fluorescence and dom absorbance properties and biogeochemical hysteresis to examine seasonal changes in predominant hydrologic inputs in a woody wetland dominated watershed in northern minnesota usa we collected sequential river water samples during event hydrographs associated with the main spring snowmelt events of 2018 and 2020 as well as four rainfall driven events spanning the dormant season to growing season transition of 2018 our goal was to evaluate the response of riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties to changes in discharge snowpack depth and rainfall inputs and to assess the potential utility of dom optical properties as tracers of hydrologic connectivity between organic matter source areas and surface waters during event flows we specifically examined 1 seasonal differences in riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties associated with snowmelt and rainfall driven events and 2 variations in doc concentration and dom optical properties during individual events we hypothesized that riverine dom optical properties would reflect elevated contributions of fresh dom from surficial and shallow subsurface source pools during the early phase of spring snowmelt and more humified dom during the later phase of spring snowmelt as soil thawing and infiltrating meltwaters progressed downward through the soil profile conversely we hypothesized that during rainfall driven growing season events dom optical properties would show the opposite pattern with indices of more humified dom prevalent on the rising limb suggesting dom mobilization along deeper flowpaths to the river and indices of fresh dom more prevalent on the falling limb as hydrologic connectivity with shallow soils increased as future climate scenarios predict warmer winters reduced seasonal snowpack and increased winter rainfall across northern minnesota and the southern edge of the boreal forest region more broadly handler et al 2014 liess et al 2021 this study provides important context on the timing magnitude and composition of dom export from wetland dominated systems across gradients of climate and hydrology 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sampling for this study was conducted in west swan river a fourth order river located in northern minnesota usa fig 1 the sampling location drains a 209 km2 undeveloped watershed with approximately 87 of the land cover classified as upland forest or woody wetlands anderson et al 2013 elevation across the watershed ranges from 397 to 472 m usgs 2022 and water table depths range from 0 to 30 m below the land surface adams 2016 soils in the watershed are primarily alfisols with approximately 77 of soils classified as hydrologic soil group d in the natural resources conservation service classification system these soils are characterized by low infiltration rates when thoroughly wet nrcs soil survey staff 2021 discharge in west swan river is strongly seasonal with annual peak flows typically occurring in april or may during the spring snowmelt period usgs 2016 water quality in west swan river is characterized by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca as excellent with low concentrations of suspended sediment nutrients and bacteria the river supports populations of several sensitive fish and invertebrate species anderson et al 2013 2 2 sample collection discharge and precipitation measurements sampling was conducted on an ungauged reach of west swan river discharge was estimated using several methods from october 2016 through november 2017 simultaneous measurements of discharge measured with an upward looking sontek iq acoustic doppler velocimeter adv installed on the riverbed and depth measured with a meter ctd 10 pressure transducer were taken at 5 minute intervals to establish a rating curve for the study site channel cross sections were surveyed during the summers of 2016 and 2017 and channel profile information in the adv software was adjusted accordingly to ensure accurate discharge estimates based on these 5 minute adv measurements average baseflow discharge in west swan river was 0 52 m3 s the adv was removed from the site in november 2017 to ensure additional measurement redundancy following occasional instances of damage to the pressure transducer we installed a staff gauge in the river in march 2017 along with an outdoor trail camera programmed to take hourly photographs of the staff gauge water level during daylight hours each day staff gauge water level measurements were adjusted to account for the depth offset between the pressure transducer and staff gauge locations in the river before applying the rating curve to estimate discharge rates we quantified rainfall inputs associated with growing season high flow events using data from the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa automated surface observing system noaa 2022a local rainfall inputs were quantified on an hourly timestep fig 2 at the chisholm hibbing airport in hibbing minnesota located approximately 15 km north of the study site antecedent precipitation in the week prior to each growing season event sampled in 2018 was quantified with an antecedent precipitation index api7 as in other studies of intra event stormflow dynamics brocca et al 2008 heathwaite and bieroza 2020 rose and karwan 2021 to track temporal changes in daily snowpack depth we used measurements recorded at noaa national climate data center station us1mnsl0108 located approximately 30 km northeast of the study site in iron junction minnesota noaa 2022b although this station is somewhat distant from the study site it is the nearest measurement location with a complete record of daily snowpack depths for the full snowmelt periods in 2018 and 2020 we used an automated sampler model 6712 teledyne isco usa to collect sequential 1 l river water samples during high flow events associated with snowmelt and rainfall events during 2018 and 2020 table 1 during the main snowmelt event in 2018 samples were collected every eight hours sample collection intervals varied for the subsequent growing season rainfall events ranging from every five hours to once per day during the 2020 snowmelt event rising limb and peakflow samples were collected once per day however an undetected autosampler failure resulted in missing samples at the end of the falling limb of this event hydrograph we discovered this instrument failure only upon arriving at the study site near the time when the final autosampler bottle was scheduled to be collected by which time the river had already returned to baseflow conditions we collected a grab sample from the river at this time upon retrieval from the study site following each event samples were brought to the lab for processing samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone pes filter and stored in the dark at 4 c until analysis for organic and inorganic constituents 2 3 sample analyses 2 3 1 doc concentration and dom optical properties dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined using a phoenix dohrmann 800 tic toc analyzer at the research analytical laboratory at the university of minnesota twin cities following standard methods arnold et al 1992 the analytical procedure uses persulfate in the presence of ultraviolet light to oxidize organic carbon to co2 which is then measured directly by non dispersive infrared radiation inorganic carbon was removed by sparging with n2 gas prior to sample analysis due to analytical instrumentation problems during initial sample analyses doc concentrations were reliably determined for only a subset of water samples collected during the 2018 snowmelt and rainfall events 68 doc concentration measurements out of 94 total samples during 2018 despite this reduced doc concentration dataset doc concentrations on the rising limb near peakflow and on the falling limb are still included in the final dataset of all sampled events dissolved organic matter optical properties were determined for all samples using a horiba aqualog fluorescence spectrophotometer sample excitation emission matrices eems were measured using a 1 cm quartz cell with correction for inner filter effects and normalization by raman scattering area at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm a reference sample of ultrapure water 18 mω cm 1 at 25 c was included in each analytical run sample eems data were used to calculate several indices based on dom optical properties table 2 indices used in our analyses included fi mcknight et al 2001 hix zsolnay et al 1999 β α wilson and xenopoulos 2009 e250 e365 de haan and de boer 1987 and the fluorescence peak ratio t c coble 1996 2 3 2 inorganic and water isotope analyses for hydrologic source characterization to examine potential variations in groundwater and direct snowmelt inputs to west swan river during snowmelt driven high flow events we quantified concentrations of a weathering solute tracer calcium ca during the 2018 and 2020 events and a stable isotope tracer of water δ18o h2o during the 2020 event in sequential river samples calcium concentrations were determined for a subset of samples collected on the rising and falling limbs of event hydrographs during the 2018 snowmelt event and for all samples collected during the 2020 snowmelt event calcium concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes at the research analytical laboratory at the university of minnesota twin cities following standard methods epa 1983 temporal changes in river ca concentrations were compared to concentration ranges previously reported for precipitation and groundwater at sampling sites in northern minnesota for the groundwater source we defined a ca concentration range of 22 3 mg l 1 29 9 mg l 1 using measurements from minnesota pollution control agency mpca groundwater monitoring station 526735 well completion depth 12 m and station 484886 well completion depth 20 m these wells represent the nearest available data for our study site both located approximately 14 km west of our sampling location mpca 2022a similarly mpca reported a ca concentration of 28 3 mg l 1 in a river sample collected in november 2011 under low flow conditions at a monitoring site approximately 4 km downstream of our study site mpca 2022b bedrock underlying these mpca monitoring sites as well as our study site is part of the virginia formation composed of interbedded argillite argillaceous siltstone and fine grained feldspathic graywacke sims et al 1970 the precipitation ca concentration range was determined from weekly samples collected at the national atmospheric deposition program national trends network site mn16 at the usda forest service marcell experimental forest near grand rapids mn approximately 70 km west of our study site national atmospheric deposition program 2022 we defined a range of precipitation ca concentration between 0 03 mg l 1 1 07 mg l 1 representing the lowest and highest ca concentrations reported across all weekly samples collected during the periods of seasonal snowpack accumulation and melt in our study area for 2018 october 2017 april 2018 and 2020 october 2019 march 2020 preferential elution of ions can occur within the snowpack leading to higher concentrations in meltwaters relative to the parent snowpack brimblecombe et al 1987 1985 jenkins et al 1993 lilbæk and pomeroy 2008 williams and melack 1991 previous studies examining preferential elution of ca in snowpack meltwaters reported an approximately 10 fold increase in meltwater concentrations relative to the parent snowpack brimblecombe et al 1987 jenkins et al 1993 lilbæk and pomeroy 2008 williams and melack 1991 because the ca concentration ranges of the precipitation and groundwater endmembers used in our study differ by more than 20 fold figure si we assumed any effect of preferential ca elution from the snowpack would not preclude a qualitative assessment of changes in predominant hydrologic inputs to west swan river during snowmelt driven high flow events during the 2020 snowmelt event we also analyzed sequential river samples for water isotopic composition δ18o h2o samples were analyzed at the university of minnesota duluth stable isotope lab using a picarro l2130 i isotope and gas concentration analyzer 0 1 precision for δ18o h2o samples were subjected to a range of holding times in the autosampler i e a 30 day holding time for the first snowmelt sample and a 15 day holding time for the last snowmelt sample collected prior to all samples being retrieved from the study site to address the potential effect of extended sample holding times in the field on water isotopic composition we subsampled two 25 ml aliquots from a 1 l grab sample collected on 11 march 2020 one aliquot was left in the field the vial was stored uncapped but was protected under the lid of the autosampler for 12 days and the other aliquot was immediately capped sealed with parafilm and returned to the lab where it was stored until all samples for the 2020 event were analyzed for δ18o h2o composition comparison of the paired aliquots from the 11 march 2020 grab sample indicated that the δ18o h2o in the uncapped field sample was 10 38 0 03 whereas the δ18o h2o in the immediately capped and parafilm sealed vial was 11 01 0 02 therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that fractionation processes might have differentially affected the water isotopic composition of sequential water samples collected over 16 days during the 2020 snowmelt period because we did not sample groundwater and snowpack meltwaters at the study site we used δ18o h2o values for groundwater range 11 7 to 11 2 n 4 and snowpack meltwater range 15 2 to 12 4 n 18 samples collected on the university of minnesota duluth campus located approximately 100 km east of the study site between march and april 2020 ihlang 2021 to establish ranges for these hydrologic sources as the marcell experimental forest and duluth sites are located at large distances from our study site we limited our comparisons of river precipitation and groundwater ca and δ18o h2o to qualitative examinations of the temporal evolution of ca concentration and δ18o h2o composition during snowmelt associated hydrographs assuming the chemical and isotopic compositions of snowmelt and groundwater remain sufficiently distinct over the time periods of our analysis such qualitative evaluation of the relative changes in hydrologic contributions from these two hydrologic sources to west swan river should be possible while this assumption likely holds for ca concentrations due to the large difference in concentration ranges between the precipitation and groundwater sources we acknowledge that this assumption might not hold for water isotopic composition due to the greater similarity in snowmelt and groundwater isotope values 2 4 data analysis we used the kruskal wallis test to examine statistical differences in median values of doc concentrations and dom indices across sampled events kruskal and wallis 1952 when statistically significant differences were present we performed a post hoc dunn s test for comparison across multiple groups dunn 1961 statistical significance among event medians was assessed at the α 0 05 level using a bonferroni correction to control for the familywise type i error rate across multiple comparisons bonferroni 1936 to characterize doc and dom responses during individual events we analyzed hysteresis loops and flushing indices of doc concentration and dom optical properties for each sampled event based on visual inspection of hysteresis loop directionality we classified hysteresis patterns as clockwise anti clockwise or complex i e having more than one hysteresis direction as in a figure eight pattern chanat et al 2002 evans and davies 1998 we used a similar approach to the one presented by vaughan et al 2017 to calculate a flushing index for dom optical properties during individual events eq 1 flushing index c highest sampled flow norm c initial norm where chighest sampled flow norm is the normalized value of a dom optical property for the sample with the highest flow during an event note that this may differ from the timing of peak discharge due to the grab sampling method employed in this study and cinitial norm is the normalized value at the beginning of an event the flushing index provides a quantitative estimate of the directional change in a particular dom characteristic from the onset of stormflow to peakflow negative flushing indices indicate a decrease in the value of a measured dom property on the rising limb and positive flushing indices indicate an increase in that property flushing index values range from 1 to 1 and the magnitude of the index reflects the relative change in value of a dom optical property from baseflow to peakflow providing a quantitative estimate of dom variation across early event flow conditions flushing indices for doc concentration were only calculated when data were available for both stormflow onset and peakflow samples we used linear regression to evaluate the relationships between precipitation inputs and doc concentration and dom optical properties for all events for the two snowmelt driven events we regressed doc and dom data against snowpack depth as a proxy for snowmelt progression over time during growing season events we evaluated the linear response of doc concentration and dom optical properties to total event rainfall amount and event api7 linear relationships were considered statistically significant if p 0 05 and we used the r2 goodness of fit statistic to assess the degree to which the change in snowpack or rainfall depth explained the variability in riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties during measured snowmelt and growing season events we used principal component analysis pca to assess qualitative differences in riverine dom optical properties across sampled events pearson 1901 the pca dataset included five variables fi hix β α e250 e365 and t c doc concentrations were not included in the pca due to the limited availability of these data for the 2018 sampled events all variables included in the pca were zero centered and scaled to unit variance prior to analysis the number of principal components to retain was determined through evaluation of the scree plot for the pca with a minimum threshold for principal component pc retention set as the fractional contribution to the explained variance theoretically contributed by one variable if all variables contributed equally i e 1

on 25 february and the snowpack had completely melted by 19 april during 2020 the snowpack reached a peak depth of 65 cm on 18 february and was completely melted by 10 april peak discharge associated with the main snowmelt events of 2018 and 2020 were 16 3 m3 s on 25 april 2018 and 34 2 m3 s on 4 april 2020 respectively fig 2 table 1 the river did not exceed bankfull discharge during the 2018 snowmelt event but did overflow the riverbank on 2 5 april during the 2020 event periodic rain events occurred during the active snowmelt runoff period in both years with a single day event contributing 10 4 mm of rainfall during the 2018 snowmelt runoff event and 48 0 mm of total rainfall over four separate rainfall events during the 22 days of snowmelt driven high flow in 2020 3 2 seasonal and intra event variation in doc concentration and dom optical properties dissolved organic carbon concentrations ranged from 9 9 to 61 1 mg l 1 across all sampled events with the lowest median concentrations observed during snowmelt events and generally increasing median concentrations as the 2018 growing season progressed fig 3 a the β α and t c indices of dom also demonstrated clear seasonal variations with the highest median values observed during snowmelt periods and lower median values during the 2018 growing season events fig 3d e humification index a measure of the more recalcitrant fraction of fluorescent dom cory and kaplan 2012 varied from 0 87 to 0 96 across events with lower median hix values during snowmelt driven events and higher median values during rainfall driven growing season events fig 3f fluorescence index and e250 e365 values showed no consistent seasonal patterns with significantly lower median values during the 2018 snowmelt event relative to the 2020 event and 2018 growing season event medians between the two snowmelt events fig 3b c on the time scale of individual events doc concentration and dom optical properties were highly variable with nearly all events demonstrating complex hysteresis patterns i e showing both clockwise and anti clockwise directionality figs 4 and 5 during both snowmelt events doc concentrations and hix values were lower at the start of the rising limb than at the cessation of the events however doc and hix flushing indices during the 2020 snowmelt event showed opposing patterns with a value of 0 51 for doc and 0 65 for hix fig 4a 4f fluorescence index e250 e365 β α and t c values were highest at the onset of snowmelt events and flushing indices for all of these dom optical properties were negative during the 2018 and 2020 snowmelt periods fig 4b e calcium concentrations and δ18o h2o values showed more straightforward hysteresis patterns during snowmelt events with the highest values at the start of the rising limb in both cases ca concentrations showed clockwise hysteresis figure s1 and isotope values exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis figure s2 during the first rainfall driven event following the 2018 snowmelt event 2 hysteresis patterns were highly complex for all dom optical properties fig 5 flushing indices for fi and β α were moderately positive 0 14 for both during this event while indices were negative for t c 0 59 and e250 e365 0 02 and zero for hix fig 5b f for the subsequent rainfall driven events hysteresis patterns became somewhat less complex but the directionality of hysteresis for doc concentration and all dom optical properties was inconsistent from one event to the next fig 5g x flushing indices for fi β α and e250 e365 showed similar patterns across subsequent events decreasing from event 2 to event 3 increasing from event 3 to event 4 and decreasing from event 4 to event 5 fig 5 the t c flushing index was lowest during event 2 0 59 and highest during event 4 0 57 but became marginally negative again during event 5 0 01 while the flushing index for hix was 1 00 for event 3 and zero for all other growing season events fig 5 3 3 changes in riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties with decreasing snowpack and growing season rainfall inputs in 2018 and 2020 maximum snowpack depths occurred in late february and declined thereafter with only a few instances of increased snowpack following late season snowfall events fig 2 no additional snow accumulation occurred after the onset of event sampling in either year snowpack depth decreased from 5 1 cm to 0 cm during the 2018 sampling period 20 april 2 may and from 40 6 cm to 0 cm during the 2020 sampling period 23 march 8 april riverine dom demonstrated strong linear relationships with snowpack depth as a proxy for melt progression during 2018 and 2020 while riverine doc concentrations increased as the snowpack melted during both years the relationship was only significant during the 2020 melt period fig 6 a as the spring melt progressed in both years fi e250 e365 β α and t c all decreased significantly fig 6b e these changes in dom are also reflected in the negative directionality and relatively large magnitude range 1 00 to 0 20 of flushing indices for these dom properties conversely hix changed relatively little with decreasing snowpack depth from 0 88 to 0 90 in 2018 and 0 93 to 0 92 during 2020 fig 6f the flushing index for hix was positive 0 50 during the 2018 snowmelt event but negative 0 65 during the 2020 event fig 4f during most rainfall driven events in 2018 doc concentration and dom optical properties were not influenced by total event precipitation and api7 although statistically significant relationships did occur during some events table s1 3 4 principal component analysis of event dom optical properties principal component analysis revealed clear differences in the optical properties of dom during snowmelt and rainfall driven events fig 7 together pc1 and pc2 explained 84 of the variability in the dataset the first pc represented a gradient in dom freshness as reflected by β α values while the second pc primarily represented a gradient of dom humification as indicated by the opposing hix and t c vectors fig 7 in general snowmelt events were positively associated with indices of more recently produced less aromatic dom i e higher fi e250 e365 β α and t c scores although each snowmelt event aligned with a unique subset of dom properties specifically the 2018 snowmelt event was associated most strongly with high t c and low hix values whereas the 2020 snowmelt event was best described by high fi and e250 e365 values fig 7 in contrast to the snowmelt driven events the 2018 rainfall driven events all clustered close to one another in principal component space suggesting similar dom optical properties these events were characterized by higher hix values and lower t c and β α values than snowmelt driven events although a notable exception to this clustering occurred during event 5 on 16 26 june 2018 the dom properties of the last three samples collected during this event were similar to those of the 2018 snowmelt event with higher t c and lower hix values fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal patterns in riverine dom the clear separation in principal component space between snowmelt and rainfall driven events as well as the differences in median values of doc concentrations and dom optical properties across seasons indicate that the mixture of dom sources in west swan river varies across the dormant season to growing season transition the shift from lower concentrations and more recently produced riverine dom during snowmelt periods to higher concentrations and a more humic like character during the growing season indicates a shift in organic matter source connectivity to the river over time differences in riverine dom composition between the spring snowmelt and growing season periods have been reported previously burd et al 2018 burns et al 2016 fellman et al 2009 inamdar et al 2011 singh et al 2014 although the nature of the change in dom composition often differs among sites burns et al 2016 reported a transition from more fluorescent fresh amino acid like dom at the onset of snowmelt to older more humic like dom at and following peak snowmelt in a montane headwater catchment in colorado usa the authors attributed this pattern to variations in hydrologic source contributions from primarily deeper groundwater during early snowmelt characterized by microbial dom sources to increasingly hydrologically connected shallow soils during and following peak snowmelt characterized by a more terrestrial dom source signature we observed a similar pattern during spring snowmelt events in west swan river with relatively fresh dom mobilized to the river during the early snowmelt period and older humic like dom becoming prevalent during the growing season both our study and burns et al 2016 reported shifts toward more humic like dom as the seasonal snowmelt progressed however hix values in our study ranged from only 0 87 to 0 96 across all sampled events whereas burns et al 2016 reported hix values ranging from 1 80 to 3 85 during spring snowmelt in a rocky mountain headwater stream the magnitude and range of hix values in our study is more similar to those reported by singh et al 2014 in a mid atlantic forested catchment the authors reported a mean stdev hix value of 0 89 0 02 across ten spring stormflow events which included snowmelt driven high flows and a mean value of 0 91 0 01 across eleven summer rainfall driven events in the same mid atlantic catchment inamdar et al 2011 reported greater protein like fluorescence in stream water dom during the spring snowmelt period compared to growing season rainfall events associated with greater contributions to the stream from groundwater sources during spring snowmelt events compared to growing season rainfall events our dom ca and δ18o h2o data suggest a similar progression of dom source inputs to the river during snowmelt although the temporal evolution of dom optical properties during snowmelt confirms our initial hypothesis of elevated fresh dom contributions during early snowmelt ca and δ18o h2o data suggest that the predominant source of this dom in west swan river is groundwater rather than mobilization of thawing surficial organic matter pools fellman et al 2009 similarly observed higher contributions of protein like fluorescence tryptophan and tyrosine like components during spring snowmelt events compared to summer high flow events in an alaskan forested wetland catchment however the authors attributed the seasonal variation in dom optical properties in that system to faster flow and mobilization of labile dom from shallow peat layers to the stream during the wet spring season and slower flows through deeper peat layers following water table drawdown in the summer months although these studies invoke opposing patterns of deep vs shallow hydrologic source inputs to explain the observed seasonality of dom characteristics during high flow events all of them demonstrate a similar seasonal evolution of dom optical properties namely higher t c values indicative of greater proportions of tryptophan like components during the spring snowmelt and increased prevalence of humic like dom during growing season events interestingly a contrasting seasonal pattern in stream dom properties was reported by burd et al 2018 in a large peatland watershed in canada that study reported greater contributions of high molecular weight highly aromatic dom during spring snowmelt followed by a general decline in dom aromaticity and molecular weight through the early summer period as in the fellman et al 2009 study these authors attributed the pattern to a transition from water mobilized primarily along shallow flowpaths over frozen ground in the spring to deeper groundwater flowing through mineral soils during the summer despite the contrasting temporal patterns in dom optical properties in these and other studies seasonal variations in predominant hydrologic flowpaths and connectivity remain important drivers of seasonal variability in doc concentration and dom composition in organic matter rich systems andrews et al 2011 guarch ribot and butturini 2016 raymond and saiers 2010 the seasonal patterns in doc concentration dom optical properties and biogeochemical tracers we observed in west swan river also point to hydrologic flowpath connectivity as a primary driver of riverine dom variability the shift from primarily low concentration low aromaticity protein like dom during the early snowmelt period to higher concentration more humified and aromatic dom during the growing season reflects the increased importance of soil water flowpaths during this period of increased warming and biological activity fellman et al 2009 4 2 event scale patterns in riverine dom in addition to the seasonal shift in dom properties in west swan river event scale hysteresis and flushing patterns also support the idea of dom mobilization from multiple source pools on event time scales hood et al 2005 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 pellerin et al 2012 sebestyen et al 2021 2008 during the 2018 and 2020 snowmelt driven events lower doc concentrations and hix values and higher fi e250 e365 β α and t c values coincided with the early phases of snowmelt fig 6 and event hydrographs fig 4 during this early phase fresh lower molecular weight fluorescent dom was mobilized to the river from deeper hydrologic source areas shallow organic matter rich wetland soil layers contributed little dom to surface waters during this time because they were snow covered and largely frozen however as surficial soils gradually began to thaw and snowpack meltwaters were able to infiltrate dom mobilization along shallower lateral flowpaths occurred at depths likely dictated by the interface between thawed soils near the surface and deeper frozen soil layers friesen et al 2021 additionally although specific data on water table elevations are not available for our study site observations from hourly photographs at the sampling location indicate that water tables rose substantially during both snowmelt events and even overflowed the riverbank for several days during the 2020 event this may have also contributed to the variation in dom optical properties during events as soils inundated by an elevated water table gradually released water to the river although the precipitation and groundwater ca and δ18o h2o data permit only a qualitative assessment of hydrologic flowpath variability as a driver of event scale hysteresis in west swan river the hysteresis patterns in both ca during 2018 and 2020 and δ18o h2o 2020 only support the idea of greater dom contributions from deeper groundwater sources during the early phase of snowmelt driven events followed by increased contributions of either direct snowmelt runoff or infiltration and lateral mobilization of soil water on the falling hydrograph limb figs s1 and s2 the negative flushing indices for nearly all dom optical properties during both the 2018 and 2020 spring snowmelt periods fig 4 also indicate a clear shift in dom optical properties from the early to later phases of spring snowmelt likely linked to this transition in predominant dom source pools as soil thawing and variations in water table elevation during the melt enabled hydrologic connectivity along previously unconnected flowpaths burd et al 2018 in our study watershed the extensive woody wetland cover contributes to high organic matter content in shallow soil layers such wetland vegetation cover is characterized by large humic acid fractions and high doc concentrations hood et al 2005 sebestyen et al 2021 2008 the elevated hix values and lower indices of fresh and microbial doc e g fi β α and t c in west swan river on the falling limb of the snowmelt driven events in 2018 and 2020 are consistent with the mobilization of meltwaters through these organic matter rich shallow soil layers sebestyen et al 2008 observed similar intra event variations in connectivity of dom source areas during seasonal snowmelt events in the sleepers river research watershed vermont usa with increasing contributions from surficial hillslope soils during the later melt period following peak event flow in the same watershed pellerin et al 2012 reported hysteresis patterns during snowmelt driven events that are consistent with our observations suggesting initial dom mobilization along deeper flowpaths followed by contributions from shallow subsurface source areas as soils wet up during the later phases of melt the gradual process of soil thawing during the transition from dormant season to growing season may have also contributed to the highly complex hysteresis patterns observed for all dom indices during event 2 the first rainfall driven event following the 2018 snowmelt period fig 5 highly complex and heterogeneous hysteresis patterns across indices of dom optical properties have been observed elsewhere with pre event biogeochemical conditions identified as a confounding factor in event scale hysteresis patterns guarch ribot and butturini 2016 during the spring season in northern minnesota soil thawing proceeds gradually from surficial soil layers downward deeper soil layers often remain frozen well into june in some areas friesen et al 2021 as the composition of dom can change substantially with depth in the soil profile kaiser and kalbitz 2012 roth et al 2019 spatial variation in the degree of soil thawing may contribute to greater variability in shallow subsurface flowpath connectivity and therefore riverine dom optical properties during the earliest growing season events following snowmelt in addition warming soil temperatures during this seasonal transition period directly regulate microbial respiration and dom production in soils christ and david 1996 further contributing to biogeochemical heterogeneity of the riverine dom profile at this time of year such transitory but influential seasonal processes may complicate the use of event scale dom hysteresis patterns to infer the timing of hydrologic connectivity between dom source pools e g deeper groundwater vs shallow subsurface flowpaths and surface waters during some events as biotic abiotic biogeochemical and hydrologic drivers simultaneously alter organic matter pools in unique ways guarch ribot and butturini 2016 raymond and saiers 2010 other indirect metrics of hydro biogeochemical source connectivity such as the flushing index may provide some insight into changing dom source contributions on event timescales particularly when consistency in the magnitude and directionality i e positive or negative of flushing indices exists across multiple dom optical properties for example consistently negative flushing indices for fi e250 e365 β α and t c during the 2018 and 2020 snowmelt events point to a broad shift across multiple dom metrics and a transition from fresh less aromatic dom source pools to more humified dom pools however we emphasize that while metrics such as the flushing index can provide useful insight on the relative change in dom properties it is important to interpret them within the context of absolute changes in dom properties as well the 2018 growing season events in our study provide an instructive example of this necessary additional context as the flushing indices of some dom optical properties e g fi and hix showed relative magnitudes as high as 1 00 while the absolute changes in these metrics from the onset of stormflow to peakflow were less than 0 05 fig 5 during most of the rainfall driven events in 2018 riverine dom remained relatively consistent characterized by less fresh more humic like dom fig 7 the consistency of dom optical properties across these growing season events and the sustained increase in doc concentrations fig 3a suggests that hydrologic connectivity between shallow wetland soils and the river coupled with increasing biological activity during this period of warming ambient and soil temperatures may have facilitated the increased mobilization of more highly degraded forms of dom to the river during these events hood et al 2006 raymond et al 2016 raymond and saiers 2010 5 conclusions patterns in doc concentration and dom optical properties in west swan river across seasonal and event time scales suggest that variations in hydrologic flowpaths regulate dom source connectivity in this wetland dominated northern minnesota watershed and consequently the compositional profile of riverine dom our results demonstrate that the seasonal snowmelt period signals a transition from primarily groundwater dominated inputs of low concentration fresh dom to the river during the dormant season toward high concentration more humified dom mobilized from wetland soils during the early growing season this pattern is further supported by the broad consistency in flushing index directionality across several dom optical properties possibly signaling a shift away from groundwater dominated inputs and toward increased contributions of soil derived dom highly complex hysteresis patterns of dom optical properties following the main spring snowmelt pulse may reflect dynamic soil thawing processes and water table elevations that add heterogeneity to hydrologic flowpaths and access to soil dom pools as the spring melt progresses as reduced snow cover is a predicted outcome of climate change in northern minnesota handler et al 2014 liess et al 2021 with implications for altered soil freeze thaw cycles and hydrologic flowpaths across soil depths the results of our study provide an important seasonal and event scale baseline against which to evaluate future patterns in riverine doc quantity and dom optical properties that might accompany predicted changes in

2365,the spring snowmelt period is an important time for organic matter mobilization and export in peatland and wetland dominated systems the hydrologic flowpaths that transport melting snow and soil water to surface waters can vary over relatively short time periods several days to weeks depending on the timing and rate of melt and the occurrence of freeze thaw cycles and rain on snow events dynamic flowpaths can alter dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and dissolved organic matter dom optical properties in surface waters due to differential melt and mobilization of snow ice and soil waters in 2018 and 2020 we measured the doc concentration and dom optical properties in a woody wetland dominated watershed in northern minnesota during spring snowmelt 2018 2020 and early growing season 2018 only events we examined patterns in riverine doc dom and hydrochemical tracers across event hydrographs to infer changes in hydrologic connectivity across this seasonal transition measurements of riverine dom optical properties calcium concentration and water isotopic composition indicated that dom shifted from a primarily groundwater source and more fresh character during the dormant season to a more shallow wetland soil source and recalcitrant character during the early growing season seasonal variations in dom optical properties and highly complex hysteresis patterns of dom indices e g fluorescence index humification index β α e250 e365 and the fluorescence peak ratio t c during individual events may reflect spatial heterogeneity in soil thawing throughout the watershed and temporal variations in water table elevation affecting flowpath depths and connectivity to dom pools within the soil profile this study provides an important seasonal and event scale

snowmelt event dom organic matter fluorescence eems data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a highly mobile component of organic matter pools dissolved organic matter dom plays a key role in many biotic and abiotic biogeochemical processes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems previous research has identified the importance of dom in the global partitioning

in these and other biogeochemical cycles but it is important to note that doc represents only one component of the larger dom pool cory et al 2011 thurman 1985 in addition to carbon dom is composed of other elements including nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen and this heteroatomic composition makes it difficult to quantify accurately minor et al 2014 thurman 1985 this difficulty notwithstanding

conditions organic matter mobilization and cycling are highly transient across spatial and temporal domains ågren et al 2007 andrews et al 2011 the spatial variability of organic matter pools at the watershed scale is regulated by multiple factors including seasonality soil type and moisture content vegetation cover and hydrologic connectivity ågren et al 2007 andrews et al 2011 limpens et al 2008 raymond and saiers 2010 sebestyen et al 2021 in turn the spatial arrangement of these characteristics within a watershed affects the quantity and quality of dom ultimately reaching streams and rivers for example due to their extraordinary capacity to generate store and mobilize organic matter the location of wetlands in a watershed whether they are proximally or distally situated relative to surface waters can significantly affect organic matter mobilization from terrestrial to aquatic systems laudon et al 2011 2004 in the temporal domain researchers have reported a range of surface water doc concentrations and dom compositions on event and longer time scales seasonally the spring snowmelt period coincides with the highest annual stream doc concentrations in some watersheds andrews et al 2011 boyer et al 2000 perdrial et al 2014 and the lowest concentrations in others inamdar et al 2011 the sources and composition of surface water dom can also vary seasonally with terrestrially derived fulvic acid rich dom predominant during spring snowmelt and more non humic autochthonous dom prevalent during the summer and fall in some systems hood et al 2003 such seasonal differences in organic matter are driven by multiple factors including temporal variations in predominant hydrologic flowpaths plant and microbial activity ambient temperature and photochemistry ågren et al 2007 laudon et al 2004 macdonald and minor 2013 raymond and saiers 2010 dissolved organic matter also varies over the much shorter time scale of individual high flow events some researchers have reported greater fractions of hydrolyzable amino acid rich dom under high flows relative to baseflow speculating that event flows mobilize more bioavailable dom lu and liu 2019 however others have observed no difference in the degree of bioavailability across flow conditions buffam et al 2001 such variations in doc quantity and dom composition on event timescales have been attributed to the timing and duration of hydrologic connectivity between organic matter source areas and surface waters covino 2017 hornberger et al 1994 inamdar et al 2011 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 differences in doc concentrations among source areas inamdar et al 2011 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 and differential hydrologic transit times between watershed source areas and surface waters resulting in biogeochemical hysteresis mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 rose et al 2018 van verseveld et al 2008 when the concentrations of biogeochemical constituents e g organic and inorganic solutes stable isotopes differ across source areas characteristic patterns of solute concentration discharge hysteresis may arise reflecting the sequence timing and magnitude of connectivity between these hydro biogeochemical source areas and the channel during periods of high flow therefore the magnitude and directionality i e clockwise anti clockwise or both of hysteresis can inform our understanding of the relative source area contributions to surface waters rose et al 2018 rose and karwan 2021 for example an anti clockwise hysteresis pattern of doc i e lower concentrations on the rising hydrograph limb and higher concentrations on the falling limb may reflect organic matter sources that are distal to the stream channel and therefore require longer transport times vaughan et al 2017 or alternatively delayed connectivity between shallow organic matter rich soil layers as soils wet up during rainfall events rose et al 2018 likewise in areas where bedrock is rich in weathering solutes such as calcium or magnesium higher concentrations on the rising limb compared to the falling limb i e clockwise hysteresis may indicate greater relative contributions of groundwater to the stream during early stormflow lower concentrations on the falling limb might signal a gradual increase in the connectivity of hydrologic sources characterized by lower concentrations of weathering solutes e g direct precipitation overland flow stored soil water resulting in a clockwise hysteresis pattern as groundwater becomes a less dominant source on the falling limb in this way temporal changes in surface water biogeochemical signals across the hydrograph may indicate variations in source area connectivity and contributions to surface waters this study combines measurements of riverine doc concentration dom fluorescence and dom absorbance properties and biogeochemical hysteresis to examine seasonal changes in predominant hydrologic inputs in a woody wetland dominated watershed in northern minnesota usa we collected sequential river water samples during event hydrographs associated with the main spring snowmelt events of 2018 and 2020 as well as four rainfall driven events spanning the dormant season to growing season transition of 2018 our goal was to evaluate the response of riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties to changes in discharge snowpack depth and rainfall inputs and to assess the potential utility of dom optical properties as tracers of hydrologic connectivity between organic matter source areas and surface waters during event flows we specifically examined 1 seasonal differences in riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties associated with snowmelt and rainfall driven events and 2 variations in doc concentration and dom optical properties during individual events we hypothesized that riverine dom optical properties would reflect elevated contributions of fresh dom from surficial and shallow subsurface source pools during the early phase of spring snowmelt and more humified dom during the later phase of spring snowmelt as soil thawing and infiltrating meltwaters progressed downward through the soil profile conversely we hypothesized that during rainfall driven growing season events dom optical properties would show the opposite pattern with indices of more humified dom prevalent on the rising limb suggesting dom mobilization along deeper flowpaths to the river and indices of fresh dom more prevalent on the falling limb as hydrologic connectivity with shallow soils increased as future climate scenarios predict warmer winters reduced seasonal snowpack and increased winter rainfall across northern minnesota and the southern edge of the boreal forest region more broadly handler et al 2014 liess et al 2021 this study provides important context on the timing magnitude and composition of dom export from wetland dominated systems across gradients of climate and hydrology 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sampling for this study was conducted in west swan river a fourth order river located in northern minnesota usa fig 1 the sampling location drains a 209 km2 undeveloped watershed with approximately 87 of the land cover classified as upland forest or woody wetlands anderson et al 2013 elevation across the watershed ranges from 397 to 472 m usgs 2022 and water table depths range from 0 to 30 m below the land surface adams 2016 soils in the watershed are primarily alfisols with approximately 77 of soils classified as hydrologic soil group d in the natural resources conservation service classification system these soils are characterized by low infiltration rates when thoroughly wet nrcs soil survey staff 2021 discharge in west swan river is strongly seasonal with annual peak flows typically occurring in april or may during the spring snowmelt period usgs 2016 water quality in west swan river is characterized by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca as excellent with low concentrations of suspended sediment nutrients and bacteria the river supports populations of several sensitive fish and invertebrate species anderson et al 2013 2 2 sample collection discharge and precipitation measurements sampling was conducted on an ungauged reach of west swan river discharge was estimated using several methods from october 2016 through november 2017 simultaneous measurements of discharge measured with an upward looking sontek iq acoustic doppler velocimeter adv installed on the riverbed and depth measured with a meter ctd 10 pressure transducer were taken at 5 minute intervals to establish a rating curve for the study site channel cross sections were surveyed during the summers of 2016 and 2017 and channel profile information in the adv software was adjusted accordingly to ensure accurate discharge estimates based on these 5 minute adv measurements average baseflow discharge in west swan river was 0 52 m3 s the adv was removed from the site in november 2017 to ensure additional measurement redundancy following occasional instances of damage to the pressure transducer we installed a staff gauge in the river in march 2017 along with an outdoor trail camera programmed to take hourly photographs of the staff gauge water level during daylight hours each day staff gauge water level measurements were adjusted to account for the depth offset between the pressure transducer and staff gauge locations in the river before applying the rating curve to estimate discharge rates we quantified rainfall inputs associated with growing season high flow events using data from the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa automated surface observing system noaa 2022a local rainfall inputs were quantified on an hourly timestep fig 2 at the chisholm hibbing airport in hibbing minnesota located approximately 15 km north of the study site antecedent precipitation in the week prior to each growing season event sampled in 2018 was quantified with an antecedent precipitation index api7 as in other studies of intra event stormflow dynamics brocca et al 2008 heathwaite and bieroza 2020 rose and karwan 2021 to track temporal changes in daily snowpack depth we used measurements recorded at noaa national climate data center station us1mnsl0108 located approximately 30 km northeast of the study site in iron junction minnesota noaa 2022b although this station is somewhat distant from the study site it is the nearest measurement location with a complete record of daily snowpack depths for the full snowmelt periods in 2018 and 2020 we used an automated sampler model 6712 teledyne isco usa to collect sequential 1 l river water samples during high flow events associated with snowmelt and rainfall events during 2018 and 2020 table 1 during the main snowmelt event in 2018 samples were collected every eight hours sample collection intervals varied for the subsequent growing season rainfall events ranging from every five hours to once per day during the 2020 snowmelt event rising limb and peakflow samples were collected once per day however an undetected autosampler failure resulted in missing samples at the end of the falling limb of this event hydrograph we discovered this instrument failure only upon arriving at the study site near the time when the final autosampler bottle was scheduled to be collected by which time the river had already returned to baseflow conditions we collected a grab sample from the river at this time upon retrieval from the study site following each event samples were brought to the lab for processing samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone pes filter and stored in the dark at 4 c until analysis for organic and inorganic constituents 2 3 sample analyses 2 3 1 doc concentration and dom optical properties dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined using a phoenix dohrmann 800 tic toc analyzer at the research analytical laboratory at the university of minnesota twin cities following standard methods arnold et al 1992 the analytical procedure uses persulfate in the presence of ultraviolet light to oxidize organic carbon to co2 which is then measured directly by non dispersive infrared radiation inorganic carbon was removed by sparging with n2 gas prior to sample analysis due to analytical instrumentation problems during initial sample analyses doc concentrations were reliably determined for only a subset of water samples collected during the 2018 snowmelt and rainfall events 68 doc concentration measurements out of 94 total samples during 2018 despite this reduced doc concentration dataset doc concentrations on the rising limb near peakflow and on the falling limb are still included in the final dataset of all sampled events dissolved organic matter optical properties were determined for all samples using a horiba aqualog fluorescence spectrophotometer sample excitation emission matrices eems were measured using a 1 cm quartz cell with correction for inner filter effects and normalization by raman scattering area at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm a reference sample of ultrapure water 18 mω cm 1 at 25 c was included in each analytical run sample eems data were used to calculate several indices based on dom optical properties table 2 indices used in our analyses included fi mcknight et al 2001 hix zsolnay et al 1999 β α wilson and xenopoulos 2009 e250 e365 de haan and de boer 1987 and the fluorescence peak ratio t c coble 1996 2 3 2 inorganic and water isotope analyses for hydrologic source characterization to examine potential variations in groundwater and direct snowmelt inputs to west swan river during snowmelt driven high flow events we quantified concentrations of a weathering solute tracer calcium ca during the 2018 and 2020 events and a stable isotope tracer of water δ18o h2o during the 2020 event in sequential river samples calcium concentrations were determined for a subset of samples collected on the rising and falling limbs of event hydrographs during the 2018 snowmelt event and for all samples collected during the 2020 snowmelt event calcium concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes at the research analytical laboratory at the university of minnesota twin cities following standard methods epa 1983 temporal changes in river ca concentrations were compared to concentration ranges previously reported for precipitation and groundwater at sampling sites in northern minnesota for the groundwater source we defined a ca concentration range of 22 3 mg l 1 29 9 mg l 1 using measurements from minnesota pollution control agency mpca groundwater monitoring station 526735 well completion depth 12 m and station 484886 well completion depth 20 m these wells represent the nearest available data for our study site both located approximately 14 km west of our sampling location mpca 2022a similarly mpca reported a ca concentration of 28 3 mg l 1 in a river sample collected in november 2011 under low flow conditions at a monitoring site approximately 4 km downstream of our study site mpca 2022b bedrock underlying these mpca monitoring sites as well as our study site is part of the virginia formation composed of interbedded argillite argillaceous siltstone and fine grained feldspathic graywacke sims et al 1970 the precipitation ca concentration range was determined from weekly samples collected at the national atmospheric deposition program national trends network site mn16 at the usda forest service marcell experimental forest near grand rapids mn approximately 70 km west of our study site national atmospheric deposition program 2022 we defined a range of precipitation ca concentration between 0 03 mg l 1 1 07 mg l 1 representing the lowest and highest ca concentrations reported across all weekly samples collected during the periods of seasonal snowpack accumulation and melt in our study area for 2018 october 2017 april 2018 and 2020 october 2019 march 2020 preferential elution of ions can occur within the snowpack leading to higher concentrations in meltwaters relative to the parent snowpack brimblecombe et al 1987 1985 jenkins et al 1993 lilbæk and pomeroy 2008 williams and melack 1991 previous studies examining preferential elution of ca in snowpack meltwaters reported an approximately 10 fold increase in meltwater concentrations relative to the parent snowpack brimblecombe et al 1987 jenkins et al 1993 lilbæk and pomeroy 2008 williams and melack 1991 because the ca concentration ranges of the precipitation and groundwater endmembers used in our study differ by more than 20 fold figure si we assumed any effect of preferential ca elution from the snowpack would not preclude a qualitative assessment of changes in predominant hydrologic inputs to west swan river during snowmelt driven high flow events during the 2020 snowmelt event we also analyzed sequential river samples for water isotopic composition δ18o h2o samples were analyzed at the university of minnesota duluth stable isotope lab using a picarro l2130 i isotope and gas concentration analyzer 0 1 precision for δ18o h2o samples were subjected to a range of holding times in the autosampler i e a 30 day holding time for the first snowmelt sample and a 15 day holding time for the last snowmelt sample collected prior to all samples being retrieved from the study site to address the potential effect of extended sample holding times in the field on water isotopic composition we subsampled two 25 ml aliquots from a 1 l grab sample collected on 11 march 2020 one aliquot was left in the field the vial was stored uncapped but was protected under the lid of the autosampler for 12 days and the other aliquot was immediately capped sealed with parafilm and returned to the lab where it was stored until all samples for the 2020 event were analyzed for δ18o h2o composition comparison of the paired aliquots from the 11 march 2020 grab sample indicated that the δ18o h2o in the uncapped field sample was 10 38 0 03 whereas the δ18o h2o in the immediately capped and parafilm sealed vial was 11 01 0 02 therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that fractionation processes might have differentially affected the water isotopic composition of sequential water samples collected over 16 days during the 2020 snowmelt period because we did not sample groundwater and snowpack meltwaters at the study site we used δ18o h2o values for groundwater range 11 7 to 11 2 n 4 and snowpack meltwater range 15 2 to 12 4 n 18 samples collected on the university of minnesota duluth campus located approximately 100 km east of the study site between march and april 2020 ihlang 2021 to establish ranges for these hydrologic sources as the marcell experimental forest and duluth sites are located at large distances from our study site we limited our comparisons of river precipitation and groundwater ca and δ18o h2o to qualitative examinations of the temporal evolution of ca concentration and δ18o h2o composition during snowmelt associated hydrographs assuming the chemical and isotopic compositions of snowmelt and groundwater remain sufficiently distinct over the time periods of our analysis such qualitative evaluation of the relative changes in hydrologic contributions from these two hydrologic sources to west swan river should be possible while this assumption likely holds for ca concentrations due to the large difference in concentration ranges between the precipitation and groundwater sources we acknowledge that this assumption might not hold for water isotopic composition due to the greater similarity in snowmelt and groundwater isotope values 2 4 data analysis we used the kruskal wallis test to examine statistical differences in median values of doc concentrations and dom indices across sampled events kruskal and wallis 1952 when statistically significant differences were present we performed a post hoc dunn s test for comparison across multiple groups dunn 1961 statistical significance among event medians was assessed at the α 0 05 level using a bonferroni correction to control for the familywise type i error rate across multiple comparisons bonferroni 1936 to characterize doc and dom responses during individual events we analyzed hysteresis loops and flushing indices of doc concentration and dom optical properties for each sampled event based on visual inspection of hysteresis loop directionality we classified hysteresis patterns as clockwise anti clockwise or complex i e having more than one hysteresis direction as in a figure eight pattern chanat et al 2002 evans and davies 1998 we used a similar approach to the one presented by vaughan et al 2017 to calculate a flushing index for dom optical properties during individual events eq 1 flushing index c highest sampled flow norm c initial norm where chighest sampled flow norm is the normalized value of a dom optical property for the sample with the highest flow during an event note that this may differ from the timing of peak discharge due to the grab sampling method employed in this study and cinitial norm is the normalized value at the beginning of an event the flushing index provides a quantitative estimate of the directional change in a particular dom characteristic from the onset of stormflow to peakflow negative flushing indices indicate a decrease in the value of a measured dom property on the rising limb and positive flushing indices indicate an increase in that property flushing index values range from 1 to 1 and the magnitude of the index reflects the relative change in value of a dom optical property from baseflow to peakflow providing a quantitative estimate of dom variation across early event flow conditions flushing indices for doc concentration were only calculated when data were available for both stormflow onset and peakflow samples we used linear regression to evaluate the relationships between precipitation inputs and doc concentration and dom optical properties for all events for the two snowmelt driven events we regressed doc and dom data against snowpack depth as a proxy for snowmelt progression over time during growing season events we evaluated the linear response of doc concentration and dom optical properties to total event rainfall amount and event api7 linear relationships were considered statistically significant if p 0 05 and we used the r2 goodness of fit statistic to assess the degree to which the change in snowpack or rainfall depth explained the variability in riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties during measured snowmelt and growing season events we used principal component analysis pca to assess qualitative differences in riverine dom optical properties across sampled events pearson 1901 the pca dataset included five variables fi hix β α e250 e365 and t c doc concentrations were not included in the pca due to the limited availability of these data for the 2018 sampled events all variables included in the pca were zero centered and scaled to unit variance prior to analysis the number of principal components to retain was determined through evaluation of the scree plot for the pca with a minimum threshold for principal component pc retention set as the fractional contribution to the explained variance theoretically contributed by one variable if all variables contributed equally i e 1 5 0 20 all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 4 0 3 3 results 3 1 snowmelt and related high flow event characteristics during 2018 and 2020 in 2018 the peak snow depth of 61 cm occurred on 25 february and the snowpack had completely melted by 19 april during 2020 the snowpack reached a peak depth of 65 cm on 18 february and was completely melted by 10 april peak discharge associated with the main snowmelt events of 2018 and 2020 were 16 3 m3 s on 25 april 2018 and 34 2 m3 s on 4 april 2020 respectively fig 2 table 1 the river did not exceed bankfull discharge during the 2018 snowmelt event but did overflow the riverbank on 2 5 april during the 2020 event periodic rain events occurred during the active snowmelt runoff period in both years with a single day event contributing 10 4 mm of rainfall during the 2018 snowmelt runoff event and 48 0 mm of total rainfall over four separate rainfall events during the 22 days of snowmelt driven high flow in 2020 3 2 seasonal and intra event variation in doc concentration and dom optical properties dissolved organic carbon concentrations ranged from 9 9 to 61 1 mg l 1 across all sampled events with the lowest median concentrations observed during snowmelt events and generally increasing median concentrations as the 2018 growing season progressed fig 3 a the β α and t c indices of dom also demonstrated clear seasonal variations with the highest median values observed during snowmelt periods and lower median values during the 2018 growing season events fig 3d e humification index a measure of the more recalcitrant fraction of fluorescent dom cory and kaplan 2012 varied from 0 87 to 0 96 across events with lower median hix values during snowmelt driven events and higher median values during rainfall driven growing season events fig 3f fluorescence index and e250 e365 values showed no consistent seasonal patterns with significantly lower median values during the 2018 snowmelt event relative to the 2020 event and 2018 growing season event medians between the two snowmelt events fig 3b c on the time scale of individual events doc concentration and dom optical properties were highly variable with nearly all events demonstrating complex hysteresis patterns i e showing both clockwise and anti clockwise directionality figs 4 and 5 during both snowmelt events doc concentrations and hix values were lower at the start of the rising limb than at the cessation of the events however doc and hix flushing indices during the 2020 snowmelt event showed opposing patterns with a value of 0 51 for doc and 0 65 for hix fig 4a 4f fluorescence index e250 e365 β α and t c values were highest at the onset of snowmelt events and flushing indices for all of these dom optical properties were negative during the 2018 and 2020 snowmelt periods fig 4b e calcium concentrations and δ18o h2o values showed more straightforward hysteresis patterns during snowmelt events with the highest values at the start of the rising limb in both cases ca concentrations showed clockwise hysteresis figure s1 and isotope values exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis figure s2 during the first rainfall driven event following the 2018 snowmelt event 2 hysteresis patterns were highly complex for all dom optical properties fig 5 flushing indices for fi and β α were moderately positive 0 14 for both during this event while indices were negative for t c 0 59 and e250 e365 0 02 and zero for hix fig 5b f for the subsequent rainfall driven events hysteresis patterns became somewhat less complex but the directionality of hysteresis for doc concentration and all dom optical properties was inconsistent from one event to the next fig 5g x flushing indices for fi β α and e250 e365 showed similar patterns across subsequent events decreasing from event 2 to event 3 increasing from event 3 to event 4 and decreasing from event 4 to event 5 fig 5 the t c flushing index was lowest during event 2 0 59 and highest during event 4 0 57 but became marginally negative again during event 5 0 01 while the flushing index for hix was 1 00 for event 3 and zero for all other growing season events fig 5 3 3 changes in riverine doc concentration and dom optical properties with decreasing snowpack and growing season rainfall inputs in 2018 and 2020 maximum snowpack depths occurred in late february and declined thereafter with only a few instances of increased snowpack following late season snowfall events fig 2 no additional snow accumulation occurred after the onset of event sampling in either year snowpack depth decreased from 5 1 cm to 0 cm during the 2018 sampling period 20 april 2 may and from 40 6 cm to 0 cm during the 2020 sampling period 23 march 8 april riverine dom demonstrated strong linear relationships with snowpack depth as a proxy for melt progression during 2018 and 2020 while riverine doc concentrations increased as the snowpack melted during both years the relationship was only significant during the 2020 melt period fig 6 a as the spring melt progressed in both years fi e250 e365 β α and t c all decreased significantly fig 6b e these changes in dom are also reflected in the negative directionality and relatively large magnitude range 1 00 to 0 20 of flushing indices for these dom properties conversely hix changed relatively little with decreasing snowpack depth from 0 88 to 0 90 in 2018 and 0 93 to 0 92 during 2020 fig 6f the flushing index for hix was positive 0 50 during the 2018 snowmelt event but negative 0 65 during the 2020 event fig 4f during most rainfall driven events in 2018 doc concentration and dom optical properties were not influenced by total event precipitation and api7 although statistically significant relationships did occur during some events table s1 3 4 principal component analysis of event dom optical properties principal component analysis revealed clear differences in the optical properties of dom during snowmelt and rainfall driven events fig 7 together pc1 and pc2 explained 84 of the variability in the dataset the first pc represented a gradient in dom freshness as reflected by β α values while the second pc primarily represented a gradient of dom humification as indicated by the opposing hix and t c vectors fig 7 in general snowmelt events were positively associated with indices of more recently produced less aromatic dom i e higher fi e250 e365 β α and t c scores although each snowmelt event aligned with a unique subset of dom properties specifically the 2018 snowmelt event was associated most strongly with high t c and low hix values whereas the 2020 snowmelt event was best described by high fi and e250 e365 values fig 7 in contrast to the snowmelt driven events the 2018 rainfall driven events all clustered close to one another in principal component space suggesting similar dom optical properties these events were characterized by higher hix values and lower t c and β α values than snowmelt driven events although a notable exception to this clustering occurred during event 5 on 16 26 june 2018 the dom properties of the last three samples collected during this event were similar to those of the 2018 snowmelt event with higher t c and lower hix values fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal patterns in riverine dom the clear separation in principal component space between snowmelt and rainfall driven events as well as the differences in median values of doc concentrations and dom optical properties across seasons indicate that the mixture of dom sources in west swan river varies across the dormant season to growing season transition the shift from lower concentrations and more recently produced riverine dom during snowmelt periods to higher concentrations and a more humic like character during the growing season indicates a shift in organic matter source connectivity to the river over time differences in riverine dom composition between the spring snowmelt and growing season periods have been reported previously burd et al 2018 burns et al 2016 fellman et al 2009 inamdar et al 2011 singh et al 2014 although the nature of the change in dom composition often differs among sites burns et al 2016 reported a transition from more fluorescent fresh amino acid like dom at the onset of snowmelt to older more humic like dom at and following peak snowmelt in a montane headwater catchment in colorado usa the authors attributed this pattern to variations in hydrologic source contributions from primarily deeper groundwater during early snowmelt characterized by microbial dom sources to increasingly hydrologically connected shallow soils during and following peak snowmelt characterized by a more terrestrial dom source signature we observed a similar pattern during spring snowmelt events in west swan river with relatively fresh dom mobilized to the river during the early snowmelt period and older humic like dom becoming prevalent during the growing season both our study and burns et al 2016 reported shifts toward more humic like dom as the seasonal snowmelt progressed however hix values in our study ranged from only 0 87 to 0 96 across all sampled events whereas burns et al 2016 reported hix values ranging from 1 80 to 3 85 during spring snowmelt in a rocky mountain headwater stream the magnitude and range of hix values in our study is more similar to those reported by singh et al 2014 in a mid atlantic forested catchment the authors reported a mean stdev hix value of 0 89 0 02 across ten spring stormflow events which included snowmelt driven high flows and a mean value of 0 91 0 01 across eleven summer rainfall driven events in the same mid atlantic catchment inamdar et al 2011 reported greater protein like fluorescence in stream water dom during the spring snowmelt period compared to growing season rainfall events associated with greater contributions to the stream from groundwater sources during spring snowmelt events compared to growing season rainfall events our dom ca and δ18o h2o data suggest a similar progression of dom source inputs to the river during snowmelt although the temporal evolution of dom optical properties during snowmelt confirms our initial hypothesis of elevated fresh dom contributions during early snowmelt ca and δ18o h2o data suggest that the predominant source of this dom in west swan river is groundwater rather than mobilization of thawing surficial organic matter pools fellman et al 2009 similarly observed higher contributions of protein like fluorescence tryptophan and tyrosine like components during spring snowmelt events compared to summer high flow events in an alaskan forested wetland catchment however the authors attributed the seasonal variation in dom optical properties in that system to faster flow and mobilization of labile dom from shallow peat layers to the stream during the wet spring season and slower flows through deeper peat layers following water table drawdown in the summer months although these studies invoke opposing patterns of deep vs shallow hydrologic source inputs to explain the observed seasonality of dom characteristics during high flow events all of them demonstrate a similar seasonal evolution of dom optical properties namely higher t c values indicative of greater proportions of tryptophan like components during the spring snowmelt and increased prevalence of humic like dom during growing season events interestingly a contrasting seasonal pattern in stream dom properties was reported by burd et al 2018 in a large peatland watershed in canada that study reported greater contributions of high molecular weight highly aromatic dom during spring snowmelt followed by a general decline in dom aromaticity and molecular weight through the early summer period as in the fellman et al 2009 study these authors attributed the pattern to a transition from water mobilized primarily along shallow flowpaths over frozen ground in the spring to deeper groundwater flowing through mineral soils during the summer despite the contrasting temporal patterns in dom optical properties in these and other studies seasonal variations in predominant hydrologic flowpaths and connectivity remain important drivers of seasonal variability in doc concentration and dom composition in organic matter rich systems andrews et al 2011 guarch ribot and butturini 2016 raymond and saiers 2010 the seasonal patterns in doc concentration dom optical properties and biogeochemical tracers we observed in west swan river also point to hydrologic flowpath connectivity as a primary driver of riverine dom variability the shift from primarily low concentration low aromaticity protein like dom during the early snowmelt period to higher concentration more humified and aromatic dom during the growing season reflects the increased importance of soil water flowpaths during this period of increased warming and biological activity fellman et al 2009 4 2 event scale patterns in riverine dom in addition to the seasonal shift in dom properties in west swan river event scale hysteresis and flushing patterns also support the idea of dom mobilization from multiple source pools on event time scales hood et al 2005 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 pellerin et al 2012 sebestyen et al 2021 2008 during the 2018 and 2020 snowmelt driven events lower doc concentrations and hix values and higher fi e250 e365 β α and t c values coincided with the early phases of snowmelt fig 6 and event hydrographs fig 4 during this early phase fresh lower molecular weight fluorescent dom was mobilized to the river from deeper hydrologic source areas shallow organic matter rich wetland soil layers contributed little dom to surface waters during this time because they were snow covered and largely frozen however as surficial soils gradually began to thaw and snowpack meltwaters were able to infiltrate dom mobilization along shallower lateral flowpaths occurred at depths likely dictated by the interface between thawed soils near the surface and deeper frozen soil layers friesen et al 2021 additionally although specific data on water table elevations are not available for our study site observations from hourly photographs at the sampling location indicate that water tables rose substantially during both snowmelt events and even overflowed the riverbank for several days during the 2020 event this may have also contributed to the variation in dom optical properties during events as soils inundated by an elevated water table gradually released water to the river although the precipitation and groundwater ca and δ18o h2o data permit only a qualitative assessment of hydrologic flowpath variability as a driver of event scale hysteresis in west swan river the hysteresis patterns in both ca during 2018 and 2020 and δ18o h2o 2020 only support the idea of greater dom contributions from deeper groundwater sources during the early phase of snowmelt driven events followed by increased contributions of either direct snowmelt runoff or infiltration and lateral mobilization of soil water on the falling hydrograph limb figs s1 and s2 the negative flushing indices for nearly all dom optical properties during both the 2018 and 2020 spring snowmelt periods fig 4 also indicate a clear shift in dom optical properties from the early to later phases of spring snowmelt likely linked to this transition in predominant dom source pools as soil thawing and variations in water table elevation during the melt enabled hydrologic connectivity along previously unconnected flowpaths burd et al 2018 in our study watershed the extensive woody wetland cover contributes to high organic matter content in shallow soil layers such wetland vegetation cover is characterized by large humic acid fractions and high doc concentrations hood et al 2005 sebestyen et al 2021 2008 the elevated hix values and lower indices of fresh and microbial doc e g fi β α and t c in west swan river on the falling limb of the snowmelt driven events in 2018 and 2020 are consistent with the mobilization of meltwaters through these organic matter rich shallow soil layers sebestyen et al 2008 observed similar intra event variations in connectivity of dom source areas during seasonal snowmelt events in the sleepers river research watershed vermont usa with increasing contributions from surficial hillslope soils during the later melt period following peak event flow in the same watershed pellerin et al 2012 reported hysteresis patterns during snowmelt driven events that are consistent with our observations suggesting initial dom mobilization along deeper flowpaths followed by contributions from shallow subsurface source areas as soils wet up during the later phases of melt the gradual process of soil thawing during the transition from dormant season to growing season may have also contributed to the highly complex hysteresis patterns observed for all dom indices during event 2 the first rainfall driven event following the 2018 snowmelt period fig 5 highly complex and heterogeneous hysteresis patterns across indices of dom optical properties have been observed elsewhere with pre event biogeochemical conditions identified as a confounding factor in event scale hysteresis patterns guarch ribot and butturini 2016 during the spring season in northern minnesota soil thawing proceeds gradually from surficial soil layers downward deeper soil layers often remain frozen well into june in some areas friesen et al 2021 as the composition of dom can change substantially with depth in the soil profile kaiser and kalbitz 2012 roth et al 2019 spatial variation in the degree of soil thawing may contribute to greater variability in shallow subsurface flowpath connectivity and therefore riverine dom optical properties during the earliest growing season events following snowmelt in addition warming soil temperatures during this seasonal transition period directly regulate microbial respiration and dom production in soils christ and david 1996 further contributing to biogeochemical heterogeneity of the riverine dom profile at this time of year such transitory but influential seasonal processes may complicate the use of event scale dom hysteresis patterns to infer the timing of hydrologic connectivity between dom source pools e g deeper groundwater vs shallow subsurface flowpaths and surface waters during some events as biotic abiotic biogeochemical and hydrologic drivers simultaneously alter organic matter pools in unique ways guarch ribot and butturini 2016 raymond and saiers 2010 other indirect metrics of hydro biogeochemical source connectivity such as the flushing index may provide some insight into changing dom source contributions on event timescales particularly when consistency in the magnitude and directionality i e positive or negative of flushing indices exists across multiple dom optical properties for example consistently negative flushing indices for fi e250 e365 β α and t c during the 2018 and 2020 snowmelt events point to a broad shift across multiple dom metrics and a transition from fresh less aromatic dom source pools to more humified dom pools however we emphasize that while metrics such as the flushing index can provide useful insight on the relative change in dom properties it is important to interpret them within the context of absolute changes in dom properties as well the 2018 growing season events in our study provide an instructive example of this necessary additional context as the flushing indices of some dom optical properties e g fi and hix showed relative magnitudes as high as 1 00 while the absolute changes in these metrics from the onset of stormflow to peakflow were less than 0 05 fig 5 during most of the rainfall driven events in 2018 riverine dom remained relatively consistent characterized by less fresh more humic like dom fig 7 the consistency of dom optical properties across these growing season events and the sustained increase in doc concentrations fig 3a suggests that hydrologic connectivity between shallow wetland soils and the river coupled with increasing biological activity during this period of warming ambient and soil temperatures may have facilitated the increased mobilization of more highly degraded forms of dom to the river during these events hood et al 2006 raymond et al 2016 raymond and saiers 2010 5 conclusions patterns in doc concentration and dom optical properties in west swan river across seasonal and event time scales suggest that variations in hydrologic flowpaths regulate dom source connectivity in this wetland dominated northern minnesota watershed and consequently the compositional profile of riverine dom our results demonstrate that the seasonal snowmelt period signals a transition from primarily groundwater dominated inputs of low concentration fresh dom to the river during the dormant season toward high concentration more humified dom mobilized from wetland soils during the early growing season this pattern is further supported by the broad consistency in flushing index directionality across several dom optical properties possibly signaling a shift away from groundwater dominated inputs and toward increased contributions of soil derived dom highly complex hysteresis patterns of dom optical properties following the main spring snowmelt pulse may reflect dynamic soil thawing processes and water table elevations that add heterogeneity to hydrologic flowpaths and access to soil dom pools as the spring melt progresses as reduced snow cover is a predicted outcome of climate change in northern minnesota handler et al 2014 liess et al 2021 with implications for altered soil freeze thaw cycles and hydrologic flowpaths across soil depths the results of our study provide an important seasonal and event scale baseline against which to evaluate future patterns in riverine doc quantity and dom optical properties that might accompany predicted changes in

2366,when an earth fill dam breaks dam body sediment and water flow simultaneously move to downstream area causing devastation dam break studies in the literature have concentrated mostly on the water flow part while ignoring the sediment movement by designing the dam body as a movable metal gate this study however is the first one experimentally investigating flow and sediment transport due to an earth fill dam break by constructing the dam body from sediment sediment propagation as a result of homogenous earth fill dam overtopping break was experimentally studied in a laboratory flume of 18 4 m long and 2 0 m wide and 0 88 m in height in the hydraulics laboratory of izmir katip celebi university izmir turkey downstream section right after the dam body was designed as a smooth bed and rough bed the rough bed resembling a simplified urban area was created by using thirteen 10 10 10 cm sized concrete blocks the dam body was constructed as homogenous with uniform material having d50 0 441 mm the earth fill dam body was built using the standard compression methods each layer of sediment with a thickness of 10 cm was laid in layers and the body was prepared with a crest width of 10 cm a transverse base width of 200 cm a longitudinal base width of 202 cm and height of 60 cm with upstream and downstream slopes of 1 1 6 the water level behind the dam was gradually raised until it overtopped the crest level a pre breach was formed at the top of the dam to trigger the break during each dam break event water depths were measured by three uls 40d level meter sensors at different locations and the final sediment bathymetry map was generated using the uls 40d probes at 10 10 cm grids the results showed that in both smooth and rough downstream bed cases the dam body eventually collapsed while a great portion of it was carried away by the flood flow the sediment spreading occurred all over the downstream area showing significant non uniform variation in thickness both longitudinally and transversely especially in the simulated urban area all the residential areas while breaking in motion were submerged under the muddy flow some blocks were almost submerged while sediment heights reached half level of some blocks at the end of the experiment sediment heights were higher in the urban area keywords earth fill dam overtopping dam break sediment bathymetry water level smooth bed rough bed urban area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the main causes of dam breaks are mainly insufficient spillway capacity piping seepage overtopping and structural deficiencies bozkus 2004 extreme inflows and overtopping have become major culprit in recent decades many dam breaks have occurred around the world the majority of them being earth fill dams constituting about 64 yanmaz and beser 2005 and overtopping is about 36 of dam failure causes costa 1985 foster et al 2000 in jakarta indonesia an earth fill dam having 20 million m3 volume and 16 m height failed on march 26 2009 due to extreme inflows resulting in more than 100 deaths and flooding hundreds of houses in kenya an earth fill dam failed on may 9 2018 due to the extreme inflows immersing many people and houses under mud and causing about 48 deaths an earth fill dam in vietnam failed on july 23 2018 causing many deaths and submerging houses another earth fill dam in brazil failed on january 29 2019 causing many people and houses to be drowned out under sludge these recent failed earth fill dams have shown that when such a dam fails not only water flow but also sediment movement can lead to devastating consequences it is well known that earth fill dams constitute about 80 of dams all around the world including turkey costa 1985 molu 1995 foster et al 2000 in recent decades failure of earth fill dams due to climate change causing extreme inflows are becoming common putting people and settlements at risk in downstream areas due to a possible failure as encountered in reality tons of sediments from dam bodies are transported downstream submerging people and settlements this study intends to investigate experimentally the effects of transported sediment at downstream areas there are many experimental studies concerning dam breaks for which the dam body is generally mimicked as a movable metal structure kocaman and cagatay 2015

having an obstacle or set of obstacles at the downstream side soares frazao 2007 soares frazao and zech 2007 testa et al 2007 guney et al 2014 constructed three dimensional physical model of an actual dam located in izmir turkey including dam reservoir and downstream area topography and settlements in an open area of 300 m2 they performed a series of sudden dam break failure experiments and investigated the flood wave movement in two dimensions at the downstream area although their work was the first one at such a large scale reflecting actual dam reservoir downstream area town highway and creek the dam body was designed as a movable metal gate tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 constructed an earth fill dam body in a flume and investigated overtopping failure in one dimension greco et al 2008 performed experiments on investigating the progress of dam body breach using a 35 cm wide and 37 cm high sand fill dam body in a flume similar work was undertaken by morris et al morris et al 2007 who built an earth fill dam body in a laboratory and in a field to study the breach process recently zhang et al 2009 constructed a homogenous earth fill dam body in a laboratory flume and investigated dam failure due to overtopping sharif et al 2015 investigated the piping process using cohesive earthen embankments in a laboratory flume msadala 2016 studied overtopping failure using a homogenous earth fill dam body existing literature shows that most of the experimental works designed the dam body as a movable metal gate and concentrated on flood wave movement few studies have constructed earth fill dam bodies but concentrated only on the breaching and piping processes due to overtopping and or seepage to the knowledge of the authors there is no study yet which has investigated the earth fill dam body failure and resulting water and sediment transport at the downstream area in three dimensions the objective of this study is to fill this gap by carrying out overtopping earth fill dam break experiments on smooth and rough bed downstream surfaces in each downstream bed case the experiment is performed twice to minimize the measurement errors and thus to present the reliability of the results 2 experimental set up experiments were carried out in an 18 4 m long and 2 0 m wide and 0 88 m height concrete channel constructed in the hydraulics laboratory of izmir katip celebi university plan and side view of the experimental setup and the side view of constructed homogenous earth fill dam body was presented fig 1 as seen in fig 1 camera 1 visualizing the crest was positioned at x 1 m in the middle of the dam crest which corresponds to the transversal central axis and camera 2 was positioned at the end of the channel looking towards the downstream face of the dam uls 40d probes probe 1 probe 2 and probe 3 were used for water depth measurements and they were positioned along the longitudinal central axis at x 1 07 m the location right at the crest section of the dam body see fig 1 x 2 02 m the location right at the end of the downstream skirt of the dam body see fig 1 and x 4 5 m the location which was 2 48 m away from probe 2 see fig 1 respectively uls 40d sensor is widely used for the measurement of water surfaces canals hydraulic laboratories and simulation facilities of physical models it is an easy to use ultrasonic measuring system that can measure water levels quickly and precisely uls 40d probes permit distance measurement from 30 mm to 3 4 m and measure with sub millimeter resolution the most important feature of this device is that it can perform measurements without disturbing the flow non intrusive the median grain diameter of the material used for the dam body was d50 0 441 mm and a total of 1363 kg of sediment was used to construct the dam body the particle diameter distribution of the material was given in fig 2 the dam body was constructed at x 0 m to x 2 02 m section of the experimental channel and at a height of 60 cm in 6 layers with a slope of 1 1 6 see fig 1 the side view of the longitudinal section of the dam body and details about its dimensions are given in fig 3 and table 1 respectively each layer was formed as 10 cm thickness by compressing it by 4 5 kg weight dropped on a 40 cm 40 cm metal plate 10 times from a height of approximately 46 cm in the experiments the downstream region was designed in two different conditions 1 smooth bed surface see fig 1 and 2 rough bed surface see fig 4 downstream roughness elements were placed at a distance of 150 cm from the dam body as shown in fig 4 with concrete blocks of 10 cm 10 cm 10 cm in staggered manner after the body is prepared a 5 cm deep and 10 cm wide triangular breach that corresponds to the intersection of longitudinal and transversal central axis see fig 1a was created at the center top part of the dam body by excavating the small amount of sediment to trigger the overtopping failure fig 5 shows the final version of the constructed dam body having a crest width of 10 cm a height of 60 cm a longitudinal base width of 202 cm and transversal base width of 200 cm as well as the smooth downstream area and the probes and cameras the upstream face of the dam was protected with a plastic cover as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 to prevent any damage to the dam while filling the upstream reservoir of the dam body with water before the initiation of the dam break the reservoir volume of 13 1 m3 was filled slowly for about 13 min in all experiments when the upstream water level reached almost the crest level the plastic cover was pulled from the upstream without disturbing the reservoir water surface and the upstream face of dam body once the overtopping starts the water level simultaneously starts dropping in the reservoir therefore as soon as the water level begins to decrease in the reservoir the dam failure experiment was defined to be initiated the pump is turned off once the water level in the reservoir reaches the lowest elevation of the breach records were taken to observe the movement and propagation of the flow and sediment with 2 cameras one located at the upstream side right above the dam body and the other at the downstream side see fig 1 fig 5 also 3 uls 40d level meter sensors probes were used for recording the levels see fig 1 fig 5 at the end of the experiment the sediment depth profile variation was measured by using the uls 40d and the surfer software surfer 2022 was used to develop the topographical maps fig 6 shows the experimental set up having rough bed surface at the downstream section and the pictures of the roughness elements cameras probes and the dam body 3 experiments 3 1 smooth bed downstream case as stated earlier two experiments were carried out for this case these are called experiment 1 and experiment 2 the pictures showing the propagation of water flow and sediment as a result of dam body failure recorded by camera 2 are shown in fig 7 the dam break started at 270th s of the experiment and for the sake of simplicity this timing is noted as t 0 s herein the stages of breach enlargement the propagation of water flow and sediment at the downstream area at t 0 s to 110 s with 10 s intervals were presented in fig 7a l respectively the breach formation progressed in time while the flow and sediment started moving at the downstream area fig 7a c at t 30 s the wave front reached to 4 m in the downstream section of the dam body while the breach progressively widened and deepened fig 7d at t 40 s the wave reached the end of downstream while the middle section of the dam body was washed away fig 7e at t 50 s at 2 m distance from the downstream edge of the dam body in the middle part of the downstream section a local hydraulic jump occurred fig 7f this jump widened towards side walls and became more dominant in the next 30 s of the experiment while the middle part of the dam body was completely carried away fig 7g i in the following 30 s of the experiment around t 90 s the hydraulic jump disappeared and only the left and right parts of the dam body remained standing still and the sediment originated from the dam body covered the whole downstream area with a varying thickness fig 7j l after 110 s there was hardly any sediment movement but only water flow the dam body collapse in experiment 2 showed the similar behavior as in experiment 1 fig 8 shows the distribution of sediment at the downstream area at the end of experiment 1 as seen the sediment moved to the downstream end covering the whole area while the area near both right and left sides of the longitudinal central axis where y 1 m had a shallower sediment zone depth due to the high velocity of water flow see fig 8 the sediment height was observed to be higher close to the walls at the right and left sides of the channel see fig 8 at the end of the experiment the sediment height readings were performed using the uls 40d probes at 10 cm intervals on the x and y axis and the two dimensional contour map and the three dimensional map were created by using the surfer software surfer 2022 as illustrated in fig 9 as seen the sediment heights at a distance between 3 5 m and 7 m from the dam body varied around 8 cm on the right and left sides of the channel while in the middle section its depth varied around 4 cm towards the downstream end the depths decreased from 4 cm to 2 cm becoming 1 cm at the edge see fig 9 the non uniform distribution seems to be symmetrical around the central longitudinal section see fig 9 fig 10 shows the longitudinal sediment height profiles from x 0 to 9 5 m along the channel length measured at every 25 cm section of the channel width transverse direction for experiment 1 and experiment 2 here y 0 cm corresponds to the right side of the channel while y 200 cm is the left side according to fig 10 the approximate sediment heights in sections y 0 cm and y 200 cm y 25 cm and y 175 cm y 50 and y 150 cm y 75 cm and y 125 were almost the same implying the symmetrical distribution of the sediment variation around the longitudinal central axis where y 100 cm maximum sediment height in the dam body was about 52 cm at y 0 and y 200 cm while the sediment height along the stream wise direction is about 6 cm at x 2 m 4 cm at x 4 m and 6 m and 1 cm at x 8 m the maximum dam body height was 44 cm at y 25 cm and y 175 cm while along the channel length it became about 6 cm at x 2 m 6 cm at x 4 m and at x 6 m and 2 cm at x 8 m maximum sediment height in the dam body at y 50 cm and y 150 cm was about 32 cm and it became about 6 cm at x 2 m 4 cm at x 6 m and 2 cm at 8 m distance from the dam body at y 75 cm and y 125 cm the maximum sediment height in the dam body was about 14 cm and it became 5 cm at x 2 m and 2 cm x 8 m distance from the dam body the section with the lowest sediment height was observed at y 100 cm which was located in the longitudinal central axis of the channel located on the way of fast moving water wave front the maximum sediment height in the dam body was about 5 cm at x 2 m 4 cm at x 6 m and x 2 cm at 8 m distance from the dam body the sediment heights transversely decreased from the channel sides towards the longitudinal central axis of the channel while longitudinally decreased from dam body site towards the downstream end of the channel see fig 10 the final topography obtained at the transversal central axis of the dam body that corresponds to the crest is depicted in fig 10j fig 10a i together with fig 10j confirm to the similarity and thus the reliability and repeatability of the experiments fig 11 shows the levels measured by probe 1 probe 2 and probe 3 sensors for experiment 1 and experiment 2 probe 1 shows the change in level at the location of the dam body x 1 07 m probe 2 shows the change in the level at the end of the dam body x 2 02 m and probe 3 shows the level change in the channel at the section of x 4 5 m as seen in probe 1 the level change in the dam body started after 0 s see fig 11 the level decreased from about 58 cm to 13 cm in between 0 and 110 s and then to about 10 cm in between 110 and 220 s at the end of 500 s the level became almost constant being equal to 8 cm probe 1 in a way shows the level change in the reservoir as seen in probe 2 in fig 11 the level increased to 10 cm in 30 s from t 0 to 30 s and then gradually decreased to 2 cm in the next 400 s in a similar fashion at probe 3 the depth increased to about 20 cm at 70 s and then gradually decreased to about 6 cm see fig 11 figs 10 and 11 show that the sediment profiles and levels measured in both experiments are compatible and thus conforming to the reliability of the experiments 4 rough bed downstream case in this case also two experiments were carried out namely experiment 3 and experiment 4 as presented in figs 4 6 and 12 thirteen concrete cubic blocs were used as the roughness elements at the downstream area of the dam body the objective was to investigate the homogeneous earth fill dam break as a result of overtopping and consequently flow and sediment movement in a simplified residential area fig 12 shows the images taken from camera 2 at intervals of 10 s from the beginning of the dam break for experiment 3 the water level at the downstream of the dam slowly reached 56 cm within 790 s and water passed through the dam breach fig 12b thus the dam break started at 790th s of the experiment and for the sake of simplicity this timing is noted as t 0 s herein water wave front reached the middle block located in the first line in 50 s t 50 s fig 12c sedimentary water passed the middle block and reached the second line of blocks at t 60 s fig 12d at t 70 s the front wave reached the last line of the blocks fig 12e and all the blocks were almost submerged at t 80 s fig 12f at t 90 s all the blocks were totally submerged and there were observed hydraulic jumps at the residential area fig 12g this process continued in the next 10 s as well fig 12h at t 110 s although the jump weakened all the residential area including the downstream section were submerged fig 12j and this last in the next 40 s fig 12k n the breach in the dam body gradually increased and the middle section of the dam body was almost completely carried away see fig 12a n in 130 s and the downstream area was completely covered with sedimentary flow within 90 s see fig 12a g the dam body collapse in experiment 4 showed the similar behavior as in experiment 3 fig 13 shows the picture of the sediment propagation along the channel at the end of the experiment 3 as seen almost half of the dam body the middle section was carried away while the left and right sides stood up high sediment heights were observed around the blocks located close to the right and left sides of the channel while some blocks were almost buried under the sediment there was no sediment accumulation around few blocks in the middle of the channel especially the middle block in the first line close to the dam body due to being on the way of very fast moving wave front see fig 13 the three dimensional bathymetry and contour maps of fig 13 were presented in fig 14 the sediment height varied between 56 cm and 5 cm at the dam body location and between 10 cm and 0 cm in the downstream region the distribution in sediment height was not uniform longitudinally and transversely throughout the section rather being quite non uniform the sediment heights around the blocks varied in between 10 cm and 0 cm depending upon the location of a block as seen in fig 14 most of the sediment carried away from the dam body was deposited around the residential area as in the smooth case the experiments for rough case were performed twice to minimize the measurement errors and to present the reliability of the results fig 15 shows the longitudinal sediment height profiles along the channel length measured at every 25 cm of the channel width transverse direction for both experiment 3 and experiment 4 y 0 corresponds to the right side of the channel and y 200 cm is the left side according to fig 15 the values of sediment heights in sections y 0 cm and y 200 cm y 25 cm and y 175 cm y 50 and y 150 cm y 75 cm and y 125 were not quite similar implying a non symmetrical distribution of the sediment variation around the middle section maximum sediment height in the dam body at y 0 cm and y 200 cm was about 56 cm at x 2 m distance depths varied between 2 cm and 5 cm at x 4 m distance the variation was in between 6 cm and 8 cm at x 6 m distance the depths were around 5 cm while they were around 2 cm at 8 m distance at y 25 cm and y 175 cm the sediment height in the dam body did not change significantly it was about 6 cm at x 2 m 7 cm at x 4 m 4 cm at x 6 m at 8 m distance it varied between 1 cm and 5 cm maximum sediment heights were 45 cm at y 50 cm and 32 cm at y 150 cm it was around 5 cm at x 2 4 and 6 m while it was about 2 cm at x 8 m distance maximum sediment height was 17 cm at y 75 cm while it was 8 cm at y 125 cm it was 6 cm at x 2 m about 3 cm at x 4 m 5 cm at x 6 m and 2 cm at x 8 m maximum sediment height in dam body at y 100 cm was 8 cm it was 5 cm at x 2 m it was 4 cm at x 4 m 6 cm at x 6 m and 2 cm at x 8 m distance the sediment heights transversely decreased from the channel sides towards the middle section of the channel while longitudinally decreased from dam body site towards the end of the channel see fig 15 the variations both longitudinally and transversely showed non symmetrical variation the final topography obtained along the transversal central axis of the dam that corresponds to the crest is depicted in fig 15j fig 15a i and fig 15j confirm to the reliability on the repeatability of the experiments fig 16 shows the levels measured by probe 1 probe 2 and probe 3 sensors probe 1 shows the change in the level in the dam body x 1 07 m probe 2 shows the level change at the edge of the dam body x 2 02 m and probe 3 shows the depth change at a distance of x 4 5 m as seen in fig 16 the depth change in the dam body started after t 0 s the level change at the dam body measured by probe 1 decreased from 59 cm to 15 2 cm in 110 s the decrease slowed down in the next 100 s reaching to 12 6 cm at the end of 500 s the height in the dam body became almost constant as 10 cm the level measured by probe 2 increased sharply to about 10 cm in 40 s and then it decreased gradually the levels measured by probe 3 rose to about 20 cm in 75 s and then gradually decreased to about 7 5 cm see fig 16 figs 15 and 16 show that the sediment profiles and levels measured in both experiments are compatible and thus conforming to the reliability of the experiments figs 17 and 18 respectively present the comparison of sediment depth profiles and levels for the smooth and the rough downstream bed cases the average values of experiments 1 and 2 the smooth bed case are compared against the average values of experiments 3 and 4 the rough bed case as seen in fig 17 sediment depths are higher near dam site including the urban area but lower close the downstream end the dam body have comparable heights in both cases fig 17a d and fig 17g i yet at y 50 cm the left side of the dam body in the smooth case and at y 150 cm the right side of the dam body in the rough case is significantly washed away see fig 17e f however overall in both the smooth and the rough cases as also seen in fig 7j the similar behaviour is observed with respect to the erosion of the dam body i e almost the same quantity of the sediment is carried away this can be further confirmed by the levels measured at the middle and the edge of the dam body by probes 1 and 2 respectively see fig 18 it is also seen that in the case of the rough downstream bed case there is more accumulation of sediment at x 4 5 m where probe 3 is located corresponding to the urban area see fig 18 5 dıscussıon of results after filling the reservoir it takes about 13 min for the overtopping to start after which the breach enlargement progresses carrying more flow and sediment from the dam body in time carried sediment spreads all over the downstream section of 8 m length showing the non uniform variation of thickness longitudinally and transversely sediment heights vary from 6 cm to 1 cm from the downstream edge of the dam body to the end of the canal at 2 m distance the variation is around 6 cm while it is between 4 and 6 cm between 4 and 6 m distance and 1 2 cm at 8 m distance if one were to try to derive an analogy with a real world problem based on the froude similarity law by considering a distorted physical model with a distortion ratio of 5 guney et al 2014 e g 1 30 for the vertical scale and 1 150 for the horizontal scale the dimensions of the experimental dam body employed in this study would correspond to the prototype of 18 m high and 300 m crest length and 1200 m distance from the downstream face edge of the dam body to the end of the downstream area according to these dimensions the sediment depths mentioned above would correspond to 1 8 m at 300 m 1 2 1 8 m in between 400 and 600 m and 0 3 0 6 m at 1200 m distance in the prototype note that these sediment depths are measured after the experiment when there is no more water however as shown by probe 3 in fig 18 during the experiment while the dam break is in progress the sedimentary water levels can reach 18 cm at 2 5 m distance from the downstream face edge of the dam body which corresponds to 5 4 m level at about 400 m distance in the prototype all the blocks representing a simplified residential area each standing for a 3 floor building according to the above mentioned distorted model are submerged by the flood flow some blocks are almost under the mud most of the sediment is deposited in the residential area the sediment depths varied between 2 and 6 cm 4 8 cm 4 6 cm and 1 5 cm at distances of 2 4 6 and 8 m respectively these values considering the above described distorted model of the prototype would correspond to 0 6 1 8 m 1 2 2 4 m and 0 3 1 5 m at 300 600 900 and 1200 m distances from the downstream face edge of the dam body as pointed out above these sediment depths are measured after the experiment when there is no more water however as shown by probe 3 in fig 18 during the experiment while the dam break is in progress the sedimentary water levels can reach 20 cm at 2 5 m distance from the downstream face edge of dam body which corresponds to 6 m level at about 400 m distance in the prototype considering that the residential area is located at this distance this result implies that two floor buildings can be submerged under the muddy flow these results can be considered compatible although it is not one to one comparison with those that were observed when the dam break happened in jakarta indonesia where 16 m high earth fill dam broke in 2009 due to heavy rains it is reported that a surge of water and debris several meters high reached the town of cirendeu washing away cars houses and a brick built bridge while most of the population was asleep the flood resulted in standing water up to 2 5 m deep inundating around 400 homes https en wikipedia org wiki situ gintung also when patel dam broke in 2018 in kenya it is reported that the sea of sedimentary water washed away power poles destroyed buildings and submerged the villages homes over a radius of nearly 2 km were submerged https en wikipedia org wiki patel dam failure 6 conclusions this study carried out overtopping earth fill dam break experiments in a long and wide laboratory canal the dam body was constructed from homogenous sediment with d50 0 441 mm the downstream section was designed for two cases smooth and rough the breach formation break stages flow and sediment movements were observed during the breaking process sensors measured flow depths while sediment maps were generated by uls 40d probes the repeatability of the experiments were presented and confirmed the reliability of the results the results show that the overtopping takes a little while to occur after the level reaches the dam crest after the overtopping flood flow becomes dominant and then a little while both the sediment and water flow occur simultaneously sediment movement speeds up as the breach opening keeps widening dam body eventually collapses and the most portion of it is carried away downstream while the left and right sides stands up the middle section is completely washed away sediment spreading occurs all over the downstream section showing a strong deviation in thickness both longitudinally and transversely as expected sediment heights at the end of the experiments are higher near the dam body and lower away from the body these depths can reach about 8 cm and 6 cm for the rough bed and smooth bed downstream cases respectively the sediment heights show a decrease from the dam body towards the downstream section about 8 cm to 2 cm in variation sedimentary flow depths during the experiments can reach high levels at the downstream section and decrease in time these depths can reach 20 cm and then become 10 cm for the rough bed case simplified residential area they can reach 18 cm and then gradually decrease to 6 cm in the smooth bed case sedimentary flow can overtop residential areas submerging all the blocks during the breaking process at the end of the overtopping break sediment levels can reach almost the top of some buildings near the channel sides away from the longitudinal central axis it is interesting to note that the blocks which are located near the longitudinal central axis on the way of water wave front had no sedimentation around rather sediment accumulated nearby the blocks most of the sediment is deposited in the residential area the results reveal that in case of such an earth fill dam break residential areas can be subjected to muddy flood flows resulting in catastrophic consequences the experimental investigation of sediment movement together with flood flow due to an overtopping earth fill dam break is carried out for the first time in this study the existing literature shows that most experiments designed the dam body as a movable gate some constructed the dam body from sediment but just concentrated on the breach formation dynamics however this study constructed the whole dam body using actual sediment and therefore the experimental data obtained in this study can form a sound basis for the development of numerical models that can be later employed for modeling such catastrophic events at larger scales it is also worth noting that currently available numerical models are not simultaneously and dynamically able to solve the all three main processes of the breaching the flow and the sediment transport although some solve the flow part dynamically they mostly handle the sediment transport part by employing the related empirical equations therefore the data obtained from this study can be a valuable source to develop and calibrate such comprehensive dynamic models in future such calibrated models can be employed to simulate sedimentary flows due to real earth fill dam breaks the success of the numerical models depends on also the correct estimation of the main geometric elements in time and in space for the breach formation in real dimensions future experiments can also focus on this aspect as well actual earth fill dams are constructed with the clay core in the center therefore future experimental works can also take this fact into consideration in addition earth fill dam failures due to piping process can also be studied in future author

2366,when an earth fill dam breaks dam body sediment and water flow simultaneously move to downstream area causing devastation dam break studies in the literature have concentrated mostly on the water flow part while ignoring the sediment movement by designing the dam body as a movable metal gate this study however is the first one experimentally investigating flow and sediment transport due to an earth fill dam break by constructing the dam body from sediment sediment propagation as a result of homogenous earth fill dam overtopping break was experimentally studied in a laboratory flume of 18 4 m long and 2 0 m wide and 0 88 m in height in the hydraulics laboratory of izmir katip celebi university izmir turkey downstream section right after the dam body was designed as a smooth bed and rough bed the rough bed resembling a simplified urban area was created by using thirteen 10 10 10 cm sized concrete blocks the dam body was constructed as homogenous with uniform material having d50 0 441 mm the earth fill dam body was built using the standard compression methods each layer of sediment with a thickness of 10 cm was laid in layers and the body was prepared with a crest width of 10 cm a transverse base width of 200 cm a longitudinal base width of 202 cm and height of 60 cm with upstream and downstream slopes of 1 1 6 the water level behind the dam was gradually raised until it overtopped the crest level a pre breach was formed at the top of the dam to trigger the break during each dam break event water depths were measured by three uls 40d level meter sensors at different locations and the final sediment bathymetry map was generated using the uls 40d probes at 10 10 cm grids the results showed that in both smooth and rough downstream bed cases the dam body eventually collapsed while a great portion of it was carried away by the flood flow the sediment spreading occurred all over the downstream area showing significant non uniform variation in thickness both longitudinally and transversely especially in the simulated urban area all the residential areas while breaking in motion were submerged under the muddy flow some blocks were almost submerged while sediment heights reached half level of some blocks at the end of the experiment sediment heights were higher in the urban area keywords earth fill dam overtopping dam break sediment bathymetry water level smooth bed rough bed urban area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the main causes of dam breaks are mainly insufficient spillway capacity piping seepage overtopping and structural deficiencies bozkus 2004 extreme inflows and overtopping have become major culprit in recent decades many dam breaks have occurred around the world the majority of them being earth fill dams constituting about 64 yanmaz and beser 2005 and overtopping is about 36 of dam failure causes costa 1985 foster et al 2000 in jakarta indonesia an earth fill dam having 20 million m3 volume and 16 m height failed on march 26 2009 due to extreme inflows resulting in more than 100 deaths and flooding hundreds of houses in kenya an earth fill dam failed on may 9 2018 due to the extreme inflows immersing many people and houses under mud and causing about 48 deaths an earth fill dam in vietnam failed on july 23 2018 causing many deaths and submerging houses another earth fill dam in brazil failed on january 29 2019 causing many people and houses to be drowned out under sludge these recent failed earth fill dams have shown that when such a dam fails not only water flow but also sediment movement can lead to devastating consequences it is well known that earth fill dams constitute about 80 of dams all around the world including turkey costa 1985 molu 1995 foster et al 2000 in recent decades failure of earth fill dams due to climate change causing extreme inflows are becoming common putting people and settlements at risk in downstream areas due to a possible failure as encountered in reality tons of sediments from dam bodies are transported downstream submerging people and settlements this study intends to investigate experimentally the effects of transported sediment at downstream areas there are many experimental studies concerning dam breaks for which the dam body is generally mimicked as a movable metal structure kocaman and cagatay 2015 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 bahmanpouri et al 2021 majority of these studies have concentrated on the movement of flood wave at the downstream area on a smooth surface without any obstacles bozkus

dam located in izmir turkey including dam reservoir and downstream area topography and settlements in an open area of 300 m2 they performed a series of sudden dam break failure experiments and investigated the flood wave movement in two dimensions at the downstream area although their work was the first one at such a large scale reflecting actual dam reservoir downstream area town highway and creek the dam body was designed as a movable metal gate tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 constructed an earth fill dam body in a flume and investigated overtopping failure in one dimension greco et al 2008 performed experiments on investigating the progress of dam body breach using a 35 cm wide and 37 cm high sand fill dam body in a flume similar work was undertaken by morris et al morris et al 2007 who built an earth fill dam body in a laboratory and in a field to study the breach process recently zhang et al 2009 constructed a homogenous earth fill dam body in a laboratory flume and investigated dam failure due to overtopping sharif et al 2015 investigated the piping process using cohesive earthen embankments in a laboratory flume msadala 2016 studied overtopping failure using a homogenous earth fill dam body existing literature shows that most of the experimental works designed the dam body as a movable metal gate and concentrated on flood wave movement few studies have constructed earth fill dam bodies but concentrated only on the breaching and piping processes due to overtopping and or seepage to the knowledge of the authors there is no study yet which has investigated the earth fill dam body failure and resulting water and sediment transport at the downstream area in three dimensions the objective of this study is to fill this gap by carrying out overtopping earth fill dam break experiments on smooth and rough bed downstream surfaces in each downstream bed case the experiment is performed twice to minimize the measurement errors and thus to present the reliability of the results 2 experimental set up experiments were carried out in an 18 4 m long and 2 0 m wide and 0 88 m height concrete channel constructed in the hydraulics laboratory of izmir katip celebi university plan and side view of the experimental setup and the side view of constructed homogenous earth fill dam body was presented fig 1 as seen in fig 1 camera 1 visualizing the crest was positioned at x 1 m in the middle of the dam crest which corresponds to the transversal central axis and camera 2 was positioned at the end of the channel looking towards the downstream face of the dam uls 40d probes probe 1 probe 2 and probe 3 were used for water depth measurements and they were positioned along the longitudinal central axis at x 1 07 m the location right at the crest section of the dam body see fig 1 x 2 02 m the location right at the end of the downstream skirt of the dam body see fig 1 and x 4 5 m the location which was 2 48 m away from probe 2 see fig 1 respectively uls 40d sensor is widely used for the measurement of water surfaces canals hydraulic laboratories and simulation facilities of physical models it is an easy to use ultrasonic measuring system that can measure water levels quickly and precisely uls 40d probes permit distance measurement from 30 mm to 3 4 m and measure with sub millimeter resolution the most important feature of this device is that it can perform measurements without disturbing the flow non intrusive the median grain diameter of the material used for the dam body was d50 0 441 mm and a total of 1363 kg of sediment was used to construct the dam body the particle diameter distribution of the material was given in fig 2 the dam body was constructed at x 0 m to x 2 02 m section of the experimental channel and at a height of 60 cm in 6 layers with a slope of 1 1 6 see fig 1 the side view of the longitudinal section of the dam body and details about its dimensions are given in fig 3 and table 1 respectively each layer was formed as 10 cm thickness by compressing it by 4 5 kg weight dropped on a 40 cm 40 cm metal plate 10 times from a height of approximately 46 cm in the experiments the downstream region was designed in two different conditions 1 smooth bed surface see fig 1 and 2 rough bed surface see fig 4 downstream roughness elements were placed at a distance of 150 cm from the dam body as shown in fig 4 with concrete blocks of 10 cm 10 cm 10 cm in staggered manner after the body is prepared a 5 cm deep and 10 cm wide triangular breach that corresponds to the intersection of longitudinal and transversal central axis see fig 1a was created at the center top part of the dam body by excavating the small amount of sediment to trigger the overtopping failure fig 5 shows the final version of the constructed dam body having a crest width of 10 cm a height of 60 cm a longitudinal base width of 202 cm and transversal base width of 200 cm as well as the smooth downstream area and the probes and cameras the upstream face of the dam was protected with a plastic cover as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 to prevent any damage to the dam while filling the upstream reservoir of the dam body with water before the initiation of the dam break the reservoir volume of 13 1 m3 was filled slowly for about 13 min in all experiments when the upstream water level reached almost the crest level the plastic cover was pulled from the upstream without disturbing the reservoir water surface and the upstream face of dam body once the overtopping starts the water level simultaneously starts dropping in the reservoir therefore as soon as the water level begins to decrease in the reservoir the dam failure experiment was defined to be initiated the pump is turned off once the water level in the reservoir reaches the lowest elevation of the breach records were taken to observe the movement and propagation of the flow and sediment with 2 cameras one located at the upstream side right above the dam body and the other at the downstream side see fig 1 fig 5 also 3 uls 40d level meter sensors probes were used for recording the levels see fig 1 fig 5 at the end of the experiment the sediment depth profile variation was measured by using the uls 40d and the surfer software surfer 2022 was used to develop the topographical maps fig 6 shows the experimental set up having rough bed surface at the downstream section and the pictures of the roughness elements cameras probes and the dam body 3 experiments 3 1 smooth bed downstream case as stated earlier two experiments were carried out for this case these are called experiment 1 and experiment 2 the pictures showing the propagation of water flow and sediment as a result of dam body failure recorded by camera 2 are shown in fig 7 the dam break started at 270th s of the experiment and for the sake of simplicity this timing is noted as t 0 s herein the stages of breach enlargement the propagation of water flow and sediment at the downstream area at t 0 s to 110 s with 10 s intervals were presented in fig 7a l respectively the breach formation progressed in time while the flow and sediment started moving at the downstream area fig 7a c at t 30 s the wave front reached to 4 m in the downstream section of the dam body while the breach progressively widened and deepened fig 7d at t 40 s the wave reached the end of downstream while the middle section of the dam body was washed away fig 7e at t 50 s at 2 m distance from the downstream edge of the dam body in the middle part of the downstream section a local hydraulic jump occurred fig 7f this jump widened towards side walls and became more dominant in the next 30 s of the experiment while the middle part of the dam body was completely carried away fig 7g i in the following 30 s of the experiment around t 90 s the hydraulic jump disappeared and only the left and right parts of the dam body remained standing still and the sediment originated from the dam body covered the whole downstream area with a varying thickness fig 7j l after 110 s there was hardly any sediment movement but only water flow the dam body collapse in experiment 2 showed the similar behavior as in experiment 1 fig 8 shows the distribution of sediment at the downstream area at the end of experiment 1 as seen the sediment moved to the downstream end covering the whole area while the area near both right and left sides of the longitudinal central axis where y 1 m had a shallower sediment zone depth due to the high velocity of water flow see fig 8 the sediment height was observed to be higher close to the walls at the right and left sides of the channel see fig 8 at the end of the experiment the sediment height readings were performed using the uls 40d probes at 10 cm intervals on the x and y axis and the two dimensional contour map and the three dimensional map were created by using the surfer software surfer 2022 as illustrated in fig 9 as seen the sediment heights at a distance between 3 5 m and 7 m from the dam body varied around 8 cm on the right and left sides of the channel while in the middle section its depth varied around 4 cm towards the downstream end the depths decreased from 4 cm to 2 cm becoming 1 cm at the edge see fig 9 the non uniform distribution seems to be symmetrical around the central longitudinal section see fig 9 fig 10 shows the longitudinal sediment height profiles from x 0 to 9 5 m along the channel length measured at every 25 cm section of the channel width transverse direction for experiment 1 and experiment 2 here y 0 cm corresponds to the right side of the channel while y 200 cm is the left side according to fig 10 the approximate sediment heights in sections y 0 cm and y 200 cm y 25 cm and y 175 cm y 50 and y 150 cm y 75 cm and y 125 were almost the same implying the symmetrical distribution of the sediment variation around the longitudinal central axis where y 100 cm maximum sediment height in the dam body was about 52 cm at y 0 and y 200 cm while the sediment height along the stream wise direction is about 6 cm at x 2 m 4 cm at x 4 m and 6 m and 1 cm at x 8 m the maximum dam body height was 44 cm at y 25 cm and y 175 cm while along the channel length it became about 6 cm at x 2 m 6 cm at x 4 m and at x 6 m and 2 cm at x 8 m maximum sediment height in the dam body at y 50 cm and y 150 cm was about 32 cm and it became about 6 cm at x 2 m 4 cm at x 6 m and 2 cm at 8 m distance from the dam body at y 75 cm and y 125 cm the maximum sediment height in the dam body was about 14 cm and it became 5 cm at x 2 m and 2 cm x 8 m distance from the dam body the section with the lowest sediment height was observed at y 100 cm which was located in the longitudinal central axis of the channel located on the way of fast moving water wave front the maximum sediment height in the dam body was about 5 cm at x 2 m 4 cm at x 6 m and x 2 cm at 8 m distance from the dam body the sediment heights transversely decreased from the channel sides towards the longitudinal central axis of the channel while longitudinally decreased from dam body site towards the downstream end of the channel see fig 10 the final topography obtained at the transversal central axis of the dam body that corresponds to the crest is depicted in fig 10j fig 10a i together with fig 10j confirm to the similarity and thus the reliability and repeatability of the experiments fig 11 shows the levels measured by probe 1 probe 2 and probe 3 sensors for experiment 1 and experiment 2 probe 1 shows the change in level at the location of the dam body x 1 07 m probe 2 shows the change in the level at the end of the dam body x 2 02 m and probe 3 shows the level change in the channel at the section of x 4 5 m as seen in probe 1 the level change in the dam body started after 0 s see fig 11 the level decreased from about 58 cm to 13 cm in between 0 and 110 s and then to about 10 cm in between 110 and 220 s at the end of 500 s the level became almost constant being equal to 8 cm probe 1 in a way shows the level change in the reservoir as seen in probe 2 in fig 11 the level increased to 10 cm in 30 s from t 0 to 30 s and then gradually decreased to 2 cm in the next 400 s in a similar fashion at probe 3 the depth increased to about 20 cm at 70 s and then gradually decreased to about 6 cm see fig 11 figs 10 and 11 show that the sediment profiles and levels measured in both experiments are compatible and thus conforming to the reliability of the experiments 4 rough bed downstream case in this case also two experiments were carried out namely experiment 3 and experiment 4 as presented in figs 4 6 and 12 thirteen concrete cubic blocs were used as the roughness elements at the downstream area of the dam body the objective was to investigate the homogeneous earth fill dam break as a result of overtopping and consequently flow and sediment movement in a simplified residential area fig 12 shows the images taken from camera 2 at intervals of 10 s from the beginning of the dam break for experiment 3 the water level at the downstream of the dam slowly reached 56 cm within 790 s and water passed through the dam breach fig 12b thus the dam break started at 790th s of the experiment and for the sake of simplicity this timing is noted as t 0 s herein water wave front reached the middle block located in the first line in 50 s t 50 s fig 12c sedimentary water passed the middle block and reached the second line of blocks at t 60 s fig 12d at t 70 s the front wave reached the last line of the blocks fig 12e and all the blocks were almost submerged at t 80 s fig 12f at t 90 s all the blocks were totally submerged and there were observed hydraulic jumps at the residential area fig 12g this process continued in the next 10 s as well fig 12h at t 110 s although the jump weakened all the residential area including the downstream section were submerged fig 12j and this last in the next 40 s fig 12k n the breach in the dam body gradually increased and the middle section of the dam body was almost completely carried away see fig 12a n in 130 s and the downstream area was completely covered with sedimentary flow within 90 s see fig 12a g the dam body collapse in experiment 4 showed the similar behavior as in experiment 3 fig 13 shows the picture of the sediment propagation along the channel at the end of the experiment 3 as seen almost half of the dam body the middle section was carried away while the left and right sides stood up high sediment heights were observed around the blocks located close to the right and left sides of the channel while some blocks were almost buried under the sediment there was no sediment accumulation around few blocks in the middle of the channel especially the middle block in the first line close to the dam body due to being on the way of very fast moving wave front see fig 13 the three dimensional bathymetry and contour maps of fig 13 were presented in fig 14 the sediment height varied between 56 cm and 5 cm at the dam body location and between 10 cm and 0 cm in the downstream region the distribution in sediment height was not uniform longitudinally and transversely throughout the section rather being quite non uniform the sediment heights around the blocks varied in between 10 cm and 0 cm depending upon the location of a block as seen in fig 14 most of the sediment carried away from the dam body was deposited around the residential area as in the smooth case the experiments for rough case were performed twice to minimize the measurement errors and to present the reliability of the results fig 15 shows the longitudinal sediment height profiles along the channel length measured at every 25 cm of the channel width transverse direction for both experiment 3 and experiment 4 y 0 corresponds to the right side of the channel and y 200 cm is the left side according to fig 15 the values of sediment heights in sections y 0 cm and y 200 cm y 25 cm and y 175 cm y 50 and y 150 cm y 75 cm and y 125 were not quite similar implying a non symmetrical distribution of the sediment variation around the middle section maximum sediment height in the dam body at y 0 cm and y 200 cm was about 56 cm at x 2 m distance depths varied between 2 cm and 5 cm at x 4 m distance the variation was in between 6 cm and 8 cm at x 6 m distance the depths were around 5 cm while they were around 2 cm at 8 m distance at y 25 cm and y 175 cm the sediment height in the dam body did not change significantly it was about 6 cm at x 2 m 7 cm at x 4 m 4 cm at x 6 m at 8 m distance it varied between 1 cm and 5 cm maximum sediment heights were 45 cm at y 50 cm and 32 cm at y 150 cm it was around 5 cm at x 2 4 and 6 m while it was about 2 cm at x 8 m distance maximum sediment height was 17 cm at y 75 cm while it was 8 cm at y 125 cm it was 6 cm at x 2 m about 3 cm at x 4 m 5 cm at x 6 m and 2 cm at x 8 m maximum sediment height in dam body at y 100 cm was 8 cm it was 5 cm at x 2 m it was 4 cm at x 4 m 6 cm at x 6 m and 2 cm at x 8 m distance the sediment heights transversely decreased from the channel sides towards the middle section of the channel while longitudinally decreased from dam body site towards the end of the channel see fig 15 the variations both longitudinally and transversely showed non symmetrical variation the final topography obtained along the transversal central axis of the dam that corresponds to the crest is depicted in fig 15j fig 15a i and fig 15j confirm to the reliability on the repeatability of the experiments fig 16 shows the levels measured by probe 1 probe 2 and probe 3 sensors probe 1 shows the change in the level in the dam body x 1 07 m probe 2 shows the level change at the edge of the dam body x 2 02 m and probe 3 shows the depth change at a distance of x 4 5 m as seen in fig 16 the depth change in the dam body started after t 0 s the level change at the dam body measured by probe 1 decreased from 59 cm to 15 2 cm in 110 s the decrease slowed down in the next 100 s reaching to 12 6 cm at the end of 500 s the height in the dam body became almost constant as 10 cm the level measured by probe 2 increased sharply to about 10 cm in 40 s and then it decreased gradually the levels measured by probe 3 rose to about 20 cm in 75 s and then gradually decreased to about 7 5 cm see fig 16 figs 15 and 16 show that the sediment profiles and levels measured in both experiments are compatible and thus conforming to the reliability of the experiments figs 17 and 18 respectively present the comparison of sediment depth profiles and levels for the smooth and the rough downstream bed cases the average values of experiments 1 and 2 the smooth bed case are compared against the average values of experiments 3 and 4 the rough bed case as seen in fig 17 sediment depths are higher near dam site including the urban area but lower close the downstream end the dam body have comparable heights in both cases fig 17a d and fig 17g i yet at y 50 cm the left side of the dam body in the smooth case and at y 150 cm the right side of the dam body in the rough case is significantly washed away see fig 17e f however overall in both the smooth and the rough cases as also seen in fig 7j the similar behaviour is observed with respect to the erosion of the dam body i e almost the same quantity of the sediment is carried away this can be further confirmed by the levels measured at the middle and the edge of the dam body by probes 1 and 2 respectively see fig 18 it is also seen that in the case of the rough downstream bed case there is more accumulation of sediment at x 4 5 m where probe 3 is located corresponding to the urban area see fig 18 5 dıscussıon of results after filling the reservoir it takes about 13 min for the overtopping to start after which the breach enlargement progresses carrying more flow and sediment from the dam body in time carried sediment spreads all over the downstream section of 8 m length showing the non uniform variation of thickness longitudinally and transversely sediment heights vary from 6 cm to 1 cm from the downstream edge of the dam body to the end of the canal at 2 m distance the variation is around 6 cm while it is between 4 and 6 cm between 4 and 6 m distance and 1 2 cm at 8 m distance if one were to try to derive an analogy with a real world problem based on the froude similarity law by considering a distorted physical model with a distortion ratio of 5 guney et al 2014 e g 1 30 for the vertical scale and 1 150 for the horizontal scale the dimensions of the experimental dam body employed in this study would correspond to the prototype of 18 m high and 300 m crest length and 1200 m distance from the downstream face edge of the dam body to the end of the downstream area according to these dimensions the sediment depths mentioned above would correspond to 1 8 m at 300 m 1 2 1 8 m in between 400 and 600 m and 0 3 0 6 m at 1200 m distance in the prototype note that these sediment depths are measured after the experiment when there is no more water however as shown by probe 3 in fig 18 during the experiment while the dam break is in progress the sedimentary water levels can reach 18 cm at 2 5 m distance from the downstream face edge of the dam body which corresponds to 5 4 m level at about 400 m distance in the prototype all the blocks representing a simplified residential area each standing for a 3 floor building according to the above mentioned distorted model are submerged by the flood flow some blocks are almost under the mud most of the sediment is deposited in the residential area the sediment depths varied between 2 and 6 cm 4 8 cm 4 6 cm and 1 5 cm at distances of 2 4 6 and 8 m respectively these values considering the above described distorted model of the prototype would correspond to 0 6 1 8 m 1 2 2 4 m and 0 3 1 5 m at 300 600 900 and 1200 m distances from the downstream face edge of the dam body as pointed out above these sediment depths are measured after the experiment when there is no more water however as shown by probe 3 in fig 18 during the experiment while the dam break is in progress the sedimentary water levels can reach 20 cm at 2 5 m distance from the downstream face edge of dam body which corresponds to 6 m level at about 400 m distance in the prototype considering that the residential area is located at this distance this result implies that two floor buildings can be submerged under the muddy flow these results can be considered compatible although it is not one to one comparison with those that were observed when the dam break happened in jakarta indonesia where 16 m high earth fill dam broke in 2009 due to heavy rains it is reported that a surge of water and debris several meters high reached the town of cirendeu washing away cars houses and a brick built bridge while most of the population was asleep the flood resulted in standing water up to 2 5 m deep inundating around 400 homes https en wikipedia org wiki situ gintung also when patel dam broke in 2018 in kenya it is reported that the sea of sedimentary water washed away power poles destroyed buildings and submerged the villages homes over a radius of nearly 2 km were submerged https en wikipedia org wiki patel dam failure 6 conclusions this study carried out overtopping earth fill dam break experiments in a long and wide laboratory canal the dam body was constructed from homogenous sediment with d50 0 441 mm the downstream section was designed for two cases smooth and rough the breach formation break stages flow and sediment movements were observed during the breaking process sensors measured flow depths while sediment maps were generated by uls 40d probes the repeatability of the experiments were presented and confirmed the reliability of the results the results show that the overtopping takes a little while to occur after the level reaches the dam crest after the overtopping flood flow becomes dominant and then a little while both the sediment and water flow occur simultaneously sediment movement speeds up as the breach opening keeps widening dam body eventually collapses and the most portion of it is carried away downstream while the left and right sides stands up the middle section is completely washed away sediment spreading occurs all over the downstream section showing a strong deviation in thickness both longitudinally and transversely as expected sediment heights at the end of the experiments are higher near the dam body and lower away from the body these depths can reach about 8 cm and 6 cm for the rough bed and smooth bed downstream cases respectively the sediment heights show a decrease from the dam body towards the downstream section about 8 cm to 2 cm in variation sedimentary flow depths during the experiments can reach high levels at the downstream section and decrease in time these depths can reach 20 cm and then become 10 cm for the rough bed case simplified residential area they can reach 18 cm and then gradually decrease to 6 cm in the smooth bed case sedimentary flow can overtop residential areas submerging all the blocks during the breaking process at the end of the overtopping break sediment levels can reach almost the top of some buildings near the channel sides away from the longitudinal central axis it is interesting to note that the blocks which are located near the longitudinal central axis on the way of water wave front had no sedimentation around rather sediment accumulated nearby the blocks most of the sediment is deposited in the residential area the results reveal that in case of such an earth fill dam break residential areas can be subjected to muddy flood flows resulting in catastrophic consequences the experimental investigation of sediment movement together with flood flow due to an overtopping earth fill dam break is carried out for the first time in this study the existing literature shows that most experiments designed the dam body as a movable gate some constructed the dam body from sediment but just concentrated on the breach formation dynamics however this study constructed the whole dam body using actual sediment and therefore the experimental data obtained in this study can form a sound basis for the development of numerical models that can be later employed for modeling such catastrophic events at larger scales it is also worth noting that currently available numerical models are not simultaneously and dynamically able to solve the all three main processes of the breaching the flow and the sediment transport although some solve the flow part dynamically they mostly handle the sediment transport part by employing the related empirical equations therefore the data obtained from this study can be a valuable source to develop and calibrate such comprehensive dynamic models in future such calibrated models can be employed to simulate sedimentary flows due to real earth fill dam breaks the success of the numerical models depends on also the correct estimation of the main geometric elements in time and in space for the breach formation in real dimensions future experiments can also focus on this aspect as well actual earth fill dams are constructed with the clay core in the center therefore future experimental works can also take this fact into consideration in addition earth fill dam failures due to piping process can also be studied in future author

2367,droughts influence dissolved organic carbon doc export doc concentration and flux dynamics during different propagation stages of hydrological drought hd are complex and poorly understood long term from 1978 to 2018 weekly biweekly doc concentration and daily streamflow at four headwater streams of harp lake catchment ontario canada were used to examine the effects of hd on the dynamics identified hd were divided into four propagation stages pre drought p1 intensification p2 recovery p3 and post drought p4 the potential mechanisms underlying the patterns in doc were also investigated first hd reduced doc concentration by an average of 19 24 relative to non hd periods doc concentrations and fluxes of streams were different during different propagation stages second doc flux patterns among streams were consistent with fast decline slow rise fast rise trends over the p2 p3 and p4 relative to each previous stage however doc concentration pattern differed among four streams showing a fast decline slow decline fast rise trend across four stages in two streams but a fast decline slow rise fast rise pattern at other two initially doc flux during hd was primarily dominated by streamflow but doc concentration eventually became an important co factor third the rapid decrease or increases in streamflow during p2 p4 relative to p1 p3 led to a fast decline or rise in doc concentration differences in doc concentration responses among streams were probably due to differences in local hydrologic features e g wetlands and unnatural activities ph and so4 can also influence doc concentration dynamics during hd but just under the specific hydrothermal combinations this study provides an updated perspective to understand the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux and their drivers during droughts and it could be used to improve the modeling and management capability of water quality keywords hydrological drought propagation stage dissolved organic carbon dynamic patterns headwater streams data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the impacts of extreme hydroclimatic events on the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon doc have recently become broadly concerning castello macedo 2016 ren et al 2016 warner saros 2019 tiwari et al 2018 because they influence organic matter decomposition and doc export from soil to rivers bauer et al 2013 clark et al 2005 evans et al 2006 changes in doc concentrations can lead to significant changes in aquatic ecosystems and global regional carbon cycles morison et al 2022 fenner et al 2007 extreme hydrologic events such as hydrological drought hd has been occurring more frequently in the past few decades under global warming chawla et al 2020 hao et al 2018 sutanto et al 2020 williams et al 2020 hd is a continuation and evolution of meteorological drought precipitation deficit hao singh 2015 mishra singh 2010 zhang et al 2022 hd is usually characterized by a shortage of river flow or surface runoff and is regarded as the most severe type of drought linsley et al 1982 closely related to water flows the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux i e streamflow doc concentration during hd can reflect the states of terrestrial ecosystems during extreme hydrologic events bastos et al 2020 clark et al 2006 stocker et al 2019 pumpanen et al 2014 however much remains unknown about the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations and fluxes and their driving mechanisms during hd doc concentrations have increased over the past decades in rivers throughout the world clark et al 2006 worrall burt 2008 these increases in doc concentrations have been linked to increases in temperatures decreases in ionic strength or acidity of soil solutions and stream waters resulting from changes in atmospheric deposition changes in ph and sulfate and increases in atmospheric co2 as well as increases in droughts fenner freeman 2020 ritson et al 2017 several explanations have been proposed to explain the dynamics of doc concentrations during droughts for example i decreased runoff during droughts resulted in lower doc export from catchments worrall burt 2008 ii physicochemical changes in the peat structure prevented rewetting and led to delayed inhibited doc release from the soils revchuk suffet 2014 iii increased consumption of doc as a substrate by soil microbes caused increased co2 efflux blagodatskaya et al 2011 iv limited microbial activities were limited under dry acidic conditions resulting in reduced decomposition and production of doc romani et al 2006 scott et al 1998 and v so4 induced acidification reduced doc concentrations during droughts clark et al 2006 studies such as that by ahmadi et al 2019 have analyzed the evolution of water quantity i e streamflow and water quality i e turbidity and dissolved oxygen during hd and estimated that it would take an average of two or more months for water quality variables to fully recover following an hd event the doc concentrations become relatively low during dry seasons compared to wet seasons because the release of doc is inhibited by low river flow but doc release will flare up again once sufficient flow returns worrall burt 2008 a recent study from blaurock et al 2021 also found that low hydrological connectivity during drought inhibited doc mobilization alnahit et al 2020 suggested that not only anthropogenic variables influence the mean water quality constituents but other watershed characteristics such as soil properties have a significant impact besides we found that doc during hd had a close and positive linear relationship with hd characteristics that is with the increased drought duration and severity doc concentration also increased wu et al 2022a although general reasons for the changes in the dynamics of doc due to drought have been provided in previous studies hd have multiple propagation stages and the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux during the evolution of hd have not been well studied from the temporal perspective the propagation of hd can be divided into four stages pre hd p1 intensification p2 recovery p3 and rewetting post hd p4 wu et al 2018 the p1 period represents streamflow state before the occurrence of hd and is used as a baseline to characterize the response times of hydrological systems to a certain meteorological or hydro chemical processes hellwig et al 2020 vicente serrano lopez moreno 2005 wu et al 2021b p2 and p3 are the main periods of hd representing drought formation and the subsequent gradual disappearance recovery parry et al 2016 wu et al 2018 p4 is a specified period after the hd has recovered to a wetted condition i e the streamflow has been recovered to normal because water has been sufficiently supplied by the cumulative rainfall snowmelt or other water sources wu et al 2020 the different propagation stages periods of hd have different hydrological features parry et al 2016 and thus different biochemical activities blaurock et al 2021 a comprehensive understandings of doc dynamics during these periods of hd and their driving mechanisms are of great importance for revealing the response of doc changes to extreme hydrological events under changing environments here to reveal the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations and fluxes during hd events we used a 41 year 1978 2018 dataset of weekly biweekly doc concentration measurements at four monitoring sites in harp lake catchment ontario canada alongside long term daily hydrometeorological records i e streamflow precipitation and temperature and water quality e g so4 and ph records we also investigated the potential driving mechanisms underlying the dynamic doc

central ontario canada fig 1 was selected to demonstrate our study because there are four monitored streams hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 with long term data records from 1978 to 2018 but different drainage sizes the size from 9 97 to 119 09 ha in harp lake catchment the area was dominated by mixed deciduous and coniferous forests 75 of total area lake wetlands and ponds also occupied a substantial portion of the harp lake catchment fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the coverage by wetlands or ponds in hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 catchments was 8 6 0 7 9 7 and 4 5 respectively lane et al 2020 richardson 2011 the straight line distances for the nearest wetland to the monitoring sites were about 382 m 144 m 156 m and 345 m in the hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 catchments respectively table 1 mean annual temperatures ranged from 9 38 c to 12 79 c during the study period with an average of 11 03 c the means in january and july were 4 93 c and 25 66 c respectively zhang et al 2020 due to the cold climate around one third of precipitation in the harp lake catchment falls as snow with snow cover from december through april fu yao 2015 streamflow during the spring snowmelt period march may contributes about 50 of the annual runoff hrycik et al 2021 within the catchment meteorology hydrology and water quality have been monitored since the mid 1970s by the inland waters unit environmental monitoring and reporting branch ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks monitoring data used in this study included daily streamflow precipitation and temperature and weekly biweekly ph and so4 from 1978 to 2018 long term averages of weekly biweekly doc concentrations at the selected monitoring sites ranged from 3 02 mg l to 10 71 mg l table 1 with higher doc concentrations albeit smaller control areas generally observed in monitoring sites where cottages and roads were built upstream of the sites i e hp3 and hp6 yao et al 2016 yao et al 2020 human activities e g deicing of roads and driveways may explain the consistently higher average doc concentrations at the hp3 and hp6 sites table 1 the hp3a and hp4 sites were not directly influenced by road deicing however while a road was located upstream of site hp4 it could still be considered less influenced by deicing due to its higher proportion of intact area compared to hp3 and hp6 the data used in this study have undergone strict quality testing and have previously been used to analyze changes in water quantity and quality imtiazy et al 2020 james et al 2022 morison et al 2022 yao et al 2016 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identification of hd events both the fixed and variable drought threshold methods are commonly used to identify hd van loon 2015 wu et al 2022b the fixed drought threshold method fdt is applicable to regions with little fluctuation in hydrological features during a year while the variable drought threshold vdt is used to identify hd where hydrological features exhibit obvious seasonal differences van loon 2015 wu et al 2021a although the streamflow was quite variable within each year in harp lake catchment figure s1 a the fdt method was adopted because the vdt method treats the drought frequencies of all months as equal and can identify droughts during the wet season that have relatively high flows if compared to dry season fixed drought threshold fdt method considers the entire streamflow time series for an entire year or multiple years to determine a single threshold according to requirements furthermore the sensitivity of doc dynamics to different hydrological conditions is different which it difficult to identify common mechanisms underlying the doc dynamics if the vdt is used q80 is calculated as the 80 discharge on the cumulative frequency curve of historical daily streamflow from high to low fig 2 a and has commonly been used to identify hd rangecroft et al 2019 tallaksen et al 2009 tijdeman et al 2018 van loon 2015 wu et al 2021a therefore q80 was chosen for use in the fdt in our study if a day s streamflow is below the q80 threshold i e the day s streamflow minus q80 is negative it is regarded as being in an hd state duration d and severity s are two basic characteristics of hd mishra and singh 2010 d is measured from the onset to the termination time of an hd event and s is the absolute value for the sum of the negative drought index for the entire event similar to tijdeman et al 2018 we created an hd index time series hd t that specifies for each daily time step t if the streamflow variable x t is at or below the q80 threshold tq80 and thus can be used to detect anomalies below the threshold here for simplicity termed as hd eq 1 example in fig 2 b 1 hd t x t t q 80 if the hd t 0 then the day is hd day otherwise it is non hd the hd duration is then computed as the number of days from onset tonset to termination ttermination of hd the s eq 2 is 2 s h d t 1 d h d s x t t q 80 0 since identifying hd events using only daily streamflow would produce many small or short hd samples the noise of drought time series was reduced by applying a sliding average method over 7 consecutive days to smooth the drought time series for obtaining hd events van loon 2015 also the sliding average method over 7 consecutive days was used because the largest doc monitoring time interval was one week besides the ration of s and basin area can be used to increase the comparability among different basins 2 2 2 time based propagation stage of hd there are two basic propagation stages are contained in an hd i e the intensification and recovery stages wu et al 2018 these stages are divided by the peak values of the flow index pv 2 in fig 2 b which is the lowest point of x t tq80 and corresponds to time of t3 the period between the drought onset time t2 and the peak value time t3 is the drought intensification stage the period between time t3 and drought termination time t4 is the drought recovery stage wu et al 2019 we defined the other two stages of hd i e pre hd and rewetting stages for the analysis of doc dynamic patterns to determine the pre drought and rewetting stages two boundary conditions were developed that is the minimum duration and maximum duration for these two stages were set to guarantee the minimum durations of the pre drought and rewetting stages and partly limit their maximum duration the minimum duration was defined as time it takes streamflow processes to respond to daily precipitation processes scaled to those during the pre hd rewetting stage because the precipitation shortages or replenishments may take some time to develop a streamflow deficit or surplus vicente serrano lopez moreno 2005 to confirm the first boundary condition a correlation between the daily streamflow and the corresponding different average moving window average of daily rainfall were examined using the pearson correlation coefficient pcc method and the timescale with the largest correlation coefficient pccmax was regarded as the response time i e rt see fig 2 c the pccmax means that the precipitation fluctuations on a certain moving timescale are consistent with daily streamflow fluctuations the pccmax method has been widely used to determine the response times of streamflow processes to rainfall processes hellwig et al 2020 wu et al 2021b on the response time length basis the time point when the first peak value pv before the hd onset occurred is defined as the second boundary condition thus the pre hd stage is defined as beginning at the time of pv 1 and ending at the time of drought onset i e from the t1 to t2 in fig 2 b the rewetting stage is regarded the time from drought termination to the time of pv 3 i e from t4 to t5 in fig 2 b noted that the duration of pre hd or rewetting stage must be longer than the rt but shorter than the duration from t1 or t4 to t2 or t5 here p1 p2 p3 and p4 were used to represent the pre drought intensification recovery and rewetting stages respectively 2 2 3 dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux during hd because the doc sampling frequency was weekly or biweekly but the durations of the four stages may be shorter than one week not every hd propagation had a corresponding doc vale within that stage therefore the hd events with at least one doc value falling within each of their stages were selected see the red circle in fig 2 b from all identified drought events the doc concentration data for each stage were then extracted so that the average doc concentration for each stage could be calculated using by eq 3 3 σ 1 t i 1 t i t i 1 t i σ where ti and ti 1 are the start and end times for a certain stage of hd and σ is the doc concentration data as sampled during that stage the average doc flux mg s of each stage was determined using the average doc concentration mg l and the average streamflow discharge l s during that stage dynamic patterns of doc concentrations or fluxes during a hd event i e across four hd stages were characterized by comparing the variability in average doc concentration or flux in a stage relative to the previous stage see fig 2 d therefore three stage comparisons were made across the four stages p1 to p2 from p2 to p3 and p3 to p4 the box plot statistical method was used to illustrate the distributions of variables in the original samples while also serving to compare these distribution characteristics among multiple groups of samples for each of the four streams based on identified hd events over 41 years and by applying the above calculations and methods the differences in doc concentrations or fluxes between drought and non drought periods were revealed along with the dynamic variation patterns of doc across the four stages generally exhibiting a declining rising rising trend across the four stages these calculations allowed any differences in the patterns among the four streams to be seen furthermore a correlation analysis was used to relate doc concentrations or flux to their potential driving factors such as streamflow temperature precipitation ph level and so4 level to help understand the major driving mechanisms underlying the patterns and differences 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of hd events there were 23 23 27 and 23 hd events identified at the hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 sites respectively and not all the 41 years had an event the longest hd events occurred in 1997 1998 and persisted 120 days 192 days 192 days and 122 days the d at hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 respectively fig 3 a the hd events mainly occurred in june july august september and october in which the july august and september accounted for 75 of all events fig 3 b as a result there was no value from november to may fig 3 because the fixed drought threshold method was adopted generally these are the dry season months in harp lake catchment during which there are low flows figure s1 the totals of the daily samples in specific months during p1 and p4 stages were less than p2 and p3 stages which reflects the quick responses of streamflow processes to precipitation processes in the study basin that is the quick decrease or increase in daily streamflow during the p1 or p4 stage the pccmax value for the relationship between daily streamflow and different precipitation timescales indicated the rt was was 4 days in p1 and 3 days in p4 for all stream sites figure s2 the p2 stage occurred mainly in july and august and the p3 stage was mainly happened in august and september in harp lake catchment the characteristics for the propagation stages of hd were consistent with the hydrometeorological conditions for example the average of streamflow and precipitation from june to october were lower than other months and the average monthly precipitation in the study basin began to increase in september as did the river flow figure s1 for all hd events table 2 the average of d and s at hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 sites were 50 96 days and 19 16 l s 0 84 l s per ha 81 04 days and 14 39 l s 0 73 l s per ha 53 89 days and 94 01 l s 0 78 l s per ha and 40 91 days and 6 86 l s 0 69 l s per ha respectively the corresponding did and drd at the four sites were 33 82 and 17 14 days 48 18 and 32 86 days 31 59 and 22 30 days and 32 52 and 8 39 days respectively table 2 the average of drd was less than the did which was because hd events developed slowly and resulted from the cumulative influence of a long term precipitation shortage tallaksen et al 2009 van loon 2015 thomas et al 2014 we previously observed that the effective streamflow originating from the precipitation within a certain time period was the main reason for hd propagation patterns wu et al 2021a namely the effective streamflow originating from precipitation or other sources in the p2 stage of hd was less than in the p3 stage thus the average of did was longer than the drd 3 2 influence of hd on doc concentration and flux the average streamflow during hd periods was obviously lower than that in non hd periods lower by 96 51 98 05 93 21 and 97 13 respectively at the four sites fig 4 a the average doc concentrations during hd periods were also less than non hd periods by 18 69 23 97 5 13 and 29 18 respectively fig 4b the average doc flux during the hd events were clearly lower than that non hd periods by 92 92 99 06 93 30 and 93 32 respectively interestingly the percentages difference in streamflow and doc flux were similar among the four stations these results relative to non hd periods showed that droughts substantially influenced i e reduced doc concentrations and fluxes furthermore the scale and intensity of the influence on doc concentrations were different between hp3 and hp3a and between hp6 and hp4 in other words hd had a smaller influence on doc concentration at site hp4 compared to it s at the influence at other three sites however despite the differences in the degree of influence among streams in all cases hd tended to inhibit or reduce the release of doc from uphill catchment areas to the streams 3 3 dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux in hd according to the methods in 2 2 3 section the mean streamflow of stages p1 to p4 exhibited consistent dynamic patterns at all four sites upper part of fig 5 streamflow declined from p1 to p2 slightly increased from p2 to p3 and rapidly increased from p3 to p4 streamflow consistently increased from p2 to p4 relative to the average of streamflow in the previous stage the average streamflows in p2 and p3 were lower than the average streamflow in p1 indicating that the streamflow were very low during hd the average streamflow in p3 and p4 were larger than the average streamflow in p2 implying that the streamflow started to increase and increase rapidly in stages p3 and p4 respectively the streamflow dropped in p2 and slightly increased in p3 which was consistent with the general hd dynamic patterns parry et al 2016 wu et al 2018 for the doc concentrations middle part of fig 5 the dynamic pattern at hp3 and hp6 were similar with the average doc concentrations exhibiting a gradual decrease from p1 to p2 and from p2 to p3 and then a rising from p3 to p4 although faster at hp3 than at hp6 however the patterns of change at the other two sites i e hp3a and hp4 were quite different from the patterns at hp3 and hp6 with the average doc concentrations decreasing quickly from p1 to p2 stage then gradually increasing from p2 to p3 and from p3 to p4 the doc patterns were also quite different from the streamflow patterns for the doc flux lower part of fig 5 the dynamic patterns were coherent or similar among all four sites with the average doc flux declining quickly from p1 to p2 stage slightly increasing from p2 to p3 and increasing quickly from p3 to p4 this flux pattern was consistent with expectations based on the streamflow pattern thus the streamflow had a primary and dominant effect on doc flux at the headwater streams in our study area even overshadowing the different contributions by doc concentrations this phenomenon has also been observed for other chemicals such as base cations yao et al 2016 3 4 correlation between doc concentration and interested variables fig 6 a shows the solely correlations between doc concentrations and variables of interest i e doc flux streamflow precipitation temperature so4 and ph during hd and non hd at site hp4 the drainage area of hp4 was the largest among the four stations and this site was nearest to meteorological station in harp lake catchment and thus the hp4 was selected as the case to further reveal the possible mechanisms forcing the dynamic patterns although the correlations between the variables of interest and doc concentrations were different the correlation between doc concentrations and doc flux was during both hd and non hd periods fig 6 a interestingly the correlation between doc concentrations and doc fluxes during the hd was stronger than that during non hd i e 0 72 vs 0 11 and the correlations with streamflow during hd were positive but negative during non hd periods i e 0 36 vs 0 11 the ratio of the coefficient of variation of streamflow cv streamflow to doc flux cv doc flux i e cv streamflow cv doc flux decreased from 1 02 to 0 80 when comparing the non hd to the hd periods while the ratio of cv doc to cv doc flux increased from 0 18 to 0 41 in other words the importance or contribution of doc concentration to doc flux increased and gradually became a co dominant factor for doc flux when streamflow shifted from non hd to hd in non hd periods there was a negative correlation between doc concentration and streamflow indicating that the doc changed inversely with streamflow furthermore doc concentration had a positive or negative correlation with temperature or so4 in both hd and non hd periods this meant that temperature and so4 are two more factors influencing the doc dynamics in addition to the dominant streamflow factor the correlations between doc and streamflow and between doc and precipitation were opposite both in non hd and hd periods this is because the harp lake catchment is the typical snowmelt driven basin namely streamflow during the spring snowmelt period march may contributes about 50 of the annual runoff hrycik et al 2021 but the rainfall season in the autumn just contributes about 20 of the annual runoff wu et al 2022 commonly larger streamflow with less doc concentration but larger precipitation with more doc concentration during the non hd period due to the dilution of streamflow and the rainfall erosion will cause more geochemical elements from terrestrial to the rivers clark et al 2006 worral burt 2008 thus formulating a positive relation of doc with precipitation but a negative relation of doc with streamflow the correlation between doc concentration and ph was significant in the non hd period but not in the hd period it showed that the ph was not an important factor for doc dynamics during hd events moreover the correlations between doc concentrations and variables of interest differed among different propagation stages fig 6 b doc concentration was positively correlated with doc and streamflow in the p2 p3 and p4 stages but not in the p1 stage the correlation coefficients of doc concentration with doc flux and streamflow in p2 and p3 were larger than in the p4 stage the ratios of the cv streamflow or cv doc to cv doc flux in the p1 p2 p3 and p4 stages were 1 14 0 09 0 74 0 23 0 64 0 19 and 0 86 0 17 respectively thus although the dynamic patterns of doc flux were mainly dominated by streamflow the importance of doc concentration to doc flux during hd cannot be ignored especially during the p2 and p3 stages when it had a higher importance compared to p1 and p4 overall the correlations between doc concentration and other variables of interest across the four stages were complex notably the correlation between doc concentration and precipitation passed the significance test only during stage p4 which will be discussed further in the following section 3 5 driving mechanisms of doc concentration dynamics in hd doc concentrations in hd periods were lower than those of non hd periods fig 4 b with an average difference of 19 24 at the four monitoring sites in harp lake catchment the streamflow was very low during the hd events compared to non hd periods fig 4 a therefore the concentration difference developed because only the subsurface soil layers had hydrological connections to the streams during low flows periods due to the the lower groundwater tables and because the subsurface soil layers contain less organic matters less doc is exported from soils to streams in contrast the organic matter rich topsoil layers were connected to the streams during high flows periods so more doc was exported from the soils to streams barnes et al 2018 for harp lake catchment doc in the headwater streams comprised two components as suggested by schiff et al 1997 i the first being the old doc with low concentrations carried to the stream by discharging groundwater and ii the second being the recently fixed doc leached from the horizon litter layer and transported to streams via shallow flow paths during high flow conditions although the temperature during the low flow period from june to september was high figure s1 the lower rainfall during these months made it difficult for the carbon sources from land to be transported to the streams and thus the doc was mainly from the first component mentioned above the limited organic carbon migration and transformation during hd i e from june to september could suppress doc input to rivers confirming observations in previous studies i e clark et al 2006 fenner freeman 2020 ritson et al 2017 furthermore when the rainfall gradually increased in september the most frequent month for p3 or the drought recovery stage and october the most frequent month for p4 or the rewetting stage the doc concentration gradually increased or rapidly increased correspondingly fig 5 interestingly the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations during the hd at hp3 and hp6 were different from those at hp3a and hp4 they exhibited a fast decrease slow decrease fast rise pattern from p1 to p4 while hp3a and hp6 exhibited a fast decrease slow rise fast rise pattern fig 5 b these patterns were thought to results from two factors the first of which was possible perturbation by human activities there were two households and one road upstream of the hp6 and hp3 monitoring sites so domestic sewage and automobile exhaust emissions or road salt use and road dust control may have interfered with doc export from these sub catchments compared with the other two streams streams hp3 and hp6 have smaller drainage areas but higher doc concentrations which may indicate that the doc dynamics were disturbed by unnatural elements the correlations between doc concentration and doc flux in hp3 0 44 and hp6 0 51 were lower than in hp3a 0 62 and hp4 0 72 figure s3 which also supports the possibility that unnatural activities decreased the correlation between these components the second reason was related to the wetlands very near both hp3a and hp4 monitoring stations see fig 1 and table 1 stage p2 of hd events usually occurred in august and september fig 3 c when rainfall generally started increasing figure s1 b thus doc export from wetlands to streams during these months may be more rapid due to the wetland effect wu yao 2022c yao et al 2020 which resulted in increased doc concentrations in p2 relative to p3 at the hp3a and hp4 sites compared to hp3 and hp6 which were not influenced by wetlands stage p4 most frequently occurred in october fig 3 c when local rainfall events or snowmelt helped the rewet the hydrological system this was followed by the inevitable release of land stored doc thus contributing to the rapidly increase in stream doc concentration in the p4 stage this phenomenon of elevated chemical concentrations during rewetting in the fall after a dry summer has also been reported for southeastern canada kerr et al 2012 and central europe winter et al 2022 generally the fast decline slow decline fast rise trend was the basic pattern for doc flux during hd events this pattern for doc flux was consistent across the four sites and was mainly related to or supported by the same dynamic patterns in streamflow rather than changes in doc concentration which was similar to the recently reported regional and seasonal coherence phenomenon humbert et al 2015 morison et al 2022 in our previous study although the model describing the relationship of doc concentration with hd duration and severity was constructed and interesting results were found e g with the increasing drought d and s doc concentration also increases wu et al 2022 the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux and their possible driving mechanisms were not explained although streamflow was the main factor dominating the dynamic pattern of doc flux in hd fig 6 the importance of doc concentration to doc flux gradually increased and became one of a co dominating factors for the dynamic pattern of doc flux as hd progressed this was because streamflow decreased sharply during the hd while doc concentration did not average percent reduction in doc was 19 24 obviously less than the reduction in streamflow percentage 96 23 fig 4 the changes in the cvstreamflow cv doc and cvstreamflow cv doc flux ratios as mentioned in section 3 4 support this as a typical driver temperature was significantly and positively correlated with doc concentration both in hd and non hd periods fig 6 which was because temperature increases decreases result in more less terrestrial bioactivity the correlation between precipitation and doc concentration was significant and positive only during the non hd period and stage p4 fig 6 because more rainfall during these periods transported terrestrial carbon into the streams previous studies have found that the doc concentrations were relatively low during the drought periods relative to wetting periods likely because doc release was inhibited by the low river flow but flared up again after the droughts clark et al 2005 worral burt 2008 however before this study the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux in the different hd propagation stages had not considered in depth other factors i e ph and so4 also influenced the doc concentration for example there was a significant positive correlation between ph and doc concentration significance level 0 01 during non hd periods but the correlation was not significant during hd and there was a significant negative correlation between so4 and doc concentration both in hd and non hd periods fig 6 a overall the higher the ph value and the lower the so4 the higher the doc concentration during non hd and lower the doc concentration during hd thus ph and so4 changes across the hd stages might have contributed positively or negatively to doc concentrations in fact droughts caused the release of so4 through the oxidation of the inorganic organic sulphur stored in the peat of terrestrial soils which was accompanied by a decrease in ph and increase in ionic strength there are important factors as both ph and ionic strength are known to control the solubility of doc indeed the inclusion of a function for doc suppression by drought induced acidification accounted for a significant amount of the variability of doc in streams clark et al 2005 besides the differences in the correlations between doc concentration and variables of interest during the hd propagation stages were related to the months in which they occurred and the different hydrometeorological conditions but these mechanisms were very complex for example temperature influenced so4 and ph and thus influenced the variation of doc concentration in a river clark et al 2006 while the average temperatures of different months or seasons throughout the year have been linked to changes in biological activity morison et al 2022 kimball et al 2006 found that the seasonal variation in cold northern regions was characterized by sharp transitions between high rates of biological activity during the growing season and low rates or even dormancy during the freezing period thus if we want to precisely reveal the mechanisms underlying the variation of doc concentration and flux during drought combinations of hydro meteorological and bio chemical factors must be considered in the context of specific times of the year these subjects are not sufficiently addressed in this study and need more attention 3 6 limitations and implication of this study this study had a number of limitations first although long term daily streamflow and weekly biweekly doc measurements were adopted there were still just 23 23 27 and 23 hd events identified at hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 respectively these numbers may be low and my indicate that there was a partial loss of available statistical information there were 438 2064 554 2073 638 2194 and 445 2073 doc samples identified as being during hd non hd thus although the number of samples and their distribution as determined by the doc sample numbers can be almost ignored because the long term measurements were used here although the daily scale streamflow and precipitation were used to determine the rt different timescales e g second minute hour month or annual of streamflow response to precipitation may be different the response of doc export to rainfall is very quickly grabs et al 2012 lidman et al 2017 but response to different timescales of rainfall may also be different and needs to further research second our understanding of the interactions among mechanisms underlying changes in doc concentration changes and terrestrial ecosystems during periods of different drought intensity e g different drought return period remains incomplete the rainfall intensity during the rewetting stage appeared to influence the doc output or release thereby interfering with doc dynamics however quantifying the degrees to which drought and rainfall intensity influence the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux requires further research third for the studied harp lake catchment differences in vegetation soil type wetland and geology all may have affected doc concentrations however the changes trend in doc concentrations due to changes in hydrometeorological and hydrochemical variables were the primary focus of this research evidence from previous studies has suggested that fluctuations in climate system is responsible for a larger proportion of variability in the export of doc from terrestrial peatlands than long term changes in temperature alone whereas chemical changes induced by extreme hydroclimatic conditions can control doc mobility and variability clark et al 2005 it is very difficult to distinguish between the separate contributions of specific elements to changes in doc also groundwater changes at different depths can also affect the doc export during the dry season jutglar et al 2021 the differences in the soil vegetation surface water groundwater atmosphere system or their feedback effect during the drought can also affect the dynamics of doc concentration and flux which was not well addressed in this study and will further studied in our future work in this study we first characterized the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux in different propagation stages of hd based on long term 41 years measurements of headwater streams second the possible driving mechanisms for the dynamic patterns were revealed and discussed these results will help us better understand doc concentration and flux dynamics and their relationships with terrestrial ecosystems during droughts furthermore capturing more information about the dynamics of doc concentrations and fluxes during hd can help us further improve the predictive and tracking power for catchment and ecological models more importantly the deterioration of water quality caused by extreme hydrological events presents serious water and ecological security issues worldwide bradford et al 2020 warner saros 2019 tiwari et al 2018 this study has provided additional information that policy makers can use to establish reasonable measures to ensure water and ecological security during the droughts 4 conclusions this study aimed to reveal the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux during different propagation stages of hd using a long term dataset of weekly biweekly doc and daily streamflow as well as other meteorological and water chemistry records from four environmental monitoring sites in the harp lake catchment south central ontario canada the main conclusions of this study are i doc flux exhibited coherent dynamic patterns during hd propagation across monitoring sites that is a fast decline slow rise fast rise trend during the drought intensification recovery and rewetting stages relative to the pre drought stage any inconsistencies in dynamic pattern of doc concentrations among four streams were partly due to the perturbation by unnatural anthropogenic activities ii the streamflow pattern during different propagation stages of hd was similar among streams and was very similar to the dynamic pattern of doc flux the dynamic pattern of doc flux during the hd was primarily dominated by streamflow and doc concentration was next most important factor the importance of doc concentration to doc flux increased during hd and gradually became a co dominating factor for the dynamic pattern of doc flux other factors i e ph and so4 changes across the hd stages might have contributed positively or negatively to doc concentrations this study provided an updated perspective to help understand the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux and their driving mechanisms during hd that can be used to improve modeling and management capability for water quantity and

2367,droughts influence dissolved organic carbon doc export doc concentration and flux dynamics during different propagation stages of hydrological drought hd are complex and poorly understood long term from 1978 to 2018 weekly biweekly doc concentration and daily streamflow at four headwater streams of harp lake catchment ontario canada were used to examine the effects of hd on the dynamics identified hd were divided into four propagation stages pre drought p1 intensification p2 recovery p3 and post drought p4 the potential mechanisms underlying the patterns in doc were also investigated first hd reduced doc concentration by an average of 19 24 relative to non hd periods doc concentrations and fluxes of streams were different during different propagation stages second doc flux patterns among streams were consistent with fast decline slow rise fast rise trends over the p2 p3 and p4 relative to each previous stage however doc concentration pattern differed among four streams showing a fast decline slow decline fast rise trend across four stages in two streams but a fast decline slow rise fast rise pattern at other two initially doc flux during hd was primarily dominated by streamflow but doc concentration eventually became an important co factor third the rapid decrease or increases in streamflow during p2 p4 relative to p1 p3 led to a fast decline or rise in doc concentration differences in doc concentration responses among streams were probably due to differences in local hydrologic features e g wetlands and unnatural activities ph and so4 can also influence doc concentration dynamics during hd but just under the specific hydrothermal combinations this study provides an updated perspective to understand the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux

carbon doc have recently become broadly concerning castello macedo 2016 ren et al 2016 warner saros 2019 tiwari et al 2018 because they influence organic matter decomposition and doc export from soil to rivers bauer et al 2013 clark et al 2005 evans et al 2006 changes in doc concentrations can lead to significant changes in aquatic ecosystems and global regional carbon cycles morison et al 2022 fenner et al 2007 extreme hydrologic events such as hydrological drought hd has been occurring more frequently in the past few decades under global warming chawla et al 2020 hao et al 2018 sutanto et al 2020 williams et al 2020 hd is a continuation and evolution of meteorological drought precipitation deficit hao singh 2015 mishra singh 2010 zhang et al 2022 hd is usually characterized by a shortage of river flow or surface runoff and is regarded as the most severe type of drought linsley et al 1982 closely related to water flows the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux i e streamflow doc concentration during hd can reflect the states of terrestrial ecosystems during extreme hydrologic events bastos et al 2020 clark et al 2006 stocker et al 2019 pumpanen et al 2014 however much remains unknown about the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations and fluxes and their driving mechanisms during hd doc concentrations have increased over the past decades in rivers throughout the world clark et al 2006 worrall burt 2008 these increases in doc concentrations have been linked to increases in temperatures decreases in ionic strength or acidity of soil solutions and stream waters resulting from changes in atmospheric deposition changes in ph and sulfate and increases in atmospheric co2 as well as increases in droughts fenner freeman 2020 ritson et al 2017 several explanations have been proposed to explain the dynamics of doc concentrations during droughts for example i decreased runoff during droughts resulted in lower doc export from catchments worrall burt 2008 ii physicochemical changes in the peat structure prevented rewetting and led to delayed inhibited doc release from the soils revchuk suffet 2014 iii increased consumption of doc as a substrate by soil microbes caused increased co2 efflux blagodatskaya et al 2011 iv limited microbial activities were limited under dry acidic conditions resulting in reduced decomposition and production of doc romani et al 2006 scott et al 1998 and v so4 induced acidification reduced doc concentrations during droughts clark et al 2006 studies such as that by ahmadi et al 2019 have analyzed the evolution of water quantity i e streamflow and water quality i e turbidity and dissolved oxygen during hd and estimated that it would take an average of two or more months for water quality variables to fully recover following an hd event the doc concentrations become relatively low during dry seasons compared to wet seasons because the release of doc is inhibited by low river flow but doc release will flare up again once sufficient flow returns worrall burt 2008 a recent study from blaurock et al 2021 also found that low hydrological connectivity during drought inhibited doc mobilization alnahit et al 2020 suggested that not only anthropogenic variables influence the mean water quality constituents but other watershed characteristics such as soil properties have a significant impact besides we found that doc during hd had a close and positive linear relationship with hd characteristics that is with the increased drought duration and severity doc concentration also increased wu et al 2022a although general reasons for the changes in the dynamics of doc due to drought have been provided in previous studies hd have multiple propagation stages and the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux during the evolution of hd have not been well studied from the temporal perspective the propagation of hd can be divided into four stages pre hd p1 intensification p2 recovery p3 and rewetting post hd p4 wu et al 2018 the p1 period represents streamflow state before the occurrence of hd and is used as a baseline to characterize the response times of hydrological systems to a certain meteorological or hydro chemical processes hellwig et al 2020 vicente serrano lopez moreno 2005 wu et al 2021b p2 and p3 are the main periods of hd representing drought formation and the subsequent gradual disappearance recovery parry et al 2016 wu et al 2018 p4 is a specified period after the hd has recovered to a wetted condition i e the streamflow has been recovered to normal because water has been sufficiently supplied by the cumulative rainfall snowmelt or other water sources wu et al 2020 the different propagation stages periods of hd have different hydrological features parry et al 2016 and thus different biochemical activities blaurock et al 2021 a comprehensive understandings of doc dynamics during these periods of hd and their driving mechanisms are of great importance for revealing the response of doc changes to extreme hydrological events under changing environments here to reveal the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations and fluxes during hd events we used a 41 year 1978 2018 dataset of weekly biweekly doc concentration measurements at four monitoring sites in harp lake catchment ontario canada alongside long term daily hydrometeorological records i e streamflow precipitation and temperature and water quality e g so4 and ph records we also investigated the potential driving mechanisms underlying the dynamic doc patterns this study will improve the water quality modeling and management capabilities related to doc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data the harp lake catchment 542 ha located in south central ontario canada fig 1 was selected to demonstrate our study because there are four monitored streams hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 with long term data records from 1978 to 2018 but different drainage sizes the size from 9 97 to 119 09 ha in harp lake catchment the area was dominated by mixed deciduous and coniferous forests 75 of total area lake wetlands and ponds also occupied a substantial portion of the harp lake catchment fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the coverage by wetlands or ponds in hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 catchments was 8 6 0 7 9 7 and 4 5 respectively lane et al 2020 richardson 2011 the straight line distances for the nearest wetland to the monitoring sites were about 382 m 144 m 156 m and 345 m in the hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 catchments respectively table 1 mean annual temperatures ranged from 9 38 c to 12 79 c during the study period with an average of 11 03 c the means in january and july were 4 93 c and 25 66 c respectively zhang et al 2020 due to the cold climate around one third of precipitation in the harp lake catchment falls as snow with snow cover from december through april fu yao 2015 streamflow during the spring snowmelt period march may contributes about 50 of the annual runoff hrycik et al 2021 within the catchment meteorology hydrology and water quality have been monitored since the mid 1970s by the inland waters unit environmental monitoring and reporting branch ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks monitoring data used in this study included daily streamflow precipitation and temperature and weekly biweekly ph and so4 from 1978 to 2018 long term averages of weekly biweekly doc concentrations at the selected monitoring sites ranged from 3 02 mg l to 10 71 mg l table 1 with higher doc concentrations albeit smaller control areas generally observed in monitoring sites where cottages and roads were built upstream of the sites i e hp3 and hp6 yao et al 2016 yao et al 2020 human activities e g deicing of roads and driveways may explain the consistently higher average doc concentrations at the hp3 and hp6 sites table 1 the hp3a and hp4 sites were not directly influenced by road deicing however while a road was located upstream of site hp4 it could still be considered less influenced by deicing due to its higher proportion of intact area compared to hp3 and hp6 the data used in this study have undergone strict quality testing and have previously been used to analyze changes in water quantity and quality imtiazy et al 2020 james et al 2022 morison et al 2022 yao et al 2016 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identification of hd events both the fixed and variable drought threshold methods are commonly used to identify hd van loon 2015 wu et al 2022b the fixed drought threshold method fdt is applicable to regions with little fluctuation in hydrological features during a year while the variable drought threshold vdt is used to identify hd where hydrological features exhibit obvious seasonal differences van loon 2015 wu et al 2021a although the streamflow was quite variable within each year in harp lake catchment figure s1 a the fdt method was adopted because the vdt method treats the drought frequencies of all months as equal and can identify droughts during the wet season that have relatively high flows if compared to dry season fixed drought threshold fdt method considers the entire streamflow time series for an entire year or multiple years to determine a single threshold according to requirements furthermore the sensitivity of doc dynamics to different hydrological conditions is different which it difficult to identify common mechanisms underlying the doc dynamics if the vdt is used q80 is calculated as the 80 discharge on the cumulative frequency curve of historical daily streamflow from high to low fig 2 a and has commonly been used to identify hd rangecroft et al 2019 tallaksen et al 2009 tijdeman et al 2018 van loon 2015 wu et al 2021a therefore q80 was chosen for use in the fdt in our study if a day s streamflow is below the q80 threshold i e the day s streamflow minus q80 is negative it is regarded as being in an hd state duration d and severity s are two basic characteristics of hd mishra and singh 2010 d is measured from the onset to the termination time of an hd event and s is the absolute value for the sum of the negative drought index for the entire event similar to tijdeman et al 2018 we created an hd index time series hd t that specifies for each daily time step t if the streamflow variable x t is at or below the q80 threshold tq80 and thus can be used to detect anomalies below the threshold here for simplicity termed as hd eq 1 example in fig 2 b 1 hd t x t t q 80 if the hd t 0 then the day is hd day otherwise it is non hd the hd duration is then computed as the number of days from onset tonset to termination ttermination of hd the s eq 2 is 2 s h d t 1 d h d s x t t q 80 0 since identifying hd events using only daily streamflow would produce many small or short hd samples the noise of drought time series was reduced by applying a sliding average method over 7 consecutive days to smooth the drought time series for obtaining hd events van loon 2015 also the sliding average method over 7 consecutive days was used because the largest doc monitoring time interval was one week besides the ration of s and basin area can be used to increase the comparability among different basins 2 2 2 time based propagation stage of hd there are two basic propagation stages are contained in an hd i e the intensification and recovery stages wu et al 2018 these stages are divided by the peak values of the flow index pv 2 in fig 2 b which is the lowest point of x t tq80 and corresponds to time of t3 the period between the drought onset time t2 and the peak value time t3 is the drought intensification stage the period between time t3 and drought termination time t4 is the drought recovery stage wu et al 2019 we defined the other two stages of hd i e pre hd and rewetting stages for the analysis of doc dynamic patterns to determine the pre drought and rewetting stages two boundary conditions were developed that is the minimum duration and maximum duration for these two stages were set to guarantee the minimum durations of the pre drought and rewetting stages and partly limit their maximum duration the minimum duration was defined as time it takes streamflow processes to respond to daily precipitation processes scaled to those during the pre hd rewetting stage because the precipitation shortages or replenishments may take some time to develop a streamflow deficit or surplus vicente serrano lopez moreno 2005 to confirm the first boundary condition a correlation between the daily streamflow and the corresponding different average moving window average of daily rainfall were examined using the pearson correlation coefficient pcc method and the timescale with the largest correlation coefficient pccmax was regarded as the response time i e rt see fig 2 c the pccmax means that the precipitation fluctuations on a certain moving timescale are consistent with daily streamflow fluctuations the pccmax method has been widely used to determine the response times of streamflow processes to rainfall processes hellwig et al 2020 wu et al 2021b on the response time length basis the time point when the first peak value pv before the hd onset occurred is defined as the second boundary condition thus the pre hd stage is defined as beginning at the time of pv 1 and ending at the time of drought onset i e from the t1 to t2 in fig 2 b the rewetting stage is regarded the time from drought termination to the time of pv 3 i e from t4 to t5 in fig 2 b noted that the duration of pre hd or rewetting stage must be longer than the rt but shorter than the duration from t1 or t4 to t2 or t5 here p1 p2 p3 and p4 were used to represent the pre drought intensification recovery and rewetting stages respectively 2 2 3 dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux during hd because the doc sampling frequency was weekly or biweekly but the durations of the four stages may be shorter than one week not every hd propagation had a corresponding doc vale within that stage therefore the hd events with at least one doc value falling within each of their stages were selected see the red circle in fig 2 b from all identified drought events the doc concentration data for each stage were then extracted so that the average doc concentration for each stage could be calculated using by eq 3 3 σ 1 t i 1 t i t i 1 t i σ where ti and ti 1 are the start and end times for a certain stage of hd and σ is the doc concentration data as sampled during that stage the average doc flux mg s of each stage was determined using the average doc concentration mg l and the average streamflow discharge l s during that stage dynamic patterns of doc concentrations or fluxes during a hd event i e across four hd stages were characterized by comparing the variability in average doc concentration or flux in a stage relative to the previous stage see fig 2 d therefore three stage comparisons were made across the four stages p1 to p2 from p2 to p3 and p3 to p4 the box plot statistical method was used to illustrate the distributions of variables in the original samples while also serving to compare these distribution characteristics among multiple groups of samples for each of the four streams based on identified hd events over 41 years and by applying the above calculations and methods the differences in doc concentrations or fluxes between drought and non drought periods were revealed along with the dynamic variation patterns of doc across the four stages generally exhibiting a declining rising rising trend across the four stages these calculations allowed any differences in the patterns among the four streams to be seen furthermore a correlation analysis was used to relate doc concentrations or flux to their potential driving factors such as streamflow temperature precipitation ph level and so4 level to help understand the major driving mechanisms underlying the patterns and differences 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of hd events there were 23 23 27 and 23 hd events identified at the hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 sites respectively and not all the 41 years had an event the longest hd events occurred in 1997 1998 and persisted 120 days 192 days 192 days and 122 days the d at hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 respectively fig 3 a the hd events mainly occurred in june july august september and october in which the july august and september accounted for 75 of all events fig 3 b as a result there was no value from november to may fig 3 because the fixed drought threshold method was adopted generally these are the dry season months in harp lake catchment during which there are low flows figure s1 the totals of the daily samples in specific months during p1 and p4 stages were less than p2 and p3 stages which reflects the quick responses of streamflow processes to precipitation processes in the study basin that is the quick decrease or increase in daily streamflow during the p1 or p4 stage the pccmax value for the relationship between daily streamflow and different precipitation timescales indicated the rt was was 4 days in p1 and 3 days in p4 for all stream sites figure s2 the p2 stage occurred mainly in july and august and the p3 stage was mainly happened in august and september in harp lake catchment the characteristics for the propagation stages of hd were consistent with the hydrometeorological conditions for example the average of streamflow and precipitation from june to october were lower than other months and the average monthly precipitation in the study basin began to increase in september as did the river flow figure s1 for all hd events table 2 the average of d and s at hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 sites were 50 96 days and 19 16 l s 0 84 l s per ha 81 04 days and 14 39 l s 0 73 l s per ha 53 89 days and 94 01 l s 0 78 l s per ha and 40 91 days and 6 86 l s 0 69 l s per ha respectively the corresponding did and drd at the four sites were 33 82 and 17 14 days 48 18 and 32 86 days 31 59 and 22 30 days and 32 52 and 8 39 days respectively table 2 the average of drd was less than the did which was because hd events developed slowly and resulted from the cumulative influence of a long term precipitation shortage tallaksen et al 2009 van loon 2015 thomas et al 2014 we previously observed that the effective streamflow originating from the precipitation within a certain time period was the main reason for hd propagation patterns wu et al 2021a namely the effective streamflow originating from precipitation or other sources in the p2 stage of hd was less than in the p3 stage thus the average of did was longer than the drd 3 2 influence of hd on doc concentration and flux the average streamflow during hd periods was obviously lower than that in non hd periods lower by 96 51 98 05 93 21 and 97 13 respectively at the four sites fig 4 a the average doc concentrations during hd periods were also less than non hd periods by 18 69 23 97 5 13 and 29 18 respectively fig 4b the average doc flux during the hd events were clearly lower than that non hd periods by 92 92 99 06 93 30 and 93 32 respectively interestingly the percentages difference in streamflow and doc flux were similar among the four stations these results relative to non hd periods showed that droughts substantially influenced i e reduced doc concentrations and fluxes furthermore the scale and intensity of the influence on doc concentrations were different between hp3 and hp3a and between hp6 and hp4 in other words hd had a smaller influence on doc concentration at site hp4 compared to it s at the influence at other three sites however despite the differences in the degree of influence among streams in all cases hd tended to inhibit or reduce the release of doc from uphill catchment areas to the streams 3 3 dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux in hd according to the methods in 2 2 3 section the mean streamflow of stages p1 to p4 exhibited consistent dynamic patterns at all four sites upper part of fig 5 streamflow declined from p1 to p2 slightly increased from p2 to p3 and rapidly increased from p3 to p4 streamflow consistently increased from p2 to p4 relative to the average of streamflow in the previous stage the average streamflows in p2 and p3 were lower than the average streamflow in p1 indicating that the streamflow were very low during hd the average streamflow in p3 and p4 were larger than the average streamflow in p2 implying that the streamflow started to increase and increase rapidly in stages p3 and p4 respectively the streamflow dropped in p2 and slightly increased in p3 which was consistent with the general hd dynamic patterns parry et al 2016 wu et al 2018 for the doc concentrations middle part of fig 5 the dynamic pattern at hp3 and hp6 were similar with the average doc concentrations exhibiting a gradual decrease from p1 to p2 and from p2 to p3 and then a rising from p3 to p4 although faster at hp3 than at hp6 however the patterns of change at the other two sites i e hp3a and hp4 were quite different from the patterns at hp3 and hp6 with the average doc concentrations decreasing quickly from p1 to p2 stage then gradually increasing from p2 to p3 and from p3 to p4 the doc patterns were also quite different from the streamflow patterns for the doc flux lower part of fig 5 the dynamic patterns were coherent or similar among all four sites with the average doc flux declining quickly from p1 to p2 stage slightly increasing from p2 to p3 and increasing quickly from p3 to p4 this flux pattern was consistent with expectations based on the streamflow pattern thus the streamflow had a primary and dominant effect on doc flux at the headwater streams in our study area even overshadowing the different contributions by doc concentrations this phenomenon has also been observed for other chemicals such as base cations yao et al 2016 3 4 correlation between doc concentration and interested variables fig 6 a shows the solely correlations between doc concentrations and variables of interest i e doc flux streamflow precipitation temperature so4 and ph during hd and non hd at site hp4 the drainage area of hp4 was the largest among the four stations and this site was nearest to meteorological station in harp lake catchment and thus the hp4 was selected as the case to further reveal the possible mechanisms forcing the dynamic patterns although the correlations between the variables of interest and doc concentrations were different the correlation between doc concentrations and doc flux was during both hd and non hd periods fig 6 a interestingly the correlation between doc concentrations and doc fluxes during the hd was stronger than that during non hd i e 0 72 vs 0 11 and the correlations with streamflow during hd were positive but negative during non hd periods i e 0 36 vs 0 11 the ratio of the coefficient of variation of streamflow cv streamflow to doc flux cv doc flux i e cv streamflow cv doc flux decreased from 1 02 to 0 80 when comparing the non hd to the hd periods while the ratio of cv doc to cv doc flux increased from 0 18 to 0 41 in other words the importance or contribution of doc concentration to doc flux increased and gradually became a co dominant factor for doc flux when streamflow shifted from non hd to hd in non hd periods there was a negative correlation between doc concentration and streamflow indicating that the doc changed inversely with streamflow furthermore doc concentration had a positive or negative correlation with temperature or so4 in both hd and non hd periods this meant that temperature and so4 are two more factors influencing the doc dynamics in addition to the dominant streamflow factor the correlations between doc and streamflow and between doc and precipitation were opposite both in non hd and hd periods this is because the harp lake catchment is the typical snowmelt driven basin namely streamflow during the spring snowmelt period march may contributes about 50 of the annual runoff hrycik et al 2021 but the rainfall season in the autumn just contributes about 20 of the annual runoff wu et al 2022 commonly larger streamflow with less doc concentration but larger precipitation with more doc concentration during the non hd period due to the dilution of streamflow and the rainfall erosion will cause more geochemical elements from terrestrial to the rivers clark et al 2006 worral burt 2008 thus formulating a positive relation of doc with precipitation but a negative relation of doc with streamflow the correlation between doc concentration and ph was significant in the non hd period but not in the hd period it showed that the ph was not an important factor for doc dynamics during hd events moreover the correlations between doc concentrations and variables of interest differed among different propagation stages fig 6 b doc concentration was positively correlated with doc and streamflow in the p2 p3 and p4 stages but not in the p1 stage the correlation coefficients of doc concentration with doc flux and streamflow in p2 and p3 were larger than in the p4 stage the ratios of the cv streamflow or cv doc to cv doc flux in the p1 p2 p3 and p4 stages were 1 14 0 09 0 74 0 23 0 64 0 19 and 0 86 0 17 respectively thus although the dynamic patterns of doc flux were mainly dominated by streamflow the importance of doc concentration to doc flux during hd cannot be ignored especially during the p2 and p3 stages when it had a higher importance compared to p1 and p4 overall the correlations between doc concentration and other variables of interest across the four stages were complex notably the correlation between doc concentration and precipitation passed the significance test only during stage p4 which will be discussed further in the following section 3 5 driving mechanisms of doc concentration dynamics in hd doc concentrations in hd periods were lower than those of non hd periods fig 4 b with an average difference of 19 24 at the four monitoring sites in harp lake catchment the streamflow was very low during the hd events compared to non hd periods fig 4 a therefore the concentration difference developed because only the subsurface soil layers had hydrological connections to the streams during low flows periods due to the the lower groundwater tables and because the subsurface soil layers contain less organic matters less doc is exported from soils to streams in contrast the organic matter rich topsoil layers were connected to the streams during high flows periods so more doc was exported from the soils to streams barnes et al 2018 for harp lake catchment doc in the headwater streams comprised two components as suggested by schiff et al 1997 i the first being the old doc with low concentrations carried to the stream by discharging groundwater and ii the second being the recently fixed doc leached from the horizon litter layer and transported to streams via shallow flow paths during high flow conditions although the temperature during the low flow period from june to september was high figure s1 the lower rainfall during these months made it difficult for the carbon sources from land to be transported to the streams and thus the doc was mainly from the first component mentioned above the limited organic carbon migration and transformation during hd i e from june to september could suppress doc input to rivers confirming observations in previous studies i e clark et al 2006 fenner freeman 2020 ritson et al 2017 furthermore when the rainfall gradually increased in september the most frequent month for p3 or the drought recovery stage and october the most frequent month for p4 or the rewetting stage the doc concentration gradually increased or rapidly increased correspondingly fig 5 interestingly the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations during the hd at hp3 and hp6 were different from those at hp3a and hp4 they exhibited a fast decrease slow decrease fast rise pattern from p1 to p4 while hp3a and hp6 exhibited a fast decrease slow rise fast rise pattern fig 5 b these patterns were thought to results from two factors the first of which was possible perturbation by human activities there were two households and one road upstream of the hp6 and hp3 monitoring sites so domestic sewage and automobile exhaust emissions or road salt use and road dust control may have interfered with doc export from these sub catchments compared with the other two streams streams hp3 and hp6 have smaller drainage areas but higher doc concentrations which may indicate that the doc dynamics were disturbed by unnatural elements the correlations between doc concentration and doc flux in hp3 0 44 and hp6 0 51 were lower than in hp3a 0 62 and hp4 0 72 figure s3 which also supports the possibility that unnatural activities decreased the correlation between these components the second reason was related to the wetlands very near both hp3a and hp4 monitoring stations see fig 1 and table 1 stage p2 of hd events usually occurred in august and september fig 3 c when rainfall generally started increasing figure s1 b thus doc export from wetlands to streams during these months may be more rapid due to the wetland effect wu yao 2022c yao et al 2020 which resulted in increased doc concentrations in p2 relative to p3 at the hp3a and hp4 sites compared to hp3 and hp6 which were not influenced by wetlands stage p4 most frequently occurred in october fig 3 c when local rainfall events or snowmelt helped the rewet the hydrological system this was followed by the inevitable release of land stored doc thus contributing to the rapidly increase in stream doc concentration in the p4 stage this phenomenon of elevated chemical concentrations during rewetting in the fall after a dry summer has also been reported for southeastern canada kerr et al 2012 and central europe winter et al 2022 generally the fast decline slow decline fast rise trend was the basic pattern for doc flux during hd events this pattern for doc flux was consistent across the four sites and was mainly related to or supported by the same dynamic patterns in streamflow rather than changes in doc concentration which was similar to the recently reported regional and seasonal coherence phenomenon humbert et al 2015 morison et al 2022 in our previous study although the model describing the relationship of doc concentration with hd duration and severity was constructed and interesting results were found e g with the increasing drought d and s doc concentration also increases wu et al 2022 the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux and their possible driving mechanisms were not explained although streamflow was the main factor dominating the dynamic pattern of doc flux in hd fig 6 the importance of doc concentration to doc flux gradually increased and became one of a co dominating factors for the dynamic pattern of doc flux as hd progressed this was because streamflow decreased sharply during the hd while doc concentration did not average percent reduction in doc was 19 24 obviously less than the reduction in streamflow percentage 96 23 fig 4 the changes in the cvstreamflow cv doc and cvstreamflow cv doc flux ratios as mentioned in section 3 4 support this as a typical driver temperature was significantly and positively correlated with doc concentration both in hd and non hd periods fig 6 which was because temperature increases decreases result in more less terrestrial bioactivity the correlation between precipitation and doc concentration was significant and positive only during the non hd period and stage p4 fig 6 because more rainfall during these periods transported terrestrial carbon into the streams previous studies have found that the doc concentrations were relatively low during the drought periods relative to wetting periods likely because doc release was inhibited by the low river flow but flared up again after the droughts clark et al 2005 worral burt 2008 however before this study the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux in the different hd propagation stages had not considered in depth other factors i e ph and so4 also influenced the doc concentration for example there was a significant positive correlation between ph and doc concentration significance level 0 01 during non hd periods but the correlation was not significant during hd and there was a significant negative correlation between so4 and doc concentration both in hd and non hd periods fig 6 a overall the higher the ph value and the lower the so4 the higher the doc concentration during non hd and lower the doc concentration during hd thus ph and so4 changes across the hd stages might have contributed positively or negatively to doc concentrations in fact droughts caused the release of so4 through the oxidation of the inorganic organic sulphur stored in the peat of terrestrial soils which was accompanied by a decrease in ph and increase in ionic strength there are important factors as both ph and ionic strength are known to control the solubility of doc indeed the inclusion of a function for doc suppression by drought induced acidification accounted for a significant amount of the variability of doc in streams clark et al 2005 besides the differences in the correlations between doc concentration and variables of interest during the hd propagation stages were related to the months in which they occurred and the different hydrometeorological conditions but these mechanisms were very complex for example temperature influenced so4 and ph and thus influenced the variation of doc concentration in a river clark et al 2006 while the average temperatures of different months or seasons throughout the year have been linked to changes in biological activity morison et al 2022 kimball et al 2006 found that the seasonal variation in cold northern regions was characterized by sharp transitions between high rates of biological activity during the growing season and low rates or even dormancy during the freezing period thus if we want to precisely reveal the mechanisms underlying the variation of doc concentration and flux during drought combinations of hydro meteorological and bio chemical factors must be considered in the context of specific times of the year these subjects are not sufficiently addressed in this study and need more attention 3 6 limitations and implication of this study this study had a number of limitations first although long term daily streamflow and weekly biweekly doc measurements were adopted there were still just 23 23 27 and 23 hd events identified at hp3 hp3a hp4 and hp6 respectively these numbers may be low and my indicate that there was a partial loss of available statistical information there were 438 2064 554 2073 638 2194 and 445 2073 doc samples identified as being during hd non hd thus although the number of samples and their distribution as determined by the doc sample numbers can be almost ignored because the long term measurements were used here although the daily scale streamflow and precipitation were used to determine the rt different timescales e g second minute hour month or annual of streamflow response to precipitation may be different the response of doc export to rainfall is very quickly grabs et al 2012 lidman et al 2017 but response to different timescales of rainfall may also be different and needs to further research second our understanding of the interactions among mechanisms underlying changes in doc concentration changes and terrestrial ecosystems during periods of different drought intensity e g different drought return period remains incomplete the rainfall intensity during the rewetting stage appeared to influence the doc output or release thereby interfering with doc dynamics however quantifying the degrees to which drought and rainfall intensity influence the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux requires further research third for the studied harp lake catchment differences in vegetation soil type wetland and geology all may have affected doc concentrations however the changes trend in doc concentrations due to changes in hydrometeorological and hydrochemical variables were the primary focus of this research evidence from previous studies has suggested that fluctuations in climate system is responsible for a larger proportion of variability in the export of doc from terrestrial peatlands than long term changes in temperature alone whereas chemical changes induced by extreme hydroclimatic conditions can control doc mobility and variability clark et al 2005 it is very difficult to distinguish between the separate contributions of specific elements to changes in doc also groundwater changes at different depths can also affect the doc export during the dry season jutglar et al 2021 the differences in the soil vegetation surface water groundwater atmosphere system or their feedback effect during the drought can also affect the dynamics of doc concentration and flux which was not well addressed in this study and will further studied in our future work in this study we first characterized the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux in different propagation stages of hd based on long term 41 years measurements of headwater streams second the possible driving mechanisms for the dynamic patterns were revealed and discussed these results will help us better understand doc concentration and flux dynamics and their relationships with terrestrial ecosystems during droughts furthermore capturing more information about the dynamics of doc concentrations and fluxes during hd can help us further improve the predictive and tracking power for catchment and ecological models more importantly the deterioration of water quality caused by extreme hydrological events presents serious water and ecological security issues worldwide bradford et al 2020 warner saros 2019 tiwari et al 2018 this study has provided additional information that policy makers can use to establish reasonable measures to ensure water and ecological security during the droughts 4 conclusions this study aimed to reveal the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux during different propagation stages of hd using a long term dataset of weekly biweekly doc and daily streamflow as well as other meteorological and water chemistry records from four environmental monitoring sites in the harp lake catchment south central ontario canada the main conclusions of this study are i doc flux exhibited coherent dynamic patterns during hd propagation across monitoring sites that is a fast decline slow rise fast rise trend during the drought intensification recovery and rewetting stages relative to the pre drought stage any inconsistencies in dynamic pattern of doc concentrations among four streams were partly due to the perturbation by unnatural anthropogenic activities ii the streamflow pattern during different propagation stages of hd was similar among streams and was very similar to the dynamic pattern of doc flux the dynamic pattern of doc flux during the hd was primarily dominated by streamflow and doc concentration was next most important factor the importance of doc concentration to doc flux increased during hd and gradually became a co dominating factor for the dynamic pattern of doc flux other factors i e ph and so4 changes across the hd stages might have contributed positively or negatively to doc concentrations this study provided an updated perspective to help understand the dynamic patterns of doc concentration and flux and their driving mechanisms during hd that can be used to improve modeling and management capability for water quantity and

2368,hydrologic connectivity along the hillslope critical zone is essential for the transmission of water solutes and nutrients to streams however the influences of critical zone structure on hydrological connectivity are not adequately understood especially for hillslopes with complex topography we investigated the hydrological connectivity along different topographical positions of two adjacent dolomite hillslope plots in southwest china a deep soil plot average value 66 cm and shallow soil plot average value 35 cm we characterized the dynamics of multiple interface runoff and soil water based on observations of stable isotopes δ18o and δd and hydrometric monitoring and computed the lc excess young water fraction yw and hydrograph separation from june 2020 to july 2021 on both hillslopes soil depth gradually increased from up slope to down slope and the contribution of event water and yw to soil water gradually decreased 100 to 69 in the vertical depth a sudden decrease in the contribution of yw 98 to 47 and event water 44 to 11 in the down slope of the soil epikarst interface was observed these results indicate that the infiltration of rainwater from up slope to down slope was altered by vertical flow to lateral flow which was connected through the soil epikarst interface and finally converged in the low lying area contrary to expectations the contribution of yw at the soil epikarst interface was lower in the shallow soil plot 43 than in the deep soil plot 71 as a supplement moisture at the soil epikarst interface was significantly higher in the shallow soil plot this indicates that the renewal cycle of groundwater was slower in shallow soil covered hillslopes not only because almost all rainwater 98 entered the soil epikarst to redistribute as well as the higher water storage area in the soil epikarst interface accordingly the soil epikarst structure which is differentiated by soil depth controls hillslope hydrological connectivity and groundwater storage capacity in the karst region of southwest china abbreviations dsp deep soil plot ssp shallow soil plot yw young water fraction ks saturated soil hydraulic conductivity lc excess line

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction connectivity is widely involved in earth and environmental sciences such as ecological connectivity landscape connectivity and hydrological connectivity bracken et al 2013 of these hydrological connectivity is the key concept linking the biochemical cycles to earth s critical zone lin 2010 hydrological connectivity can be defined as dynamic and static connectivity with the former referring to the flow connection process of each landscape unit hillslope river channels and the latter referring to the flow path soil bedrock etc connection state in the catchment bracken et al 2013 turnbull et al 2008 however although global research on these two topics has received great attention the observations are often inconsistent owing to differences in specific geography and climate han et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnel 2010 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a b therefore further studies are needed to expand our limited understanding of hydrological connectivity the observation and quantification of rainfall runoff response processes is the most direct way to characterize hydrological connectivity coles and mcdonnell 2018 mcdonnell 2003 inspired by the nonlinear relationship of rainfall and runoff values which essentially reflects whether flow paths are connected early hydrologists introduced the concept of saturation excess dunne and black 1970 subsequently other runoff behaviors describing the linking process in catchments have been proposed such as fill and spill tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a b and saturation infiltration excess wang et al 2020 previous attempts at monitoring these direct runoff processes have greatly advanced our understanding of hydrological connectivity however the direct observation method makes it difficult to determine the flow path of hillslopes and reveal the internal mechanism of runoff generation even in watersheds with well monitored facilities mcguire et al 2005 thereby promoting the application of other methods such as isotope tracers in hydrology isotope tracer techniques have been applied to hillslope hydrology greatly expanding our understanding of hydrological processes at both the micro and macro scales chen et al 2018 water isotopes δ18o and δd are considered ideal tracers for capturing runoff paths in the soil profile ala aho et al 2018 tetzlaff et al 2015 calculating the transit time of different water bodies in watersheds or hillslopes klaus et al 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 and evaluating the mixing process between event water and pre event water in infiltration and runoff processes luo et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 2019 recently hydrograph separation using stable isotope tracers has played an important role in identifying runoff paths and rainwater conversion at different critical zone interfaces klaus and mcdonnell 2013 zhao et al 2016 2018 through the hydrograph separation of runoff isotopes we can accurately identify the contribution of rainwater to water flow in the channel and the contribution proportion is affected by environmental factors mcdonnell 2014 sprenger et al 2015 2018 van meerveld et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 more recent techniques based on stable isotopes have been able to quantify the age and seasonal origin of streamflow through periodic regression against seasonal tracer cycles of precipitation and various water types kirchner 2016a the young water fraction yw is an estimate of the streamflow fraction that is younger than a few months yw can be reliably determined in heterogeneous and nonstationary basins by analyzing seasonal tracer cycles however previous methods of mean transit time estimating from seasonal tracer cycles are subject to severe aggregation bias kirchner 2016a b xiao et al 2022 therefore integrating multiple methods and information sources is important for fully evaluating the hydrological connectivity process in addition to directly measuring rainfall runoff response the quantification of the spatial hydrological connection of water flow paths must consider the influence of structure such as topography soil and bedrock which is conducive to the combination of abstract hydrological processes and concrete physical structures hopp and mcdonnell 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 the important role of the soil bedrock interface in the formation of lateral subsurface runoff has been emphasized in the hydrology monitoring in many humid regions fu et al 2016 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 kim 2009 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a for example the formation of a relatively impervious layer at the soil bedrock interface may lead to connectivity among hillslopes gullies and intermittent stream channels van meerveld et al 2015 the spatial pattern of soil and bedrock co evolution directly affects the hydraulic gradient distribution which is the basic driving force of runoff tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a many studies have revealed the influence of soil depth on hydrological processes through its effects on soil properties soil rock structure and moisture conditions buttle et al 2000 lin 2006 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a however because of the spatial heterogeneity and random nature of runoff especially in karst landforms with a complex topography and a discontinuous soil layer observations may be specific to the local area and difficult to the extend to watershed or regional scales thus continuous monitoring and more in depth research is required karst regions account for approximately 7 12 of the earth s continent and approximately one quarter of the global population is completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 we define karst as comprising terrain with distinctive hydrology and landforms that arise from a combination of high rock solubility and well developed secondary fracture porosity ford and williams 2007 the key to the expression of karst is the development of its unusual subsurface hydrology the evolution of which is driven by the hydrological cycle the distinctive surface and subterranean features which are a hallmark of karst result from rock dissolution by natural waters along pathways provided by the geological structure under the strong effect of dissolution karst landforms are characterized by thin soils and plant roots grow into the epikarst that is the highly weathered skin of the karst bakalowicz 2004 due to the shallow soil layer and two dimensional hydrogeological structure of the surface and subsurface subsurface and epikarst runoff are the main runoff patterns of karst landforms worldwide chen et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 wilcox et al 2007 2008 the epikarst plays a vital role in the runoff generation process which is the core region that differs from the non karst critical zone hartmann et al 2014 williams 2008 simulated rainfall experiments have revealed surface runoff generation occurs only when the rainfall intensity exceeds the stable soil epikarst interface infiltration rate and when rainfall accumulates saturates the epikarst zone fu et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2020 moreover recent studies have shown that soil epikarst structure characterized by soil depth can lead to significant differences in runoff components and rainfall runoff relationship on karst hillslope wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a this is because runoff mechanisms are controlled by soil epikarst structures although the prediction of epikarst depth and its spatial distribution from soil depth is considered to be highly complicated the combination of detailed geophysical exploration and machine learning has nevertheless made it possible wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 however a simple rainfall runoff relationship diagram cannot explain the mechanism by which the soil epikarst structure controls rainwater infiltration and runoff connection processes in hrs system for instance what is the relationship between upslope runoff and low lying runoff how does the soil bedrock structure affect the contribution of rainwater to runoff or soil water answering these questions will help us understand hydrological connectivity in areas of complex topography in this study we conducted hydrological and isotopic monitoring in southwest china which is the largest continuous karst peak cluster depression region in the world wang et al 2019 hydrological connectivity in this area provides a basis for water resource management in the context of frequent extreme precipitation events shao et al 2021 thus the objectives of this study were as follows using hydrological and water isotope monitoring to 1 reveal the mechanism of infiltration and runoff generation to rainfall and to 2 clarify the effect of soil depth on hydrological connectivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the experiment was conducted in mulian catchment 1 14 km2 24 7417 e 108 3261 n northwest guangxi province of southwest china which is a long term monitoring stations of the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation fig 1 a the catchment which is a long term field research site of the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems of the chinese academy of science fig 1b is a representative cockpit karst catchment developed on pure dolomite the ratios of cao and mgo in the bedrock are 30 and 20 respectively the catchment is characterized by a flat depression surrounded by the peak of overlapping hills and ridges excluding an outlet in the northeast ford and williams 2007 fu et al 2015 the elevation ranges from 272 to 647 m above sea level approximately 60 of the slopes have a gradient greater than 25 hu et al 2015 the study site has a humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 19 6 c the monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures occur in july and february respectively the average annual rainfall is approximately 1456 mm 1980 2013 and the average rainfall in the wet season from may to september accounts for approximately 74 of the annual rainfall wang et al 2020 previous geophysical exploration at the catchment scale revealed that the geology of the study area comprises middle carboniferous c 2 dolomite and dolomitic limestone zhang et al 2021 the soils are brown calcareous soil with a clay to clay loam texture 25 50 silt and 30 60 clay the soil depth varies between 0 and 6 4 m however the average soil depth on the slopes is approximately 30 cm and contains abundant rock fragments with particle sizes of 2 mm wang et al 2020 2 2 experimental plot descriptions two adjacent experimental hillslope plots were selected for monitoring with a projected area of 5 20 m and separated by 5 m fig 1c for the monitoring plots soil drilling was used to collect soil depth at 1 1 m grid points with 100 measuring points in each plot fig 1c one plot with shallow average soil depth 35 4 39 46 cm was named the shallow soil plot ssp and the other with a relatively large average soil depth 66 0 33 26 cm was named the deep soil plot dsp the spatial distribution of soil depth is shown in fig 2 c the bedrock outcrop ratios in the dsp and ssp were 4 and 21 and the percentage of rock fragments was 7 3 and 15 9 respectively wang et al 2020 the topographic wetness index twi with 1 1 m grid was used to quantify the bedrock topography the twi is calculated as follows freer et al 2002 1 twi ln α tan β where α is the upslope confluence area of the unit contour length flowing through any point on the slope surface β is the local slope angle and tanβ is the slope of this point notably the flatter the terrain the larger the twi and the larger the confluence area indicating that the area is saturated more easily by water storage thus generating runoff beven et al 1984 the material of each plot was completely removed from the unweathered bedrock which had an average vertical depth of 4 m according to backhoe excavation fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 this depth represented the bedrock layer with no visible rock fractures and conduits and had a steady infiltration rate of 3 mm h 1 fu et al 2015 a strongly weathered product similar to the saprolite layer at the soil bedrock interface in non karst areas between the soil and epikarst interface was observed in the dsp whereas no saprolite was observed in the ssp as shown in fig 2b concrete walls were installed deep into the epikarst surface on three sides of each plot the left right and upper edges to prevent surface runoff and soil epikarst interface runoff exchange between adjacent plots fig 1e and f the above measures ensured the isolation of the soil layer at the soil epikarst interface undisturbed soil and saprolite samples were collected to measure the soil properties we collected soil samples from both up slope and down slope areas covered with soil in addition valuable saprolite samples were collected only on the up slope soil epikarst interface one sample each was collected from both the dsp and ssp the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks cm h 1 was determined using the constant head method jia et al 2013 then the bulk density of the undisturbed soil cores was determined from the volume mass relationship for each oven dried core sample wang et al 2014 the disturbed soil was passed through a 1 mm sieve and the particle size was analyzed by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england the properties of the soil and saprolite are listed in table 1 the permeability of the dsp was lower than that of the ssp 2 3 hydro meteorological monitoring meteorological parameters including daily rainfall amount and temperature were measured by using standard meteorological station in the study area from june 2020 to july 2021 fig 1a and b rainfall quantities were measured using an automatic tipping bucket with a resolution of 0 1 mm hobo event data logger usa surface runoff from the soil interface subsurface runoff from the soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff from the epikarst bedrock interface were measured at the outlet of the two experimental plots using a tipping bucket connected by a hosepipe and equipped with a hobo event recorder fig 1c f during the monitoring period june 2020 to july 2021 soil sensors ech2o 5tm decagon were installed horizontally at two depths 10 cm and 30 cm to represent the wetness condition monitoring was recorded at 5 minute intervals and subsequently converted to the daily scale dataset the measurement errors were 0 03 cm3 cm 3 fig 2 from 2015 to 2016 seven soil moisture probes were buried stevens hydra probe usa at each slope both in the dsp and ssp with relatively large soil cover depths and buried depths of each probe at the soil epikarst interface fig 2c unfortunately many of these instruments were deemed unusable after 2019 because of uncontrollable factors related to lighting strikes therefore this part of the dataset was used to supplement the relevant conclusions presented in section 4 2 4 water isotope sampling and analysis rainwater was sampled using a 20 cm diameter glass funnel connected to a 1 l high density polyethylene bottle a table tennis ball was placed in a funnel to reduce evaporation schotterer 1996 in total 130 daily rainfall isotope samples were collected with 10 and 57 surface runoff water isotope samples 61 and 97 subsurface runoff water isotope samples and 292 and 294 epikarst runoff water isotope samples collected form the dsp and ssp respectively all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and preserved at 4 c a total of 4172 daily mobile soil water samples were collected during the monitoring period the number of data points corresponding to specific points is presented in section 3 1 the horizontal distance was divided into the up middle and down slopes soil water isotope samples were collected at depths of 10 cm 30 cm and at the soil bedrock interface 60 cm and saprolite layer weathered bedrock at 100 cm from the down and middle slopes only two sampling points were established on the up slope at 10 cm and 30 cm owing to the shallow soil layer soil water samples were collected using suction lysimeters at 8 a m under a constant head vacuum of approximately 80 kpa zheng et al 2019 the δ 18o and δd stable isotopes of all water samples were measured using a los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 usa west et al 2010 via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy at johns hopkins university following the international atomic energy agency iaea standard procedure iaea 2009 the results are reported in the standard δ notation craig 1961 and defined relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water as given by the following equation 2 δ d δ 18 o r sample r standard r standard where r represents the isotope ratio of a sample 2h 1h and 18o 16o and rstandard represents the corresponding ratio in a standard form the δ value was expressed in parts per thousand permit the precision of measurement of δd was 0 5 and that of δ 18o was 0 2 at the 2σ criterion the isotopic composition of precipitation is characterized by equilibrium fractionation processes leading to a strong correlation between δ 18o and δd in rainwater this relationship is described by the local meteoric water line lmwl representing the regression line characterized by a slope and intercept between δ 18o and δd in a dual isotope plot sprenger et al 2017 in this study the lmwl during the monitoring period was δd 8 06δ 18o 15 77 r 2 0 95 based on the daily precipitation isotope values the resulting deviation of the water sample from the lmwl was described as the line conditioned excess lc excess as defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 3 lc e x c e s s δ d a δ 18 o b where a and b represent the slope and intercept of the lmwl respectively a 8 06 b 15 77 the slope 8 06 and intercept 15 77 of the lmwl during the monitoring period were larger than those of the global meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 indicating the basic characteristics of the subtropical humid climate region the lc excess indicates the degree of offset of the sampled waters from the lmwl the physical meaning of lc excess is expressed as the degree of deviation of the isotope value in the sample from the lmwl indicating the non equilibrium dynamic fractionation process caused by evaporation landwehr and coplen 2004 because stable isotopes in soil water are enriched by evaporation the average lc excess is usually negative sprenger et al 2017 2 5 young water fraction yw according to the daily variation in δ 18o the sine method was used to compare the amplitude of seasonal variations in the δ 18o values of precipitation runoff and mobile soil water and the degree of damping was used to estimate the transit time rusjan et al 2019 estimation of the mean transit time through tracer cycles and methods such as the lumped convolution approach should be limited to homogeneous catchments for which steady state conditions apply kirchner 2016a therefore we complemented the analysis with a more robust calculation of the yw defined as the fraction of discharge younger than a threshold age of approximately 2 3 months kirchner 2016a the use of yw assumes that the precipitation isotopes at the interannual scale satisfy sinusoidal fluctuations the sin wave model is defined as 4 δ 18 o δ mean 18 a p o r s sin c t θ where δ 18o and δ 18omean are the modeled and the mean annual measured δ 18o values respectively ap or as are the fitted annual amplitudes of precipitation and of the water body respectively c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period θ is the phase lag the yw can be calculated as follows 5 young w a t e r f r a c t i o n y w a s a p 2 6 hydrograph separation in this study we assumed a simple mixing of two end member event water and pre event water to quantify the mixing proportions of rainwater recharging the subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff here the hydrograph refers to the flow into each tipping bucket we used the weighted mean of daily rainfall samples as the event water cevent and the isotope of subsurface runoff and epikasrt runoff on the days before as the pre event water cpre event where the pre event water was defined as one day before the event the respective contributions were calculated using the following equations wang et al 2020 6 c event x event c event 1 x event c pre event where x event is the concentration of water discharge by the event water if the proportion of water source was overestimated the negative estimate was excluded zhao et al 2016 specifically a proportion above 100 was recorded as 100 and a proportion below 0 was recorded as 0 zhao et al 2016 notably we calculated the average event water ratios month scale only based on the mobile water isotope samples from june 1 to november 31 2020 due to the limited number of samples available in 2021 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic and precipitation isotope dynamics during the monitoring period june 2020 to july 2021 the total rainfall amount was 2496 5 mm 85 of which occurred in the wet season april to september fig 3 a september 2020 experienced the highest total rainfall 820 4 mm and daily rainfall 406 3 mm recorded the precipitation events were mainly low intensities with 67 of rainy days having 10 mm d 1 however rainstorms rainfall intensity 50 mm d 1 occurred during the wet season and were the main contributor to rainfall although only nine events 5 with rainfall amounts greater than 50 mm d 1 these events contributed to 42 of the total rainfall during the monitoring period at the annual scale significant seasonal effects were observed in the precipitation δ18o values the precipitation isotope values were more depleted in the wet season average value 7 83 than in the dry season average value 3 35 fig 3a particularly a period of low precipitation isotope values appeared from august to september which was accompanied by frequent high rainfall events in contrast a period of high precipitation isotope values appeared from november to march with low temperatures and drying we then determined the sinusoidal wave of precipitation based on the daily δ18o values as follows 7 δ 18 o 6 46 4 12 sin π t 166 83 183 29 r 2 0 53 n 128 the sinusoidal fluctuation of precipitation δ18o values was approximately one year 366 58 d temperature and evapotranspiration et0 showed strong seasonality fig 3a the average daily temperature and et0 in the dry season october to march were 14 5 and 3 8 mm respectively which were significantly lower than those in the wet season 24 2 and 5 7 mm soil moisture in the dsp average 0 31 cm3 cm 3 was higher than that in the ssp average 0 28 cm3 cm 3 during the monitoring period fig 3c the soil moisture in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season but the variation was higher in the dsp 18 1 and 10 4 at 10 and 30 cm respectively than in ssp 11 3 and 6 2 at 10 and 30 cm respectively surface runoff was low and occurred only during heavy rainstorms especially in the ssp accounting for only 2 2 of total runoff in the ssp but 20 4 in the dsp subsurface and epikarst runoff were the main components of runoff on the karst hillslope with subsurface runoff representing 35 8 and 45 2 of total runoff in the dsp and ssp respectively and epikarst runoff representing 43 8 and 52 6 fig 3b although the flow velocity of epikarst runoff was relatively low its outflow was stable and lasted for a long time particularly under the low rainfall conditions in the dry season fig 3b notably the flow of each runoff component was higher in the dsp than in the ssp indicating that part of the rainwater was not discharged or infiltrated into the deep layer in the ssp 3 2 stable isotope spatiotemporal dynamics the δ18o values of rainwater mobile soil water and runoff showed significant regular sinusoidal fluctuations on the interannual scale indicating strong seasonality to the isotope temporal dynamics fig 4 and table 2 the sinusoidal fluctuation period of the dsp average value 490 3 d was longer than that of the ssp average value 385 4 d and both were higher than that of precipitation 366 d for the dsp the fluctuation period was longer at a depth of 60 cm on the down slope and 100 cm on the middle slope fig 4a and c in contrast the fluctuation period was shorter on the down slope and middle slopes at a depth of 100 cm for the up slope the δ18o values and variation trends at 10 cm and 30 cm in were highly consistent in the ssp and the fluctuation period was shorter than that of the dsp fig 4e and f similar trends were observed in the runoff dynamics the homogeneity between each water medium was relatively weak in the dsp and there was a certain degree of hysteresis the δ18o values of all soil layer and runoff components were more depleted in the wet season than in the dry season table 2 moreover in the down slope and middle slope the δ18o value was more depleted at 0 30 cm than at 60 100 cm whereas the opposite was true in the dry season this reflects the dramatic changes in isotopes at the surface whereas the deeper layer is more stable all δ18o values in the down slope and middle slope in the wet season were more depleted in the dsp except that at 30 cm in the ssp for up slope the wet season δ18o values were most depleted in the ssp whereas the δ18o values in the dry season were the most enriched and closest to rainwater this shows that the rainfall input has a controlling effect on water isotopes in the up slope in contrast δ18o values at 10 cm were more depleted than those at 30 cm in both the wet seasons in the dsp table 2 3 3 young water fraction yw the yw of each water body is shown in table 3 the average yw of mobile soil water was 79 61 with a range of 21 55 100 high yw values occurred in the surface layer 10 30 cm depth especially on the up slope where yw values were 100 at both 10 cm and 30 cm depths the average yw of subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff was much lower than the soil mobile water at 58 25 and 25 48 respectively significant differences were observed in the yw of soil mobile water at each slope position owing to the different soil depths table 3 overall the yw values of mobile soil water were higher in the dsp 82 37 than in the ssp 71 94 this difference was mainly reflected in soil depth of 60 100 cm on the down and middle slopes in particular we observed greater agreement between sinusoidal fitting curves in the soil layer and epikarst runoff in the ssp correspondingly a sinusoid amplitude of 0 9 1 4 exhibited the closest agreement fig 4 and table 3 3 4 water meteoric lines and lc excess the δ18o δd plot of mobile soil water and runoff is presented in fig 5 and the fitting formula was obtained using linear regression the δ18o and δd values of each water sample fell on the lmwl with minimal deviation significant seasonal variations were also observed fig s1 with isotopic values clustered to the lower left corner of the plot during the dry season and to the upper right corner during the wet season the slope and intercept range of the event meteoric water line emwl were 7 16 8 20 and 7 85 15 60 respectively which were slightly less than the corresponding lmwl values indicating that the emwl was partially affected by evaporation fractionation precipitation showed both positive and negative lc excess values fig 6 blue dash line with an average value of 0 02 the lc excess value of each water body was lower than that of precipitation and showed significant p 0 05 seasonal differentiation with an average value of 1 63 in the wet season and 2 45 in the dry season the spatial variation of lc excess was greater in the wet season than in the dry season in particular no significant differences were observed for each depth of the up slope and runoff components in the dry season fig 6c and d for the down slope lc excess values were lower for the surface layer 0 30 cm than the deep layer 60 100 cm in contrast lc excess increased with increasing soil depth in the middle slope for the up slope the divergence was mainly reflected in the wet season with lc excess values lower at 30 cm depth than at 10 cm depth overall the lc excess value of runoff increased in the following order surface runoff subsurface runoff epikarst runoff fig 6d the lc excess values of mobile soil water were affected by soil depth for the down slope at the boundary of 60 cm the lc excess value above 60 cm was significantly higher p 0 05 in the dsp than in the ssp whereas the opposite was observed below 60 cm fig 6a in contrast the distribution trend on the middle slope was the opposite of that on the down slope and the lc excess value was lower in the dsp than in the ssp in the wet season fig 6b for the up slope the lc excess value was significantly higher in the dsp than in the ssp the influence of soil depth on the lc excess value showed no significant difference among runoff components regardless of wet or dry seasons fig 6d 3 5 hydrograph separation according to hydrograph separation the proportion of event water increased and then decreased from summer to winter which was related to the seasonal variation in precipitation and its isotopes fig 7 soil mobile water showed that the proportion of event water increased from the down slope to the up slope and decreased with an increase in soil depth at the profile scale except for the depth of 60 cm on the middle slope 64 45 in the ssp the proportion of event water was much higher on the surface 51 98 than in the deep layer 20 55 the proportion of event water was lower in runoff than in mobile soil water and was concentrated in the range of 0 10 a high proportion of event water occurred during relatively rare high intensity precipitation events fig 7d the proportion of event water was higher in ssp than in dsp both in mobile soil water 34 39 in the dsp and 44 42 in the ssp and runoff components 1 86 in the dsp and 3 05 in the ssp fig 7 the proportion of event water in the middle slope and up slope of the ssp was 43 48 and 81 05 respectively which was substantially higher than that in the dsp 25 14 and 51 85 respectively on the down slope the proportion of event water showed relatively little difference between dsp and ssp and ranged between 41 87 and 61 29 and 7 04 and 21 62 at depths of 0 30 and 60 100 cm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological connectivity via rainwater infiltration and distribution the precipitation isotopes at the study site showed significant sinusoidal fluctuations period one year fig 3a indicating that the distinct seasonal cycles are controlled by regular variation of the moisture source allen et al 2018 2019 liu et al 2014 sánchez murillo et al 2019 compared with the up slope the effect of rainfall isotope input on soil water isotopes was weakened in the down slopes on the up slope the soil water movement was mainly vertical infiltration because of the strong permeability and the water exchange mixing level between rainwater and soil water was low xu et al 2020 on the down slope the vertical flow of the soil part and the lateral subsurface flow mixed with the soil epikarst interface and this portion of the water could be preserved for a long time within the profile fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 thereby weakening the control effect of rainwater on the soil water isotope signal the above results are well supported by our isotopic monitoring in that the subsurface runoff isotope values are closer to those of soil water at the down slope and the proportion of event water and yw in the up slope is higher than that of the down slope the sinusoidal fluctuation period of soil and runoff water isotope essentially reflects the distribution of rainwater after infiltration in the soil epikarst profile the degree of mixing of mobile soil water increases gradually from the up slope to the down slope as can be clearly observed by the amplitude and period of the sinusoidal fluctuations fig 4 this feature reflects the hydrological process differentiation between the sloping and down depression transition zone in the karst peak cluster depression region similar to the riparian zone in non karst area chen et al 2017 pointed out that the vertical flow velocity of the hillslope is comparatively higher than that of the lowland suggesting that hydrological processes operate more rapidly on the up slope than on the down slope soil depths and permeability were negatively correlated and varied with elevation as one of the main influencing factors fu et al 2015 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2022 investigated the soil depth distribution in a small watershed and found that soil depth increased from the up slope to the down slope whereas the soil infiltration capacity decreased moreover compared with the down slope the isotopic hydrologic separation results showed that a higher proportion of new water and young water on the up slope also explained the above phenomenon fig 7 contrary to our traditional understanding the period of fluctuation in the down slope did not increase with the vertical depth of the soil profile especially in the ssp the special water flow path in karst well explains this phenomenon we previously investigated the runoff path at the small catchment scale based on the dye tracing method and found that the water flow was preferentially distributed along the soil bedrock interface or cracks wang et al 2018 because of this rainwater does not reside in the soil matrix and thus fluctuates more slowly this discovery thus deepens our understanding of the deeper unseen karst flow paths the unique rapid hydrological processes of karst hillslopes are well captured by isotopic signals at the horizontal scale of 0 60 cm yw water 2 3 months including mobile soil water from the up slope to down slope surface runoff and subsurface runoff was overwhelmingly dominant average value 79 61 table 3 the higher yw suggest that a large proportion of fast flow components were dominant the young water was mainly the component of precipitation entering rivers via fast flow slope flow and underground lateral flow but not the slow flow component from underground water and deep flow with very old age hu et al 2020 kirchner 2016a calculated the global river average yw 26 moreover in the non karst catchment in the same climate zone as the study area the observed contribution of yw to the river was 21 dai et al 2022 the yw values from the above results were much lower than those in this study 21 61 table 3 and other karst catchments rusjan et al 2019 in view of the travel times the young water could be related to the stream water that follows well developed karst conduits and the diffuse discharge through the fissured and fractured vadose zone of the karst catchments rusjan et al 2019 the above results were also confirmed by the soil event water proportion with the average contributions being as high as 34 and 43 in the dsp and ssp respectively and the event water of the shallow soil 0 30 cm was dominant 50 fig 7 on the contrary in the entisol soil slope of the same climate zone the event water is greater than 50 only when the soil is saturated by heavy rainfall events zhao et al 2016 however we observed that the event water contribution of soil water and runoff could even reach 100 during the extreme rainfall in september zhang et al 2022b on the other hand the lower lc excess value indicates that soil water and runoff were weakly affected by evaporation which indirectly suggests a fast water flow process 4 2 hydrological connectivity via the connection process of runoff this study emphasizes the basic characteristics that karst is dominated by underground hydrological processes fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 wilcox et al 2007 zhang et al 2022a because the total runoff from subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff exceeded 80 in both the wet and dry seasons fig 3 this is markedly different from a non karst region for which one study found that the runoff was dominated by underground runoff only in the high wet environment while surface overland runoff dominated 48 to 94 in the dry sites peng and wang 2012 in addition after the continuous long term monitoring in this study 2006 to 2010 it was found that the surface runoff coefficient was 5 and was not affected by vegetation type chen et al 2012 however there is still a limited understanding of the isotopic characteristics of runoff from epikarst which is the core area distinguishing the karst critical zone from the non karst zone williams 2008 epikarst comprises highly weathered carbonate bedrock immediately beneath the surface of the soil or exposed at the surface williams 2008 the soil epikarst interface can easily generate lateral runoff when the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil bedrock interface resulting in water becoming perched at the soil epikarst interface hartmann et al 2014 parise et al 2015 williams 2008 in this study the isotope values of the epikarst fluctuated significantly after high intensity rainfall events with the proportion of event water suddenly increasing then flattening fig 4h therefore it can be stated that when the soil epikarst system is saturated or nearly saturated the runoff in epikarst is dominated by diffuse flow adji et al 2016 wang et al 2020 and preferential flow is often observed in the early dry environment zhang et al 2022b moreover it was observed that the flow rate of epikarst runoff was stable and could be maintained for a long time even if no effective rainfall event occurred fig 3 this ability to redistribute and store release rainwater is important for vegetation growth and drinking water security in karst regions with low water storage capacity wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a however the direct quantification of water in the epikarst requires further exploration although indirect observations continue to emphasize the role of the epikarst the mixing of mobile soil water mainly occurred down slope below 60 cm which was confirmed by the significantly lower amplitude of the fitting curve of this layer fig 4 the soil epikarst interface 60 cm plays an important role in the distribution of water infiltration and runoff which determines the spatial distribution of mobile soil water isotopes generally a layer of low permeability saprolite forms at the interface between the soil and weathered bedrock blocking the infiltration of rainwater into this layer and producing lateral runoff banks et al 2009 however the soil bedrock interface in karst areas is not well defined because the soil layer is shallow and bedrock is frequently exposed to the surface zhang et al 2022a nevertheless lateral subsurface flow is commonly observed at the soil epikarst interface fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 wilcox et al 2007 2008 our previous studies explored the mechanism of subsurface runoff generation through rainfall simulations and hydrometric monitoring subsurface runoff meets the fill and spill theory where the prerequisite is that the infiltration of rainwater exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil epikarst interface fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 in this study the above theory was confirmed through mobile water isotope monitoring and further restricted the location to slope positions with a relatively thick soil layer 4 3 critical zone structure hydrological connectivity relationship influence of soil depth on soil water and runoff isotopes the latest results in the monitoring plots show that soil depth has a first order controlling effect on the relationship between rainfall and runoff wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a here the possible influence of soil depth on the mechanism of isotope variation is discussed in order to provide new insights into hydrological processes on karst hillslopes the sinusoidal fluctuation period of mobile soil water was shorter in the ssp than in the dsp fig 4 and table 3 and the fluctuation range of isotope values was wider in the ssp than in the dsp this means that when rainwater infiltrates the soil layer it is relatively well mixed in the thicker soil layers and more easily permeates through the shallow soil layers this can be explained by differences in the soil infiltration capacity which determine how water moves in the soil profile soils in the ssp could be characterized by high infiltration capacity and discontinuous spatial coverage which increases the possibility of preferential flow wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a from research in the shale hills watershed lin 2006 suggested that preferential flow is more likely to be generated in shallow soil than in thick soil areas buttle et al 2000 summarized that infiltration excess runoff is the main runoff generation in bedrock outcrops whereas macropore preferential flow dominates the soil bedrock interface runoff in shallow soil areas isotopic hydrograph separation effectively supported the above results as shown by the higher proportion of event water in the ssp than in the dsp fig 7 wang et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022a reported similar results however they only considered runoff and did not consider soil water although only runoff was considered the mechanisms of mobile soil water and runoff are consistent a shallow soil layer together with the lack of storage in catchments leads to the dominance of event water during storms cras et al 2007 rainwater preserved in the soil profile also returns to the atmosphere as a gas which is affected by evapotranspiration and isotopes are effective for capturing the amount of water subjected to evaporative fractionation sprenger et al 2017 evaporation causes kinetic fractionation of the composition of stable isotopes in residual water craig et al 1963 which in visual representation deviate to the lower right corner of the lmwl in the δ18o δd plot resulting in the slope and intercept that are lower than the lmwl however the difference in the emwl was small for each water body the mobile soil water collected in this study was typically replenished by recent rain and whether it is sufficiently mixed with previously retained water depends on complex environmental factors some studies have also shown significant differences in isotopic composition between mobile and non mobile bulk soil water sprenger et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 therefore simply observing the slope of the emwl cannot effectively reveal whether the mobile soil water isotope is affected by kinetic fractionation however the mobile soil water is not immune to evaporative fractionation for example sprenger et al 2017 found that evaporation fractionation within peatland drainage networks affects the isotopic signal of headwater catchments which calls into question the common assumption in hydrological modeling that the isotopic composition of stream waters does not undergo fractionation processes similarly the results in this study based on lc excess values indicate that mobile water is more strongly affected by evaporative fractionation in the dry season than in the wet season fig 6 although the deviation signal of lc excess values was as strong as that of bulk soil water luo et al 2019 the average lc excess value was smaller in the ssp indicating a relatively strong kinetic fractionation in the dry season when there is less precipitation mobile water gradually decreases with soil drying and is vulnerable to evaporation luo et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 thus for the ssp pore water is more likely to be lost during the dry season because of its relatively weak retention capacity which makes water molecules more susceptible to evaporative fractionation sprenger et al 2015 interestingly contrary to expectations it was found that yw water and event water at depths of 60 cm and 100 cm were lower in the ssp than in the dsp table 3 and fig 4 the above phenomena can be explained by the differences in confluence area and water storage space based on the bedrock topography first in terms of the runoff generation process the flat terrain of dsp leads to a large and continuous confluence area making it easier to generate surface runoff beven et al 1984 the twi reflects the spatial distribution of the confluence area as shown in fig 8 in the dsp high twi areas easy to saturate and generate runoff are continuously distributed from the middle up slope to the down slope and the terrain is flat however high twi areas are mainly concentrated in the middle slope and edges in the ssp which indicates that the confluence area may extend beyond the range of the plot we used a heavy rainfall event as an example 42 8 mm beginning at 22 00 and ending at 04 00 and observed the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture to indicate changes in the saturation zone fig 9 the dsp s larger confluence area allows saturation zones to form downhill at the beginning of the rainfall in ssp there is less variation in soil moisture and more rainwater can be received before the saturated zone forms on the other hand the larger bedrock water storage area of the ssp plays an important role in water redistribution due to its rugged bedrock topography water infiltration in the epikarst zone is not lost quickly due to the low permeability 3 cm h 1 of the bedrock fu et al 2016 the more complex topography means more space for underground water storage thus increasing the time for water migration enabling ample mixing and exchange between event and prevent water brkić et al 2018 kogovšek and petrič 2014 rusjan et al 2019 the above results can be validated by the observed changes in epikarst moisture over a long time series august 2015 to may 2016 using a meter buried at the soil epikarst interface in the dsp and ssp fig 10 through the two way anova analysis of the moisture at the soil epikarst interface during the monitoring period it was found that the moisture of ssp was significant p 0 001 n 2729 higher than that of dsp which was contrary to the results of soil layer 0 30 cm fig 3 it further confirmed that rainwater from ssp penetrates to the low permeability bedrock surface and can maintain a high water condition the two time scale processes mentioned above are consistent because a large amount of surface runoff is rapidly discharged in the dsp during rainfall figs 9 and 10 and the relatively small area of bedrock water storage results in a relatively weak water supply capacity accordingly based on knowing the role of the water reservoir in the soil epikarst interface in the early stage fu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 this study emphasizes that this role is more prominent in the ssp from the perspective of water security and sustainable use water is important for vegetation or animals in the face of drought stress furthermore it is necessary to accurately quantify the critical zone structure of plots with different soil depths through geophysical methods however there is also an urgent need to quantify moisture in the epikarst zone similar to the weathered bedrock layer in non karst areas and clarify its relationship with vegetation rempe and dietrich 2018 here we reassess the practical significance of rainfall runoff threshold behavior which is a fundamental indicator of hydrological connectivity in complex karst areas our previous study showed that the rainfall threshold of surface runoff in dsp 45 mm was larger than that in ssp 40 mm zhang et al 2022a this method homogenizes the hillslope and although the effect of soil depth on water storage is shown the effects of topographic spatial heterogeneity are weakened we also previously found that the surface and bedrock topographic wetness index were associated at a higher degree in the ssp 34 than in the dsp 3 figs s2 and s3 zhang et al 2022a a high degree of coupling between soil depth and bedrock means that they affect runoff generation in a combinatory manner which agrees with findings in previous experimental plots and small watersheds freer et al 2002 hutchinson and moore 2000 peters et al 1995 tani 1997 through further analyses in this study we found that the spatial heterogeneity of bedrock topography caused differentiation of the hillslope confluence area which further affected the formation of the spatial saturation zone fig 9 from the perspective of the runoff mechanism the rainfall runoff threshold reflects the surface runoff generated by saturation excess while the surface runoff of the karst hillslope is generally associated with infiltration excess and saturation excess of the area wang et al 2018 the high surface runoff in dsp is likely due to the large confluence area and weak permeability which increase runoff from the infiltration excess component during rainfall especially during high intensity rainfall events zhang et al 2022b in contrast the greater soil infiltration capacity and bedrock water storage capacity in the ssp make it difficult to generate surface runoff 2 table 1 and almost all of the rainwater seeps down or is stored in the epikarst fu et al 2016 the simple rainfall runoff plot can obscure the impact of runoff generation processes to some extent therefore it is necessary to utilize references with varying methodologies and scales to understand these complex karst hillslope hydrological processes this study then constructed a conceptual model for runoff components according to soil depth in a karst hillslope and integrated the results over two representative profiles based on previous studies fig 11 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a first the structural differentiation leads to differences in runoff composition in the dsp and ssp in the dsp the surface intercepts more rainwater in the form of surface runoff 20 4 which results in limited distribution into the soil epikarst zone relatively speaking the ssp can be characterized by discontinuous soil cover frequent bedrock outcrops a strong soil infiltration capacity but weak permeability of weathered bedrock and large underground water storage space fig 9a zhang et al 2022a these structural features make the soil epikarst interface play a more prominent role in water storage secondly the influence of soil depth is emphasized from the perspective of hydrological connectivity rainwater from the up slope is connected to the low lying area through the soil epikarst interface the shallow soil layer accelerates the hydrological process of the soil layer but enhances the water storage of the epikarst because the shallow soil layer has more underground water storage space various water bodies are fully mixed and exhibit delayed discharge resulting in a lower proportion of young water fraction in mobile soil in the down slope at 60 cm depth than in the deep soil layer these results provide a new perspective for understanding the structure and hydrological connectivity of the karst hillslope critical zone 5 conclusion this study provides a unique insight into the hydrological connectivity of the hillslope critical zone in karst areas of southwest china the unique rapid hydrological processes of karst hillslopes were well captured by isotopic signals at the horizontal scale of 0 60 cm the young water fraction was overwhelmingly dominant average value 79 61 indicating that a large proportion of fast flow components dominant the total runoff from subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff exceeded 80 and deep infiltration was the main runoff component of karst it was found that the soil epikarst interface 60 cm plays an important role in the distribution of water infiltration and runoff which determining the connection position and flow path of runoff on the hillslope moreover the critical zone structure differentiated by soil depth plays an important role in controlling the hydrological connectivity although shallow soil allows rainwater to infiltrate almost entirely into the soil epikarst the rugged bedrock topography and its low permeability lead to a larger water storage area in the soil epikarsat interface thus extending the water renewal rate and supply time accordingly these results help us understand the role of epikarst in hydrological regulation and water storage in the karst critical zone credit authorship contribution statement jun zhang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft investigation hongsong chen

2368,hydrologic connectivity along the hillslope critical zone is essential for the transmission of water solutes and nutrients to streams however the influences of critical zone structure on hydrological connectivity are not adequately understood especially for hillslopes with complex topography we investigated the hydrological connectivity along different topographical positions of two adjacent dolomite hillslope plots in southwest china a deep soil plot average value 66 cm and shallow soil plot average value 35 cm we characterized the dynamics of multiple interface runoff and soil water based on observations of stable isotopes δ18o and δd and hydrometric monitoring and computed the lc excess young water fraction yw and hydrograph separation from june 2020 to july 2021 on both hillslopes soil depth gradually increased from up slope to down slope and the contribution of event water and yw to soil water gradually decreased 100 to 69 in the vertical depth a sudden decrease in the contribution of yw 98 to 47 and event water 44 to 11 in the down slope of the soil epikarst interface was observed these results indicate that the infiltration of rainwater from up slope to down slope was altered by vertical flow to lateral flow which was connected through the soil epikarst interface and finally converged in the low lying area contrary to expectations the contribution of yw at the soil epikarst interface was lower in the shallow soil plot 43 than in the deep soil plot 71 as a supplement moisture at the soil epikarst interface was significantly higher in the shallow soil plot this indicates that the renewal cycle of groundwater was slower in shallow soil covered hillslopes not only because almost all rainwater 98 entered the soil epikarst to redistribute as well as the higher water storage area in the soil epikarst interface accordingly the soil epikarst structure which is differentiated by soil depth controls hillslope hydrological connectivity and groundwater

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction connectivity is widely involved in earth and environmental sciences such as ecological connectivity landscape connectivity and hydrological connectivity bracken et al 2013 of these hydrological connectivity is the key concept linking the biochemical cycles to earth s critical zone lin 2010 hydrological connectivity can be defined as dynamic and static connectivity with the former referring to the flow connection process of each landscape unit hillslope river channels and the latter referring to the flow path soil bedrock etc connection state in the catchment bracken et al 2013 turnbull et al 2008 however although global research on these two topics has received great attention the observations are often inconsistent owing to differences in specific geography and climate han et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnel 2010 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a b therefore further studies are needed to expand our limited understanding of hydrological connectivity the observation and quantification of rainfall runoff response processes is the most direct way to characterize hydrological connectivity coles and mcdonnell 2018 mcdonnell 2003 inspired by the nonlinear relationship of rainfall and runoff values which essentially reflects whether flow paths are connected early hydrologists introduced the concept of saturation excess dunne and black 1970 subsequently other runoff behaviors describing the linking process in catchments have been proposed such as fill and spill tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a b and saturation infiltration excess wang et al 2020 previous attempts at monitoring these direct runoff processes have greatly advanced our understanding of hydrological connectivity however the direct observation method makes it difficult to determine the flow path of hillslopes and reveal the internal mechanism of runoff generation even in watersheds with well monitored facilities mcguire et al 2005 thereby promoting the application of other methods such as isotope tracers in hydrology isotope tracer techniques have been applied to hillslope hydrology greatly expanding our understanding of hydrological processes at both the micro and macro scales chen et al 2018 water isotopes δ18o and δd are considered ideal tracers for capturing runoff paths in the soil profile ala aho et al 2018 tetzlaff et al 2015 calculating the transit time of different water bodies in watersheds or hillslopes klaus et al 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 and evaluating the mixing process between event water and pre event water in infiltration and runoff processes luo et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 2019 recently hydrograph separation using stable isotope tracers has played an important role in identifying runoff paths and rainwater conversion at different critical zone interfaces klaus and mcdonnell 2013 zhao et al 2016 2018 through the hydrograph separation of runoff isotopes we can accurately identify the contribution of rainwater to water flow in the channel and the contribution proportion is affected by environmental factors mcdonnell 2014 sprenger et al 2015 2018 van meerveld et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 more recent techniques based on stable isotopes have been able to quantify the age and seasonal origin of streamflow through periodic regression against seasonal tracer cycles of precipitation and various water types kirchner 2016a the young water fraction yw is an estimate of the streamflow fraction that is younger than a few months yw can be reliably determined in heterogeneous and nonstationary basins by analyzing seasonal tracer cycles however previous methods of mean transit time estimating from seasonal tracer cycles are subject to severe aggregation bias kirchner 2016a b xiao et al 2022 therefore integrating multiple methods and information sources is important for fully evaluating the hydrological connectivity process in addition to directly measuring rainfall runoff response the quantification of the spatial hydrological connection of water flow paths must consider the influence of structure such as topography soil and bedrock which is conducive to the combination of abstract hydrological processes and concrete physical structures hopp and mcdonnell 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 the important role of the soil bedrock interface in the formation of lateral subsurface runoff has been emphasized in the hydrology monitoring in many humid regions fu et al 2016 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 kim 2009 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a for example the formation of a relatively impervious layer at the soil bedrock interface may lead to connectivity among hillslopes gullies and intermittent stream channels van meerveld et al 2015 the spatial pattern of soil and bedrock co evolution directly affects the hydraulic gradient distribution which is the basic driving force of runoff tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a many studies have revealed the influence of soil depth on hydrological processes through its effects on soil properties soil rock structure and moisture conditions buttle et al 2000 lin 2006 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a however because of the spatial heterogeneity and random nature of runoff especially in karst landforms with a complex topography and a discontinuous soil layer observations may be specific to the local area and difficult to the extend to watershed or regional scales thus continuous monitoring and more in depth research is required karst regions account for approximately 7 12 of the earth s continent and approximately one quarter of the global population is completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 we define karst as comprising terrain with distinctive hydrology and landforms that arise from a combination of high rock solubility and well developed secondary fracture porosity ford and williams 2007 the key to the expression of karst is the development of its unusual subsurface hydrology the evolution of which is driven by the hydrological cycle the distinctive surface and subterranean features which are a hallmark of karst result from rock dissolution by natural waters along pathways provided by the geological structure under the strong effect of dissolution karst landforms are characterized by thin soils and plant roots grow into the epikarst that is the highly weathered skin of the karst bakalowicz 2004 due to the shallow soil layer and two dimensional hydrogeological structure of the surface and subsurface subsurface and epikarst runoff are the main runoff patterns of karst landforms worldwide chen et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 wilcox et al 2007 2008 the epikarst plays a vital role in the runoff generation process which is the core region that differs from the non karst critical zone hartmann et al 2014 williams 2008 simulated rainfall experiments have revealed surface runoff generation occurs only when the rainfall intensity exceeds the stable soil epikarst interface infiltration rate and when rainfall accumulates saturates the epikarst zone fu et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2020 moreover recent studies have shown that soil epikarst structure characterized by soil depth can lead to significant differences in runoff components and rainfall runoff relationship on karst hillslope wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a this is because runoff mechanisms are controlled by soil epikarst structures although the prediction of epikarst depth and its spatial distribution from soil depth is considered to be highly complicated the combination of detailed geophysical exploration and machine learning has nevertheless made it possible wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 however a simple rainfall runoff relationship diagram cannot explain the mechanism by which the soil epikarst structure controls rainwater infiltration and runoff connection processes in hrs system for instance what is the relationship between upslope runoff and low lying runoff how does the soil bedrock structure affect the contribution of rainwater to runoff or soil water answering these questions will help us understand hydrological connectivity in areas of complex topography in this study we conducted hydrological and isotopic monitoring in southwest china which is the largest continuous karst peak cluster depression region in the world wang et al 2019 hydrological connectivity in this area provides a basis for water resource management in the context of frequent extreme precipitation events shao et al 2021 thus the objectives of this study were as follows using hydrological and water isotope monitoring to 1 reveal the mechanism of infiltration and runoff generation to rainfall and to 2 clarify the effect of soil depth on hydrological connectivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the experiment was conducted in mulian catchment 1 14 km2 24 7417 e 108 3261 n northwest guangxi province of southwest china which is a long term monitoring stations of the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation fig 1 a the catchment which is a long term field research site of the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems of the chinese academy of science fig 1b is a representative cockpit karst catchment developed on pure dolomite the ratios of cao and mgo in the bedrock are 30 and 20 respectively the catchment is characterized by a flat depression surrounded by the peak of overlapping hills and ridges excluding an outlet in the northeast ford and williams 2007 fu et al 2015 the elevation ranges from 272 to 647 m above sea level approximately 60 of the slopes have a gradient greater than 25 hu et al 2015 the study site has a humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 19 6 c the monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures occur in july and february respectively the average annual rainfall is approximately 1456 mm 1980 2013 and the average rainfall in the wet season from may to september accounts for approximately 74 of the annual rainfall wang et al 2020 previous geophysical exploration at the catchment scale revealed that the geology of the study area comprises middle carboniferous c 2 dolomite and dolomitic limestone zhang et al 2021 the soils are brown calcareous soil with a clay to clay loam texture 25 50 silt and 30 60 clay the soil depth varies between 0 and 6 4 m however the average soil depth on the slopes is approximately 30 cm and contains abundant rock fragments with particle sizes of 2 mm wang et al 2020 2 2 experimental plot descriptions two adjacent experimental hillslope plots were selected for monitoring with a projected area of 5 20 m and separated by 5 m fig 1c for the monitoring plots soil drilling was used to collect soil depth at 1 1 m grid points with 100 measuring points in each plot fig 1c one plot with shallow average soil depth 35 4 39 46 cm was named the shallow soil plot ssp and the other with a relatively large average soil depth 66 0 33 26 cm was named the deep soil plot dsp the spatial distribution of soil depth is shown in fig 2 c the bedrock outcrop ratios in the dsp and ssp were 4 and 21 and the percentage of rock fragments was 7 3 and 15 9 respectively wang et al 2020 the topographic wetness index twi with 1 1 m grid was used to quantify the bedrock topography the twi is calculated as follows freer et al 2002 1 twi ln α tan β where α is the upslope confluence area of the unit contour length flowing through any point on the slope surface β is the local slope angle and tanβ is the slope of this point notably the flatter the terrain the larger the twi and the larger the confluence area indicating that the area is saturated more easily by water storage thus generating runoff beven et al 1984 the material of each plot was completely removed from the unweathered bedrock which had an average vertical depth of 4 m according to backhoe excavation fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 this depth represented the bedrock layer with no visible rock fractures and conduits and had a steady infiltration rate of 3 mm h 1 fu et al 2015 a strongly weathered product similar to the saprolite layer at the soil bedrock interface in non karst areas between the soil and epikarst interface was observed in the dsp whereas no saprolite was observed in the ssp as shown in fig 2b concrete walls were installed deep into the epikarst surface on three sides of each plot the left right and upper edges to prevent surface runoff and soil epikarst interface runoff exchange between adjacent plots fig 1e and f the above measures ensured the isolation of the soil layer at the soil epikarst interface undisturbed soil and saprolite samples were collected to measure the soil properties we collected soil samples from both up slope and down slope areas covered with soil in addition valuable saprolite samples were collected only on the up slope soil epikarst interface one sample each was collected from both the dsp and ssp the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks cm h 1 was determined using the constant head method jia et al 2013 then the bulk density of the undisturbed soil cores was determined from the volume mass relationship for each oven dried core sample wang et al 2014 the disturbed soil was passed through a 1 mm sieve and the particle size was analyzed by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england the properties of the soil and saprolite are listed in table 1 the permeability of the dsp was lower than that of the ssp 2 3 hydro meteorological monitoring meteorological parameters including daily rainfall amount and temperature were measured by using standard meteorological station in the study area from june 2020 to july 2021 fig 1a and b rainfall quantities were measured using an automatic tipping bucket with a resolution of 0 1 mm hobo event data logger usa surface runoff from the soil interface subsurface runoff from the soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff from the epikarst bedrock interface were measured at the outlet of the two experimental plots using a tipping bucket connected by a hosepipe and equipped with a hobo event recorder fig 1c f during the monitoring period june 2020 to july 2021 soil sensors ech2o 5tm decagon were installed horizontally at two depths 10 cm and 30 cm to represent the wetness condition monitoring was recorded at 5 minute intervals and subsequently converted to the daily scale dataset the measurement errors were 0 03 cm3 cm 3 fig 2 from 2015 to 2016 seven soil moisture probes were buried stevens hydra probe usa at each slope both in the dsp and ssp with relatively large soil cover depths and buried depths of each probe at the soil epikarst interface fig 2c unfortunately many of these instruments were deemed unusable after 2019 because of uncontrollable factors related to lighting strikes therefore this part of the dataset was used to supplement the relevant conclusions presented in section 4 2 4 water isotope sampling and analysis rainwater was sampled using a 20 cm diameter glass funnel connected to a 1 l high density polyethylene bottle a table tennis ball was placed in a funnel to reduce evaporation schotterer 1996 in total 130 daily rainfall isotope samples were collected with 10 and 57 surface runoff water isotope samples 61 and 97 subsurface runoff water isotope samples and 292 and 294 epikarst runoff water isotope samples collected form the dsp and ssp respectively all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and preserved at 4 c a total of 4172 daily mobile soil water samples were collected during the monitoring period the number of data points corresponding to specific points is presented in section 3 1 the horizontal distance was divided into the up middle and down slopes soil water isotope samples were collected at depths of 10 cm 30 cm and at the soil bedrock interface 60 cm and saprolite layer weathered bedrock at 100 cm from the down and middle slopes only two sampling points were established on the up slope at 10 cm and 30 cm owing to the shallow soil layer soil water samples were collected using suction lysimeters at 8 a m under a constant head vacuum of approximately 80 kpa zheng et al 2019 the δ 18o and δd stable isotopes of all water samples were measured using a los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 usa west et al 2010 via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy at johns hopkins university following the international atomic energy agency iaea standard procedure iaea 2009 the results are reported in the standard δ notation craig 1961 and defined relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water as given by the following equation 2 δ d δ 18 o r sample r standard r standard where r represents the isotope ratio of a sample 2h 1h and 18o 16o and rstandard represents the corresponding ratio in a standard form the δ value was expressed in parts per thousand permit the precision of measurement of δd was 0 5 and that of δ 18o was 0 2 at the 2σ criterion the isotopic composition of precipitation is characterized by equilibrium fractionation processes leading to a strong correlation between δ 18o and δd in rainwater this relationship is described by the local meteoric water line lmwl representing the regression line characterized by a slope and intercept between δ 18o and δd in a dual isotope plot sprenger et al 2017 in this study the lmwl during the monitoring period was δd 8 06δ 18o 15 77 r 2 0 95 based on the daily precipitation isotope values the resulting deviation of the water sample from the lmwl was described as the line conditioned excess lc excess as defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 3 lc e x c e s s δ d a δ 18 o b where a and b represent the slope and intercept of the lmwl respectively a 8 06 b 15 77 the slope 8 06 and intercept 15 77 of the lmwl during the monitoring period were larger than those of the global meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 indicating the basic characteristics of the subtropical humid climate region the lc excess indicates the degree of offset of the sampled waters from the lmwl the physical meaning of lc excess is expressed as the degree of deviation of the isotope value in the sample from the lmwl indicating the non equilibrium dynamic fractionation process caused by evaporation landwehr and coplen 2004 because stable isotopes in soil water are enriched by evaporation the average lc excess is usually negative sprenger et al 2017 2 5 young water fraction yw according to the daily variation in δ 18o the sine method was used to compare the amplitude of seasonal variations in the δ 18o values of precipitation runoff and mobile soil water and the degree of damping was used to estimate the transit time rusjan et al 2019 estimation of the mean transit time through tracer cycles and methods such as the lumped convolution approach should be limited to homogeneous catchments for which steady state conditions apply kirchner 2016a therefore we complemented the analysis with a more robust calculation of the yw defined as the fraction of discharge younger than a threshold age of approximately 2 3 months kirchner 2016a the use of yw assumes that the precipitation isotopes at the interannual scale satisfy sinusoidal fluctuations the sin wave model is defined as 4 δ 18 o δ mean 18 a p o r s sin c t θ where δ 18o and δ 18omean are the modeled and the mean annual measured δ 18o values respectively ap or as are the fitted annual amplitudes of precipitation and of the water body respectively c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period θ is the phase lag the yw can be calculated as follows 5 young w a t e r f r a c t i o n y w a s a p 2 6 hydrograph separation in this study we assumed a simple mixing of two end member event water and pre event water to quantify the mixing proportions of rainwater recharging the subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff here the hydrograph refers to the flow into each tipping bucket we used the weighted mean of daily rainfall samples as the event water cevent and the isotope of subsurface runoff and epikasrt runoff on the days before as the pre event water cpre event where the pre event water was defined as one day before the event the respective contributions were calculated using the following equations wang et al 2020 6 c event x event c event 1 x event c pre event where x event is the concentration of water discharge by the event water if the proportion of water source was overestimated the negative estimate was excluded zhao et al 2016 specifically a proportion above 100 was recorded as 100 and a proportion below 0 was recorded as 0 zhao et al 2016 notably we calculated the average event water ratios month scale only based on the mobile water isotope samples from june 1 to november 31 2020 due to the limited number of samples available in 2021 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic and precipitation isotope dynamics during the monitoring period june 2020 to july 2021 the total rainfall amount was 2496 5 mm 85 of which occurred in the wet season april to september fig 3 a september 2020 experienced the highest total rainfall 820 4 mm and daily rainfall 406 3 mm recorded the precipitation events were mainly low intensities with 67 of rainy days having 10 mm d 1 however rainstorms rainfall intensity 50 mm d 1 occurred during the wet season and were the main contributor to rainfall although only nine events 5 with rainfall amounts greater than 50 mm d 1 these events contributed to 42 of the total rainfall during the monitoring period at the annual scale significant seasonal effects were observed in the precipitation δ18o values the precipitation isotope values were more depleted in the wet season average value 7 83 than in the dry season average value 3 35 fig 3a particularly a period of low precipitation isotope values appeared from august to september which was accompanied by frequent high rainfall events in contrast a period of high precipitation isotope values appeared from november to march with low temperatures and drying we then determined the sinusoidal wave of precipitation based on the daily δ18o values as follows 7 δ 18 o 6 46 4 12 sin π t 166 83 183 29 r 2 0 53 n 128 the sinusoidal fluctuation of precipitation δ18o values was approximately one year 366 58 d temperature and evapotranspiration et0 showed strong seasonality fig 3a the average daily temperature and et0 in the dry season october to march were 14 5 and 3 8 mm respectively which were significantly lower than those in the wet season 24 2 and 5 7 mm soil moisture in the dsp average 0 31 cm3 cm 3 was higher than that in the ssp average 0 28 cm3 cm 3 during the monitoring period fig 3c the soil moisture in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season but the variation was higher in the dsp 18 1 and 10 4 at 10 and 30 cm respectively than in ssp 11 3 and 6 2 at 10 and 30 cm respectively surface runoff was low and occurred only during heavy rainstorms especially in the ssp accounting for only 2 2 of total runoff in the ssp but 20 4 in the dsp subsurface and epikarst runoff were the main components of runoff on the karst hillslope with subsurface runoff representing 35 8 and 45 2 of total runoff in the dsp and ssp respectively and epikarst runoff representing 43 8 and 52 6 fig 3b although the flow velocity of epikarst runoff was relatively low its outflow was stable and lasted for a long time particularly under the low rainfall conditions in the dry season fig 3b notably the flow of each runoff component was higher in the dsp than in the ssp indicating that part of the rainwater was not discharged or infiltrated into the deep layer in the ssp 3 2 stable isotope spatiotemporal dynamics the δ18o values of rainwater mobile soil water and runoff showed significant regular sinusoidal fluctuations on the interannual scale indicating strong seasonality to the isotope temporal dynamics fig 4 and table 2 the sinusoidal fluctuation period of the dsp average value 490 3 d was longer than that of the ssp average value 385 4 d and both were higher than that of precipitation 366 d for the dsp the fluctuation period was longer at a depth of 60 cm on the down slope and 100 cm on the middle slope fig 4a and c in contrast the fluctuation period was shorter on the down slope and middle slopes at a depth of 100 cm for the up slope the δ18o values and variation trends at 10 cm and 30 cm in were highly consistent in the ssp and the fluctuation period was shorter than that of the dsp fig 4e and f similar trends were observed in the runoff dynamics the homogeneity between each water medium was relatively weak in the dsp and there was a certain degree of hysteresis the δ18o values of all soil layer and runoff components were more depleted in the wet season than in the dry season table 2 moreover in the down slope and middle slope the δ18o value was more depleted at 0 30 cm than at 60 100 cm whereas the opposite was true in the dry season this reflects the dramatic changes in isotopes at the surface whereas the deeper layer is more stable all δ18o values in the down slope and middle slope in the wet season were more depleted in the dsp except that at 30 cm in the ssp for up slope the wet season δ18o values were most depleted in the ssp whereas the δ18o values in the dry season were the most enriched and closest to rainwater this shows that the rainfall input has a controlling effect on water isotopes in the up slope in contrast δ18o values at 10 cm were more depleted than those at 30 cm in both the wet seasons in the dsp table 2 3 3 young water fraction yw the yw of each water body is shown in table 3 the average yw of mobile soil water was 79 61 with a range of 21 55 100 high yw values occurred in the surface layer 10 30 cm depth especially on the up slope where yw values were 100 at both 10 cm and 30 cm depths the average yw of subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff was much lower than the soil mobile water at 58 25 and 25 48 respectively significant differences were observed in the yw of soil mobile water at each slope position owing to the different soil depths table 3 overall the yw values of mobile soil water were higher in the dsp 82 37 than in the ssp 71 94 this difference was mainly reflected in soil depth of 60 100 cm on the down and middle slopes in particular we observed greater agreement between sinusoidal fitting curves in the soil layer and epikarst runoff in the ssp correspondingly a sinusoid amplitude of 0 9 1 4 exhibited the closest agreement fig 4 and table 3 3 4 water meteoric lines and lc excess the δ18o δd plot of mobile soil water and runoff is presented in fig 5 and the fitting formula was obtained using linear regression the δ18o and δd values of each water sample fell on the lmwl with minimal deviation significant seasonal variations were also observed fig s1 with isotopic values clustered to the lower left corner of the plot during the dry season and to the upper right corner during the wet season the slope and intercept range of the event meteoric water line emwl were 7 16 8 20 and 7 85 15 60 respectively which were slightly less than the corresponding lmwl values indicating that the emwl was partially affected by evaporation fractionation precipitation showed both positive and negative lc excess values fig 6 blue dash line with an average value of 0 02 the lc excess value of each water body was lower than that of precipitation and showed significant p 0 05 seasonal differentiation with an average value of 1 63 in the wet season and 2 45 in the dry season the spatial variation of lc excess was greater in the wet season than in the dry season in particular no significant differences were observed for each depth of the up slope and runoff components in the dry season fig 6c and d for the down slope lc excess values were lower for the surface layer 0 30 cm than the deep layer 60 100 cm in contrast lc excess increased with increasing soil depth in the middle slope for the up slope the divergence was mainly reflected in the wet season with lc excess values lower at 30 cm depth than at 10 cm depth overall the lc excess value of runoff increased in the following order surface runoff subsurface runoff epikarst runoff fig 6d the lc excess values of mobile soil water were affected by soil depth for the down slope at the boundary of 60 cm the lc excess value above 60 cm was significantly higher p 0 05 in the dsp than in the ssp whereas the opposite was observed below 60 cm fig 6a in contrast the distribution trend on the middle slope was the opposite of that on the down slope and the lc excess value was lower in the dsp than in the ssp in the wet season fig 6b for the up slope the lc excess value was significantly higher in the dsp than in the ssp the influence of soil depth on the lc excess value showed no significant difference among runoff components regardless of wet or dry seasons fig 6d 3 5 hydrograph separation according to hydrograph separation the proportion of event water increased and then decreased from summer to winter which was related to the seasonal variation in precipitation and its isotopes fig 7 soil mobile water showed that the proportion of event water increased from the down slope to the up slope and decreased with an increase in soil depth at the profile scale except for the depth of 60 cm on the middle slope 64 45 in the ssp the proportion of event water was much higher on the surface 51 98 than in the deep layer 20 55 the proportion of event water was lower in runoff than in mobile soil water and was concentrated in the range of 0 10 a high proportion of event water occurred during relatively rare high intensity precipitation events fig 7d the proportion of event water was higher in ssp than in dsp both in mobile soil water 34 39 in the dsp and 44 42 in the ssp and runoff components 1 86 in the dsp and 3 05 in the ssp fig 7 the proportion of event water in the middle slope and up slope of the ssp was 43 48 and 81 05 respectively which was substantially higher than that in the dsp 25 14 and 51 85 respectively on the down slope the proportion of event water showed relatively little difference between dsp and ssp and ranged between 41 87 and 61 29 and 7 04 and 21 62 at depths of 0 30 and 60 100 cm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological connectivity via rainwater infiltration and distribution the precipitation isotopes at the study site showed significant sinusoidal fluctuations period one year fig 3a indicating that the distinct seasonal cycles are controlled by regular variation of the moisture source allen et al 2018 2019 liu et al 2014 sánchez murillo et al 2019 compared with the up slope the effect of rainfall isotope input on soil water isotopes was weakened in the down slopes on the up slope the soil water movement was mainly vertical infiltration because of the strong permeability and the water exchange mixing level between rainwater and soil water was low xu et al 2020 on the down slope the vertical flow of the soil part and the lateral subsurface flow mixed with the soil epikarst interface and this portion of the water could be preserved for a long time within the profile fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 thereby weakening the control effect of rainwater on the soil water isotope signal the above results are well supported by our isotopic monitoring in that the subsurface runoff isotope values are closer to those of soil water at the down slope and the proportion of event water and yw in the up slope is higher than that of the down slope the sinusoidal fluctuation period of soil and runoff water isotope essentially reflects the distribution of rainwater after infiltration in the soil epikarst profile the degree of mixing of mobile soil water increases gradually from the up slope to the down slope as can be clearly observed by the amplitude and period of the sinusoidal fluctuations fig 4 this feature reflects the hydrological process differentiation between the sloping and down depression transition zone in the karst peak cluster depression region similar to the riparian zone in non karst area chen et al 2017 pointed out that the vertical flow velocity of the hillslope is comparatively higher than that of the lowland suggesting that hydrological processes operate more rapidly on the up slope than on the down slope soil depths and permeability were negatively correlated and varied with elevation as one of the main influencing factors fu et al 2015 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2022 investigated the soil depth distribution in a small watershed and found that soil depth increased from the up slope to the down slope whereas the soil infiltration capacity decreased moreover compared with the down slope the isotopic hydrologic separation results showed that a higher proportion of new water and young water on the up slope also explained the above phenomenon fig 7 contrary to our traditional understanding the period of fluctuation in the down slope did not increase with the vertical depth of the soil profile especially in the ssp the special water flow path in karst well explains this phenomenon we previously investigated the runoff path at the small catchment scale based on the dye tracing method and found that the water flow was preferentially distributed along the soil bedrock interface or cracks wang et al 2018 because of this rainwater does not reside in the soil matrix and thus fluctuates more slowly this discovery thus deepens our understanding of the deeper unseen karst flow paths the unique rapid hydrological processes of karst hillslopes are well captured by isotopic signals at the horizontal scale of 0 60 cm yw water 2 3 months including mobile soil water from the up slope to down slope surface runoff and subsurface runoff was overwhelmingly dominant average value 79 61 table 3 the higher yw suggest that a large proportion of fast flow components were dominant the young water was mainly the component of precipitation entering rivers via fast flow slope flow and underground lateral flow but not the slow flow component from underground water and deep flow with very old age hu et al 2020 kirchner 2016a calculated the global river average yw 26 moreover in the non karst catchment in the same climate zone as the study area the observed contribution of yw to the river was 21 dai et al 2022 the yw values from the above results were much lower than those in this study 21 61 table 3 and other karst catchments rusjan et al 2019 in view of the travel times the young water could be related to the stream water that follows well developed karst conduits and the diffuse discharge through the fissured and fractured vadose zone of the karst catchments rusjan et al 2019 the above results were also confirmed by the soil event water proportion with the average contributions being as high as 34 and 43 in the dsp and ssp respectively and the event water of the shallow soil 0 30 cm was dominant 50 fig 7 on the contrary in the entisol soil slope of the same climate zone the event water is greater than 50 only when the soil is saturated by heavy rainfall events zhao et al 2016 however we observed that the event water contribution of soil water and runoff could even reach 100 during the extreme rainfall in september zhang et al 2022b on the other hand the lower lc excess value indicates that soil water and runoff were weakly affected by evaporation which indirectly suggests a fast water flow process 4 2 hydrological connectivity via the connection process of runoff this study emphasizes the basic characteristics that karst is dominated by underground hydrological processes fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 wilcox et al 2007 zhang et al 2022a because the total runoff from subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff exceeded 80 in both the wet and dry seasons fig 3 this is markedly different from a non karst region for which one study found that the runoff was dominated by underground runoff only in the high wet environment while surface overland runoff dominated 48 to 94 in the dry sites peng and wang 2012 in addition after the continuous long term monitoring in this study 2006 to 2010 it was found that the surface runoff coefficient was 5 and was not affected by vegetation type chen et al 2012 however there is still a limited understanding of the isotopic characteristics of runoff from epikarst which is the core area distinguishing the karst critical zone from the non karst zone williams 2008 epikarst comprises highly weathered carbonate bedrock immediately beneath the surface of the soil or exposed at the surface williams 2008 the soil epikarst interface can easily generate lateral runoff when the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil bedrock interface resulting in water becoming perched at the soil epikarst interface hartmann et al 2014 parise et al 2015 williams 2008 in this study the isotope values of the epikarst fluctuated significantly after high intensity rainfall events with the proportion of event water suddenly increasing then flattening fig 4h therefore it can be stated that when the soil epikarst system is saturated or nearly saturated the runoff in epikarst is dominated by diffuse flow adji et al 2016 wang et al 2020 and preferential flow is often observed in the early dry environment zhang et al 2022b moreover it was observed that the flow rate of epikarst runoff was stable and could be maintained for a long time even if no effective rainfall event occurred fig 3 this ability to redistribute and store release rainwater is important for vegetation growth and drinking water security in karst regions with low water storage capacity wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a however the direct quantification of water in the epikarst requires further exploration although indirect observations continue to emphasize the role of the epikarst the mixing of mobile soil water mainly occurred down slope below 60 cm which was confirmed by the significantly lower amplitude of the fitting curve of this layer fig 4 the soil epikarst interface 60 cm plays an important role in the distribution of water infiltration and runoff which determines the spatial distribution of mobile soil water isotopes generally a layer of low permeability saprolite forms at the interface between the soil and weathered bedrock blocking the infiltration of rainwater into this layer and producing lateral runoff banks et al 2009 however the soil bedrock interface in karst areas is not well defined because the soil layer is shallow and bedrock is frequently exposed to the surface zhang et al 2022a nevertheless lateral subsurface flow is commonly observed at the soil epikarst interface fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 wilcox et al 2007 2008 our previous studies explored the mechanism of subsurface runoff generation through rainfall simulations and hydrometric monitoring subsurface runoff meets the fill and spill theory where the prerequisite is that the infiltration of rainwater exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil epikarst interface fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 in this study the above theory was confirmed through mobile water isotope monitoring and further restricted the location to slope positions with a relatively thick soil layer 4 3 critical zone structure hydrological connectivity relationship influence of soil depth on soil water and runoff isotopes the latest results in the monitoring plots show that soil depth has a first order controlling effect on the relationship between rainfall and runoff wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a here the possible influence of soil depth on the mechanism of isotope variation is discussed in order to provide new insights into hydrological processes on karst hillslopes the sinusoidal fluctuation period of mobile soil water was shorter in the ssp than in the dsp fig 4 and table 3 and the fluctuation range of isotope values was wider in the ssp than in the dsp this means that when rainwater infiltrates the soil layer it is relatively well mixed in the thicker soil layers and more easily permeates through the shallow soil layers this can be explained by differences in the soil infiltration capacity which determine how water moves in the soil profile soils in the ssp could be characterized by high infiltration capacity and discontinuous spatial coverage which increases the possibility of preferential flow wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a from research in the shale hills watershed lin 2006 suggested that preferential flow is more likely to be generated in shallow soil than in thick soil areas buttle et al 2000 summarized that infiltration excess runoff is the main runoff generation in bedrock outcrops whereas macropore preferential flow dominates the soil bedrock interface runoff in shallow soil areas isotopic hydrograph separation effectively supported the above results as shown by the higher proportion of event water in the ssp than in the dsp fig 7 wang et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022a reported similar results however they only considered runoff and did not consider soil water although only runoff was considered the mechanisms of mobile soil water and runoff are consistent a shallow soil layer together with the lack of storage in catchments leads to the dominance of event water during storms cras et al 2007 rainwater preserved in the soil profile also returns to the atmosphere as a gas which is affected by evapotranspiration and isotopes are effective for capturing the amount of water subjected to evaporative fractionation sprenger et al 2017 evaporation causes kinetic fractionation of the composition of stable isotopes in residual water craig et al 1963 which in visual representation deviate to the lower right corner of the lmwl in the δ18o δd plot resulting in the slope and intercept that are lower than the lmwl however the difference in the emwl was small for each water body the mobile soil water collected in this study was typically replenished by recent rain and whether it is sufficiently mixed with previously retained water depends on complex environmental factors some studies have also shown significant differences in isotopic composition between mobile and non mobile bulk soil water sprenger et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 therefore simply observing the slope of the emwl cannot effectively reveal whether the mobile soil water isotope is affected by kinetic fractionation however the mobile soil water is not immune to evaporative fractionation for example sprenger et al 2017 found that evaporation fractionation within peatland drainage networks affects the isotopic signal of headwater catchments which calls into question the common assumption in hydrological modeling that the isotopic composition of stream waters does not undergo fractionation processes similarly the results in this study based on lc excess values indicate that mobile water is more strongly affected by evaporative fractionation in the dry season than in the wet season fig 6 although the deviation signal of lc excess values was as strong as that of bulk soil water luo et al 2019 the average lc excess value was smaller in the ssp indicating a relatively strong kinetic fractionation in the dry season when there is less precipitation mobile water gradually decreases with soil drying and is vulnerable to evaporation luo et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 thus for the ssp pore water is more likely to be lost during the dry season because of its relatively weak retention capacity which makes water molecules more susceptible to evaporative fractionation sprenger et al 2015 interestingly contrary to expectations it was found that yw water and event water at depths of 60 cm and 100 cm were lower in the ssp than in the dsp table 3 and fig 4 the above phenomena can be explained by the differences in confluence area and water storage space based on the bedrock topography first in terms of the runoff generation process the flat terrain of dsp leads to a large and continuous confluence area making it easier to generate surface runoff beven et al 1984 the twi reflects the spatial distribution of the confluence area as shown in fig 8 in the dsp high twi areas easy to saturate and generate runoff are continuously distributed from the middle up slope to the down slope and the terrain is flat however high twi areas are mainly concentrated in the middle slope and edges in the ssp which indicates that the confluence area may extend beyond the range of the plot we used a heavy rainfall event as an example 42 8 mm beginning at 22 00 and ending at 04 00 and observed the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture to indicate changes in the saturation zone fig 9 the dsp s larger confluence area allows saturation zones to form downhill at the beginning of the rainfall in ssp there is less variation in soil moisture and more rainwater can be received before the saturated zone forms on the other hand the larger bedrock water storage area of the ssp plays an important role in water redistribution due to its rugged bedrock topography water infiltration in the epikarst zone is not lost quickly due to the low permeability 3 cm h 1 of the bedrock fu et al 2016 the more complex topography means more space for underground water storage thus increasing the time for water migration enabling ample mixing and exchange between event and prevent water brkić et al 2018 kogovšek and petrič 2014 rusjan et al 2019 the above results can be validated by the observed changes in epikarst moisture over a long time series august 2015 to may 2016 using a meter buried at the soil epikarst interface in the dsp and ssp fig 10 through the two way anova analysis of the moisture at the soil epikarst interface during the monitoring period it was found that the moisture of ssp was significant p 0 001 n 2729 higher than that of dsp which was contrary to the results of soil layer 0 30 cm fig 3 it further confirmed that rainwater from ssp penetrates to the low permeability bedrock surface and can maintain a high water condition the two time scale processes mentioned above are consistent because a large amount of surface runoff is rapidly discharged in the dsp during rainfall figs 9 and 10 and the relatively small area of bedrock water storage results in a relatively weak water supply capacity accordingly based on knowing the role of the water reservoir in the soil epikarst interface in the early stage fu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 this study emphasizes that this role is more prominent in the ssp from the perspective of water security and sustainable use water is important for vegetation or animals in the face of drought stress furthermore it is necessary to accurately quantify the critical zone structure of plots with different soil depths through geophysical methods however there is also an urgent need to quantify moisture in the epikarst zone similar to the weathered bedrock layer in non karst areas and clarify its relationship with vegetation rempe and dietrich 2018 here we reassess the practical significance of rainfall runoff threshold behavior which is a fundamental indicator of hydrological connectivity in complex karst areas our previous study showed that the rainfall threshold of surface runoff in dsp 45 mm was larger than that in ssp 40 mm zhang et al 2022a this method homogenizes the hillslope and although the effect of soil depth on water storage is shown the effects of topographic spatial heterogeneity are weakened we also previously found that the surface and bedrock topographic wetness index were associated at a higher degree in the ssp 34 than in the dsp 3 figs s2 and s3 zhang et al 2022a a high degree of coupling between soil depth and bedrock means that they affect runoff generation in a combinatory manner which agrees with findings in previous experimental plots and small watersheds freer et al 2002 hutchinson and moore 2000 peters et al 1995 tani 1997 through further analyses in this study we found that the spatial heterogeneity of bedrock topography caused differentiation of the hillslope confluence area which further affected the formation of the spatial saturation zone fig 9 from the perspective of the runoff mechanism the rainfall runoff threshold reflects the surface runoff generated by saturation excess while the surface runoff of the karst hillslope is generally associated with infiltration excess and saturation excess of the area wang et al 2018 the high surface runoff in dsp is likely due to the large confluence area and weak permeability which increase runoff from the infiltration excess component during rainfall especially during high intensity rainfall events zhang et al 2022b in contrast the greater soil infiltration capacity and bedrock water storage capacity in the ssp make it difficult to generate surface runoff 2 table 1 and almost all of the rainwater seeps down or is stored in the epikarst fu et al 2016 the simple rainfall runoff plot can obscure the impact of runoff generation processes to some extent therefore it is necessary to utilize references with varying methodologies and scales to understand these complex karst hillslope hydrological processes this study then constructed a conceptual model for runoff components according to soil depth in a karst hillslope and integrated the results over two representative profiles based on previous studies fig 11 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a first the structural differentiation leads to differences in runoff composition in the dsp and ssp in the dsp the surface intercepts more rainwater in the form of surface runoff 20 4 which results in limited distribution into the soil epikarst zone relatively speaking the ssp can be characterized by discontinuous soil cover frequent bedrock outcrops a strong soil infiltration capacity but weak permeability of weathered bedrock and large underground water storage space fig 9a zhang et al 2022a these structural features make the soil epikarst interface play a more prominent role in water storage secondly the influence of soil depth is emphasized from the perspective of hydrological connectivity rainwater from the up slope is connected to the low lying area through the soil epikarst interface the shallow soil layer accelerates the hydrological process of the soil layer but enhances the water storage of the epikarst because the shallow soil layer has more underground water storage space various water bodies are fully mixed and exhibit delayed discharge resulting in a lower proportion of young water fraction in mobile soil in the down slope at 60 cm depth than in the deep soil layer these results provide a new perspective for understanding the structure and hydrological connectivity of the karst hillslope critical zone 5 conclusion this study provides a unique insight into the hydrological connectivity of the hillslope critical zone in karst areas of southwest china the unique rapid hydrological processes of karst hillslopes were well captured by isotopic signals at the horizontal scale of 0 60 cm the young water fraction was overwhelmingly dominant average value 79 61 indicating that a large proportion of fast flow components dominant the total runoff from subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff exceeded 80 and deep infiltration was the main runoff component of karst it was found that the soil epikarst interface 60 cm plays an important role in the distribution of water infiltration and runoff which determining the connection position and flow path of runoff on the hillslope moreover the critical zone structure differentiated by soil depth plays an important role in controlling the hydrological connectivity although shallow soil allows rainwater to infiltrate almost entirely into the soil epikarst the rugged bedrock topography and its low permeability lead to a larger water storage area in the soil epikarsat interface thus extending the water renewal rate and supply time accordingly these results help us understand the role of epikarst in hydrological regulation and water storage in the karst critical zone credit authorship contribution statement jun zhang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft investigation hongsong chen

al 2020 for these models it is particularly important to improve the simulation efficiency while ensuring the simulation accuracy considering the timeliness of pollutant research and water environment management the environment fluid dynamics code efdc mike storm water management model swmm and qual2k are the most widely used water environment models worldwide chen et al 2014 guan et al 2019 mu et al 2019 sun et al 2022 taghizadeh et al 2021 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 xu et al 2012 used mike21 to construct a two dimensional model of eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs and analysed eutrophication in the study area under different scenarios kim et al 2017 used the efdc to simulate algal bloom patterns in the lower reaches of the seoul han river qual series models exhibit similar characteristics to those of the swmm wu et al 2022 dalun and abdullah 2021 used the qual2k model to predict the effects of leachate and other pollutants in the sarawak river and its main tributaries these models cannot be employed to achieve high efficiency and high precision water environment simulations involving large river areas with complex terrain although the above water environment numerical models are widely used in water environment simulation evaluations studies under different conditions one dimensional water quality models such as the swmm and qual2k model are applicable when simulating well mixed interval water environmental processes however accurate simulation of most regional water environmental processes requires an accurate description of local hydraulic conditions warren et al 2005 although the efdc and mike model provide the function of water environment simulation a high precision and high efficiency cannot simultaneously be realized with the efdc in the simulation of large area complex terrain rivers graphics process unit gpu acceleration technology has been adopted for the mike model but its key function entails hydrodynamic simulation the capacity of the model in regard to the simulation of the mutual physical and chemical reaction of various water quality variables is limited the code modifiability is also important for the further development of models and the customization of water environment models for specific areas at present the existing water environment quality model must be further studied which could maintain the calculation accuracy and greatly reduce the calculation time without reducing the spatial resolution when simulating the water quality of large scale complex terrain rivers the main purpose of this study was to develop a high resolution comprehensive water quality model based on the gpu acceleration technique considering the above model problems we achieved efficient and high precision simulation of river water environment processes in large scale complex terrains with the compute unified device architecture cuda parallel computing architecture and advanced model algorithms were adopted for model programming the established model fully coupled two dimensional surface water dynamics and the accompanying pollutant evolution process and a process driven model framework for the transport attenuation of multicomponent pollutants and their interaction was established which could be adjusted and updated at any time in regard to the number of water quality variables and equation forms the accuracy of the model in the simulation of the pure reaction process and the transport and reaction process of pollutants was verified against an analytical solution finally the water quality of the xidagou river in yinchuan under different scenarios was evaluated and analysed by using the validated high resolution comprehensive water quality model the model developed in this paper could provide a suitable tool for deeper research on the water environment and water ecology and the treatment of black and odorous water bodies the model could likely play a guiding role in future urban and watershed water environment governance and evaluation provide a scientific basis for the mitigation of black and odorous water bodies and offer effective decision support for the formulation of water cycle water quality planning and management policies 2 model structure the model mainly includes a high efficiency and high precision hydrodynamic module and a comprehensive water quality

34 c en c e 0 k 5 c e 0 d t h 0 h n the discrete format of the convection diffusion equation is the same as that of the two dimensional driving equation and the above equations for each water quality variable are interrelated at each time step the above equations were solved in turn the courant friedrichs lewy cfl value is 0 5 and the numerical simulation time step is short so the above equations could be solved via the finite difference method first the water temperature equation was solved followed by those for algae zooplankton total phosphorus ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen nitrate nitrogen dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod e coli and degradable or nondegradable substances the submodels for each water quality variable above were substituted into the two dimensional convective diffusion equation the boundary conditions of each equation were t 0 and c n c 0 and the submodels were sequentially solved according to equations 18 28 c n denotes the pollutant concentration at a given moment and c 0 denotes the pollutant concentration at zero time because the water temperature equation considers multiple factors the water temperature was temporarily set to a certain value 2 3 gpu acceleration techniques gpu acceleration technology the use of graphics rendering devices adopts its multithreading advantage to achieve the concurrent execution of a large number of data task calculations and the computation speed is 5 10 times that of a comparable cpu smith and liang 2013 liang et al 2016 to improve the computational efficiency of the model the model implements gpu parallel computing technology through autonomous programming in the cuda language to achieve high speed computing the gpu accelerated two dimensional hydrodynamic model realized an acceleration effect vielding a computation speed 23 88 to 158 72 times higher than that provided by cpu technology in the simulation of the urban rainfall process under different scenarios huo 2018 gong jia hui et al 2020 therefore gpu technology provides significant advantages in parallel computing tasks with a large amount of computation based on the advantages of gpu acceleration technology the model employed in this study realized the large scale parallel calculation of various hydraulic elements in high precision large scale terrain via programming to solve the above two dimensional shallow water equation in cuda and c fig 3 shows the gpu acceleration technology process 3 model validation to verify the accuracy of the model in the simulation of the physical and mutual reaction processes of multiple water quality variables a square with a side length of 50 m and a bottom slope of 0 was constructed as an ideal terrain element to ensure the attenuation reaction of pollutants under hydrostatic conditions and the simulation results were analyzed and compared to the analytical solution described in section 2 2 to verify the model behavior a regular ditch topography was constructed to simulate the transformation pattern of the pollutant concentration in complex flow regimes and the results were validated against the calculation results of a two dimensional steady state water quality model to verify the model stability the model performance in managing the diffusion term was fully verified shi et al 2020 therefore the model validation was only based on the reaction process of each water quality variable 3 1 ideal terrain calculation case 3 1 1 model parameter settings a square with a side length of 50 m was constructed as ideal terrain and the grid accuracy was 0 5 m considering a uniform structural grid with a total of 10 000 cells the simulation area was surrounded by a solid wall boundary the point source pollutant location was defined at x 25 m y 25 m with a concentration of 1 mg l the initial water depth was 3 m the water quality parameters used to calculate point source pollutant concentration changes over time are given in table 2 the cfl value was 0 5 the simulation duration was 10 h and the output file exhibited a step of 1 min in the process of model parameter setting the saturated do concentration was calculated according to a water temperature of 25 c and the concentration reached 8 2686 mg l the remaining parameters were obtained according to the corresponding normative value ranges parameters with notable value range changes were set to 0 and values with an unspecified range were obtained from the literature the parameter values and ranges are listed in table 2 3 1 2 results and discussion a comparison of the numerical and analytical solutions for the mutual reaction between the comprehensive water quality variables in a static water flow field is shown in fig 4 to illustrate the consistency between the numerical and analytical solutions of the model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was used for analysis and the nse coefficient can be calculated with equation 35 35 e 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 in the formula q 0 refers to the analytical value q m refers to the analogue value q t refers to the value at time t and q 0 refers to the total average of the observed values it could be determined that the nse of all water quality variables were all approximately equal to 1 which indicates that the model attains a satisfactory accuracy in simulating the pure reaction process fig 4 shows the variation process of the water quality variable concentrations based on the model simulation results and analytical solution most water quality variables exhibited a decreasing or increasing trend except do the ca and no3 n concentrations gradually increased over time the increase rate of the former indicated an increasing trend while that of the latter exhibited the opposite trend the z po4 3 p nh3 n no2 n bod and ce concentration decreased with increasing time the po4 3 p and no2 n concentration increased at a lower rate and the increase in no2 n was more obvious the concentration reduction rates of all water quality variables decreased it should be noted that the do concentration gradually increased over time the increase rate gradually declined thereby reaching a peak within approximately two hours and the saturated do concentration fluctuated the do concentration can significantly impact natural microbial communities and diversity which in turn can affect the degradation and utilization of organic matter johannsson et al 2021 the reduction in do is also a key factor in water quality deterioration and physical reoxygenation metabolism and water temperature are critical for the accurate simulation of river do dynamics jankowski et al 2021 therefore for space reasons do concentration variation patterns given focus in this paper the initial do concentration was set to 1 mg l and the saturated do concentration was 8 26855 mg l based on equation 20 it could be found that the reoxygenation rate k 2 and saturated do concentration os imposed the greatest effects on the change in the do concentration when the do concentration was low os o increased so the reoxygenation rate was higher with a value of 7 3548 mg l at 1 h with increasing do concentration os o decreased and the increase rate of the do concentration thus declined at 5 h the do concentration exceeded the saturated do concentration os and os o became negative therefore the increase in the do concentration was limited however the concentration did not remain at 8 26855 mg l indicating that do was simultaneously affected by other water quality variables accordingly the do concentration exhibited a gradual rising trend within 10 h the prediction accuracy of the do concentration was generally poor when the effects of other water quality variables were considered because the calculation errors of the other water quality variables affected the do prediction results keupers and willems 2017 however compared to the analytical solution the nse coefficient of the do concentration predicted via model simulation was still close to 1 which is the inevitable result of an effective model this case indicates that the model initially successfully established a model framework for the transport attenuation and mutual reaction of multicomponent pollutants and could accurately and efficiently simulate the internal process of action between do and various water quality variables and algae growth the parameters of this case were randomly obtained within a reasonable range based on the code modifiability a corresponding exclusive model could be established for the development of water ecological processes in unique regions which highlights the independent research and development advantages of the proposed model 3 2 ditch topography calculation case the pure reaction process of water quality variables is usually adopted as the simulation focus in the study of the water quality mechanism process by using a water environment numerical model however this is completely contrary to the real flow state of most rivers namely water moves under turbulence detailed hydraulic characteristics are needed to accurately simulate the physical and chemical reaction processes of water quality variables such as do within a given water system hutchins et al 2021 when the pure reaction processes of the water quality model and high resolution hydrodynamic evolution model are fully coupled the accuracy and efficiency of the coupled model in the simulation of the water environment are the key problems that must be addressed to verify the model accuracy in turbulent state water environment simulations this paper selected a regular ditch case to simulate the transformation process of water quality variables the terrain length is 200 m the bottom width is 5 5 m the slope coefficient is 1 5 the manning coefficient is 0 015 s m1 3 the slope drop is 1 3 000 and the upstream inflow is 1 7 m3 s there is no tributary water flows from the left boundary the right boundary is defined as an open boundary and the remaining boundaries are closed boundaries the topographic resolution is 0 1 m with a total of 266 000 uniform structure grids adopting bod5 as the simulated water quality variable the attenuation coefficient reached 2 d 1 and the upstream water quality category was employed as a quasi iv standard notably the initial concentration in the whole section is 6 mg l and the cfl value is 0 5 the length of the 200 m length trench scale increased 100 times and the attenuation coefficient increased in the same proportion notably the calculation results of the model in the above complex flow field were compared to the analysis results of the two dimensional steady water quality model with an actual distance of 20 km to more effectively verify the model stability in the calculation the diffusion attenuation reaction process of pollutants under complex flow patterns 3 2 1 two dimensional steady state water quality model the two dimensional steady state water quality model can be expressed as equation 36 the data obtained with the model were used as measured values and compared to the calculation results of the high resolution comprehensive water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology 36 c x y exp k x 86400 u c 0 c p q p h π m y x u 1 2 exp u y 2 4 m y x exp u 2 b y 2 4 m y x in the above c x y is the pollutant concentration at the discharge port mg l x is the distance of the calculation point from the outfall m y is the distance of the calculation point from the shore where the outfall is located km b is the river width m h is the average water depth of the river m u is the river flow velocity m s c 0 is the concentration of pollutants upstream of the outfall mg l q p is the wastewater discharge from the outfall m3 s c p is the effluent concentration at the outfall mg l m y is the transverse diffusion coefficient m2 s and k is the water quality degradation factor d 1 the parameters of the two dimensional steady state water quality model were consistent with those of the high resolution water quality model based on gpu technology and the specific values are provided in table 3 3 2 2 results and discussion because the actual ditch is shorter and there occurs a hydrodynamic deficiency zone on the bank the concentration value is lower and the concentration at the center of each ditch was therefore selected as the simulation value the average flow velocity and water depth in the simulated section were basically consistent with those determined with the two dimensional steady state water quality model and the simulation effect was satisfactory fig 5 shows the simulation and measured bod5 concentration in different river sections the difference between the simulated and measured water concentrations in each section the absolute error interval was less than 0 2 mg l the relative error remained within 6 and the nse coefficient reached 0 984 the simulation results suitably matched the measured results the two dimensional steady state water quality model is a model without time variables which can only describe the water quality in the equilibrium state however natural rivers are often irregular although the model constructed in this example involved a regular channel the length of the 200 m channel in this model was used to simulate the length of the 20 km channel in the two dimensional steady state water quality model in regard to the two dimensional hydrodynamic model this could inevitably generate a certain error from the downstream flow pattern close to the boundary because the river channel is short and the upstream boundary flow is a constant value the river flow evolution process determined with the two dimensional hydrodynamic model is realistic this also indicates that the model remains stable in the simulation of flood routing and its accompanying pollutant transport reaction process in high resolution terrain as shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic conditions on both sides of the river were often weak which could also yield different water quality concentrations within the same section different points within the same section could exhibit different water concentrations that could be ignored in whole river water environment analysis however this phenomenon must be considered when fine simulations of wide and shallow rivers and precise pollution prevention and control are implemented the observed simulation error of 6 is completely acceptable when the water concentration in the middle section is compared to that obtained with the two dimensional steady water quality model because the water flow simulated by the model is not uniform the first order attenuation coefficient of pollutants is approximately 0 3 d when river pollutants are not subjected to artificial reduction measures such as ecological floating islands but the model validation process is described in this part to better assess the simulation results the attenuation coefficient was set to 2 d based on the simulation results the farther away from the initial section the lower the bod5 concentration was and without exogenous pollution the bod5 concentration reached approximately 4 mg l at 12 km from the initial section this also completely agrees with the actual physical change process fig 6 shows a two dimensional cloud chart of the bod5 concentration change at different times and various sections to ensure a better comparison of the simulation results to the calculation results of the two dimensional steady state model the concentration in the whole river section was set to the initial concentration at zero time at 6 mg l the water quality concentration downstream of the river began to decrease over time the water flow reached a steady state close to 600 s and there occurred no significant change in the water quality concentration at each simulated point which matches the simulated value of the pollutant concentration in each river section in the actual state it should be noted that the bod5 concentration could differ among different cells within the same section in the simulation of two dimensions at a high resolution this is also consistent with the rules mentioned in the previous paragraph the main reason for the gradual decrease in the downstream pollutant concentration was the given attenuation coefficient when upstream pollutants evolve downstream under a constant concentration the farther away from the upstream section the longer the time needed is pollutant concentrations continue to decline due to first order attenuation the upstream flow is constant and the river section is uniform so the velocity and water depth in each section basically remain unchanged the linear inverse relationship between the distance from the initial section and the pollutant concentration can be attributed to the fixed time from upstream to downstream and the river water quality concentration remains stable at 600 s this case verifies that the high resolution two dimensional hydrodynamic model could be used to efficiently simulate the change process of the river water quality which could reveal the spatial and temporal distributions of the river water quality in real time with notable intuition and clarity and the calculation results can be presented to decision makers 4 model application one of the main causes of black water and odour in urban rivers is the direct discharge of sewage combined with overflow pollution load into rivers luo et al 2021 narin et al 2022 this high concentration pollution source could significantly impact the river water quality which could lead to continuous water quality deterioration in urban rivers resulting in black and odorous water bodies mailhot et al 2015 therefore to address the black water and odour phenomenon of urban water the remediation of urban sewage direct discharge and combined overflow pollution must be considered this example involves the application of the model in the simulation and evaluation of the water environment of rivers in yinchuan city the effects of the tail water load of a sewage treatment plant and combined overflow pollution load on river water environment changes on dry and rainy days were simulated 4 1 regional overview to assess the application effect of the high resolution comprehensive water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology xidagou which is the receiving body of the second sewage treatment plant in yinchuan was used as the ditch in the simulation process the bottom width is 8 m the side slope coefficient is 1 5 the hydraulic slope drop is 1 5 000 the comprehensive manning coefficient is 0 025 and the length is 5 km to obtain a detailed and physics based hydrodynamic water quality change process the topography was divided into a uniform grid with a resolution of 0 2 m entailing a total of 350 000 calculation cells and the cfl value was set to 0 5 the upstream water flow is 1 7 m3 s and the water quality was calculated according to the worst water quality situation quasi class iv xidagou mainly receives pollution from the tailwater of the second sewage treatment plant during the dry season and average daily tailrace water volume and water quality monitoring data of the plant for 2021 were used to represent the tailwater entering xidagou during the dry season the flow rate was 0 61 m3 s the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration was 20 84 mg l and the nh3 n concentration was 0 89 mg l based on pipe network data the swmm was used to calculate the overflow flow and pollutant concentration at the overflow mouth to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation process of the river water environment under the most hazardous conditions in the study area this paper chose the maximum single day rainfall scenario in the typical year as the simulation condition the one day rainfall reached 40 1 mm according to the obtained inflow data during the rainy season the flow rate was 2 74 m3 s the cod concentration reached 370 26 mg l and the nh3 n concentration was 186 13 mg l as the focus of this study is the establishment of a high resolution water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology the calculation process of the overflow and surface source pollutant load is not described in detail here the drainage system topology in the study area is shown in fig 7 4 2 parameter calibration 4 2 1 source of measured data average nh3 n monitoring data for june and july 2021 were employed as measured values at three monitoring points in xidagou during the dry season the do concentrations in the upper middle and downstream sections were 9 62 9 45 and 7 96 mg l respectively the cod concentrations reached 180 24 160 54 and 47 28 mg l respectively the nh3 n concentrations were 0 31 0 23 and 0 2 mg l respectively the monitoring data used in this study were obtained from yinchuan black and odorous water supervision and dispatching systems 4 2 2 parameter calibration and results the detailed hydraulic state determines the accuracy of the water quality model based on the above basic data the hydrodynamic and water quality modules of the model were employed the water quality module includes the influence of the attenuation reaction process of various water quality variables on the river transmission process due to insufficient monitoring data and the fact that pollution degradation is mainly affected by the adsorption capacity of artificial purification measures such as river banks and ecological floating islands the interaction among the different water quality factors slightly affected the water concentration therefore the first order attenuation reaction terms of do cod and nh3 n were mainly calibrated in this example fig 8 shows a comparison between the simulation results and measured values of the water quality in the ditch section the simulated do concentrations at 0 1 and 5 km from the initial section are 9 6220 9 458 and 7 636 mg l respectively the simulated cod concentrations reached 180 238 160 638 and 47 869 mg l respectively and the simulated nh3 n concentrations were 0 3135 0 225 and 0 2 mg l respectively the simulated values of the water quality variables do cod and nh3 n basically matched the measured values indicating that the model parameters provided a high accuracy in the river reach 1 km from the initial section the attenuation coefficients of do cod and nh3 n were 0 46 3 00 and 8 64 d 1 respectively the attenuation coefficients within the river reach before 1 and 5 km from the initial section were 1 12 7 92 and 0 65 d 1 respectively a two dimensional cloud map of the sectional water quality concentration is shown in fig 9 as water flowed downstream due to the attenuation reaction of the water quality variables the concentrations of the water quality variables downstream were all lower than those upstream which conforms to the actual physical change trend 4 3 analysis of simulation results a model boundary data file was generated including time varying flow and concentration data according to the detailed water quantity and water quality data provided by the swmm and upstream monitoring data by simulating the process of water environment change in xidagou during the dry and rainy seasons the variation in the sectional concentration was obtained as shown in fig 10 the convective diffusion process of pollutants into the river from the drainage point to 200 m downstream was simulated fig 11 shows the two dimensional convective diffusion process of the cod load in the tail water and overflow upon discharge into the river channel as shown in fig 10 both the cod and nh3 n concentrations decreased due to convective diffusion and decayed as the water flow advanced downstream the initial section of the river exhibited a cod concentration of 30 mg l and an nh3 n concentration of 1 5 mg l and the values 500 m from the initial section were 27 53 and 1 334 mg l respectively with the flow of water downstream the concentrations at 5000 m from the initial section after attenuation reached 26 775 and 1 311 mg l respectively considering the discharge of overflow water and pollutants into xidagou the cod and nh3 n concentration after mixing at 500 m from the initial section were 239 367 and 114 955 mg l respectively however as water flowed downstream the concentrations at a distance of 5000 m from the initial section reached 232 803 and 113 025 mg l respectively due to attenuation as shown in fig 11 the cod concentration in tail water was lower than the initial concentration in the river during the dry season after the tail water of the second sewage treatment plant was discharged into the receiving water body therefore the pollutants stemming from tailwater discharge entered the river and tail water and river water were gradually mixed via convection and diffusion resulting in a reduction in cod emission in the downstream section of the discharge which could achieve the effect of water replenishment and purification the results reported by cui et al 2020 are the same as the simulation results reasonable planning of the tail water discharge path after sewage treatment plant treatment is of great significance to realize water quality improvement sewage reuse constitutes an alternative water source to solve water shortages and reduce water pollution loads tail water originating from sewage treatment plants could be used to supplement ornamental ponds and lakes in parks maintain or increase river flow and dilute pollutant concentrations in black and odorous river sections however combined sewer overflow pollution is indeed a major environmental problem recognized by many countries a 2015 in the case of heavy rain rainwater flows into the combined sewer system and subsequently enters the sewage treatment plant water bodies can become polluted as excess sewage with high concentrations of pollutants is directly discharged into nearby receiving water bodies when the capacity of sewage treatment plants is reached this causes black and odorous water bodies if the receiving water bodies exhibit insufficient hydrodynamics the two dimensional simulation results demonstrate that the cod concentration at the overflow outlet was higher than that upstream of the river during the rainy season after pollutant discharge into the river the concentration downstream of the discharge rapidly increased which severely impacted the water quality downstream because the combined overflow pollution exhibits the characteristics of a short discharge time large water volume and high pollutant concentration the model simulation results also directly reflect the water quality change process in each section after pollution discharge from the sewage outlet into the river this suggests that accurate simulation and evaluation of the temporal and spatial distributions of combined overflow pollution can provide an important reference value for pollution prevention and control work in summary the established high resolution comprehensive water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology achieved a satisfactory simulation effect in terms of the water environment change process after tail water and overflow pollution load enter the receiving water body and the simulation results agreed with the actual physical change trend the preliminary conclusion is that the model simulation results could provide basic data for the formulation of dynamic water quality management measures evaluation and analysis of water quality data water pollution early warning water environment management evaluation of the water quality status during a certain period and prediction and analysis of the impact of water environment change it should be mentioned that the model on the adopted rtx3070d computer needed only 0 12 h to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality evolution process involving 35 000 cells within 5 h 5 conclusions in this study the cuda based parallel computing architecture was adopted to establish a multicomponent pollutant migration attenuation and interaction model framework then a high performance integrated water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology coupled with efficient and high precision hydrodynamics was proposed the accuracy and stability of the model were verified by employing static and dynamic ideal cases and the model was applied in water environment simulation and urban inland river assessment the main conclusions are as follows 1 the analytical solution of the interaction between static and dynamic water quality variables under ideal conditions was compared to the results obtained with the two dimensional steady state water quality model the nse coefficients were all above 0 9 and the model achieved suitable stability and accuracy in simulating the interaction process of the water quality variables 2 the simulation results obtained considering the yinchuan ditch were basically consistent with the measured values and the proposed model could accurately simulate the water environment change process of the receiving water body during both the dry and rainy seasons the model could be used as an effective tool by relevant departments to make decisions on water environmental governance projects and could likely provide technical support for the development of water environment management measures 3 due to the cuda parallel programming approach the model needed only 0 12 h to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality evolution process involving 35 000 cells over 5 h in addition this model includes the following shortcomings 1 further model validation is needed based on a large amount of measured data 2 the complex water temperature suspended matter and sediment adsorption desorption and sedimentary rock modules were not considered in the model therefore in the subsequent model development process the calculation method should be verified and corrected through a large number of experiments and the model function should be further improved based on the model framework constructed in this study finally an efficient and high precision hydrodynamic water quality coupling model for the integration of the simulation of the water environment processes of urban and surrounding river basins will be developed by considering the advantages of the independent research and development model credit authorship contribution statement

2369,the study of the temporal and spatial evolution of pollutants in modern water bodies and river water quality management largely depend on river water quality models these models are usually

validated high resolution comprehensive water quality model and the numerical results of two dimensional pollutant transport were explored on the adopted rtx3070d computer only 0 12 h were needed to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality evolution process involving 350 000 cells with 5 h model settings the model achieved a high operation speed and high calculation accuracy and could effectively simulate predict and evaluate various complex water environment problems this study provides a reliable tool for further research on the water environment and water ecology and the treatment of black and odorous water bodies keywords hydrodynamic water quality coupling model transport process and mutual reaction gpu acceleration techniques high efficiency and precision data

al 2020 for these models it is particularly important to improve the simulation efficiency while ensuring the simulation accuracy considering the timeliness of pollutant research and water environment management the environment fluid dynamics code efdc mike storm water management model swmm and qual2k are the most widely used water environment models worldwide chen et al 2014 guan et al 2019 mu et al 2019 sun et al 2022 taghizadeh et al 2021 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 xu et al 2012 used mike21 to construct a two dimensional model of eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs and analysed eutrophication in the study area under different scenarios kim et al 2017 used the efdc to simulate algal bloom patterns in the lower reaches of the seoul han river qual series models exhibit similar characteristics to those of the swmm wu et al 2022 dalun and abdullah 2021 used the qual2k model to predict the effects of leachate and other pollutants in the sarawak river and its main tributaries these models cannot be employed to achieve high efficiency and high precision water environment simulations involving large river areas with complex terrain although the above water environment numerical models are widely used in water environment simulation evaluations studies under different conditions one dimensional water quality models such as the swmm and qual2k model are applicable when simulating well mixed interval water environmental processes however accurate simulation of most regional water environmental processes requires an accurate description of local hydraulic conditions warren et al 2005 although the efdc and mike model provide the function of water environment simulation a high precision and high efficiency cannot simultaneously be realized with the efdc in the simulation of large area complex terrain rivers graphics process unit gpu acceleration technology has been adopted for the mike model but its key function entails hydrodynamic simulation the capacity of the model in regard to the simulation of the mutual physical and chemical reaction of various water quality variables is limited the code modifiability is also important for the further development of models and the customization of water environment models for specific areas at present the existing water environment quality model must be further studied which could maintain the calculation accuracy and greatly reduce the calculation time without reducing the spatial resolution when simulating the water quality of large scale complex terrain rivers the main purpose of this study was to develop a high resolution comprehensive water quality model based on the gpu acceleration technique considering the above model problems we achieved efficient and high precision simulation of river water environment processes in large scale complex terrains with the compute unified device architecture cuda parallel computing architecture and advanced model algorithms were adopted for model programming the established model fully coupled two dimensional surface water dynamics and the accompanying pollutant evolution process and a process driven model framework for the transport attenuation of multicomponent pollutants and their interaction was established which could be adjusted and updated at any time in regard to the number of water quality variables and equation forms the accuracy of the model in the simulation of the pure reaction process and the transport and reaction process of pollutants was verified against an analytical solution finally the water quality of the xidagou river in yinchuan under different scenarios was evaluated and analysed by using the validated high resolution comprehensive water quality model the model developed in this paper could provide a suitable tool for deeper research on the water environment and water ecology and the treatment of black and odorous water bodies the model could likely play a guiding role in future urban and watershed water environment governance and evaluation provide a scientific basis for the mitigation of black and odorous water bodies and offer effective decision support for the formulation of water cycle water quality planning and management policies 2 model structure the model mainly includes a high efficiency and high precision hydrodynamic module and a comprehensive water quality module the flow field data required for the water quality module are provided by the hydrodynamic module the overall model framework is shown in fig 1 the high efficiency and high precision

influent pollutant module the model parameters can be dynamically corrected according to real time water quality monitoring data to ensure the real time correction of water quality warning metrics 2 1

water quality simulation module the comprehensive water quality simulation module considers convective diffusion dilution self degradation interactions between water quality variables and influence of external sources and sinks on the concentration of water quality indicators in a given river this comprehensive water quality simulation module is an important tool for decision making in water

variable are interrelated at each time step the above equations were solved in turn the courant friedrichs lewy cfl value is 0 5 and the numerical simulation time step is short so the above equations could be solved via the finite difference method first the water temperature equation was solved followed by those for algae zooplankton total phosphorus ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen nitrate nitrogen dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod e coli and degradable or nondegradable substances the submodels for each water quality variable above were substituted into the two dimensional convective diffusion equation the boundary conditions of each equation were t 0 and c n c 0 and the submodels were sequentially solved according to equations 18 28 c n denotes the pollutant concentration at a given moment and c 0 denotes the pollutant concentration at zero time because the water temperature equation considers multiple factors the water temperature was temporarily set to a certain value 2 3 gpu acceleration techniques gpu acceleration technology the use of graphics rendering devices adopts its multithreading advantage to achieve the concurrent execution of a large number of data task calculations and the computation speed is 5 10 times that of a comparable cpu smith and liang 2013 liang et al 2016 to improve the computational efficiency of the model the model implements gpu parallel computing technology through autonomous programming in the cuda language to achieve high speed computing the gpu accelerated two dimensional hydrodynamic model realized an acceleration effect vielding a computation speed 23 88 to 158 72 times higher than that provided by cpu technology in the simulation of the urban rainfall process under different scenarios huo 2018 gong jia hui et al 2020 therefore gpu technology provides significant advantages in parallel computing tasks with a large amount of computation based on the advantages of gpu acceleration technology the model employed in this study realized the large scale parallel calculation of various hydraulic elements in high precision large scale terrain via programming to solve the above two dimensional shallow water equation in cuda and c fig 3 shows the gpu acceleration technology process 3 model validation to verify the accuracy of the model in the simulation of the physical and mutual reaction processes of multiple water quality variables a square with a side length of 50 m and a bottom slope of 0 was constructed as an ideal terrain element to ensure the attenuation reaction of pollutants under hydrostatic conditions and the simulation results were analyzed and compared to the analytical solution described in section 2 2 to verify the model behavior a regular ditch topography was constructed to simulate the transformation pattern of the pollutant concentration in complex flow regimes and the results were validated against the calculation results of a two dimensional steady state water quality model to verify the model stability the model performance in managing the diffusion term was fully verified shi et al 2020 therefore the model validation was only based on the reaction process of each water quality variable 3 1 ideal terrain calculation case 3 1 1 model parameter settings a square with a side length of 50 m was constructed as ideal terrain and the grid accuracy was 0 5 m considering a uniform structural grid with a total of 10 000 cells the simulation area was surrounded by a solid wall boundary the point source pollutant location was defined at x 25 m y 25 m with a concentration of 1 mg l the initial water depth was 3 m the water quality parameters used to calculate point source pollutant concentration changes over time are given in table 2 the cfl value was 0 5 the simulation duration was 10 h and the output file exhibited a step of 1 min in the process of model parameter setting the saturated do concentration was calculated according to a water temperature of 25 c and the concentration reached 8 2686 mg l the remaining parameters were obtained according to the corresponding normative value ranges parameters with notable value range changes were set to 0 and values with an unspecified range were obtained from the literature the parameter values and ranges are listed in table 2 3 1 2 results and discussion a comparison of the numerical and analytical solutions for the mutual reaction between the comprehensive water quality variables in a static water flow field is shown in fig 4 to illustrate the consistency between the numerical and analytical solutions of the model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was used for analysis and the nse coefficient can be calculated with equation 35 35 e 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 in the formula q 0 refers to the analytical value q m refers to the analogue value q t refers to the value at time t and q 0 refers to the total average of the observed values it could be determined that the nse of all water quality variables were all approximately equal to 1 which indicates that the model attains a satisfactory accuracy in simulating the pure reaction process fig 4 shows the variation process of the water quality variable concentrations based on the model simulation results and analytical solution most water quality variables exhibited a decreasing or increasing trend except do the ca and no3 n concentrations gradually increased over time the increase rate of the former indicated an increasing trend while that of the latter exhibited the opposite trend the z po4 3 p nh3 n no2 n bod and ce concentration decreased with increasing time the po4 3 p and no2 n concentration increased at a lower rate and the increase in no2 n was more obvious the concentration reduction rates of all water quality variables decreased it should be noted that the do concentration gradually increased over time the increase rate gradually declined thereby reaching a peak within approximately two hours and the saturated do concentration fluctuated the do concentration can significantly impact natural microbial communities and diversity which in turn can affect the degradation and utilization of organic matter johannsson et al 2021 the reduction in do is also a key factor in water quality deterioration and physical reoxygenation metabolism and water temperature are critical for the accurate simulation of river do dynamics jankowski et al 2021 therefore for space reasons do concentration variation patterns given focus in this paper the initial do concentration was set to 1 mg l and the saturated do concentration was 8 26855 mg l based on equation 20 it could be found that the reoxygenation rate k 2 and saturated do concentration os imposed the greatest effects on the change in the do concentration when the do concentration was low os o increased so the reoxygenation rate was higher with a value of 7 3548 mg l at 1 h with increasing do concentration os o decreased and the increase rate of the do concentration thus declined at 5 h the do concentration exceeded the saturated do concentration os and os o became negative therefore the increase in the do concentration was limited however the concentration did not remain at 8 26855 mg l indicating that do was simultaneously affected by other water quality variables accordingly the do concentration exhibited a gradual rising trend within 10 h the prediction accuracy of the do concentration was generally poor when the effects of other water quality variables were considered because the calculation errors of the other water quality variables affected the do prediction results keupers and willems 2017 however compared to the analytical solution the nse coefficient of the do concentration predicted via model simulation was still close to 1 which is the inevitable result of an effective model this case indicates that the model initially successfully established a model framework for the transport attenuation and mutual reaction of multicomponent pollutants and could accurately and efficiently simulate the internal process of action between do and various water quality variables and algae growth the parameters of this case were randomly obtained within a reasonable range based on the code modifiability a corresponding exclusive model could be established for the development of water ecological processes in unique regions which highlights the independent research and development advantages of the proposed model 3 2 ditch topography calculation case the pure reaction process of water quality variables is usually adopted as the simulation focus in the study of the water quality mechanism process by using a water environment numerical model however this is completely contrary to the real flow state of most rivers namely water moves under turbulence detailed hydraulic characteristics are needed to accurately simulate the physical and chemical reaction processes of water quality variables such as do within a given water system hutchins et al 2021 when the pure reaction processes of the water quality model and high resolution hydrodynamic evolution model are fully coupled the accuracy and efficiency of the coupled model in the simulation of the water environment are the key problems that must be addressed to verify the model accuracy in turbulent state water environment simulations this paper selected a regular ditch case to simulate the transformation process of water quality variables the terrain length is 200 m the bottom width is 5 5 m the slope coefficient is 1 5 the manning coefficient is 0 015 s m1 3 the slope drop is 1 3 000 and the upstream inflow is 1 7 m3 s there is no tributary water flows from the left boundary the right boundary is defined as an open boundary and the remaining boundaries are closed boundaries the topographic resolution is 0 1 m with a total of 266 000 uniform structure grids adopting bod5 as the simulated water quality variable the attenuation coefficient reached 2 d 1 and the upstream water quality category was employed as a quasi iv standard notably the initial concentration in the whole section is 6 mg l and the cfl value is 0 5 the length of the 200 m length trench scale increased 100 times and the attenuation coefficient increased in the same proportion notably the calculation results of the model in the above complex flow field were compared to the analysis results of the two dimensional steady water quality model with an actual distance of 20 km to more effectively verify the model stability in the calculation the diffusion attenuation reaction process of pollutants under complex flow patterns 3 2 1 two dimensional steady state water quality model the two dimensional steady state water quality model can be expressed as equation 36 the data obtained with the model were used as measured values and compared to the calculation results

parameters of the two dimensional steady state water quality model were consistent with those of the high resolution water quality model based on gpu technology and the specific values are provided in table 3 3 2 2 results and discussion because the actual ditch is shorter and there occurs a hydrodynamic deficiency zone on the bank the concentration value is lower and the concentration at the center of each ditch was therefore selected as the simulation value the average flow velocity and water depth in the simulated section were basically consistent with those determined with the two dimensional steady state water quality model and the simulation effect was satisfactory fig 5 shows the simulation and measured bod5 concentration in different river sections the difference between the simulated and measured water concentrations in each section the absolute error interval was less than 0 2 mg l the relative error remained within 6 and the nse coefficient reached 0 984 the simulation results suitably matched the measured results the two dimensional steady state water quality model is a model without time variables which can only describe the water quality in the equilibrium state however natural rivers are often irregular although the model constructed in this example involved a regular channel the length of the 200 m channel in this model was used to simulate the length of the 20 km channel in the two dimensional steady state water quality model in regard to the two dimensional hydrodynamic model this could inevitably generate a certain error from the downstream flow pattern close to the boundary because the river channel is short and the upstream boundary flow is a constant value the river flow evolution process determined with the two dimensional hydrodynamic model is realistic this also indicates that the model remains stable in the simulation of flood routing and its accompanying pollutant transport reaction process in high resolution terrain as shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic conditions on both sides of the river were often weak which could also yield different water quality concentrations within the same section different points within the same section could exhibit different water concentrations that could be ignored in whole river water environment analysis however this phenomenon must be considered when fine simulations of wide and shallow rivers and precise pollution prevention and control are implemented the observed simulation error of 6 is completely acceptable when the water concentration in the middle section is compared to that obtained with the two dimensional steady water quality model because the water flow simulated by the model is not uniform the first order attenuation coefficient of pollutants is approximately 0 3 d when river pollutants are not subjected to artificial reduction measures such as ecological floating islands but the model validation process is described in this part to better assess the simulation results the attenuation coefficient was set to 2 d based on the simulation results the farther away from the initial section the lower the bod5 concentration was and without exogenous pollution the bod5 concentration reached approximately 4 mg l at 12 km from the initial section this also completely agrees with the actual physical change process fig 6 shows a two dimensional cloud chart of the bod5 concentration change at different times and various sections to ensure a better comparison of the simulation results to the calculation results of the two dimensional steady state model the concentration in the whole river section was set to the initial concentration at zero time at 6 mg l the water quality concentration downstream of the river began to decrease over time the water flow reached a steady state close to 600 s and there occurred no significant change in the water quality concentration at each simulated point which matches the simulated value of the pollutant concentration in each river section in the actual state it should be noted that the bod5 concentration could differ among different cells within the same section in the simulation of two dimensions at a high resolution this is also consistent with the rules mentioned in the previous paragraph the main reason for the gradual decrease in the downstream pollutant concentration was the given attenuation coefficient when upstream pollutants evolve downstream under a constant concentration the farther away from the upstream section the longer the time needed is pollutant concentrations continue to decline due to first order attenuation the upstream flow is constant and the river section is uniform so the velocity and water depth in each section basically remain unchanged the linear inverse relationship between the distance from the initial section and the pollutant concentration can be attributed to the fixed time from upstream to downstream and the river water quality concentration remains stable at 600 s this case verifies that the high resolution two dimensional hydrodynamic model could be used to efficiently simulate the change process of the river water quality which could reveal the spatial and temporal distributions of the river water quality in real time with notable intuition and clarity and the calculation results can be presented to decision makers 4 model application one of the main causes of black water and odour in urban rivers is the direct discharge of sewage combined with overflow pollution load into rivers luo et al 2021 narin et al 2022 this high concentration pollution source could significantly impact the river water quality which could lead to continuous water quality deterioration in urban rivers resulting in black and odorous water bodies mailhot et al 2015 therefore to address the black water and odour phenomenon of urban water the remediation of urban sewage direct discharge and combined overflow pollution must be considered this example involves the application of the model in the simulation and evaluation of the water environment of rivers in yinchuan city the effects of the tail water load of a sewage treatment plant and combined overflow pollution load on river water environment changes on dry and rainy days were simulated 4 1 regional overview to assess the application effect of the high resolution comprehensive water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology xidagou which is the receiving body of the second sewage treatment plant in yinchuan was used as the ditch in the simulation process the bottom width is 8 m the side slope coefficient is 1 5 the hydraulic slope drop is 1 5 000 the comprehensive manning coefficient is 0 025 and the length is 5 km to obtain a detailed and physics based hydrodynamic water quality change process the topography was divided into a uniform grid with a resolution of 0 2 m entailing a total of 350 000 calculation cells and the cfl value was set to 0 5 the upstream water flow is 1 7 m3 s and the water quality was calculated according to the worst water quality situation quasi class iv xidagou mainly receives pollution from the tailwater of the second sewage treatment plant during the dry season and average daily tailrace water volume and water quality monitoring data of the plant for 2021 were used to represent the tailwater entering xidagou during the dry season the flow rate was 0 61 m3 s the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration was 20 84 mg l and the nh3 n concentration was 0 89 mg l based on pipe network data the swmm was used to calculate the overflow flow and pollutant concentration at the overflow mouth to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation process of the river water environment under the most hazardous conditions in the study area this paper chose the maximum single day rainfall scenario in the typical year as the simulation condition the one day rainfall reached 40 1 mm according to the obtained inflow data during the rainy season the flow rate was 2 74 m3 s the cod concentration reached 370 26 mg l and the nh3 n concentration was 186 13 mg l as the focus of this study is the establishment of a high resolution water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology the calculation process of the overflow and surface source pollutant load is not described in detail here the drainage system topology in the study area is shown in fig 7 4 2 parameter calibration 4 2 1 source of measured data average nh3 n monitoring data for june and july 2021 were employed as measured values at three monitoring points in xidagou during the dry season the do concentrations in the upper middle and downstream sections were 9 62 9 45 and 7 96 mg l respectively the cod concentrations reached 180 24 160 54 and 47 28 mg l respectively the nh3 n concentrations were 0 31 0 23 and 0 2 mg l respectively the monitoring data used in this study were obtained from yinchuan black and odorous water supervision and dispatching systems 4 2 2 parameter calibration and results the detailed hydraulic state determines the accuracy of the water quality model based on the above basic data the hydrodynamic and water quality modules of the model were employed the water quality module includes the influence of the attenuation reaction process of various water quality variables on the river transmission process due to insufficient monitoring data and the fact that pollution degradation is mainly affected by the adsorption capacity of artificial purification measures such as river banks and ecological floating islands the interaction among the different water quality factors slightly affected the water concentration therefore the first order attenuation reaction terms of do cod and nh3 n were mainly calibrated in this example fig 8 shows a comparison between the simulation results and measured values of the water quality in the ditch section the simulated do concentrations at 0 1 and 5 km from the initial section are 9 6220 9 458 and 7 636 mg l respectively the simulated cod concentrations reached 180 238 160 638 and 47 869 mg l respectively and the simulated nh3 n concentrations were 0 3135 0 225 and 0 2 mg l respectively the simulated values of the water quality variables do cod and nh3 n basically matched the measured values indicating that the model parameters provided a high accuracy in the river reach 1 km from the initial section the attenuation coefficients of do cod and nh3 n were 0 46 3 00 and 8 64 d 1 respectively the attenuation coefficients within the river reach before 1 and 5 km from the initial section were 1 12 7 92 and 0 65 d 1 respectively a two dimensional cloud map of the sectional water quality concentration is shown in fig 9 as water flowed downstream due to the attenuation reaction of the water quality variables the concentrations of the water quality variables downstream were all lower than those upstream which conforms to the actual physical change trend 4 3 analysis of simulation results a model boundary data file was generated including time varying flow and concentration data according to the detailed water quantity and water quality data provided by the swmm and upstream monitoring data by simulating the process of water environment change in xidagou during the dry and rainy seasons the variation in the sectional concentration was obtained as shown in fig 10 the convective diffusion process of pollutants into the river from the drainage point to 200 m downstream was simulated fig 11 shows the two dimensional convective diffusion process of the cod load in the tail water and overflow upon discharge into the river channel as shown in fig 10 both the cod and nh3 n concentrations decreased due to convective diffusion and decayed as the water flow advanced downstream the initial section of the river exhibited a cod concentration of 30 mg l and an nh3 n concentration of 1 5 mg l and the values 500 m from the initial section were 27 53 and 1 334 mg l respectively with the flow of water downstream the concentrations at 5000 m from the initial section after attenuation reached 26 775 and 1 311 mg l respectively considering the discharge of overflow water and pollutants into xidagou the cod and nh3 n concentration after mixing at 500 m from the initial section were 239 367 and 114 955 mg l respectively however as water flowed downstream the concentrations at a distance of 5000 m from the initial section reached 232 803 and 113 025 mg l respectively due to attenuation as shown in fig 11 the cod concentration in tail water was lower than the initial concentration in the river during the dry season after the tail water of the second sewage treatment plant was discharged into the receiving water body therefore the pollutants stemming from tailwater discharge entered the river and tail water and river water were gradually mixed via convection and diffusion resulting in a reduction in cod emission in the downstream section of the discharge which could achieve the effect of water replenishment and purification the results reported by cui et al 2020 are the same as the simulation results reasonable planning of the tail water discharge path after sewage treatment plant treatment is of great significance to realize water quality improvement sewage reuse constitutes an alternative water source to solve water shortages and reduce water pollution loads tail water originating from sewage treatment plants could be used to supplement ornamental ponds and lakes in parks maintain or increase river flow and dilute pollutant concentrations in black and odorous river sections however combined sewer overflow pollution is indeed a major environmental problem recognized by many countries a 2015 in the case of heavy rain rainwater flows into the combined sewer system and subsequently enters the sewage treatment plant water bodies can become polluted as excess sewage with high concentrations of pollutants is directly discharged into nearby receiving water bodies when the capacity of sewage treatment plants is reached this causes black and odorous water bodies if the receiving water bodies exhibit insufficient hydrodynamics the two dimensional simulation results demonstrate that the cod concentration at the overflow outlet was higher than that upstream of the river during the rainy season after pollutant discharge into the river the concentration downstream of the discharge rapidly increased which severely impacted the water quality downstream because the combined overflow pollution exhibits the characteristics of a short discharge time large water volume and high pollutant concentration the model simulation results also directly reflect the water quality change process in each section after pollution discharge from the sewage outlet into the river this suggests that accurate simulation and evaluation of the temporal and spatial distributions of combined overflow pollution can provide an important reference value for pollution prevention and control work in summary the established high resolution comprehensive water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology achieved a satisfactory simulation effect in terms of the water environment change process after tail water and overflow pollution load enter the receiving water body and the simulation results agreed with the actual physical change trend the preliminary conclusion is that the model simulation results could provide basic data for the formulation of dynamic water quality management measures evaluation and analysis of water quality data water pollution early warning water environment management evaluation of the water quality status during a certain period and prediction and analysis of the impact of water environment change it should be mentioned that the model on the adopted rtx3070d computer needed only 0 12 h to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality evolution process involving 35 000 cells within 5 h 5 conclusions in this study the cuda based parallel computing architecture was adopted to establish a multicomponent pollutant migration attenuation and interaction model framework then a high performance integrated water quality model based on gpu acceleration technology coupled with efficient and high precision hydrodynamics was proposed the accuracy and stability of the model were verified by employing static and dynamic ideal cases and the model was applied in water environment simulation and urban inland river assessment the main conclusions are as follows 1 the analytical solution of the interaction between static and dynamic water quality variables under ideal conditions was compared to the results obtained with the two dimensional steady state water quality model the nse coefficients were all above 0 9 and the model achieved suitable stability and accuracy in simulating the interaction process of the water quality variables 2 the simulation results obtained considering the yinchuan ditch were basically consistent with the measured values and the proposed model could accurately simulate the water environment change process of the receiving water body during both the dry and rainy seasons the model could be used as an effective tool by relevant departments to make decisions on water environmental governance projects and could likely provide technical support for the development of water environment management measures 3 due to the cuda parallel programming approach the model needed only 0 12 h to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality evolution process involving 35 000 cells over 5 h in addition this model includes the following shortcomings 1 further model validation is needed based on a large amount of measured data 2 the complex water temperature suspended matter and sediment adsorption desorption and sedimentary rock modules were not considered in the model therefore in the subsequent model development process the calculation method should be verified and corrected through a large number of experiments and the model function should be further improved based on the model framework constructed in this study finally an efficient and high precision hydrodynamic water quality coupling model for the integration of the simulation of the water environment processes of urban and surrounding river basins will be developed by considering the advantages of the independent research and development model credit authorship contribution statement
