17355,dredging and in situ adsorbent inactivation are two methods which are frequently used in eutrophic water bodies such as ponds lakes and estuaries to control internal phosphorus p loading from sediments however their effects and modes on the control of sediment p loading has been seldom compared in this study a long term sediment core incubation experiment in the field was undertaken to investigate changes in sediment p loading p fluxes supply ability and forms of p and transformation comparing two remediation techniques that of lanthanum modified bentonite lmb addition or dredging to a control a 360 day field investigation indicated that lmb addition more effectively reduced pore water p concentrations and sediment p fluxes than dredging in comparison with the control on average dredging and in situ lmb inactivation reduced the p flux by 82 and 90 respectively relative to the control sediment whilst both the lmb inactivation and dredging can reduce the mobile p concentration the impact of lmb in reducing mobile p was demonstrated to be more prolonged than that of dredging after 360 days the p fraction composition in the lmb inactivated sediment differed significantly from the dredged and control sediment contrary to physical removal of dredging chemical transformation of sediment mobile p and al p into ca p is the main function mode of lmb for sediment internal p control both lmb addition and dredging caused changes in the composition of sediment bacterial communities whilst lmb addition increased bacterial diversity dredging temporarily reduced it this study indicates that in situ inactivation by lmb is superior to dredging in the long term control of sediment p loading graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dredging in situ treatment internal loading phosphorus sediment 1 introduction there is international consensus that internal phosphorus p loading from lake bottom sediments will contribute to a decline in lake water quality even if external p loading can be effectively reduced marsden 1989 schindler et al 2016 schönach et al 2018 critically p can be periodically released from sediment to overlying water underpinning eutrophication and algal growth jeppesen et al 2005 søndergaard et al 2013 douglas et al 2016 in one example it was estimated that more than 90 of p in eutrophic lake was stored in bottom sediment søndergaard et al 2013 therefore inhibition or effective interception of p released from bottom sediment will constitute amongst the most important management actions in a eutrophic lake once the external input of p is limited sediment dredging and in situ adsorbent amendment are the two most commonly used options to control of p release from bottom sediment lürling and van oosterhout 2013 dredging surface sediment that contains p in addition to some forms of n and other pollutants such as trace metals can likely reduce the internal p load oldenborg and steinman 2019 via a reduction of bottom sediment fluxes of p into the overlying water chen et al 2018a nonetheless there remains considerable debate with respect to the efficacy of sediment dredging several studies indicated that sediment dredging can effectively reduce the release of p and metals from sediment yu et al 2019 li et al 2020 on the contrary other studies indicated that sediment dredging does not constitute a long term management option for sediment internal p loading especially whilst external loading continues kiani et al 2020 wen et al 2020 with effective p retention augmenting the bottom sediment inventory secondly the disturbance of sediment may cause the release of co contaminants such as heavy metals and therefore induce secondary pollution yu et al 2019 moreover sediment dredging can produce a large quantity of waste which will require dewatering and land disposal in many cases the dredged sediments may be reactive once dried requiring further management however dredging is still used in the management of sediment associated internal loading around the world based on the premise that sediment dredging can decrease endogenous p load in a lake and therefore assist in the mitigation of eutrophication in situ p adsorbent amendment is another method which is frequently used in eutrophic lakes for management of sediment associated internal p loading robb et al 2003 haghseresht et al 2009 spears et al 2013 yin et al 2018 d haese et al 2019 douglas et al 2019 adsorbents which contain chemical inactivation agents such as la or al can bind mobile and labile p in sediment into inert forms lürling et al 2016 effectively reducing p flux from sediment amongst the most common of p inactivation methods invented is lanthanum modified bentonite lmb known commercially as phoslock which has been used in hundreds of lake and reservoir trials and full scale applications for eutrophication control copetti et al 2016 many results have documented that the addition of lmb can effectively lower down the p concentrations in overlying water immediately following application while also providing a reactive barrier to intercept internal p loading derived from the bottom sediment mucci et al 2020 the basis of lmb based treatment is the formation of rhabdophane lapo4 nh2o a precipitate resistant to redox changes and stable over a wide ph range slade and gates 1999 meis et al 2013 although depending on the composition of the water a range of intermediate phases may be present mucci et al 2020 despite the demonstrated efficacy of p inactivation agents such as lmb there is controversy on the long term effectiveness on p control by these chemical inactivation agents in shallow lakes lin et al 2019 this arises in cases where there may be frequent sediment resuspension bioturbation and the deposition of suspended particulate matter all of these processes can result in burial dispersion or preferential focusing of the applied materials in the bottom sediment xu et al 2017 with the potential to compromise the effectiveness of p inactivation agents the selection of the most appropriate methods dredging and in situ sediment inactivation or a combined approach in dealing with the remediation of sediment p load is a critical step for the effective management of water bodies this selection often with a substantial associated cost douglas et al 2016 will to some extent determine the success of lake restoration currently few studies have been undertaken to compare the two methods in the efficiency of sediment p loading management therefore a simulated field sediment core experiment was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of dredging and in situ inactivation on the reduction of sediment p loading including porewater p concentration p flux and p forms transformation furthermore the changes in bacterial community in the dredged and inactivated sediment were also analyzed and compared to the changes in sediment p fractions the results of this study will inform the selection of methods for the management of internal sediment p loading in eutrophic lakes 2 material and method 2 1 materials lanthanum modified bentonite phoslock was obtained from beijing fusileke water solutions ltd and was used without further modification intact sediment cores no less than 50 cm long were collected from western lake chaohu 117 3489 n 31 687 e using core sampler 8 8 cm in diameter and 60 cm in length on january 2019 the site was selected due to the known high sediment p and n internal loading based on previous study yang et al 2020 in total 70 sediment cores were collected for the experiments all of the sediment cores were temporarily brought to shore for handing approximately 100 l water was collected from the sampling site for the experiments 2 2 experimental design a total of 54 sediment cores were randomly selected and placed into experimental tubes followed by filling with lake water a total of 18 sediment cores were used for each treatment 1 control where the sediment cores were intact and untreated 2 dredging dred sediment cores with the upper 25 cm surface sediment was sectioned and removed to simulate sediment dredging 3 lanthanum modified bentonite lmb sediment cores with lmb added in a ratio of 100 1 based on the mass of mobile p where the amount of mobile p was estimated from that present in surface sediment 0 5 cm in the sediment cores and the soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the overlying water to avoid the deposition of suspended particulate matter into the sediment cores all sediment tubes were covered with polyamide screens with an 800 mesh 18 μm mesh size and which was periodically changed all sediment tubes were then placed into the field observation platform 31 42 6 53 n 117 23 19 23 e with submersible stainless steel frames to house the cores and designed to simulate actual lake environmental conditions the three groups of treated sediment cores were placed in stainless steel frames and submerged at the bottom of the lake and tethered with a nylon rope connected to the platform the sediment tubes were retrieved after 30 feb 2019 60 march 2019 90 april 2019 180 july 2019 270 october 2019 and 360 days january 2020 at each sampling time nine sediment tubes three sediment tubes for each treatment were collected and used to measure p flux and sediment p fractions and analysis for bacterial community composition following the last sampling diffusive gradients in thin film dgt measurements were performed with detailed information mentioned below 2 3 pore water sampling p fluxes and diffusive gradients in thin film dgt measurements in inactivated and dredged sediment the p fluxes across the sediment water interface were measured by a high resolution peeper hr peeper sampling method at each sampling time detailed information on the use of hr peeper can be found in the supplementary material the p concentration in sediment pore water in the hr peeper was measured and used for calculation of the p fluxes across sediment water interface the po4 3 fluxes j across the sediment water interface from the control and treated sediments were estimated from the pore water profiles of po4 3 using fick s first law of diffusion 1 j φ d s δ c δ x x 0 where φ is porosity ds is the bulk sediment diffusion coefficient and δ c δ x x 0 is the pore water concentration gradient across the sediment water interface ds was calculated from the diffusion coefficient of h2po4 in water using φ3 for φ 0 7 two days before the end of the final sediment core incubations commercial zr oxide diffusive gradients in thin films zr oxide dgt probes easy sensor ltd www easysensor net were used to measure the two dimensional 2d labile p for each treatment the dgt probes were inserted vertically into the three groups of sediment cores and retrieved 24 hrs after deployment the high resolution 2d labile p determination and analytical methods are described in detail by ding et al ding et al 2015 2 4 phosphorus fraction and sediment properties analysis phosphorus fractions in the sediment were determined using the sequential extraction method developed of rydin 2000 as described in supplementary material according to zhang et al 2014 with some modifications in brief air dried sediment p was fractioned using nh4cl p loosely sorbed p bd p fe p naoh nrp org p naoh rp al p hcl p ca p and residual p res p the p concentration in each step was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method and expressed as an average of the two duplicate analyses the total phosphorus tp in sediment was estimated as the sum of the six p fractions the water content was measured by drying sediment samples at 105 c for 24 hrs to a constant weight and organic content using the loss on ignition method loi 550 cfor 4 hrs in order to study the composition of the benthic microbial community around 1 0 g surface sediment 0 2 cm from various treatments at different sampling times was sampled for dna extraction the dna was extracted with a soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions and then sequenced in an illumina miseq platform personal biotechnology company shanghai china detailed information on sequencing and data analysis is provided in the supplementary material 2 5 statistical analysis significant differences in variables p flux p fractions and pore water p concentration among treatments were identified through one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test typically homogeneity of variance for the obtained data was tested and data of the test values 0 05 were adopted for the anova analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 ibm new york usa with significant levels p 0 05 and p 0 01 reported correlations between bacteria community structure and environmental variables were explored with the linear model based redundancy analysis rda using the software canoco for windows version 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties the nutrient concentrations in the sediment used in this study are listed in table s1 the average concentrations of total p tp and total n tn in the cores were 1003 mg kg and 1938 mg kg respectively these tp and tn were 1 6 and 1 2 times of that of average of tp and tn in lake chaohu respectively yang et al 2020 confirming that the site chosen for this study was likely to constitute a region of higher internal nutrient loading the high concentrations of tp and tn confirm that this area has received long term pollution load from the naifei river which flows through the urban area of hefei city the mobile p fraction the sum of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp was estimated to be 395 mg kg or 39 of the tp the loss on ignition loi of the sediment was 6 5 as indicated table s1 3 2 pore water p concentration fluxes and p supply capacity from dredged and inactivated sediment the temporal variation of sediment pore water p concentrations along sediment depth from the three treatments are presented in fig 1 the results indicated that the pore water srp concentration in the control cores increased with temperature reflecting seasonal variations fig s1 maximum srp concentrations in the control sediment typically occurred at 2 3 cm below the sediment water interface and then decreased steadily with sediment depth in comparison porewater srp concentrations in the dredged and lmb treated sediment showed considerably less variation in the profiles as a function of depth with many of the profiles often indistinguishable within one standard deviation fig 1 a seasonal variation of porewater srp in both concentration and depth from control sediments has been reported in previous studies markovic et al 2019 yang et al 2020 higher temperatures will often accelerate microbially mediated degradation of organic matter in sediment which may increase srp concentrations in sediment pore water james 2017 chen et al 2018b van dael et al 2020 both dredging and lmb inactivation can effectively reduce the p concentration in sediment porewater and this is especially evident in warmer seasons july 2019 and october 2019 fig 1 for example dredging and lmb inactivation reduced average porewater srp concentrations at day 270 by 60 and 69 respectively when compared with the control sediment this outcome is important for the management of eutrophic lake sediment internal p loading particularly where higher sediment nutrient fluxes can be observed during the summer where algal blooms may occur markovic et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the strong reduction of sediment pore water p concentrations by the addition of lmb in particular will also reduce the magnitude of p release from sediment estimated p fluxes across sediment water interface from the three treatments are presented in fig 2 the of p flux from the three sediment treatments reflected sediment pore water p concentrations fig 1 with higher p fluxes observed in warmer seasons and reduced fluxes at lower temperatures gibbons and bridgeman 2020 the control sediment p fluxes gradually increased from 0 27 mg m2 d in feb 2019 to 4 12 mg m2 d in oct 2019 and then decreased to 0 24 mg m2 d in january 2020 in comparison sediment from dredging and lmb treatments maintained relatively low p fluxes with reductions of 80 and 92 respectively compared with the control sediment in october 2019 on average dredging and in situ lmb inactivation reduced the p flux by 82 and 90 respectively relative to the control sediment importantly lmb always performed better in reducing the sediment p flux than sediment dredging over the 360 days of field incubation to further investigate the long term control effects of different engineering methods on sediment p loading sediment labile p was measured using a high resolution 2d method at the end of the experiment fig 3 the 2d image of sediment labile p reflected the effects of dredging and in situ inactivation by lmb high dgt labile p concentration or fluxes were observed in intermediate and deeper sediment horizons in control and dredged sediments respectively furthermore a number of more intense hot spot sites were observed for the control relative to the lmb inactivated sediment in contrast a deeper zone of sediment labile p was observed in the 60 to 80 cm depth interval of the dredged core fig 3 also noteworthy is a zone of low sediment labile p around the margins of the lmb inactivated core which may reflect downward migration potentially controlled by bioturbation and wind induced redistribution of this material following application previous studies have indicated that the lmb can migrate into deeper sediment via bioturbation ding et al 2018b van oosterhout et al 2020 therefore it is likely that any migrated lmb in deeper sediment can react with mobile p in sediment and thus reduce its ability to diffuse into pore water and or into the overlying water column dithmer et al 2016 in contrast it is likely that the mobility of p from the dredged sediment may increase often due to the deposition of new p rich sediment such that the remedial effects of dredging will decrease over time a calculated r value expressed as the ratio of dgt labile p contained in the sediment relative to sediment pore water p is also shown in fig 3 the dgt measured fractions come from pore water and the further release of the solute from the sediment solids to resupply the pore water zhang et al 1995 the lower of r value the more difficult p diffusion from sediment to pore water is likely to be zhang et al 1998 the average r value from the lmb inactivated sediment was only 0 007 considerably lower than the r value from the control and dredged sediment of 0 44 and 0 34 respectively the r values of the lmb inactivated sediments were particularly low from 0 to 30 cm depth where the bulk of the sediment p flux was likely to originate this was in accordance with the estimated overall p flux fig 2 the changes of sediment pore water p concentration p fluxes and dgt measured p indicated that the lmb inactivation provides a potentially improved remediation outcome in terms of managing the sediment p flux via p binding relative to dredging where only the sediment is removed 3 3 p forms in dredged and lmb inactivated sediment the surface sediment p fractions in the three treatments during various incubation times are shown in fig 4 all p fractions were extracted from the air dried sediment as described in section 2 4 these results may be different from the p fractions extracted using wet sediment as indicated in previous studies zhang et al 2014 while this study has chosen to use air dried sediments in p fractionation experiments hupfer et al 1995 ruban et al 1999 kumar and anshumali 2019 a diversity of approaches exist including the use of freeze dried sediments ruttenberg 1992 meis et al 2012b kurek et al 2020 in addition to wet sediments rydin 2000 huser and pilgrim 2014 it is understood that changes in operationally defined p fractions may occur due to drying the outcomes in this study have only been used to give a general indication of the predominant p fractions in the sediment critically as will be presented later we have demonstrated major changes in the conversion of a number of p fractions following imposition if the two remediation techniques furthermore we have demonstrated that there has been a major change into an la p bound fraction following the application of lmb that would be unlikely to be dependent on whether wet or dry sediments were used in the p fractionation analysis the results indicate that the p compositions in the control dredged and inactivated sediments were substantially different and showed dynamic changes during seasonal and associated temperature variation in control sediment al p naoh rp was the main component of the total phosphorus 41 66 of sediment tp this is consistent with a previous study which indicated that al p predominated in western lake chaohu bottom sediment yang et al 2020 the mobile p concentration the sum of labile p iron bound p and organic fractions of p was in the range of 222 to 435 mg kg with an average concentration of 366 mg kg during the study the mobile p fraction accounted for an average of 33 of the tp the mobile p is regarded to be the chemically defined fraction responsible for the active sediment internal p loading in eutrophic lakes this is because this fraction of p has the potential to be released from sediment under anoxic conditions or as a result of microbial action reitzel et al 2005 hence the reduction of this concentration of mobile p is considered an effective method to reduce lake sediment internal p loading funes et al 2016 the relative proportions of p fractions from the lmb inactivated sediment was markedly different to that of the control and dredged sediment the mobile p concentration in the dredged and lmb inactivated sediment were in the range of 104 to 313 mg kg average 194 mg kg and 72 to 173 mg kg average149 mg kg respectively the results indicate that both sediment dredging and lmb addition can reduce the concentration of mobile p in sediment albeit by two distinct modes the mobile p concentration in the dredged sediment was lower than that of the mobile p concentration in control sediment however mobile p accounted for 19 to 33 average of 26 of tp in dredged sediment which is similar to that of the percentage of mobile p in control sediment 17 41 average 34 fig 5 in contrast the addition of lmb largely reduced the percentage of mobile p in sediment which was in the range of 6 to 17 average of 14 thus on average lmb addition reduced more than 60 of mobile p relative to that of the control sediment the nominally inert al p fraction in sediment was also significantly reduced after sediment dredging and lmb addition the lower al p fraction in dredged sediment was due to the al p fraction in natural sediment generally decreasing with sediment depth li et al 2020 however the al p fraction was still dominant in the dredged sediment average of 47 in contrast the al p fraction in the lmb inactivated sediment was on average 24 of sediment tp the reduced sediment al p fraction seems to have been transformed into stable la bound p assumed to be contained in the ca p fraction with this fraction increased significantly relative to the control and dredged sediment p 0 01 on average the ca p fraction in the lmb inactivated sediment was 4 6 and 5 2 times of that of the ca p fraction in the control and dredged sediment respectively this is consistent with many previous studies which reported that the lmb addition can increase the chemically defined ca p fraction in sediment meis et al 2012a li et al 2019 the transformation of mobile p in sediment into a stable nominally ca p bound fraction will likely be beneficial to the long term management of sediment p in eutrophic lakes epe et al 2017 this is because the p bound to lmb is considered stable and thus will likely reduce the extent of eutrophication arising from internal p loading nürnberg 2017 3 4 bacterial community in dredged and inactivated sediment and the relationship with sediment p fractions the bacterial community diversity in sediment from different treatments and sampling times is listed in table s3 the results indicated that the sequencing depth was enough because the coverage of the samples was more than 94 which means that most of the bacterial otus in each sample were captured the results indicated that the remediation method can influence the bacterial diversity of the sediment for the first four sampling times the bacterial diversity indexes such as chao l ace and shannon in lmb amended sediment were higher than those for the control sediment on the other hand for the first two and last two sampling times the values of chao l ace and shannon indexes for the dredged sediment were lower than those for the control sediment these results indicated that the addition of lmb may temporarily increase the bacterial community diversity in the bottom sediment the lmb can form a 2 3 mm thin layer across sediment water interface song et al 2020 this may create a new type of microenvironment across sediment water interface and hence favor the growth of different bacteria in the surface sediment on the other hand dredging can remove most of the upper organic and nutrient rich sediment and also associated bacteria however the diversity of sediment bacteria can recover over time as observed in this study the relative abundance of various bacterial taxa at phylum level in the sediments from different treatments at six sampling times are presented in fig 6 a the most dominant phyla were proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes nitrospirae acidobacteria and patescibacteria other phyla included actinobacteria verrucomicrobia epsilonbacteraeota planctomycetes omnitrophicaeota firmicutes gemmatimonadetes spirochaetes nitrospinae kiritimatiellaeota candidatus latescibacteria candidatus rokubacteria armatimonadetes elusimicrobia and cyanobacteria the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied between 25 and 55 depending on the treatment and season it seems that sediment dredging increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria proteobacteria phylum harbours a very diverse group of bacteria some of which have been reported to responsible for n cycling in sediment fan et al 2019 while others can reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide and thus promote the maintenance of anoxic conditions karnachuk et al 2005 as has been reported dredging may in some cases induce the release of nitrogen in sediment and consequently favor the growth of proteobacteria yin et al 2019 in situ inactivation by lmb did not notably change the relative abundance of proteobacteria as compared to the control representational difference analysis rda was performed to visualize possible correlations between bacterial communities and p fractions in the sediments fig 6b the length of arrowheads show that both mobile p and hcl p ca p can significantly p 0 05 affect the bacterial communities in sediments and these were mainly driven by control treatment and lmb addition respectively previous studies have reported that the input of p would be favor the growth of actinobacteria in soil dai et al 2020 for the first two sampling times the relative abundance of actinobacteria was slightly higher in the control sediment than in lmb inactivated and dredged sediment but in april 2019 the relative abundance also decreased in the control indicating the influence of seasons in bacterial communities also some study also indicated that the lack of p would promote the growth of gemmatimonadetes liang et al 2020 the actual role of the detected bacteria in influencing the sediment p loading should be further investigated 3 5 mode of sediment internal p control by dredging and in situ inactivation and the implication for sediment management in eutrophic lakes the aim of controlling internal sediment p loading in lakes is to persistently reduce the p fluxes across sediment water interface over a substantial areal extent to reduce the mass load of labile p able to be utilised by algal biomass results of this and a previous study indicate that p fluxes are positively correlated with sediment mobile p fig s2 ding et al 2018a therefore control of sediment mobile p can be considered an effective method to reduce internal p loading and the potential for p release in a eutrophic lake most commonly this includes the two methods investigated here that application of a p binding inactivation agent in this case lmb or the removal of surface sediment often enriched in p via dredging in the present study dredging and lmb inactivation have both been demonstrated to reduce the sediment mobile p concentration and consequently decrease p fluxes across sediment water interface a schematic representation of the respective mechanisms of dredging and in situ lmb inactivation on the sediment internal p loading is shown in fig 7 in sediment p inactivation an agent such as lmb can markedly increase sediment p adsorption capacity and decrease pore water p concentration this is achieved by lmb transforming the sediment mobile p into a fraction that can be nominally equated with the ca p fraction in contrast to the application of sediment p inactivation agents such as lmb dredging aims to remove the uppermost organic and nutrient enriched sediment to reduce both the total nutrient inventory but also assimilable carbon in the organic matter that may facilitate the development of microbially driven anoxic conditions leading to nutrient release it is likely however that the effects of dredging gradually decrease over time due to the accumulation of new often nutrient and organic matter enriched sediment in this scenario there is little prospect of p being converted into less mobile or even immobile forms with a greater propensity also for release during anoxic and or warmer period as demonstrated in this study in contrast the effects of the lmb are more pervasive in that bioturbation may periodically entrain and intimately mix both lmb and newly deposited sediment into lower depths with labile p likely to be bound by lmb into less mobile forms irrespective of temperature or redox status however future field large scale experiment still should be carried out to investigate the two methods dredging and in situ adsorbent inactivation in the control of sediment internal p loading in eutrophic lakes 4 conclusion a long term field sediment cores incubation study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of in situ inactivation using lmb and dredging for the control of sediment internal p loading in a eutrophic lake both lmb inactivation and dredging can decrease pore water p concentration and its flux from sediment when compared with control sediment however lmb addition may confer a more stable remediation option than sediment dredging for the control of pore water p concentration and fluxes as identified in this study during seasonal variation lanthanum modified bentonite inactivation can significantly reduce the percentage of mobile p and increase the percentage of stable forms of p in relation to total p in sediment compared with the control sediment in contrast dredging did not change the percentage of mobile p relative to total p furthermore lmb addition can increase the diversity of bacterial communities in sediment whereas dredging appears to temporarily decrease bacterial diversity the results of this study indicated that lmb inactivation may potentially offer improved management outcomes over dredging in the control of sediment internal p loading in eutrophic lakes however further research is required to investigate the long term effects of the two methods and the role that microorganisms may play in p mobilization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

dealing with the remediation of sediment p load is a critical step for the effective management of water bodies this selection often with a substantial associated cost douglas et al 2016 will to some extent determine the success of lake restoration currently few studies have been undertaken to compare the two methods in the efficiency of sediment p loading management therefore a simulated field sediment core experiment was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of dredging and in situ inactivation on the reduction of sediment p loading including porewater p concentration p flux and p forms transformation furthermore the changes in bacterial community in the dredged and inactivated sediment were also analyzed and compared to the changes in sediment p fractions the results of this study will inform the selection of methods for the management of internal sediment p loading in eutrophic lakes 2 material and method 2 1 materials lanthanum modified bentonite phoslock was obtained from beijing fusileke water solutions ltd and was used without further modification intact sediment cores no less than 50 cm long were collected from western lake chaohu 117 3489 n 31 687 e using core sampler 8 8 cm in diameter and 60 cm in length on january 2019 the site was selected due to the known high sediment p and n internal loading based on previous study yang et al 2020 in total 70 sediment cores were collected for the experiments all of the sediment cores were temporarily brought to shore for handing approximately 100 l water was collected from the sampling site for the experiments 2 2 experimental design a total of 54 sediment cores were randomly selected and placed into experimental tubes followed by filling with lake water a total of 18 sediment cores were used

dredging 3 lanthanum modified bentonite lmb sediment cores with lmb added in a ratio of 100 1 based on the mass of mobile p where the amount of mobile p was estimated from that present in surface sediment 0 5 cm in the sediment cores and the soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the overlying water to avoid the deposition of suspended particulate matter into the sediment cores all sediment tubes were covered with polyamide screens with an 800 mesh 18 μm mesh size and which was periodically changed all sediment tubes were then placed into the field observation platform 31 42 6 53 n 117 23 19 23 e with submersible stainless steel frames to house the cores and designed to simulate actual lake environmental conditions the three groups of treated sediment cores were placed in stainless steel frames and submerged at the bottom of the lake and tethered with a nylon rope connected to the platform the sediment tubes were retrieved after 30 feb 2019 60 march 2019 90 april 2019 180 july 2019 270 october 2019 and 360 days january 2020 at each sampling time nine sediment tubes three sediment tubes for each treatment were collected and used to measure p flux and sediment p fractions and analysis for bacterial community composition following the last sampling diffusive gradients in thin film dgt measurements were performed with detailed information mentioned below 2 3 pore water sampling p fluxes and diffusive gradients in thin film dgt measurements in inactivated and dredged sediment the p fluxes across the sediment water interface were measured by a high resolution peeper hr peeper sampling method at each sampling time detailed information on the use of hr peeper can be found in the supplementary material the p concentration in sediment pore water in the hr peeper was measured and used for calculation of the p fluxes across sediment water interface the po4 3 fluxes j across the sediment water interface from the control and treated sediments were estimated from the pore water profiles of po4 3 using fick s first law of diffusion 1 j φ d s δ c δ x x 0 where φ is porosity ds is the bulk sediment diffusion coefficient and δ c δ x x 0 is the pore water concentration gradient across the sediment water interface ds was calculated from the diffusion coefficient of h2po4 in water using φ3 for φ 0 7 two days before the end of the final sediment core incubations commercial zr oxide diffusive gradients in thin films zr oxide dgt probes easy sensor ltd www easysensor net were used to measure the two dimensional 2d labile p for each treatment the dgt probes were inserted vertically into the three groups of sediment cores and retrieved 24 hrs after deployment the high resolution 2d labile p determination and analytical methods are described in detail by ding et al ding et al 2015 2 4 phosphorus fraction and sediment properties analysis phosphorus fractions in the sediment were determined using the sequential extraction method developed of rydin 2000 as described in supplementary material according to zhang et al 2014 with some modifications in brief air dried sediment p was fractioned using nh4cl p loosely sorbed p bd p fe p naoh nrp org p naoh rp al p hcl p ca p and residual p res p the p concentration in each step was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method and expressed as an average of the two duplicate analyses the total phosphorus tp in sediment was estimated as the sum of the six p fractions the water content was measured by drying sediment samples at 105 c for 24 hrs to a constant weight and organic content using the loss on ignition method loi 550 cfor 4 hrs in order to study the composition of the benthic microbial community around 1 0 g surface sediment 0 2 cm from various treatments at different sampling times was sampled for dna extraction the dna was extracted with a soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions and then sequenced in an illumina miseq platform personal biotechnology company shanghai china detailed information on sequencing and data analysis is provided in the supplementary material 2 5 statistical analysis significant differences in variables p flux p fractions and pore water p concentration among treatments were identified through one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test typically homogeneity of variance for the obtained data was tested and data of the test values 0 05 were adopted for the anova analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 ibm new york usa with significant levels p 0 05 and p 0 01 reported correlations between bacteria community structure and environmental variables were explored with the linear model based redundancy analysis rda using the software canoco for windows version 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties the nutrient concentrations in the sediment used in this study are listed in table s1 the average concentrations of total p tp and total n tn in the cores were 1003 mg kg and 1938 mg kg respectively these tp and tn were 1 6 and 1 2 times of that of average of tp and tn in lake chaohu respectively yang et al 2020 confirming that the site chosen for this study was likely to constitute a region of higher internal nutrient loading the high concentrations of tp and tn confirm that this area has received long term pollution load from the naifei river which flows through the urban area of hefei city the mobile p fraction the sum of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp was estimated to be 395 mg kg or 39 of the tp the loss on ignition loi of the sediment was 6 5 as indicated table s1 3 2 pore water p concentration fluxes and p supply capacity from dredged and inactivated sediment the temporal variation of sediment pore water p concentrations along sediment depth from the three treatments are presented in fig 1 the results indicated that the pore water srp concentration in the control cores increased with temperature reflecting seasonal variations fig s1 maximum srp concentrations in the control sediment typically occurred at 2 3 cm below the sediment water interface and then decreased steadily with sediment depth in comparison porewater srp concentrations in the dredged and lmb treated sediment showed considerably less variation in the profiles as a function of depth with many of the profiles often indistinguishable within one standard deviation fig 1 a seasonal variation of porewater srp in both concentration and depth from control sediments has been reported in previous studies markovic et al 2019 yang et al 2020 higher temperatures will often accelerate microbially mediated degradation of organic matter in sediment which may increase srp concentrations in sediment pore water james 2017 chen et al 2018b van dael et al 2020 both dredging and lmb inactivation can effectively reduce the p concentration in sediment porewater and this is especially evident in warmer seasons july 2019 and october 2019 fig 1 for example dredging and lmb inactivation reduced average porewater srp concentrations at day 270 by 60 and 69 respectively when compared with the control sediment this outcome is important for the management of eutrophic lake sediment internal p loading particularly where higher sediment nutrient fluxes can be observed during the summer where algal blooms may occur markovic et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the strong reduction of sediment pore water p concentrations by the addition of lmb in particular will also reduce the magnitude of p release from sediment estimated p fluxes across sediment water interface from the three treatments are presented in fig 2 the of p flux from the three sediment treatments reflected sediment pore water p concentrations fig 1 with higher p fluxes observed in warmer seasons and reduced fluxes at lower temperatures gibbons and bridgeman 2020 the control sediment p fluxes gradually increased from 0 27 mg m2 d in feb 2019 to 4 12 mg m2 d in oct 2019 and then decreased to 0 24 mg m2 d in january 2020 in comparison sediment from dredging and lmb treatments maintained relatively low p fluxes with reductions of 80 and 92 respectively compared with the control sediment in october 2019 on average dredging and in situ lmb inactivation reduced the p flux by 82 and 90 respectively relative to the control sediment importantly lmb always performed better in reducing the sediment p flux than sediment dredging over the 360 days of field incubation to further investigate the long term control effects of different engineering methods on sediment p loading sediment labile p was measured using a high resolution 2d method at the end of the experiment fig 3 the 2d image of sediment labile p reflected the effects of dredging and in situ inactivation by lmb high dgt labile p concentration or fluxes were observed in intermediate and deeper sediment horizons in control and dredged sediments respectively furthermore a number of more intense hot spot sites were observed for the control relative to the lmb inactivated sediment in contrast a deeper zone of sediment labile p was observed in the 60 to 80 cm depth interval of the dredged core fig 3 also noteworthy is a zone of low sediment labile p around the margins of the lmb inactivated core which may reflect downward migration potentially controlled by bioturbation and wind induced redistribution of this material following application previous studies have indicated that the lmb can migrate into deeper sediment via bioturbation ding et al 2018b van oosterhout et al 2020 therefore it is likely that any migrated lmb in deeper sediment can react with mobile p in sediment and thus reduce its ability to diffuse into pore water and or into the overlying water column dithmer et al 2016 in contrast it is likely that the mobility of p from the dredged sediment may increase often due to the deposition of new p rich sediment such that the remedial effects of dredging will decrease over time a calculated r value expressed as the ratio of dgt labile p contained in the sediment relative to sediment pore water p is also shown in fig 3 the dgt measured fractions come from pore water and the further release of the solute from the sediment solids to resupply the pore water zhang et al 1995 the lower of r value the more difficult p diffusion from sediment to pore water is likely to be zhang et al 1998 the average r value from the lmb inactivated sediment was only 0 007 considerably lower than the r value from the control and dredged sediment of 0 44 and 0 34 respectively the r values of the lmb inactivated sediments were particularly low from 0 to 30 cm depth where the bulk of the sediment p flux was likely to originate this was in accordance with the estimated overall p flux fig 2 the changes of sediment pore water p concentration p fluxes and dgt measured p indicated that the lmb inactivation provides a potentially improved remediation outcome in terms of managing the sediment p flux via p binding relative to dredging where only the sediment is removed 3 3 p forms in dredged and lmb inactivated sediment the surface sediment p fractions in the three treatments during various incubation times are shown in fig 4 all p fractions were extracted from the air dried sediment as described in section 2 4 these results may be different from the p fractions extracted using wet sediment as indicated in previous studies zhang et al 2014 while this study has chosen to use air dried sediments in p fractionation experiments hupfer et al 1995 ruban et al 1999 kumar and anshumali 2019 a diversity of approaches exist including the use of freeze dried sediments ruttenberg 1992 meis et al 2012b kurek et al 2020 in addition to wet sediments rydin 2000 huser and pilgrim 2014 it is understood that changes in operationally defined p fractions may occur due to drying the outcomes in this study have only been used to give a general indication of the predominant p fractions in the sediment critically as will be presented later we have demonstrated major changes in the conversion of a number of p fractions following imposition if the two remediation techniques furthermore we have demonstrated that there has been a major change into an la p bound fraction following the application of lmb that would be unlikely to be dependent on whether wet or dry sediments were used in the p fractionation analysis the results indicate that the p compositions in the control dredged and inactivated sediments were substantially different and showed dynamic changes during seasonal and associated temperature variation in control sediment al p naoh rp was the main component of the total phosphorus 41 66 of sediment tp this is consistent with a previous study which indicated that al p predominated in western lake chaohu bottom sediment yang et al 2020 the mobile p concentration the sum of labile p iron bound p and organic fractions of p was in the range of 222 to 435 mg kg with an average concentration of 366 mg kg during the study the mobile p fraction accounted for an average of 33 of the tp the mobile p is regarded to be the chemically defined fraction responsible for the active sediment internal p loading in eutrophic lakes this is because this fraction of p has the potential to be released from sediment under anoxic conditions or as a result of microbial action reitzel et al 2005 hence the reduction of this concentration of mobile p is considered an effective method to reduce lake sediment internal p loading funes et al 2016 the relative proportions of p fractions from the lmb inactivated sediment was markedly different to that of the control and dredged sediment the mobile p concentration in the dredged and lmb inactivated sediment were in the range of 104 to 313 mg kg average 194 mg kg and 72 to 173 mg kg average149 mg kg respectively the results indicate that both sediment dredging and lmb addition can reduce the concentration of mobile p in sediment albeit by two distinct modes the mobile p concentration in the dredged sediment was lower than that of the mobile p concentration in control sediment however mobile p accounted for 19 to 33 average of 26 of tp in dredged sediment which is similar to that of the percentage of mobile p in control sediment 17 41 average 34 fig 5 in contrast the addition of lmb largely reduced the percentage of mobile p in sediment which was in the range of 6 to 17 average of 14 thus on average lmb addition reduced more than 60 of mobile p relative to that of the control sediment the nominally inert al p fraction in sediment was also significantly reduced after sediment dredging and lmb addition the lower al p fraction in dredged sediment was due to the al p fraction in natural sediment generally decreasing with sediment depth li et al 2020 however the al p fraction was still dominant in the dredged sediment average of 47 in contrast the al p fraction in the lmb inactivated sediment was on average 24 of sediment tp the reduced sediment al p fraction seems to have been transformed into stable la bound p assumed to be contained in the ca p fraction with this fraction increased significantly relative to the control and dredged sediment p 0 01 on average the ca p fraction in the lmb inactivated sediment was 4 6 and 5 2 times of that of the ca p fraction in the control and dredged sediment respectively this is consistent with many previous studies which reported that the lmb addition can increase the chemically defined ca p fraction in sediment meis et al 2012a li et al 2019 the transformation of mobile p in sediment into a stable nominally ca p bound fraction will likely be beneficial to the long term management of sediment p in eutrophic lakes epe et al 2017 this is because the p bound to lmb is considered stable and thus will likely reduce the extent of eutrophication arising from internal p loading nürnberg 2017 3 4 bacterial community in dredged and inactivated sediment and the relationship with sediment p fractions the bacterial community diversity in sediment from different treatments and sampling times is listed in table s3 the results indicated that the sequencing depth was enough because the coverage of the samples was more than 94 which means that most of the bacterial otus in each sample were captured the results indicated that the remediation method can influence the bacterial diversity of the sediment for the first four sampling times the bacterial diversity indexes such as chao l ace and shannon in lmb amended sediment were higher than those for the control sediment on the other hand for the first two and last two sampling times the values of chao l ace and shannon indexes for the dredged sediment were lower than those for the control sediment these results indicated that the addition of lmb may temporarily increase the bacterial community diversity in the bottom sediment the lmb can form a 2 3 mm thin layer across sediment water interface song et al 2020 this may create a new type of microenvironment across sediment water interface and hence favor the growth of different bacteria in the surface sediment on the other hand dredging can remove most of the upper organic and nutrient rich sediment and also associated bacteria however the diversity of sediment bacteria can recover over time as observed in this study the relative abundance of various bacterial taxa at phylum level in the sediments from different treatments at six sampling times are presented in fig 6 a the most dominant phyla were proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes nitrospirae acidobacteria and patescibacteria other phyla included actinobacteria verrucomicrobia epsilonbacteraeota planctomycetes omnitrophicaeota firmicutes gemmatimonadetes spirochaetes nitrospinae kiritimatiellaeota candidatus latescibacteria candidatus rokubacteria armatimonadetes elusimicrobia and cyanobacteria the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied between 25 and 55 depending on the treatment and season it seems that sediment dredging increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria proteobacteria phylum harbours a very diverse group of bacteria some of which have been reported to responsible for n cycling in sediment fan et al 2019 while others can reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide and thus promote the maintenance of anoxic conditions karnachuk et al 2005 as has been reported dredging may in some cases induce the release of nitrogen in sediment and consequently favor the growth of proteobacteria yin et al 2019 in situ inactivation by lmb did not notably change the relative abundance of proteobacteria as compared to the control representational difference analysis rda was performed to visualize possible correlations between bacterial communities and p fractions in the sediments fig 6b the length of arrowheads show that both mobile p and hcl p ca p can significantly p 0 05 affect the bacterial communities in sediments and these were mainly driven by control treatment and lmb addition respectively previous studies have reported that the input of p would be favor the growth of actinobacteria in soil dai et al 2020 for the first two sampling times the relative abundance of actinobacteria was slightly higher in the control sediment than in lmb inactivated and dredged sediment but in april 2019 the relative abundance also decreased in the control indicating the influence of seasons in bacterial communities also some study also indicated that the lack of p would promote the growth of gemmatimonadetes liang et al 2020 the actual role of the detected bacteria in influencing the sediment p loading should be further investigated 3 5 mode of sediment internal p control by dredging and in situ inactivation and the implication for sediment management in eutrophic lakes the aim of controlling internal sediment p loading in lakes is to persistently reduce the p fluxes across sediment water interface over a substantial areal extent to reduce the mass load of labile p able to be utilised by algal biomass results of this and a previous study indicate that p fluxes are positively correlated with sediment mobile p fig s2 ding et al 2018a therefore control of sediment mobile p can be considered an effective method to reduce internal p loading and the potential for p release in a eutrophic lake most commonly this includes the two methods investigated here that application of a p binding inactivation agent in this case lmb or the removal of surface sediment often enriched in p via dredging in the present study dredging and lmb inactivation have both been demonstrated to reduce the sediment mobile p concentration and consequently decrease p fluxes across sediment water interface a schematic representation of the respective mechanisms of dredging and in situ lmb inactivation on the sediment internal p loading is shown in fig 7 in sediment p inactivation an agent such as lmb can markedly increase sediment p adsorption capacity and decrease pore water p concentration this is achieved by lmb transforming the sediment mobile p into a fraction that can be nominally equated with the ca p fraction in contrast to the application of sediment p inactivation agents such as lmb dredging aims to remove the uppermost organic and nutrient enriched sediment to reduce both the total nutrient inventory but also assimilable carbon in the organic matter that may facilitate the development of microbially driven anoxic conditions leading to nutrient release it is likely however that the effects of dredging gradually decrease over time due to the accumulation of new often nutrient and organic matter enriched sediment in this scenario there is little prospect of p being converted into less mobile or even immobile forms with a greater propensity also for release during anoxic and or warmer period as demonstrated in this study in contrast the effects of the lmb are more pervasive in that bioturbation may periodically entrain and intimately mix both lmb and newly deposited sediment into lower depths with labile p likely to be bound by lmb into less mobile forms irrespective of temperature or redox status however future field large scale experiment still should be carried out to investigate the two methods dredging and in situ adsorbent inactivation in the control of sediment internal p loading in eutrophic lakes 4 conclusion a long term field sediment cores incubation study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of in situ inactivation using lmb and dredging for the control of sediment internal p loading in a eutrophic lake both lmb inactivation and dredging can decrease pore water p concentration and its flux from sediment when compared with control sediment however lmb addition may confer a more stable remediation option than sediment dredging for the control of pore water p concentration and fluxes as identified in this study during seasonal variation lanthanum modified bentonite inactivation can significantly reduce the percentage of mobile p and increase the percentage of stable forms of p in relation to total p in sediment compared with the control sediment in contrast dredging did not change the percentage of mobile p relative to total p furthermore lmb addition can increase the diversity of bacterial communities in sediment whereas dredging appears to temporarily decrease bacterial diversity the results of this study indicated that lmb inactivation may potentially offer improved management outcomes over dredging in the control of sediment internal p loading in eutrophic lakes however further research is required to investigate the long term effects of the two methods and the role that microorganisms may play in p mobilization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17356,uv sulfite process in the absence of oxygen was previously applied as an advanced reduction process for the removal of many halogenated organics and inorganics in water and wastewater here it was found that uv sulfite process in the presence of oxygen could act as an advanced oxidation process specifically the oxysulfur radicals including sulfate radical so 4 and sulfite peroxomonosulfate radicals so 3 so 5 played important roles on the degradation of iopamidol ipm as a typical iodinated contrast media icm furthermore the contribution of so 4 on ipm removal gradually increased as ph increased from 5 to 7 and that of so 3 so 5 decreased besides all water quality parameters i e chloride cl iodide i and natural organic matter nom investigated here exhibited inhibitory effect on ipm removal three inorganic iodine species i e i reactive iodine species and iodate io3 were detected in uv sulfite process in the presence of oxygen while only i was detected in that without oxygen during uv sulfite ethanol uv photolysis and uv peroxydisulfate pds tert butyl alcohol tba processes thirteen transformation products including eleven deiodinated products of ipm were identified by ultra hplc quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms besides these products generated by direct uv photolysis so 4 and so 3 so 5 were further distinguished the acute toxicity assay of vibrio fischeri indicated that transformation products by uv sulfite under aerobic conditions were less toxic than that by direct uv photolysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv sulfite dissolved oxygen advanced oxidation process ipm 1 introduction uv photolysis and uv based technologies have been widely applied in drinking water purification and wastewater reclamation yang et al 2019 luo et al 2016 fang et al 2014 he et al 2019 generally the uv based technologies mainly include advanced oxidation processes aops and advanced reduction processes arps the arps involve the generation of reactive reductants such as sulfur dioxide radicals so 2 sulfite radicals so 3 hydrogen atoms h and hydrated electron e a q where e a q is regarded as the most reductive species with a high reduction potential 2 9 v at alkaline phs xie et al 2017 sulfite as one of the most widely applied inorganic reductant is often used to generate e a q under uv photolysis due to its high quantum yield sun et al 2018 gu et al 2017 gu et al 2016 bao et al 2018 li et al 2014 the uv sulfite as an arp showed great potentials for the elimination of some halogenated organics and inorganics in water and wastewater for instance li et al 2012 reported that monochloroacetic acid mcaa could be almost completely removed by uv sulfite in 15 min at ph 9 2 the degradation efficiency of para bromophenol 4 bp could be up to about 100 in uv sulfite process within 10 min xie et al 2017 during these processes above e a q was the mainly reactive species conducive to target contaminants degradation in general oxygen as a potential capture for e a q which could react with e a q at the second order rate constant of 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 xiao et al 2017 was removed from the uv sulfite system before initiating reactions however interestingly deister and warneck 1990 reported that the presence of oxygen might result in so 4 generation during uv sulfite process suggesting that uv sulfite might be regarded as a promising aop however up till now there is limited information on the contaminant degradation by uv sulfite process with oxygen the iodinated contrast media icm has been widely used in medical diagnoses gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 radjenovic et al 2013 due to its extensive use icm is frequently detected in sewage treatment plant effluents rivers and groundwater where the maximum concentration even reaches to 100 µg l ternes et al 2000 oleksy frenze et al 2000 although icm is nontoxic to humans its presence is likely responsible for the formation of absorbable organic iodine aoi and iodinated disinfection byproducts with highly genotoxicity and cytotoxicity kummerer et al 1998 richardson et al 2008 duirk et al 2011 li et al 2020 however icm cannot be effectively removed by conventional water treatment processes due to its high biochemical stability besides as reported previously the degradation efficiency of icm by some oxidation processes e g ferrate ozone monochloramine and chlorine is also unsatisfactory seitz et al 2008 wendel et al 2014 thus aops involving hydroxyl radical ho and or so 4 are adopted for the removal of icm duan et al 2017 recently some reports chen et al 2021 luo et al 2019 arslan alaton et al 2017 also showed that so 4 participated in contaminants removal during uv sulfite process under aerobic conditions for instance 95 iopamidol ipm as a typical icm could be removed by the combination of persulfate ps and zero valent aluminum zva due to the high yield of so 4 therein arslan alaton et al 2017 as reported by chen et al 2021 the maximum steady state concentration of s o 4 could reach to 1 12 10 12 m during electrolysis assisted uv sulfite oxidation system where electrolysis was applied to enhance o2 concentration however the performance of uv sulfite in the presence of oxygen as well as the contribution of so 4 formed herein for icm degradation remain unclear at present in this study the degradation of ipm by

process and identification of reactive species under aerobic conditions the degradation of ipm in uv sulfite process in comparison with uv photolysis process was shown as fig 1 the half life of ipm degradation by uv sulfite process was less than 10 min while that under uv photolysis was about 20 min control experiments showed that less than 4 0 ipm figure s1 was removed by sulfite 500 μm alone indicating that ipm showed weak reactivity towards sulfite therefore the enhanced transformation of ipm was attributed to some reactive species generated in uv sulfite process it was well known that the primary reactive species mainly included so 3 and e a q in uv sulfite process eq 5 when oxygen was present so 3 could be further transformed into so 5 and e a q could be captured rapidly at a great high reaction rate constant 10 10 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 generating o2 moreover there might exist so 4 in uv sulfite system under aerobic conditions according to the reactions shown as eq 6 8 as reported previously yang et al 2015 hydrogen radical ho was likely generated from so 4 transformation under aquatic solution conditions thus so 3 so 5 o2 so 4 and or ho might be the reactive species conducive to the improved degradation of ipm 5 s o 3 2 h v s o 3 e a q 6 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 7 s o 5 s o 3 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 8 s o 5 s o 5 s o 4 o 2 further experiments were conducted to ascertain that which reactive species as aforementioned i e so 3 so 5 o2 so 4 and or ho were involved in ipm degradation as shown in fig 2 the addition of excessive sod as a scavenger for o2 didn t inhibit the removal of ipm in uv sulfite process suggesting that the effect of o2 on ipm degradation was insignificant jeong et al 2010 also reported that o2 didn t react with diatrizoate and iohexol similar with ipm in chemical structure in γ irradiation processes moreover the addition of tba showed negligible impacts on ipm degradation as shown in figure s2 the degradation of ipm by uv was very similar to that by uv h2o2 tba implying that the product of tba with ho exhibited negligible reactivity towards ipm however the degradation of ipm was impeded when ethanol in large excess was added it s reported that the reactivity of so 3 so 5 towards ethanol was very weak while ethanol could react with so 4 at a high rate constant deister and warneck 1990 similarly ipm could hardly be degraded by the product of ethanol with ho figure s2 moreover the various degradation efficiency of benzoic acid by uv photolysis uv sulfite tba and uv sulfite ethanol process figure s3 demonstrated the so 4 generation in uv sulfite process under aerobic conditions overall the results suggested that so 4 contributed to ipm removal with uv sulfite process with oxygen significantly there was still differences on the degradation efficiency of ipm between uv sulfite ethanol system and uv photolysis system implying that so 3 so 5 was also conducive to ipm removal in summary the presence of so 4 and so 3 so 5 resulted in the enhancement of ipm removal when oxygen was present in uv sulfite process 3 2 contribution of reactive species on ipm degradation in uv sulfite process the contribution of uv photolysis and reactive species including so 4 and so 3 so 5 to the degradation of ipm in uv sulfite process at ph 5 7 was calculated according to the method described in text s1 as could be seen in fig 3 uv photolysis played a dominant role in degrading ipm in uv sulfite process over the investigated ph ranging from 5 to 7 for instance uv photolysis resulted in over 80 0 ipm removal at ph 5 after 30 min and its contribution was marginally affected by varying phs as ph ranged from 5 to 7 the contribution of so 4 in degrading ipm increased from 11 3 to 19 8 in contrary the contribution of so 3 so 5 decreased from 7 5 to 4 5 s iv with pka1 1 76 and pka2 7 2 tartar and garretson 1941 mainly existed in the forms of so3 2 and hso3 in the investigated range of ph i e 5 7 tartar and garretson 1941 increasing ph elevated the distribution of so3 2 therefore promoting the transformation from so 5 into so 4 eq 7 furthermore so 4 could react with ipm at a rapid second order rate constant of 5 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 zhao et al 2019 thus the increase of ph enhanced the contribution of so 4 on ipm degradation but decreased that of so 3 so 5 3 3 effect of water matrixes on ipm degradation by uv sulfite with oxygen 3 3 1 effect of cl as previously reported liu et al 2020 the cl concentration varied from 0 5 to 500 mm in different natural waters e g freshwater surface water groundwater and seawater the impact of cl on the degradation of ipm by uv sulfite with oxygen at ph 7 was studied fig 4 showed that the degradation efficiency of ipm decreased gradually as the concentration of cl increased from 0 1 to 2 0 mm the removal of ipm reduced by 11 5 when 2 0 mm cl was present in uv sulfite system in comparison with that without cl similarly luo et al 2019 reported that the existence of cl 0 5 mm also reduced the rate constant of 2 4 bromophenol by uv pds from 0 23 to 0 11 min 1 cl was one of the vital factors affecting the degradation efficiency of organic contaminants in so 4 based aops since so 4 could react with cl to generate cl and or cl2 at rather rapid reaction rates although cl was a strong oxidant with redox potential of 2 55 v lei et al 2019 it selectively reacted with organic contaminants it s reported that cl showed insignificant reactivity towards ipm zhao et al 2019 kong et al 2018 indicating that the conversion from so 4 to cl was likely responsible for the decrease of ipm degradation efficiency besides the second order rate constant of ipm with cl2 was 2 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 which was nearly 3 orders of magnitude slower than that with so 4 5 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 zhao et al 2019 therefore even the existence of cl2 would inhibit the degradation of ipm therein 3 3 2 effect of i i was ubiquitously present in aqueous environment with 20 μg l average concentration in raw water and the maximum concentration of 54 mg l in hydraulic fracturing wastewaters li et al 2020 respectively fig 5 showed the effect of i on ipm degradation by uv sulfite with oxygen at ph 7 the presence of i impeded the degradation of ipm and the inhibitory effect became gradually evident as i concentration increased the removal efficiency of ipm reduced by about 16 0 when the addition of i was 50 μm as shown in fig 5 some reactive iodine species ris e g i i2 i2 and i3 generated from uv photolysis of i could react with so3 2 according to eq 9 12 which boosting the decomposition of so3 2 figure s4 however the reactions of i3 and i2 with so3 2 at rather high rate constants would result in the generation non reactive oxysulfur species as shown in eq 11 12 terminating chain reactions regarding to so 3 then the formation of reactive species i e so 3 so 5 and so 4 was therefore inhibited in addition i was more competent than sulfite on absorbing uv light since the molar absorption coefficient of i 885 m 1 c m 1 was higher than that of sulfite 49 m 1 c m 1 under the same condition sauer et al 2014 therefore photoionization of sulfite would be also inhibited by i with rather high concentration 27 7 μm competitive absorption 9 i s o 3 2 i s o 3 10 i 2 s o 3 2 2 i s o 3 11 i 3 s o 3 2 2 i i s o 3 k 28 2 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 12 i 2 s o 3 2 i i s o 3 k 28 3 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 3 3 effect of nom nom was one of the most important factors affecting the contaminant degradation efficiency during uv alone photolysis or other uv based treatment processes sun et al 2019 wu et al 2017 khan et al 2017 as reported liu et al 2020 the maximum concentration of nom could reach to 18 mg l in surface water hence the effect of nom 0 1 5 mg l on the elimination of ipm 2 μm at ph 7 in uv sulfite process was investigated fig 6 the presence of nom inhibited the degradation of ipm in uv sulfite process and the degradation efficiency gradually decreased from 79 9 to 64 2 as the concentration of nom increased from 0 0 to 1 5 mg l the inhibitory effect of nom could be attributed to two aspects i nom exerted an inner filter effect since it could absorb uv light at 254 nm zhao et al 2019 ii nom was overwhelmingly capable of capturing so 4 nom could react with so 4 at second order reaction rate constant of 6 8 10 3 l m g c 1 s 1 due to its abundance in hydrogens and non bonding electrons conducive to transfer electron lutze et al 2015 ghauch et al 2017 3 4 effect of oxygen on the degradation products and pathways 3 4 1 formation of inorganic iodine species as shown in fig 7 a the generation of i increased gradually in uv sulfite system with without o2 as reactions went on after 20 min reaction the generation of i in uv sulfite system without o2 was more than that with o2 3 8 μm vs 2 6 μm the generation of reactive iodine increased rapidly within the initial 5 min and then dwindled in uv sulfite system with o2 while there was rarely reactive iodine detected in that without o2 fig 7b besides the formation of iodate in uv sulfite system with o2 generally increased as the reaction went on while almost no iodate generated in that without o2 fig 7c direct uv photolysis could lead to deiodinaiton of icm according to previous reports hu et al 2019a hu et al 2019b wu et al 2019 the higher generation of i in uv sulfite system without o2 might be attributed to the presence of e a q and or so 3 therein that were conducive to the deiodination of ipm however the generated i herein couldn t be furthermore oxidized into reactive iodine and or iodate since both so 3 and e a q were very poor oxidants during uv sulfite process with o2 the existence of oxidants i e o2 so 4 and or so 3 so 5 transformed i into reactive iodine species and even iodate interestingly the generation of reactive iodine species here suddenly decreased at 5min fig 7b and meanwhile sulfite concentration data didn t show was below the detection limitation the decline of reactive iodine species might be attributed to the disappearance of so 4 which was generated from reaction between sulfite and so 5 and or so 5 self decomposition then o2 as the only oxidant gradually oxidized these reactive iodine species into iodate 3 4 2 identification of transformation products and pathways in order to identify and differentiate the transformation products tps generated by various reactive species in uv sulfite process under aerobic condition the degradation experiments at ph 7 under aerobic condition of ipm in uv sulfite ethanol process in comparison with direct uv photolysis and uv pds tba process were carried out the accurate m z values and postulated structures of tps detected were provided in table s1 figure s5a m showed the ms spectra of thirteen tps i e tp 1 2 and 5 13 including eleven deiodinated tps and two undeiodinated tps tp 3 and 4 3 4 2 1 direct uv photolysis there are seven tps detected in uv photolysis process tp 2 i e c17h23i2n3o9 had an additional oxygen and hydrogen atom and lost an iodine atom as compared with parent ipm i e c17h22i3n3o8 indicating the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring compared with parent ipm tp 3 i e c14h18i3n3o6 was formed by the break of amide bond on asymmetric side chain tp 5 i e c17h21i2n3o9 had an additional oxygen atom and lost a hydrogen and iodine atom as compared with parent ipm suggesting the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and the transformation of hydroxyl group to aldehyde group on the side chain tp 6 i e c17h19i2n3o9 lost three hydrogen atoms and an iodine atom and had an additional oxygen atom as compared with parent ipm indicating aldehylation at two sites of the side chain besides the hydroxylation on the aromatic ring tp 9 i e c17h22in3o10 had two extra oxygen atoms and lost two iodine atoms as compared with parent ipm suggesting that two iodine atoms were replaced by hydroxyl groups and a hydroxyl group on the side chain was converted into aldehyde group tp 12 i e c17h23n3o10 had two extra oxygen atoms and a hydrogen atom and lost three iodine atoms as compared with parent ipm suggesting that two of three iodine atoms were replaced by hydroxyl groups and aldehylation took place on the side chain on the benzene ring of ipm molecular formula all these three iodine atoms were transformed into hydroxyl groups and the hydroxyl group on the side chain was oxidized into aldehyde group generating tp 13 c17h22n3o11 3 4 2 2 so 3 so 5 there are ten tps in total detected in uv sulfite ethanol process including tp 1 3 and tp 7 13 the existence of so 3 so 5 inhibited the formation of tp 5 and 6 generating from direct uv photolysis the residual tps i e tp 1 7 8 10 and 11 were generated only by so 3 so 5 tp 1 i e c17h23i2n3o8 had an additional hydrogen atom and lost an iodine atom as compared with parent ipm indicating one iodine atom was removed from ipm two iodine atoms in ipm molecular structure were removed and one of them was hydroxylated generating tp 7 c17h24in3o9 similarly two of three iodine atoms in ipm molecular structure were substituted for hydroxyl groups forming tp 8 i e c17h24in3o10 the formation of tp 10 i e c17h25n3o9 and tp 11 i e c17h25n3o10 resulted from all three iodine atoms removal following hydroxylation at one site in the former and two in the latter 3 4 2 3 so 4 three tps i e tp 3 4 and 9 in total were identified in uv pds tba process the formation of tp 4 was attributed to the presence of so 4 and the formation of tp 2 5 6 12 and 13 was impeded due to the presence of so 4 the generation of tp 4 i e c14h16i3n3o8 resulted from the amide bond break on asymmetric side chain following the oxidation of amino group 3 4 3 proposed transformation pathway 3 4 3 1 direct uv photolysis pathway uv photolysis led to the break of c i bond and then the hydroxylation occurred in the presence of h2o oh generating tp 2 scheme 1 furthermore tp 2 was transformed into tp 5 via the aldehylation on the side chain tp 5 was converted into tp 6 and tp 9 by the further aldehylation on the side chain and the hydroxylation on the benzene ring respectively then tp 9 was further transformed into tp 12 and tp 13 by hydroxylation and deiodiantion on the benzene ring respectively besides uv photolysis attacked the amide bond on asymmetric side chain to generate tp 3 3 4 3 2 uv so 3 so 5 pathway tp 2 and tp 3 were also detected in uv sulfite ethanol process as compared with uv direct photolysis process scheme 1 due to the existence of so 3 so 5 tp 2 was transformed into tp 7 and tp 8 via deiodination and hydroxylation respectively on one hand the further deiodination and hydroxylation on the benzene ring converted tp 7 into tp 10 and tp 11 respectively the aldehylation took place on the side chain of tp 11 forming tp12 on the other hand tp 8 was transformed into tp 9 and tp 11 through the deiodination on the benzene and the aldehylation on the side chain respectively on the benzene ring the deiodination and hydroxylation could transform tp 9 into tp 12 and tp 13 respectively the aldehylation on the side chain of tp 11 could also generate tp 12 besides the formation of tp 1 resulted from ipm was also attributed to the existence of so 3 so 5 and tp 1 probably led to the formation of tp 7 and subsequent tps i e tp 10 12 3 4 3 3 uv so 4 pathway in uv pds ethanol process both tp 3 and tp 9 could be generated directly in the presence of so 4 scheme 1 different from uv direct photolysis the amino group in tp 3 molecule structure could be oxidized into nitro group forming tp 4 due to the strong oxidation of so 4 3 5 acute toxicity of transformation products in uv uv sulfite and uv pds tba processes the luminescence value of marine bacterium vibrio fischeri could reflect the acute toxicity of the parent compound and its transformation products which therefore was used as an indicator of toxicity in the present work the toxicity in uv sulfite process in the presence of oxygen was investigated as compared with direct uv photolysis process and uv pds tba process the l0 represented the initial luminescence i e the sample without treatment while l represented the luminescence of the sample at specific reaction time and condition therefore the decrease of l l0 indicated the toxicity increase of the sample and vice versa the acute toxicity of ipm and its transformation products in different treatment processes was shown in fig 8 as could be seen the ratio of l l0 gradually dwindled as the removal of ipm increased in direct uv photolysis process where the luminescence finally decreased to 43 6 relative to the initial value when 60 0 of ipm was eliminated the value of luminescence in uv sulfite process appeared to fluctuate with the increase of ipm removal efficiency the luminescence in uv sulfite process only reduced by about 16 2 compared with the original luminescence when the removal efficiency of ipm reached to 72 2 generally the value of luminescence in uv sulfite process was higher than that in direct uv photolysis process indicating that uv sulfite process weakened the toxicity of transformation products by comparison with direct uv photolysis process furthermore the luminescence in uv pds tba process with excessive tba slightly enhanced as ipm removal elevated the differential phenomenon on luminescence between uv sulfite process and uv pds tba process might be attributed to the contribution of so 3 so 5 on ipm degradation during the former process i e the transformation products generated by so 3 so 5 were more toxic than those by so 4 overall uv sulfite could be considered as a potential advanced oxidation process on ipm removal 4 conclusion sulfite enhanced the degradation of ipm by uv photolysis in the presence of dissolved oxygen therein so 4 as a strong oxidant radical together with another oxysulfur radicals i e so 3 so 5 played an indispensable role on ipm removal furthermore the increase of ph 5 7 enhanced the contribution of so 4 and inhibited that of so 3 so 5 on ipm degradation the degradation of ipm was restrained no matter when cl i or nom was present in uv sulfite system under aerobic condition here three inorganic iodine species i e i reactive iodine species and iodate io3 were detected specifically the concentration of both i and io3 gradually increased as reactions went on the time dependent variation profiles of reactive iodine species concentration contained two stages i e increased initially and then dwindled transformation products generated by various ways i e direct uv photolysis uv so 4 and uv so 3 so 5 were differentiated and the corresponding degradation mechanisms were elucidated the acute toxicity assay implied that the transformation products generated by so 3 so 5 were more toxic than those by so 4 compared with direct uv system uv sulfite system decreased the generation of toxic products suggesting uv sulfite system might be a promising technology on

17356,uv sulfite process in the absence of oxygen was previously applied as an advanced reduction process for the removal of many halogenated organics and inorganics in water and wastewater here it was found that uv sulfite process in the presence of oxygen could act as an advanced oxidation process specifically the oxysulfur radicals including sulfate radical so 4 and sulfite peroxomonosulfate radicals so 3 so 5 played important roles on the degradation of iopamidol ipm as a typical iodinated contrast media icm furthermore the contribution of so 4 on ipm removal gradually increased as ph increased from 5 to 7 and that of so 3 so 5 decreased besides all water quality parameters i e chloride cl iodide i and natural organic matter nom investigated here exhibited inhibitory effect on ipm removal three inorganic iodine species i e i reactive iodine species and iodate io3 were detected in uv sulfite process in the presence of oxygen while only i was detected in that without oxygen during uv sulfite ethanol uv photolysis and uv peroxydisulfate pds tert butyl alcohol tba processes thirteen transformation products including eleven deiodinated products of ipm were identified by ultra hplc quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms besides these products generated by direct uv photolysis so 4 and so 3 so 5 were further distinguished the acute toxicity assay of vibrio fischeri indicated that transformation products by uv sulfite under aerobic conditions were less toxic than that by direct uv photolysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv sulfite dissolved oxygen advanced oxidation process ipm 1 introduction uv photolysis and uv based technologies have been widely applied in drinking water purification and wastewater reclamation yang et al 2019 luo et al 2016 fang et al 2014 he et al 2019 generally the uv based technologies mainly include advanced oxidation processes aops and advanced reduction processes arps the arps involve the generation of reactive reductants such as sulfur dioxide radicals so 2 sulfite radicals so 3 hydrogen atoms h and hydrated electron e a q where e a q is regarded as the most reductive species with a high reduction potential 2 9 v at alkaline phs xie et al 2017 sulfite as one of the most widely applied inorganic reductant is often used to generate e a q under uv photolysis due to its high quantum yield sun et al 2018 gu et al 2017 gu et al 2016 bao et al 2018 li et al 2014 the uv sulfite as an arp showed great potentials for the elimination of some halogenated organics and inorganics in water and wastewater for instance li et al 2012 reported that monochloroacetic acid mcaa could be almost completely removed by uv sulfite in 15 min at ph 9 2 the degradation efficiency of para bromophenol 4 bp could be up to about 100 in uv sulfite process within 10 min xie et al 2017 during these processes above e a q was the mainly reactive species conducive to target contaminants degradation in general oxygen as a potential capture for e a q which could react with e a q at the second order rate constant of 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 xiao et al 2017 was removed from the uv sulfite system before initiating reactions however interestingly deister and warneck 1990 reported that the presence of oxygen might result in so 4 generation during uv sulfite process suggesting that uv sulfite might be regarded as a promising aop however up till now there is limited information on the contaminant degradation by uv sulfite process with oxygen the iodinated contrast media icm has been widely used in medical diagnoses gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 radjenovic et al 2013 due to its extensive use icm is frequently detected in sewage treatment plant effluents rivers and groundwater where the maximum concentration even reaches to 100 µg l ternes et al 2000 oleksy frenze et al 2000 although icm is nontoxic to humans its presence is likely responsible for the formation of absorbable organic iodine aoi and iodinated disinfection byproducts with highly genotoxicity and cytotoxicity kummerer et al 1998 richardson et al 2008 duirk et al 2011 li et al 2020 however icm cannot be effectively removed by conventional water treatment processes due to its high biochemical stability besides as reported previously the degradation efficiency of icm by some oxidation processes e g ferrate ozone monochloramine and chlorine is also unsatisfactory seitz et al 2008 wendel et al 2014 thus aops involving hydroxyl radical ho and or so 4 are adopted for the removal of icm duan et al 2017 recently some reports chen et al 2021 luo et al 2019 arslan alaton et al 2017 also showed that so 4 participated in contaminants removal during uv sulfite process under aerobic conditions for instance 95 iopamidol ipm as a typical icm could be removed by the combination of persulfate ps and zero valent aluminum zva due to the high yield of so 4 therein arslan alaton et al 2017 as reported by chen et al 2021 the maximum steady state concentration of s o 4 could reach to 1 12 10 12 m during electrolysis assisted uv sulfite oxidation system where electrolysis was applied to enhance o2 concentration however the performance of uv sulfite in the presence of oxygen as well as the contribution of so 4 formed herein for icm degradation remain unclear at present in this study the degradation of ipm by uv sulfite process in the presence of oxygen is investigated the study mainly focuses on 1 the identification of reactive species conducive to ipm degradation in uv sulfite process 2 the contribution of different reactive species to ipm degradation 3 the effect of water quality parameters i e chloride cl natural organic matter nom and iodide i on the degradation of ipm 4 the transformation products of ipm and 5 the toxicity of the transformation products 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials ipm was purchased from j k scientific ltd atrazine atz and peroxydisulfate pds

experimental procedure a collimated beam apparatus consisting of four low pressure mercury lamps 254 nm 10 w gph212t5l 4 heraeus was used for photolysis experiments as described previously liu et al 2015 the irradiance from the uv collimated beam was measured by a uv detector uvc radiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university beijing china and the uv irradiance measurement was 0 17 mw cm2 except when otherwise mentioned experiments were performed at room temperature 20 2 c under aerobic conditions typically reactions were initiated by adding 500 μμ sulfite into buffered solutions containing 2 μm ipm with without a constitute of interest i e cl nom and i solution ph was controlled using 10 mm phosphate buffer for ph 6 7 and 10 mm borate buffer for ph 8 9 sample was periodically withdrawn for determination of the residual ipm concentration transformation products and microtox test all experiments were conducted in duplicates and the average values and standard deviations were presented 2 3 analytical methods ipm and atz were analyzed using a waters 1525 hplc with a waters 2487 dual λ detector chromatographic separations were performed using a waters symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the mobile phase for ipm analysis consisted of an eluent of water 1 acetic acid and methanol with ratio of 90 10 at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min mobile phase with 40 of water 1 acetic acid and 60 methanol at flow rate of 1 ml min was used at 242 and 230 nm respectively i was determined by ion chromatograph dionex ics 3000 equipped with a sp gradient pump an anion self regenerating suppressor asrs 300 4 mm uv detector and an as40 autosampler transformation products of ipm were determined by ultra hplc quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q

process and identification of reactive species under aerobic conditions the degradation of ipm in uv sulfite process in comparison with uv photolysis process was shown as fig 1 the half life of ipm degradation by uv sulfite process was less than 10 min while that under uv photolysis was about 20 min control experiments showed that less than 4 0 ipm figure s1 was removed by sulfite 500 μm alone indicating that ipm showed weak reactivity towards sulfite therefore the enhanced transformation of ipm was attributed to some reactive species generated in uv sulfite process it was well known that the primary reactive species mainly included so 3 and e a q in uv sulfite process eq 5 when oxygen was present so 3 could be further transformed into so 5 and e a q could be captured rapidly at a great high reaction rate constant 10 10 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 generating o2 moreover there might exist so 4 in uv sulfite system under aerobic conditions according to the reactions shown as eq 6 8 as reported previously yang et al 2015 hydrogen radical ho was likely generated from so 4 transformation under aquatic solution conditions thus so 3 so 5 o2 so 4 and or ho might be the reactive species conducive to the improved degradation of ipm 5 s o 3 2 h v s o 3 e a q 6 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 7 s o 5 s o 3 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 8 s o 5 s o 5 s o 4 o 2 further experiments were conducted to ascertain that which reactive species as aforementioned i e so 3 so 5 o2 so 4 and or ho were involved in ipm degradation as shown in fig 2 the addition of excessive sod as a scavenger for o2 didn t inhibit the removal of ipm in uv sulfite process suggesting that the effect of o2 on ipm degradation was insignificant jeong et al 2010 also reported that o2 didn t react with diatrizoate and iohexol similar with ipm in chemical structure in γ irradiation processes moreover the addition of tba showed negligible impacts on ipm degradation as shown in figure s2 the degradation of ipm by uv was very similar to that by uv h2o2 tba implying that the product of tba with ho exhibited negligible reactivity towards ipm however the degradation of ipm was impeded when ethanol in large excess was added it s reported that the reactivity of so 3 so 5 towards ethanol was very weak while ethanol could react with so 4 at a high rate constant deister and warneck 1990 similarly ipm could hardly be degraded by the product of ethanol with ho figure s2 moreover the various degradation efficiency of benzoic acid by uv photolysis uv sulfite tba and uv sulfite ethanol process figure s3 demonstrated the so 4 generation in uv sulfite process under aerobic conditions overall the results suggested that so 4 contributed to ipm removal with uv sulfite process with oxygen significantly there was still differences on the degradation efficiency of ipm between uv sulfite ethanol system and uv photolysis system implying that so 3 so 5 was also conducive to ipm removal in summary the presence of so 4 and so 3 so 5 resulted in the enhancement of ipm removal when oxygen was present in uv sulfite process 3 2 contribution of reactive species on ipm degradation in uv sulfite process the contribution of uv photolysis and reactive species including so 4 and so 3 so 5 to the degradation of ipm in uv sulfite process at ph 5 7 was calculated according to the method described in text s1 as could be seen in fig 3 uv photolysis played a dominant role in degrading ipm in uv sulfite process over the investigated ph ranging from 5 to 7 for instance uv photolysis resulted in over 80 0 ipm removal at ph 5 after 30 min and its contribution was marginally affected by varying phs as ph ranged from 5 to 7 the contribution of so 4 in degrading ipm increased from 11 3 to 19 8 in contrary the contribution of so 3 so 5 decreased from 7 5 to 4 5 s iv with pka1 1 76 and pka2 7 2 tartar and garretson 1941 mainly existed in the forms of so3 2 and hso3 in the investigated range of ph i e 5 7 tartar and garretson 1941 increasing ph elevated the distribution of so3 2 therefore promoting the transformation from so 5 into so 4 eq 7 furthermore so 4 could react with ipm at a rapid second order rate constant of 5 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 zhao et al 2019 thus the increase of ph enhanced the contribution of so 4 on ipm degradation but decreased that of so 3 so 5 3 3 effect of water matrixes on ipm degradation by uv sulfite with oxygen 3 3 1 effect of cl as previously reported liu et al 2020 the cl concentration varied from 0 5 to 500 mm in different natural waters e g freshwater surface water groundwater and seawater the impact of cl on the degradation of ipm by uv sulfite with oxygen at ph 7 was studied fig 4 showed that the degradation efficiency of ipm decreased gradually as the concentration of cl increased from 0 1 to 2 0 mm the removal of ipm reduced by 11 5 when 2 0 mm cl was present in uv sulfite system in comparison with that without cl similarly luo et al 2019 reported that the existence of cl 0 5 mm also reduced the rate constant of 2 4 bromophenol by uv pds from 0 23 to 0 11 min 1 cl was one of the vital factors affecting the degradation efficiency of organic contaminants in so 4 based aops since so 4 could react with cl to generate cl and or cl2 at rather rapid reaction rates although cl was a strong oxidant with redox potential of 2 55 v lei et al 2019 it selectively reacted with organic contaminants it s reported that cl showed insignificant reactivity towards ipm zhao et al 2019 kong et al 2018 indicating that the conversion from so 4 to cl was likely responsible for the decrease of ipm degradation efficiency besides the second order rate constant of ipm with cl2 was 2 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 which was nearly 3 orders of magnitude slower than that with so 4 5 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 zhao et al 2019 therefore even the existence of cl2 would inhibit the degradation of ipm therein 3 3 2 effect of i i was ubiquitously present in aqueous environment with 20 μg l average concentration in raw water and the maximum concentration of 54 mg l in hydraulic fracturing wastewaters li et al 2020 respectively fig 5 showed the effect of i on ipm degradation by uv sulfite with oxygen at ph 7 the presence of i impeded the degradation of ipm and the inhibitory effect became gradually evident as i concentration increased the removal efficiency of ipm reduced by about 16 0 when the addition of i was 50 μm as shown in fig 5 some reactive iodine species ris e g i i2 i2 and i3 generated from uv photolysis of i could react with so3 2 according to eq 9 12 which boosting the decomposition of so3 2 figure s4 however the reactions of i3 and i2 with so3 2 at rather high rate constants would result in the generation non reactive oxysulfur species as shown in eq 11 12 terminating chain reactions regarding to so 3 then the formation of reactive species i e so 3 so 5 and so 4 was therefore inhibited in addition i was more competent than sulfite on absorbing uv light since the molar absorption coefficient of i 885 m 1 c m 1 was higher than that of sulfite 49 m 1 c m 1 under the same condition sauer et al 2014 therefore photoionization of sulfite would be also inhibited by i with rather high concentration 27 7 μm competitive absorption 9 i s o 3 2 i s o 3 10 i 2 s o 3 2 2 i s o 3 11 i 3 s o 3 2 2 i i s o 3 k 28 2 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 12 i 2 s o 3 2 i i s o 3 k 28 3 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 3 3 effect of nom nom was one of the most important factors affecting the contaminant degradation efficiency during uv alone photolysis or other uv based treatment processes sun et al 2019 wu et al 2017 khan et al 2017 as reported liu et al 2020 the maximum concentration of nom could reach to 18 mg l in surface water hence the effect of nom 0 1 5 mg l on the elimination of ipm 2 μm at ph 7 in uv sulfite process was investigated fig 6 the presence of nom inhibited the degradation of ipm in uv sulfite process and the degradation efficiency gradually decreased from 79 9 to 64 2 as the concentration of nom increased from 0 0 to 1 5 mg l the inhibitory effect of nom could be attributed to two aspects i nom exerted an inner filter effect since it could absorb uv light at 254 nm zhao et al 2019 ii nom was overwhelmingly capable of capturing so 4 nom could react with so 4 at second order reaction rate constant of 6 8 10 3 l m g c 1 s 1 due to its abundance in hydrogens and non bonding electrons conducive to transfer electron lutze et al 2015 ghauch et al 2017 3 4 effect of oxygen on the degradation products and pathways 3 4 1 formation of inorganic iodine species as shown in fig 7 a the generation of i increased gradually in uv sulfite system with without o2 as reactions went on after 20 min reaction the generation of i in uv sulfite system without o2 was more than that with o2 3 8 μm vs 2 6 μm the generation of reactive iodine increased rapidly within the initial 5 min and then dwindled in uv sulfite system with o2 while there was rarely reactive iodine detected in that without o2 fig 7b besides the formation of iodate in uv sulfite system with o2 generally increased as the reaction went on while almost no iodate generated in that without o2 fig 7c direct uv photolysis could lead to deiodinaiton of icm according to previous reports hu et al 2019a hu et al 2019b wu et al 2019 the higher generation of i in uv sulfite system without o2 might be attributed to the presence of e a q and or so 3 therein that were conducive to the deiodination of ipm however the generated i herein couldn t be furthermore oxidized into reactive iodine and or iodate since both so 3 and e a q were very poor oxidants during uv sulfite process with o2 the existence of oxidants i e o2 so 4 and or so 3 so 5 transformed i into reactive iodine species and even iodate interestingly the generation of reactive iodine species here suddenly decreased at 5min fig 7b and meanwhile sulfite concentration data didn t show was below the detection limitation the decline of reactive iodine species might be attributed to the disappearance of so 4 which was generated from reaction between sulfite and so 5 and or so 5 self decomposition then o2 as the only oxidant gradually oxidized these reactive iodine species into iodate 3 4 2 identification of transformation products and pathways in order to identify and differentiate the transformation products tps generated by various reactive species in uv sulfite process under aerobic condition the degradation experiments at ph 7 under aerobic condition of ipm in uv sulfite ethanol process in comparison with direct uv photolysis and uv pds tba process were carried out the accurate m z values and postulated structures of tps detected were provided in table s1 figure s5a m showed the ms spectra of thirteen tps i e tp 1 2 and 5 13 including eleven deiodinated tps and two undeiodinated tps tp 3 and 4 3 4 2 1 direct uv photolysis there are seven tps detected in uv photolysis process tp 2 i e c17h23i2n3o9 had an additional oxygen and hydrogen atom and lost an iodine atom as compared with parent ipm i e c17h22i3n3o8 indicating the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring compared with parent ipm tp 3 i e c14h18i3n3o6 was formed by the break of amide bond on asymmetric side chain tp 5 i e c17h21i2n3o9 had an additional oxygen atom and lost a hydrogen and iodine atom as compared with parent ipm suggesting the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and the transformation of hydroxyl group to aldehyde group on the side chain tp 6 i e c17h19i2n3o9 lost three hydrogen atoms and an iodine atom and had an additional oxygen atom as compared with parent ipm indicating aldehylation at two sites of the side chain besides the hydroxylation on the aromatic ring tp 9 i e c17h22in3o10 had two extra oxygen atoms and lost two iodine atoms as compared with parent ipm suggesting that two iodine atoms were replaced by hydroxyl groups and a hydroxyl group on the side chain was converted into aldehyde group tp 12 i e c17h23n3o10 had two extra oxygen atoms and a hydrogen atom and lost three iodine atoms as compared with parent ipm suggesting that two of three iodine atoms were replaced by hydroxyl groups and aldehylation took place on the side chain on the benzene ring of ipm molecular formula all these three iodine atoms were transformed into hydroxyl groups and the hydroxyl group on the side chain was oxidized into aldehyde group generating tp 13 c17h22n3o11 3 4 2 2 so 3 so 5 there are ten tps in total detected in uv sulfite ethanol process including tp 1 3 and tp 7 13 the existence of so 3 so 5 inhibited the formation of tp 5 and 6 generating from direct uv photolysis the residual tps i e tp 1 7 8 10 and 11 were generated only by so 3 so 5 tp 1 i e c17h23i2n3o8 had an additional hydrogen atom and lost an iodine atom as compared with parent ipm indicating one iodine atom was removed from ipm two iodine atoms in ipm molecular structure were removed and one of them was hydroxylated generating tp 7 c17h24in3o9 similarly two of three iodine atoms in ipm molecular structure were substituted for hydroxyl groups forming tp 8 i e c17h24in3o10 the formation of tp 10 i e c17h25n3o9 and tp 11 i e c17h25n3o10 resulted from all three iodine atoms removal following hydroxylation at one site in the former and two in the latter 3 4 2 3 so 4 three tps i e tp 3 4 and 9 in total were identified in uv pds tba process the formation of tp 4 was attributed to the presence of so 4 and the formation of tp 2 5 6 12 and 13 was impeded due to the presence of so 4 the generation of tp 4 i e c14h16i3n3o8 resulted from the amide bond break on asymmetric side chain following the oxidation of amino group 3 4 3 proposed transformation pathway 3 4 3 1 direct uv photolysis pathway uv photolysis led to the break of c i bond and then the hydroxylation occurred in the presence of h2o oh generating tp 2 scheme 1 furthermore tp 2 was transformed into tp 5 via the aldehylation on the side chain tp 5 was converted into tp 6 and tp 9 by the further aldehylation on the side chain and the hydroxylation on the benzene ring respectively then tp 9 was further transformed into tp 12 and tp 13 by hydroxylation and deiodiantion on the benzene ring respectively besides uv photolysis attacked the amide bond on asymmetric side chain to generate tp 3 3 4 3 2 uv so 3 so 5 pathway tp 2 and tp 3 were also detected in uv sulfite ethanol process as compared with uv direct photolysis process scheme 1 due to the existence of so 3 so 5 tp 2 was transformed into tp 7 and tp 8 via deiodination and hydroxylation respectively on one hand the further deiodination and hydroxylation on the benzene ring converted tp 7 into tp 10 and tp 11 respectively the aldehylation took place on the side chain of tp 11 forming tp12 on the other hand tp 8 was transformed into tp 9 and tp 11 through the deiodination on the benzene and the aldehylation on the side chain respectively on the benzene ring the deiodination and hydroxylation could transform tp 9 into tp 12 and tp 13 respectively the aldehylation on the side chain of tp 11 could also generate tp 12 besides the formation of tp 1 resulted from ipm was also attributed to the existence of so 3 so 5 and tp 1 probably led to the formation of tp 7 and subsequent tps i e tp 10 12 3 4 3 3 uv so 4 pathway in uv pds ethanol process both tp 3 and tp 9 could be generated directly in the presence of so 4 scheme 1 different from uv direct photolysis the amino group in tp 3 molecule structure could be oxidized into nitro group forming tp 4 due to the strong oxidation of so 4 3 5 acute toxicity of transformation products in uv uv sulfite and uv pds tba processes the luminescence value of marine bacterium vibrio fischeri could reflect the acute toxicity of the parent compound and its transformation products which therefore was used as an indicator of toxicity in the present work the toxicity in uv sulfite process in the presence of oxygen was investigated as compared with direct uv photolysis process and uv pds tba process the l0 represented the initial luminescence i e the sample without treatment while l represented the luminescence of the sample at specific reaction time and condition therefore the decrease of l l0 indicated the toxicity increase of the sample and vice versa the acute toxicity of ipm and its transformation products in different treatment processes was shown in fig 8 as could be seen the ratio of l l0 gradually dwindled as the removal of ipm increased in direct uv photolysis process where the luminescence finally decreased to 43 6 relative to the initial value when 60 0 of ipm was eliminated the value of luminescence in uv sulfite process appeared to fluctuate with the increase of ipm removal efficiency the luminescence in uv sulfite process only reduced by about 16 2 compared with the original luminescence when the removal efficiency of ipm reached to 72 2 generally the value of luminescence in uv sulfite process was higher than that in direct uv photolysis process indicating that uv sulfite process weakened the toxicity of transformation products by comparison with direct uv photolysis process furthermore the luminescence in uv pds tba process with excessive tba slightly enhanced as ipm removal elevated the differential phenomenon on luminescence between uv sulfite process and uv pds tba process might be attributed to the contribution of so 3 so 5 on ipm degradation during the former process i e the transformation products generated by so 3 so 5 were more toxic than those by so 4 overall uv sulfite could be considered as a potential advanced oxidation process on ipm removal 4 conclusion sulfite enhanced the degradation of ipm by uv photolysis in the presence of dissolved oxygen therein so 4 as a strong oxidant radical together with another oxysulfur radicals i e so 3 so 5 played an indispensable role on ipm removal furthermore the increase of ph 5 7 enhanced the contribution of so 4 and inhibited that of so 3 so 5 on ipm degradation the degradation of ipm was restrained no matter when cl i or nom was present in uv sulfite system under aerobic condition here three inorganic iodine species i e i reactive iodine species and iodate io3 were detected specifically the concentration of both i and io3 gradually increased as reactions went on the time dependent variation profiles of reactive iodine species concentration contained two stages i e increased initially and then dwindled transformation products generated by various ways i e direct uv photolysis uv so 4 and uv so 3 so 5 were differentiated and the corresponding degradation mechanisms were elucidated the acute toxicity assay implied that the transformation products generated by so 3 so 5 were more toxic than those by so 4 compared with direct uv system uv sulfite system decreased the generation of toxic products suggesting uv sulfite system might be a promising technology on

17357,in drinking water distribution system dwds disinfection byproducts dbps have a large possibility of participating in iron oxidation by dissolved oxygen do which may induce particle structure transformations and increase unknown risks in this work the influence of trichloroacetic acid tcaa one of the most typical dbps on iron oxidation processes was studied and the potential effects of the resulting α feooh particles were evaluated through two aspects i influence on the bacterial community and ii toxicity to human cells tcaa promoted iron oxidation process through an fe o c linkage which led to a sharper surface of the particles tcaa mediated fe oxide particles tfop than that without tcaa fe oxide particles fop interestingly the influence of particles on the richness of bacterial community of drinking water was different under anaerobic and aerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community increased with the addition of particles while under aerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community decreased the higher affinity of tfop for electron accepting do than fop indicated the role of do on tfop under aerobic conditions tfop exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity among fop and the actual deposits dft calculations confirmed that tcaa in iron particles promoted the adsorption and dissociation of h2o2 to generate more oh with an obvious decrease in the energy barrier from 1 51 to 0 80 ev this study indicates the high potential of adverse effects of dbps on loose deposits in dwds and gives implications for the control of dbps and deposits in drinking water graphical abstract dbps could participate in iron oxidation and induce particle structure transformations with potential risks image graphical abstract keyword drinking water distribution system iron oxidation disinfection byproducts iron particles 1 introduction in a drinking water distribution system dwds a residual disinfectant is widely used to reduce the risk of pathogen exposure rosario ortiz et al 2016 this residual disinfectant is effective in preventing pathogen growth however it has well known drawbacks such as the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps with adverse health effects and the acceleration of metal leaching from plumbing schock et al 2008 through surface corrosion and the precipitation of metal corrosion scales are formed with loose deposits on the top after a disturbance these loose deposits can resuspend into water resulting in the increase in turbidity and discoloration of tap water liu et al 2017 among dbps the nonvolatile halogenated fraction with haloacetic acids haas as the main component has three to five times higher content than the volatile halogenated fraction with trihalomethanes thms as the main component trichloroacetic acid tcaa is a representative haa that is abundant in water systems and demonstrates carcinogenic properties notably the carboxyl group in haas can bind with metal ions to influence the corrosion process and corrosion products wang and wong 2005 thus the cooccurrence of dbps and loose deposits may further increase their harmful effects appreciable levels of iron commonly exist in tap water which comes from naturally occurring iron sources in groundwater or the corrosion of pipes in the dwds mirlohi et al 2011 the oxidation rate of fe ii to fe iii determines the lifetime of reactive fe ii and has an interplay between these two redox states critical to fe transport and bioavailability miller et al 2012 under low dissolved oxygen do conditions iron usually exists in its fe ii form nanosized 100 nm iron oxyhydr oxide particles including magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh hematite α fe2o3 maghemite γ fe2o3 and lepidocrocite γ feooh can be released from iron scales to the dwds barkatt et al 2009 trueman et al 2017 it is known that iron oxide particles especially those at the nanoscale have a high adsorption capacity for contaminants nurmi et al 2005 zhuang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2017 thus the presence of a large amount of iron in a very fine particle form increases the possibility of contaminant transportation to the customer senftle et al 2007 goethite α feooh is one of the most important components of the loose deposits in the dwds sarin et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 the formation of loose deposits requires a long period of time and depends on complex factors thus it is very difficult to reveal the behavior of loose deposits in a short term experiment until now our understanding of the water quality deterioration risk associated with biofilm and loose deposits destabilization in distribution systems during switching supply water quality is limited chen et al 2020 investigating the behavior of α feooh is an important part of understanding the risks of loose deposits trueman et al trueman et al 2017 found that α feooh could enhance lead mobility which increased the health risk of lead exposure gerke et al found that strontium was a surface complex associated with α feooh which increased the health risk of strontium exposure gerke et al 2013 our previous research reported that trichloroacetic acid tcaa which has a high carcinogenicity among dbps could clearly increase the specific area and accumulation of α feooh compared to other coexisting matters in addition to the risks due to accumulation loose deposits that contained α feooh particles also had appreciable toxicities and the toxicity of α feooh particles formed with micropollutants clearly increased when the particles had sharp surfaces with bisphenol a or were able to generate reactive oxygen species with perfluorooctanoic acid zhuang et al 2019 however the structural changes of α feooh particles with dbps in drinking water and their adverse effects on human health and water quality are not clearly understood in a dwds understanding bacteriology is important to establish innovative and effective control methods to ensure the safety and high quality of tap water to break the limited understanding of dwds microbiology which has focused on pipe wall biofilms and bulk water liu et al liu et al 2014 were the first to report the importance of bacteria in loose deposits and found that the accumulation and aging process of loose deposits could promote and protect bacterial growth thus it is meaningful to explore the influence of α feooh particles on microorganisms in drinking water to further understand the adverse effects of loose deposits moreover the particles in the dwds can be transported and resuspended through the daily hydraulic turbulence of tap water liu et al 2017 furthermore the drinking water microbiome was found to be structurally and functionally less diverse and variable across disinfected compared to non disinfected systems dai et al 2020 considering the toxicity of feooh based particles zhuang et al 2019 the toxicity of α feooh generated with dbps cannot be ignored in a real dwds no research has been conducted to evaluate the influence of dbps on the structure of loose deposits because of their complex components and long term formation but understanding the above will provide needed insights to understand this effect by revealing the interaction between their representative components in this research the effect of tcaa on α feooh formation and its effect on drinking water were studied the effects were determined based on the following aspects i bacterial community changes and ii toxicity to human cells both experimental and theoretical studies were used to confirm the structural transformation and effect mechanism 2 experimental section 2 1 sample preparation for short term fe oxidation by oxygen 5 mm feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 9 was prepared using distilled water

toxicity evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the cell cytotoxicity of the iron particles as well as the proliferation or viability of cells with the iron particles a simple nonradioactive and colorimetric 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt assay was used pieters et al 1989 since dimethyl sulfoxide dmso can dissolve cell membranes the absorbance value at 570 nm was used to reflect the number of living cells the materials used to collect and logarithmically count the cells were sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation for 30 min the cell suspension concentration

treatment with 150 µl of isopropanol in the incubator the absorbance of each well was measured on a microplate reader epoch2t biotek at 570 nm the relative cell viability was calculated by conducting 3 duplicate experiments and taking the mean value 2 5 theoretical calculation spin polarized first principles calculations based on density functional theory dft were performed using castep mcnellis et al 2009 the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe exchange correlation functional perdew et al 1992 within the generalized gradient approximation gga was employed to describe the exchange correlation energy the projector augmented wave paw blöchl 1994 method was adopted for the pseudopotentials the energy cutoff for the plane wave basis expansion was set to 450 ev the force on each atom was set as 0 05 ev å for the convergence criterion feooh was simulated by a slab of the 100 surface which was modeled by a 1 1 unit cell during the calculations five bottom layers were fixed to represent the features of the bulk structure over the slab a vacuum layer of 15 å was employed in the z direction to minimize the interaction between layers the sampling in the brillouin zone was set at 3 3 1 by the monkhorst pack method chadi 1977 the van der waals interaction was considered using the dft d3 scheme grimme et al 2010 the transition state ts linking the molecular and dissociated h2o2 was searched through the complete dimer approach henkelman and jónsson 1999 the barrier ea for the dissociation was calculated through ea e ts e reactant where e ts and e reactant were the total energies for the transition state and reactant as obtained under the same computational settings when the stability of different configurations was discussed relative energy re was employed re was defined as the energy difference with respect to the most favorable geometry during all these calculations dft u methods were used to improve the description of the on site coulomb interactions between fe 3d electrons where the net value of u was set to 4 0 ev jain et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural analysis the xrd peaks of fop and tfop figure s1 matched well with the standard data of α feooh jcpds card 71 808 indicating that tcaa did not change the crystal pattern of the iron oxides the ftir spectra reflected that the functional groups did not have obvious changes in fop and tfop which further confirmed that tcaa did not change the functional groups of the iron oxides to study the influence of tcaa on the iron oxidation process the change in do during the oxidation process is shown in fig 1 the initial do values in both solutions were adjusted to 9 4 mg l using o2 and n2 during the reaction process the do decreased sharply within 2 h and slowly decreased after 2 h which indicated that the oxidation degree was higher in the initial 2 h moreover the do in tfop solution decreased faster than that in fop and it was quite possible that tcaa promoted the oxidation process to further confirm the role of tcaa in the oxidation process tem images of the iron oxidation process are shown in the inset of fig 1 both fop and tfop had urchin like structures with hairy surfaces but tfop had larger particle sizes with sharper nanorods and more uniform surfaces than fop sem of tfop formation process is shown in figure s2 based on the results we deduced the particle formation process during the formation process fe ii was hydrolyzed oxidized and aggregated during the initial 0 5 h then α feooh nuclei formed after approximately 2 h next the α feooh nuclei further crystallized into nanorods after approximately 6 h finally the nanorods grew into the urchin like structure after 12 h the morphologies in the tem images were consistent with the changes in do which confirmed the fast crystallization and growth in the initial 2 h in the presence of tcaa fe ii first bound with the carboxyl groups in tcaa to form the fe ii tcaa complex and then continued to grow the iron oxide growth process required electron transfers with energy transferred from the outer to the inner sphere and a subsurface charge migration occurred parallel to the surface zarzycki et al 2015 the fe ii tcaa complex might promote the electron transfer process resulting in large nanorods in the xps analysis figure s3 the structural fe ii fe iii ratio decreased with time due to the increase in oxidation degree moreover the fe o c bonds increased with time influence in the elemental mapping of tfop fig 2 a fe o and cl are uniformly distributed in the nanoparticle c with the background c signal is shown in figure s4 the small amount of cl in tfop 1 83 wt revealed the low content of tcaa in tfop as fop and tfop had similar spinel crystal structures it was difficult to differentiate between them by xrd exafs is able to provide quantitative information with good sensitivity to coordination number and interatomic distances rather than lattice spacing these surface associated physicochemical properties govern interactions including deposition aggregation and attachment to bacteria reinsch et al 2010 the spectral lines of fop and tfop were well fitted to the goethite spectra of the standards as shown in fig 2b which further confirmed that tcaa did not change the crystal pattern during iron oxidation the peaks at approximately 7 0 7 5 å were considered typical features of fe iii oxyhydr oxides sun et al 2014 in the plot of fop and tfop as shown in fig 2c and 2d the fe shell contributed a strong feature at approximately 3 5 å 1 and the feature at 1 5 å revealed intense second shell peaks the slight vibration of the fe shell suggested the fe ii and tcaa may bind into inner sphere complexes the second neighbor backscattering was stronger in tfop than in fop indicating that tcaa increased the energy around the fe atom the fitting parameters of the exafs spectra are shown in table 1 the coexistence cl based matters would affect the fe o fe linkages by iron oxide formation process baig et al 2017 compared to fop the fe o bond length was slightly shortened while the fe fe bond was extended in tfop the coordination formed between tcaa and iron induced the formation of a lattice distortion causing the disorder at the interfaces to influence the growth of α feooh nanoparticles liu et al 1999 3 2 bacteriology loose deposits attached to pipes are easily resuspended in drinking water liu et al liu et al 2014 found the important contributions of particle associated bacteria from loose deposits i particle associated bacteria in the dwds accounted for over 98 of the total bacteria and ii the contributions of the pipe wall biofilm and bacteria in loose deposits were comparable therefore the influence of these particles on bacterial communities in drinking water should not be neglected the richness of bacterial community of the drinking water with the addition of particles including actual deposits fop and tfop under anaerobic and aerobic conditions is shown in figure s5a the influence of particles on the richness of bacterial community of drinking water was different under anaerobic and aerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community increased with the addition of particles while under aerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community decreased thus these particles might be favorable as substrates for anaerobic bacteria moreover the sample containing fop under anerobic conditions had the highest richness of bacterial community compared to the actual deposits and tfop the fop did not contain nonmetal components indicating a favorable effect for the anaerobic bacteria of α feooh at the phylum level of the relative abundances of the top 10 otus as shown in figure s5b the bacterial communities of all samples were dominated by proteobacteria followed by nitrospira the relative abundance of otu1 clearly decreased in the presence of all particles under anaerobic conditions blank tfop fop and deposits but increased under aerobic conditions the relative abundance of otu1 in the samples followed the order blank tfop fop deposits under anaerobic conditions and fop tfop deposits blank under aerobic conditions alphaproteobacteria was the most abundant class fig 3 which had an obvious decrease under anaerobic conditions with the addition of particles the interesting phenomenon was that tfop had higher inhibition effects than fop under aerobic conditions but lower inhibition effects under anaerobic conditions this result might be related to the interaction of do with the particles in the system in light of previous reports that h2o2 intermediates could be produced on iron based crystal surfaces through do transformation cheng et al 2016 zhuang et al 2019 do adsorption on fop and tfop particles was further studied as shown in figure s6 tfop showed higher affinity for electron accepting do molecules indicating its abundant pore surfaces shimomura et al 2010 dft calculations were used to further study the electron density and bonding as shown in figure s7 and tables s2 and s3 the combination of fe into tcaa increased the electron density of the o atom in tcaa moreover the c c c o and c cl bonds were stronger in tfop than in fop the enhanced bonding in tfop would favor its electron transfer with do thus tfop had a higher inhibition effect than fop under aerobic conditions 3 3 toxicity considering the high possibility of particle intake through drinking water liver uptake was the most effective elimination pathway briley saebo et al 2011 thus healthy human liver cells were chosen as a target to evaluate the toxicity of the particles including actual deposits fop and tfop in the florescence microscopy images of the cells before and after treatment with the particles fig 4 a the green cells are alive while the red cells are dead the cell viability results of the mtt assay method are presented in fig 4b tfop exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity followed by fop and the actual deposits after 24 h 41 2 of the cells were damaged after treatment with fop and 48 6 were damaged with tfop the reason for the higher toxicity of tfop than fop may be mainly originated from two aspects i compared with fop tfop had a sharper surface thus tfop more easily scratched the cells ii the fe o c linkage in iron organic complex was found to be able to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species ros using do as an electron donor to further attack the cells zhuang et al 2019 moreover qu et al qu et al 2019 found that the surface adhesion between cells and iron oxide particles was dominated by electrostatic forces p o fe bonds were formed rapidly resulting in changes to the membrane structure thus ros were generated on the surface of the iron oxide particles and led to cell permeabilization which is also an important reason for the higher toxicity of tfop as the interfacial interaction between the iron oxide particles and cells was an important factor in cytotoxicity the zeta potentials of fop and tfop were further analyzed as shown in figure s8 the surface of fop was more positively charged than tfop which would enhance the surface adhesion between cells and tfop to form p o fe bonds as the protein on the cell surface was positively charged 3 4 mechanism of the tcaa induced effects based on the above results the effects induced by tcaa through the structural transformation of α feooh emerge including but not limited to two ways influence on the bacterial community and ii toxicity to human cells in both processes bonding information and ros generation have important influences on the resulting effects thus the existing species of tcaa on the α feooh surface and the ts of oh generation were further analyzed the computational model of the feooh 100 surface is shown in figure s9 for the most stable configuration of h2o2 on feooh 100 figure s10 the fe o spacing is approximately 2 93 å and there are multiple hydrogen bonds at the same time the difference between the first two forms is that there is only one hydrogen bond in the latter and there is no oh in h2o2 that directly pointed to α feooh the fe o in the last form in figure s10 is approximately 3 5 å with only one hydrogen bond based on the optimized geometries for adsorbed tcaa figure s11 it is clear that the configuration with five coordinated fe fe5c terminated by c o is favorable which was essentially determined by the stabilization attributed to both fe o c bonding and hydrogen bonding when fe o c bonding is removed the energy increases by 0 76 and 0 94 ev with ccl3 and cooh respectively towards the surface clearly fe o c bonding dominates the adsorption of tcaa this is critical because fe5c will be oxidized under such a bonding network turning it from fe ii to fe iii which may affect both the adsorption and dissociation of h2o2 as described below tcaa can also directly affect h2o2 adsorption from two aspects i tcaa will occupy one active site and can prevent the formation of a large h2o2 h2o2 bonding network which is beneficial for h2o2 dissociation ii tcaa can introduce a strongly polarized cl terminal which can potentially generate hydrogen bonds with oh to further examine the effect of tcaa we compared h2o2 dissociation by fop and tfop in principle h2o2 may dissociate via two mechanisms r1 h2o2 s s oh s oh r2 h2o2 s s oh oh where s indicates the active site on the catalyst surfaces r1 will generate two oh terminals while also producing oh and oh when only a single h2o2 molecule is involved the reaction energy is 0 44 and 0 77 ev for r1 and r2 respectively as shown in fig 5 a clearly radical generation requires 1 21 ev more energy input than that for pure oh terminals however when tcaa is coadsorbed the reaction energies are 0 36 and 0 37 ev for r1 and r2 respectively as presented in fig 5b although r2 is still favorable the difference is reduced remarkably from 1 21 to 0 73 ev demonstrating that tcaa can improve the production of oh in terms of thermodynamics thus we analyzed the reaction kinetics for fop the barrier for radical generation is as high as 1 51 ev and the barrier decreases to only 0 80 ev for tfop fig 5c therefore tcaa can also improve the reaction kinetics given that radicals are not stable the promotion associated with tcaa adsorption should originate from the interaction between tcaa and oh noticeably the strongly polarized cl groups can form hydrogen bonds to better study the interfacial interaction between iron particles and do we compared o2 adsorption on fop and tfop surfaces with the optimized geometries shown in figure s12 accordingly two key features can be identified i o2 favours the adsorption over five coordinated fe site in both cases and ii o fe distance is notably different as 2 86 å and 2 39 å on fop and tfop surfaces respectively based on these observations it is believed that surface fe will be partially oxidized by adsorbed o2 but the interaction is different with tfop surface offering stronger adsorption capacity as indicated by its shortened o fe distance this conclusion can be further confirmed by calculated adsorption energies ae as listed in table 2 showing ae 0 32 ev on fop and 0 44 ev on tfop therefore do adsorption can be strengthened on the iron particles generated with tcaa generally the coadsorption effect is related to the slight change of local electronic structures to clarify it we firstly calculated mulliken charges of adsorbed o2 as listed in table 2 according to which o2 obtained more electrons from tfop surface than that from fop this confirms our hypothesis that o2 fe interaction has been improved by tcaa calculated charge difference profiles for o2 adsorbed on fop and tfop are shown in fig 6 consistent with the o2 charge we also found that the change of fe mulliken charge as listed in table 2 is more significant before and after o2 adsorption being 0 02 e and 0 08 e on fop and tfop respectively particularly we noted that tcaa adsorption can reduce the net charge on such active fe site meaning that such surface fe is more active this result has been well supported by calculated d band density of states for such fe atom as shown in figure s13 in which the key change between two surfaces is the occupied state at approximately 1 0 ev spin down tcaa adsorption shifts such state from 1 12 ev to 0 84 ev being closer to the fermi energy under which this state is more active in fixing o2 through donating electrons as reflected by calculated ae and mulliken charge in table 2 overall tcaa adsorption can activate surface fe and promote o2 coadsorption 4 conclusion this study addressed the significant role of tcaa a representative dbps in the transformation of soluble fe ii to form α feooh a representative component of iron dominated loose deposits under water chemistry conditions relevant to those in drinking water distribution systems here we proved that tcaa promoted the fe ii oxidation process through an fe o c linkage which led to a sharper surface of the particles moreover the relative abundance of out1 was lower in tfop than in fop under aerobic conditions whereas it showed the opposite trend under anaerobic conditions indicating the higher inhibitory effect of tfop on otu1 under aerobic conditions the higher affinity of tfop for electron accepting do molecules than fop indicated the abundant pore surfaces of tfop which confirmed the role of do on tfop under aerobic conditions tfop exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity among fop and the actual deposits dft calculations confirmed that tcaa in iron particles promoted the adsorption and dissociation of h2o2 to generate more oh with an obvious decrease in the energy barrier from 1 51 to 0 80 ev the results of this study can also reflect the close association of iron oxides and dbps in pipe deposits

17357,in drinking water distribution system dwds disinfection byproducts dbps have a large possibility of participating in iron oxidation by dissolved oxygen do which may induce particle structure transformations and increase unknown risks in this work the influence of trichloroacetic acid tcaa one of the most typical dbps on iron oxidation processes was studied and the potential effects of the resulting α feooh particles were evaluated through two aspects i influence on the bacterial community and ii toxicity to human cells tcaa promoted iron oxidation process through an fe o c linkage which led to a sharper surface of the particles tcaa mediated fe oxide particles tfop than that without tcaa fe oxide particles fop interestingly the influence of particles on the richness of bacterial community of drinking water was different under anaerobic and aerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community increased with the addition of particles while under aerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community decreased the higher affinity of tfop for electron accepting do than fop indicated the role of do on tfop under aerobic conditions tfop exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity among fop and the actual deposits dft calculations confirmed that tcaa in iron particles promoted the adsorption and dissociation of h2o2 to generate more oh with an obvious decrease in the energy barrier from 1 51 to 0 80 ev this study indicates the high potential of adverse effects of dbps on loose deposits in dwds and gives implications for the control of dbps and deposits in drinking water graphical abstract dbps could participate in iron oxidation and induce particle structure transformations with potential risks image graphical abstract keyword drinking water distribution system iron oxidation disinfection byproducts iron particles 1 introduction in a drinking water distribution system dwds a residual disinfectant is widely used to reduce the risk of pathogen exposure rosario ortiz et al 2016 this residual disinfectant is effective in preventing pathogen growth however it has well known drawbacks such as the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps with adverse health effects and the acceleration of metal leaching from plumbing schock et al 2008 through surface corrosion and the precipitation of metal corrosion scales are formed with loose deposits on the top after a disturbance these loose deposits can resuspend into water resulting in the increase in turbidity and discoloration of tap water liu et al 2017 among dbps the nonvolatile halogenated fraction with haloacetic acids haas as the main component has three to five times higher content than the volatile halogenated fraction with trihalomethanes thms as the main component trichloroacetic acid tcaa is a representative haa that is abundant in water systems and demonstrates carcinogenic properties notably the carboxyl group in haas can bind with metal ions to influence the corrosion process and corrosion products wang and wong 2005 thus the cooccurrence of dbps and loose deposits may further increase their harmful effects appreciable levels of iron commonly exist in tap water which comes from naturally occurring iron sources in groundwater or the corrosion of pipes in the dwds mirlohi et al 2011 the oxidation rate of fe ii to fe iii determines the lifetime of reactive fe ii and has an interplay between these two redox states critical to fe transport and bioavailability miller et al 2012 under low dissolved oxygen do conditions iron usually exists in its fe ii form nanosized 100 nm iron oxyhydr oxide particles including magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh hematite α fe2o3 maghemite γ fe2o3 and lepidocrocite γ feooh can be released from iron scales to the dwds barkatt et al 2009 trueman et al 2017 it is known that iron oxide particles especially those at the nanoscale have a high adsorption capacity for contaminants nurmi et al 2005 zhuang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2017 thus the presence of a large amount of iron in a very fine particle form increases the possibility of contaminant transportation to the customer senftle et al 2007 goethite α feooh is one of the most important components of the loose deposits in the dwds sarin et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 the formation of loose deposits requires a long period of time and depends on complex factors thus it is very difficult to reveal the behavior of loose deposits in a short term experiment until now our understanding of the water quality deterioration risk associated with biofilm and loose deposits destabilization in distribution systems during switching supply water quality is limited chen et al 2020 investigating the behavior of α feooh is an important part of understanding the risks of loose deposits trueman et al trueman et al 2017 found that α feooh could enhance lead mobility which increased the health risk of lead exposure gerke et al found that strontium was a surface complex associated with α feooh which increased the health risk of strontium exposure gerke et al 2013 our previous research reported that trichloroacetic acid tcaa which has a high carcinogenicity among dbps could clearly increase the specific area and accumulation of α feooh compared to other coexisting matters in addition to the risks due to accumulation loose deposits that contained α feooh particles also had appreciable toxicities and the toxicity of α feooh particles formed with micropollutants clearly increased when the particles had sharp surfaces with bisphenol a or were able to generate reactive oxygen species with perfluorooctanoic acid zhuang et al 2019 however the structural changes of α feooh particles with dbps in drinking water and their adverse effects on human health and water quality are not clearly understood in a dwds understanding bacteriology is important to establish innovative and effective control methods to ensure the safety and high quality of tap water to break the limited understanding of dwds microbiology which has focused on pipe wall biofilms and bulk water liu et al liu et al 2014 were the first to report the importance of bacteria in loose deposits and found that the accumulation and aging process of loose deposits could promote and protect bacterial growth thus it is meaningful to explore the influence of α feooh particles on microorganisms in drinking water to further understand the adverse effects of loose deposits moreover the particles in the dwds can be transported and resuspended through the daily hydraulic turbulence of tap water liu et al 2017 furthermore the drinking water microbiome was found to be structurally and functionally less diverse and variable across disinfected compared to non disinfected systems dai et al 2020 considering the toxicity of feooh based particles zhuang et al 2019 the toxicity of α feooh generated with dbps cannot be ignored in a real dwds no research has been conducted to evaluate the influence of dbps on the structure of loose deposits because of their complex components and long term formation but understanding the above will provide needed insights to understand this effect by revealing the interaction between their representative components in this research the effect of tcaa on α feooh formation and its effect on drinking water were studied the effects were determined based on the following aspects i bacterial community changes and ii toxicity to human cells both experimental and theoretical studies were used to confirm the structural transformation and effect mechanism 2 experimental section 2 1 sample preparation for short term fe oxidation by oxygen 5 mm feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 9 was prepared using distilled water

toxicity evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the cell cytotoxicity of the iron particles as well as the proliferation or viability of cells with the iron particles a simple nonradioactive and colorimetric 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt assay was used pieters et al 1989 since dimethyl sulfoxide dmso can dissolve cell membranes the absorbance value at 570 nm was used to reflect the number of living cells the materials used to collect and logarithmically count the cells were sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation for 30 min the cell suspension concentration

3 duplicate experiments and taking the mean value 2 5 theoretical calculation spin polarized first principles calculations based on density functional theory dft were performed using castep mcnellis et al 2009 the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe exchange correlation functional perdew et al 1992 within the generalized gradient approximation gga was employed to describe the exchange correlation energy the projector augmented wave paw blöchl 1994 method was adopted for the pseudopotentials the energy cutoff for the plane wave basis expansion was set to 450 ev the force on each atom was set as 0 05 ev å for the convergence criterion feooh was simulated by a slab of the 100 surface which was modeled by a 1 1 unit cell during the calculations five bottom layers were fixed to represent the features of the bulk structure over the slab a vacuum layer of 15 å was employed in the z direction to minimize the interaction between layers the sampling in the brillouin zone was set at 3 3 1 by the monkhorst pack method chadi 1977 the van der waals interaction was considered using the dft d3 scheme grimme et al 2010 the transition state ts linking the molecular and dissociated h2o2 was searched through the complete dimer approach henkelman and jónsson 1999 the barrier ea for the dissociation was calculated through ea e ts e reactant where e ts and e reactant were the total energies for the

energy difference with respect to the most favorable geometry during all these calculations dft u methods were used to improve the description of the on site coulomb interactions between fe 3d electrons where the net value of u was set to 4 0 ev jain et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural analysis the xrd peaks of fop and tfop figure s1 matched well with the standard data of α feooh jcpds card 71 808 indicating that tcaa did not change the crystal pattern of the iron oxides the ftir spectra reflected that the functional groups did not have obvious changes in fop and tfop which further confirmed that tcaa did not change the functional groups of the iron oxides to study the influence of tcaa on the iron oxidation process the change in do during the oxidation process is shown in fig 1 the initial do values in both solutions were adjusted to 9 4 mg l using o2 and n2 during the reaction process the do decreased sharply within 2 h and slowly decreased after 2 h which indicated that the oxidation degree was higher in the initial 2 h moreover the do in tfop solution decreased faster than that in fop and it was quite possible that tcaa promoted the oxidation process to further confirm the role of tcaa in the oxidation process tem images of the iron oxidation process are shown in the inset of fig 1 both fop and tfop had urchin like structures with hairy surfaces but tfop had larger particle sizes with sharper nanorods and more uniform surfaces than fop sem of tfop formation process is shown in figure s2 based on the results we deduced the particle formation process during the formation process fe ii was hydrolyzed oxidized and aggregated during the initial 0 5 h then α feooh nuclei formed after approximately 2 h next the α feooh nuclei further crystallized into nanorods after approximately 6 h finally the nanorods grew into the urchin like structure after 12 h the morphologies in the tem images were consistent with the changes in do which confirmed the fast crystallization and growth in the initial 2 h in the presence of tcaa fe ii first bound with the carboxyl groups in tcaa to form the fe ii tcaa complex and then continued to grow the iron oxide growth process required electron transfers with energy transferred from the outer to the inner sphere and a subsurface charge migration occurred parallel to the surface zarzycki et al 2015 the fe ii tcaa complex might promote the electron transfer process resulting in large nanorods in the xps analysis figure s3 the structural fe ii fe iii ratio decreased with time due to the increase in oxidation degree moreover the fe o c bonds increased with time influence in the elemental mapping of tfop fig 2 a fe o and cl are uniformly distributed in the nanoparticle c with the background c signal is shown in figure s4 the small amount of cl in tfop 1 83 wt revealed the low content of tcaa in tfop as fop and tfop had similar spinel crystal structures it was difficult to differentiate between them by xrd exafs is able to provide quantitative information with good sensitivity to coordination number and interatomic distances rather than lattice spacing these surface associated physicochemical properties govern interactions including deposition aggregation and attachment to bacteria reinsch et al 2010 the spectral lines of fop and tfop were well fitted to the goethite spectra of the standards as shown in fig 2b which further confirmed that tcaa did not change the crystal pattern during iron oxidation the peaks at approximately 7 0 7 5 å were considered typical features of fe iii oxyhydr oxides sun et al 2014 in the plot of fop and tfop as shown in fig 2c and 2d the fe shell contributed a strong feature at approximately 3 5 å 1 and the feature at 1 5 å revealed intense second shell peaks the slight vibration of the fe shell suggested the fe ii and tcaa may bind into inner sphere complexes the second neighbor backscattering was stronger in tfop than in fop indicating that tcaa increased the energy around the fe atom the fitting parameters of the exafs spectra are shown in table 1 the coexistence cl based matters would affect the fe o fe linkages by iron oxide formation process baig et al 2017 compared to fop the fe o bond length was slightly shortened while the fe fe bond was extended in tfop the coordination formed between tcaa and iron induced the formation of a lattice distortion causing the disorder at the interfaces to influence the growth of α feooh nanoparticles liu et al 1999 3 2 bacteriology loose deposits attached to pipes are easily resuspended in drinking water liu et al liu et al 2014 found the important contributions of particle associated bacteria from loose deposits i particle associated bacteria in the dwds accounted for over 98 of the total bacteria and ii the contributions of the pipe wall biofilm and bacteria in loose deposits were comparable therefore the influence of these particles on bacterial communities in drinking water should not be neglected the richness of bacterial community of the drinking water with the addition of particles including actual deposits fop and tfop under anaerobic and aerobic conditions is shown in figure s5a the influence of particles on the richness of bacterial community of drinking water was different under anaerobic and aerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community increased with the addition of particles while under aerobic conditions the richness of bacterial community decreased thus these particles might be favorable as substrates for anaerobic bacteria moreover the sample containing fop under anerobic conditions had the highest richness of bacterial community compared to the actual deposits and tfop the fop did not contain nonmetal components indicating a favorable effect for the anaerobic bacteria of α feooh at the phylum level of the relative abundances of the top 10 otus as shown in figure s5b the bacterial communities of all samples were dominated by proteobacteria followed by nitrospira the relative abundance of otu1 clearly decreased in the presence of all particles under anaerobic conditions blank tfop fop and deposits but increased under aerobic conditions the relative abundance of otu1 in the samples followed the order blank tfop fop deposits under anaerobic conditions and fop tfop deposits blank under aerobic conditions alphaproteobacteria was the most abundant class fig 3 which had an obvious decrease under anaerobic conditions with the addition of particles the interesting phenomenon was that tfop had higher inhibition effects than fop under aerobic conditions but lower inhibition effects under anaerobic conditions this result might be related to the interaction of do with the particles in the system in light of previous reports that h2o2 intermediates could be produced on iron based crystal surfaces through do transformation cheng et al 2016 zhuang et al 2019 do adsorption on fop and tfop particles was further studied as shown in figure s6 tfop showed higher affinity for electron accepting do molecules indicating its abundant pore surfaces shimomura et al 2010 dft calculations were used to further study the electron density and bonding as shown in figure s7 and tables s2 and s3 the combination of fe into tcaa increased the electron density of the o atom in tcaa moreover the c c c o and c cl bonds were stronger in tfop than in fop the enhanced bonding in tfop would favor its electron transfer with do thus tfop had a higher inhibition effect than fop under aerobic conditions 3 3 toxicity considering the high possibility of particle intake through drinking water liver uptake was the most effective elimination pathway briley saebo et al 2011 thus healthy human liver cells were chosen as a target to evaluate the toxicity of the particles including actual deposits fop and tfop in the florescence microscopy images of the cells before and after treatment with the particles fig 4 a the green cells are alive while the red cells are dead the cell viability results of the mtt assay method are presented in fig 4b tfop exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity followed by fop and the actual deposits after 24 h 41 2 of the cells were damaged after treatment with fop and 48 6 were damaged with tfop the reason for the higher toxicity of tfop than fop may be mainly originated from two aspects i compared with fop tfop had a sharper surface thus tfop more easily scratched the cells ii the fe o c linkage in iron organic complex was found to be able to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species ros using do as an electron donor to further attack the cells zhuang et al 2019 moreover qu et al qu et al 2019 found that the surface adhesion between cells and iron oxide particles was dominated by electrostatic forces p o fe bonds were formed rapidly resulting in changes to the membrane structure thus ros were generated on the surface of the iron oxide particles and led to cell permeabilization which is also an important reason for the higher toxicity of tfop as the interfacial interaction between the iron oxide particles and cells was an important factor in cytotoxicity the zeta potentials of fop and tfop were further analyzed as shown in figure s8 the surface of fop was more positively charged than tfop which would enhance the surface adhesion between cells and tfop to form p o fe bonds as the protein on the cell surface was positively charged 3 4 mechanism of the tcaa induced effects based on the above results the effects induced by tcaa through the structural transformation of α feooh emerge including but not limited to two ways influence on the bacterial community and ii toxicity to human cells in both processes bonding information and ros generation have important influences on the resulting effects thus the existing species of tcaa on the α feooh surface and the ts of oh generation were further analyzed the computational model of the feooh 100 surface is shown in figure s9 for the most stable configuration of h2o2 on feooh 100 figure s10 the fe o spacing is approximately 2 93 å and there are multiple hydrogen bonds at the same time the difference between the first two forms is that there is only one hydrogen bond in the latter and there is no oh in h2o2 that directly pointed to α feooh the fe o in the last form in figure s10 is approximately 3 5 å with only one hydrogen bond based on the optimized geometries for adsorbed tcaa figure s11 it is clear that the configuration with five coordinated fe fe5c terminated by c o is favorable which was essentially determined by the stabilization attributed to both fe o c bonding and hydrogen bonding when fe o c bonding is removed the energy increases by 0 76 and 0 94 ev with ccl3 and cooh respectively towards the surface clearly fe o c bonding dominates the adsorption of tcaa this is critical because fe5c will be oxidized under such a bonding network turning it from fe ii to fe iii which may affect both the adsorption and dissociation of h2o2 as described below tcaa can also directly affect h2o2 adsorption from two aspects i tcaa will occupy one active site and can prevent the formation of a large h2o2 h2o2 bonding network which is beneficial for h2o2 dissociation ii tcaa can introduce a strongly polarized cl terminal which can potentially generate hydrogen bonds with oh to further examine the effect of tcaa we compared h2o2 dissociation by fop and tfop in principle h2o2 may dissociate via two mechanisms r1 h2o2 s s oh s oh r2 h2o2 s s oh oh where s indicates the active site on the catalyst surfaces r1 will generate two oh terminals while also producing oh and oh when only a single h2o2 molecule is involved the reaction energy is 0 44 and 0 77 ev for r1 and r2 respectively as shown in fig 5 a clearly radical generation requires 1 21 ev more energy input than that for pure oh terminals however when tcaa is coadsorbed the reaction energies are 0 36 and 0 37 ev for r1 and r2 respectively as presented in fig 5b although r2 is still favorable the difference is reduced remarkably from 1 21 to 0 73 ev demonstrating that tcaa can improve the production of oh in terms of thermodynamics thus we analyzed the reaction kinetics for fop the barrier for radical generation is as high as 1 51 ev and the barrier decreases to only 0 80 ev for tfop fig 5c therefore tcaa can also improve the reaction kinetics given that radicals are not stable the promotion associated with tcaa adsorption should originate from the interaction between tcaa and oh noticeably the strongly polarized cl groups can form hydrogen bonds to better study the interfacial interaction between iron particles and do we compared o2 adsorption on fop and tfop surfaces with the optimized geometries shown in figure s12 accordingly two key features can be identified i o2 favours the adsorption over five coordinated fe site in both cases and ii o fe distance is notably different as 2 86 å and 2 39 å on fop and tfop surfaces respectively based on these observations it is believed that surface fe will be partially oxidized by adsorbed o2 but the interaction is different with tfop surface offering stronger adsorption capacity as indicated by its shortened o fe distance this conclusion can be further confirmed by calculated adsorption energies ae as listed in table 2 showing ae 0 32 ev on fop and 0 44 ev on tfop therefore do adsorption can be strengthened on the iron particles generated with tcaa generally the coadsorption effect is related to the slight change of local electronic structures to clarify it we firstly calculated mulliken charges of adsorbed o2 as listed in table 2 according to which o2 obtained more electrons from tfop surface than that from fop this confirms our hypothesis that o2 fe interaction has been improved by tcaa calculated charge difference profiles for o2 adsorbed on fop and tfop are shown in fig 6 consistent with the o2 charge we also found that the change of fe mulliken charge as listed in table 2 is more significant before and after o2 adsorption being 0 02 e and 0 08 e on fop and tfop respectively particularly we noted that tcaa adsorption can reduce the net charge on such active fe site meaning that such surface fe is more active this result has been well supported by calculated d band density of states for such fe atom as shown in figure s13 in which the key change between two surfaces is the occupied state at approximately 1 0 ev spin down tcaa adsorption shifts such state from 1 12 ev to 0 84 ev being closer to the fermi energy under which this state is more active in fixing o2 through donating electrons as reflected by calculated ae and mulliken charge in table 2 overall tcaa adsorption can activate surface fe and promote o2 coadsorption 4 conclusion this study addressed the significant role of tcaa a representative dbps in the transformation of soluble fe ii to form α feooh a representative component of iron dominated loose deposits under water chemistry conditions relevant to those in drinking water distribution systems here we proved that tcaa promoted the fe ii oxidation process through an fe o c linkage which led to a sharper surface of the particles moreover the relative abundance of out1 was lower in tfop than in fop under aerobic conditions whereas it showed the opposite trend under anaerobic conditions indicating the higher inhibitory effect of tfop on otu1 under aerobic conditions the higher affinity of tfop for electron accepting do molecules than fop indicated the abundant pore surfaces of tfop which confirmed the role of do on tfop under aerobic conditions tfop exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity among fop and the actual deposits dft calculations confirmed that tcaa in iron particles promoted the adsorption and dissociation of h2o2 to generate more oh with an obvious decrease in the energy barrier from 1 51 to 0 80 ev the results of this study can also reflect the close association of iron oxides and dbps in pipe deposits the findings suggest a high potential for the structural transformation of iron oxides induced by dbps and its resulting effect on the bacterial community and toxicity to human cells declaration of

17358,poly ferric sulfate pfs one of the typical inorganic flocculants widely used in wastewater management and waste activated sludge was dewatering could be accumulated in was and inevitably entered in anaerobic digestion system at high levels however knowledge about its impact on methane production is virtually absent this study therefore aims to fill this gap and provide insights into the mechanisms involved through both batch and long term tests using either real was or synthetic wastewaters as the digestion substrates experimental results showed that the maximum methane potential and production rate of was was respectively retarded by 39 0 and 66 4 whereas the lag phase was extended by 237 0 at pfs of 40 g per kg of total solids mechanism explorations exhibited that pfs induced the physical enmeshment and disrupted the enzyme activity involved in anaerobic digestion resulting in an inhibitory state of the bioprocess of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis furthermore pfs s inhibition to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was much severer than that to acetotrophic methanogenesis which could be supported by the elevated abundances of methanosaeta sp and the dropped abundances of methanobacterium sp in pfs present digester and probably due to the severe mass transfer resistance of hydrogen between the syntrophic bacteria and methanogens as well as the higher hydrogen appetency of pfs induced sulfate reducing bacteria among the derivatives of pfs multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers and sulfate were unveiled to be the major contributors to the decreased methane potential while the multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers were identified to be the chief buster to the slowed methane producing rate and the extended lag time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords poly ferric sulfate waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion methane production hydroxyl polymers 1 introduction poly ferric sulfate pfs the polymerized iron salts can provide a variety of nucleic hydroxyl high valence complex ions and hydrolyze to the highly cross linked hydrophobic multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers after dissolving in aqueous phase making it possess the high coagulation efficiency jiang et al 1998 zouboulis et al 2008 compared with the conventionally inorganic coagulants such as ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate the pfs owns some advantages such as comparatively lower dose wider range of ph and temperature but more effective coagulation properties and contains no harmful substances jiang et al 1998 in sewage treatment system the potential pathway of pfs entering in sewage sludge is the wastewater pretreatment process such as the enhanced coagulation and chemical phosphorus removal process fig s1 in these processes pfs would firstly hydrolyze to macromolecular iron polymer containing hydroxyl and sulfate groups and then complex and precipitate with phosphorus or sludge flocs in which most of the pfs is inevitably absorbed and concentrated in primary sedimentation sludge ps chu et al 2018 moussas et al 2009 it was reported that the dosage of pfs in wastewater pretreatment process was generally at 10 60 mg l and highly depended on the source of wastewater quality chu et al 2018 zouboulis et al 2008 with the potential content of fe remained in chemically enhanced primary sedimentation sludge being in the range of 0 to 22 g per kg of total solid sludge ghyoot et al 1997 lin et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 moreover in some small scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps where anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was in situ in wwtps is not economically feasible and in some developing countries like china where most of the wwtps have not already been configured with anaerobic digesters was is firstly required to be dewatered and then gathered together for further treatment fig s1 as pfs is substantially added into was during mechanically dewatering process pfs levels in such sludges are inevitably at high levels it was reported that pfs content in dewatered sludge was in the range of 10 40 g kg dry sludge when the pfs was applied in sludge conditioning bratby et al 2016 watanabe et al 1999 wei et al 2018a in addition according to our survey on 4 wwtps in central china 90 of the pfs used in mechanical dewatering was remained in dewatered sludge and the pfs levels in such sludge reached at 3 0 48 5 g kg ts till now however most of the studies on pfs focused on its performance optimization few considered its accumulation in sewage sludge include ps and was and potential impacts on subsequent treatments such as anaerobic digestion fig s1 anaerobic digestion is not only a conventional technology for stabling sewage sludge but also a developing technology to be regained in energy self sufficient operation appels et al 2008 xu et al 2020a through anaerobic digestion the sludge volume can be effectively reduced the pathogenic microorganisms can be effectively killed and more importantly the carbon substrates can be transferred to renewable energy methane appels et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 it is known that sludge anaerobic digestion includes several biological conversions e g hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis executed by a series of microbes such as hydrolytic microorganisms acid producing microorganisms and methanogens wu et al 2020 zhen et al 2017 thus the accumulated pfs in sewage sludge might affect these bio conversions thereby affecting the performances of sludge anaerobic digestion when pfs is dissolved in hydrous media such as sewage sludge sulfate iron and their hydroxyl polymers will co exist as a compound being rich in iron pfs would provide the required iron element for the synthesis of iron containing enzymes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis or aceticlastic methanogenesis and meanwhile served as a scavenger for s2 in sludge which might be beneficial for methane production wei et al 2018b as a substance containing sulfate however pfs might serve as a special form of anaerobic respiration and terminal electron accepting process and thereby induced the enrichment of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and competition and or coexistence with methanogens for carbon and electrons as well as the production of hydrogen sulfide which could result in a shift in the metabolic pathways of organic substrates and the change of microbial community structure in anaerobic digestion cetecioglu et al 2019 hansen et al 1999 ozuolmez et al 2015 qiao et al 2016 and as the hydroxyl polymers such as fe3 oh 4 5 fe5o2 oh 6 5 which play a core role in coagulation process and have a similar but better performance with ferric hydroxide may induce the aggregation of sludge flocs and the alteration of subsequent anaerobic digestion performance moussas et al 2009 the effect of coagulant e g fecl3 and pacl on acidogenic fermentation of ps have been clearly reported by lin et al 2017 2018 which demonstrated that fecl3 dosed at 10 30 mg fe l sewage had little influence on sludge hydrolysis and volatile fatty acid production whereas an obvious inhibitory effect was observed for pacl in organic hydrolysis of the ps these excellent attempts open the box of coagulant s effect on anaerobic fermentation of ps however the was has different properties compared to ps for instance was is the sludge produced by biological process and it mainly contains biomass and extracellular polymeric substances whereas ps is the sludge composed of settleable particulate organics removed from wastewater pretreatment processes up to now however there is no information available on the effects of pfs the mixture or synthesis being made up of sulfate iron and hydroxyl polymer on the anaerobic digestion of real was and moreover the underlying mechanisms and microbial community response to pfs during anaerobic was digestion have not been yet thoroughly investigated thus the main objective of this work is to reveal the effects of pfs on the anaerobic was digestion firstly the effects of pfs at different dosages 0 5 10 20 or 40 g kg ts on methane production during anaerobic was digestion was investigated then the underlying mechanisms for pfs affecting the digestion were identified by assessing its effect on the solubilization of was the processes of was hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis the contributions of the intermediates decomposed from pfs to methane production the microbial community as well to our knowledge this is the first work reporting the adverse effects of pfs on the anaerobic digestion of real was the findings obtained will provide insights into the pfs involved anaerobic digestion system and are supposed to make a sound contribution to mitigate pfs s negative effects in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and pfs the was used in this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtp with sludge retention time of 20 d in changsha china where pfs was not used in wastewater treatment the was was concentrated by gravity thickening at 4 c for 24 h and screened with a 1 mm sieve to remove impurities before use the main characteristics of used was were as follows ph 6 8 0 1 total solids ts 38300 600 mg l volatile solids vs 24800 350 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand cod 170 10 mg l total cod 37000 420 mg l total carbohydrate 3900 160 mg cod l and total protein 17800 220 mg cod l the seed sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester fed with was in our lab and its main characteristics were ph 6 9 0 1 ts

iron value of 20 and with a residual ferrous content less than 0 1 2 2 methane production during was anaerobic digestion in the presence of different pfs levels anaerobic digestion of was in the presence of different pfs levels was conducted through batch experiments in five replicate serum reactors each with a working volume of 1 0 l first each reactor was fed with 800 ml was afterward different volumes of pfs solution 3 w w were added into those reactors to achieve the predetermined dosage at the beginning of the experiment followed by 120 rpm of stirring for 2 min and 60 rpm for 10 min zhang et al 2018 zouboulis et al 2008 the predetermined dosages of pfs addition were 0 control 5 10 20 and 40 g kg ts respectively next 400 ml of seed sludge was equally divided and added before the ph of these five reactors was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 with 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide then each reactor was diluted with milli q water to 1 0 l to exclude the methane production from seed sludge one blank reactor contained 80 ml of seed sludge and 920 ml of milli q water was also operated oxygen in all the reactors was removed by purging with nitrogen gas for 5 min after that all reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and incubated at 35 1 c in an air bath shaker 120 rpm the ph of all reactors was controlled at 7 0 0 1 in the whole digestion period the biogas yield methane and h2s content in biogas were determined every 2 days the calculation of the cumulative volume of methane was detailed in our previous publications wang et al 2018 it should be noted that all tests were conducted in triplicate in this study and the methane production reported were net values with the values measured in blank excluded 2 3 effect of pfs on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of anaerobic digestion in the digesters operated above the concentration of soluble protein carbohydrate in digestion supernate vss reduction and floc size of sludge were analyzed after digestion of 3 days and by comparing these results the impact of pfs on solubilization process could be indicated to assess the effect of pfs on the processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis the following batch tests using synthetic wastewaters were carried out angelidaki et al 2009 wang et al 2018 twelve reactors with working volume of 1 0 l each were first divided into four groups test i test ii test iii and test iv with three in each test i test ii test iii and test iv were respectively used to evaluate the impact of pfs on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetotrophic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis all these tests were lasted for 3 d test i the three reactors received 920 ml synthetic wastewater and 80 ml of the same seed sludge collected from a laboratory anaerobic sludge digester the synthetic wastewater contains 6 0 g bsa and 1 2 g dextran two reactors were respectively fed with 0 15 and 0 60 g pfs the amount of pfs is equal to that in the 5 and 20 g kg ts pfs digester respectively while the other reactor received no pfs and was set as the control all other conditions were the same as those described above by measuring the degradation rates of protein and dextran the effect of pfs on hydrolysis process could be indicated test ii this test was operated the same as that described in test i except that the substrates i e bsa and dextran in synthetic wastewater were replaced by 4 0 g l alanine model amino acid compound and 0 8 g glucose model monosaccharide compound respectively test iii the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as that described in test i except that 3 0 g sodium acetate was employed to replace bsa and dextran in synthetic wastewater test iv the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as that described in test i except that the mixture of standard gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen was employed to replace bsa and dextran in gas and liquid phase by flushing the configured standard gas for 5 min 2 4 identifying the effect of components of pfs on methane production as mentioned above the chemical components of pfs can be divided into three types hydroxyl polymers iron sulfate in hydrous media and sediments the addition of pfs would introduce these three components into the digestion system which might have different effects on anaerobic digestion to reveal this question the following batch test was carried out using real sludge as the digestion substrates in this test 5 replicate serum bottles with identical working volume 1 0 l were performed and each received 800 ml was among them one was served as the control without addition of any chemical while the other 4 bottles received 20 g kg ts pfs 11 6 g kg ts ferric chloride 20 6 g kg ts potassium sulfate or 14 3 g kg ts ferric sulfate respectively it should be noted that ferric chloride and potassium sulfate were set as substitute for iron and sulfate to evaluate their effect on methane production respectively with their initial concentrations selected based on the stoichiometric content of iron and sulfate in 20 g kg ts pfs because the hydroxyl polymers cannot be modeled the ferric sulfate was used as a substitute for co exist of iron and sulfate to qualitatively reflect its effect on methane production after the addition of the chemicals all the bottles were diluted with milli q water to 920 ml and inoculated with 80 ml seed sludge after flushing with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen all bottles were sealed closely and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm under 35 1 c all other operating steps were the same as those mentioned in section 2 2 2 5 long term operation of semi continuous digesters for microbial activities and community measurement to reveal the effect of pfs on anaerobic digestion of was from the point of microbial activities and community two semi continuous digesters were operated in this work the two reactors were fed with either 0 or 20 g kg ts pfs added sludge with the 20 g kg ts chosen as the representative dosage of pfs in the actual dewatered sludge at the start up phase from 0 to the day of maximum methane production occurred in batch tests the two semi continuous digesters were operated the same as 0 or 20 g kg ts pfs added reactors in section 2 2 respectively and then the sludge retention time in the two digesters was controlled at 20 and 26 d by withdrawing 50 1 and 38 5 ml of digestion mixtures and replacing with respective same volume of new sludge each day respectively based on the results of the batch experiments in section 2 2 after 2 months operation the daily methane production did not change significantly with time and then the measurements of key enzyme activities and microbial community were conducted 2 6 model based analysis methane production was simulated by the modified gompertz equation eq 1 and kinetic parameters mm maximal methane yield

literatures rice et al 2012 xu et al 2019 the cod conversion coefficients of protein and carbohydrate are 1 5 and 1 06 respectively li et al 2020a 2020b the volumes of biogas were determined by releasing the pressure in the serum bottle using a 300 ml glass syringe to equilibrate with the room pressure according to the literature wang et al 2019a 2020 the composition of methane and h2s in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector according to the method documented in the literatures liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019b concentrations of aqueous fe iii and fe ii were determined using by inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer icap 6300 thermo fisher scientific usa based on the methods reported previously li et al 2020a quantifications of aqueous sulfate and sulfide were performed using anion chromatography system with uv and conductivity detector ics 900 dionex usa dai et al 2017 gutierrez et al 2009 the floc size distribution analysis was performed using a malvern mastersizer 2000 instrument with a detection range of 0 01 3500 µm in addition the activities of protease acetate kinase amidase and coenzyme f420 in semi continuous digesters were measured based on the methods reported previously without major modifications du et al 2020 fu et al 2021 liu et al 2019 the microbial community in semi continuous digesters was determined using high throughput 16s rrna gene based illuminamiseq sequencing with the 515fmodf gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806rmodr ggactacnvgggtwtctaat chosen as pcr primers and the operational taxonomic units otus clustered with 97 similarity cutoff xu et al 2020b 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as mean standard deviation values an analysis of variance with least significant difference test was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pfs on methane production from anaerobic digestion of was fig 1 a shows the cumulative methane yield from was during anaerobic digestion in the presence of different levels of pfs after 32 days of digestion no significant increment of methane production can be found in each digester p 0 05 table s1 indicating that the complete anaerobic digestion had been achieved it can be observed that the optimum digestion time for the digester without pfs addition was 20 d and at this time the maximal methane yield was obtained i e 144 7 5 0 ml g vs although similar tendencies of methane accumulation were also observed in other digesters with pfs addition the methane yield was significantly inhibited by pfs the cumulative methane yield decreased gradually from 91 7 0 3 to 68 0 0 2 of the control with respect to the increasing pfs levels from 5 to 20 g kg ts and then further decreased to 56 7 0 2 of the control with increasing pfs level to 40 g kg ts further investigation determined that the maximal methane yield showed a well negative correlation with the pfs levels in the sludge y 152 14 3 15 x 0 04 x2 r2 0 9963 fig s2 to further understand the impact of pfs on anaerobic sludge digestion the anaerobic digestion kinetics were estimated using the modified gompertz model eq 2 the simulated methane production curves are shown in fig 1a which indicates the fit of methane production to the used model was satisfactory r2 0 96 in all studies cases three kinetic parameters i e maximal methane yield potential mm maximal methane production rate rm and lag phase time λ were obtained and showed in fig 1b and table s2 in general mm and rm decreased exponentially with the increased pfs levels while the λ presented a reverse tendency it has been reported that rm is directly relevant to the methanogenic activity while λ corresponds with the start up of digester and both of them depend on the acclimation period of microorganisms to a proper substrate and environmental condition in a batch culture batstone et al 2004 lay et al 1997 thus it can be concluded that the presence of pfs resulted in the variations of sludge characters and or digestion system conditions e g solubilization rate soluble organic components floc size which would be further uncovered in the following text the above results suggested that the presence of pfs not only decreased biochemical methane potential but also inhibited the rate of methane production and prolonged the start up period 3 2 details of how pfs affects the process of anaerobic digestion anaerobic sludge digestion generally contains solubilization of sludge particulate matters hydrolysis of macromolecular organics e g protein carbohydrate acidogenesis of micromolecular organics e g amino acid glucose and methanogenesis of acetate and co2 h2 fig s3 liu et al 2020a 2020b luo et al 2020a the above results indicated that the terminal product of anaerobic digestion methane was negatively affected by pfs but it is still unknown the potential effect of pfs on the four successive bioprocesses the following analyses were therefore conducted to uncover these gaps in this study the effect of pfs on solubilization process was indicated by comparing the concentration of soluble protein carbohydrate in digestion supernate vss reduction and floc size of sludge after digestion of 3 days when the solubilized organics from was had not been massively bio consumed for methane production fig s3 luo et al 2020b wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a both soluble protein and carbohydrate decreased significantly in pfs added reactors except for the lowest pfs dosage p 0 05 in all studied cases and with the increment of pfs addition the soluble protein and carbohydrate concentration decreased gradually in the 20 g kg ts pfs added reactor the soluble protein and carbohydrate were respectively 534 2 18 0 mg cod l and 121 7 5 5 mg cod l which were only approximately 66 6 and 69 5 of that in control suggesting that the addition of pfs inhibited the solubilization process of sludge this can be further confirmed by vss reduction fig 2b an index of specific meaning for sludge solubilization xu et al 2019 after 3 days digestion the vss reduction in the control was 13 2 0 5 whereas the corresponding value was only 7 3 0 4 in 40 g kg ts pfs added reactor the higher the pfs dosage the lower the sludge solubilization and the less the levels of organic substrates provided for subsequent methane producing process fig 2d r2 0 9822 the solubilization of sludge is defectively relevant to its floc size xu et al 2020a fig 2c illustrates the effect of pfs on the floc size distribution of sludge after digestion of 3 days the distribution of floc size moved to the increasing direction along with the pfs dosage the medium diameter of raw sludge was 34 7 2 0 μm with the addition of 20 g pfs kg ts for instance the medium diameter raised to 58 3 2 8 μm indicating the physical enmeshment increased with the increasing addition of pfs dosage as a result of physical enmeshment which increased the mass transfer resistance between the organics substrates and microbes chu et al 2005 it can be revealed why the increase addition of pfs inhibited the sludge solubilization process as well as the methane production fig 2d r2 0 9764 the results of batch tests using model organics as substrates were summarized in table s3 and fig s4 it can be observed that the degradations of all tested substrates were affected and the higher the pfs dosage the lower the degradation efficiency fig 3 shows the specific degradation rates of model compounds obtained by the zero order kinetic model it can be seen that the specific degradation rates of bsa dextran l alanine glucose acetate and hydrogen in the control were 1 39 0 51 1 02 0 24 0 89 and 0 089 l l d respectively however in the presence of 20 g kg ts pfs these values decreased to 0 69 0 27 0 58 0 13 0 49 and 0 040 l l d and which was 49 6 52 9 56 9 54 2 55 1 and 40 8 of that in control respectively suggesting that the process of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis involved in anaerobic digestion were severely restrained by pfs as indicated by the correlation analysis in fig s5 the degradation rate of these model compounds showed a linear correlation with methane production rate in fig 1b with r2 values higher than 0 97 in addition the activities of key enzymes i e protease acetate kinase and coenzyme f420 in the semi continuous digesters were detected and the results were out lined in fig s6 it can be found that the relative activities of protease acetate kinase and coenzyme f420 which respectively represents the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes in 20 g kg ts pfs added digester was 62 8 70 5 and 57 3 of that in control digester thus it can be speculated that the inhibited enzymes activity was one reason for the restrained bio processes fig 3 and the decreased methane production rate fig 1b our previous publications indicated that the polymers such as pam an organic macromolecular flocculant would cover both organic substrate and anaerobic microbes through its chemical characteristics resulting in the deterioration of normal enzyme metabolism wang et al 2018 the hydrolyzed pfs might play a similar role in the batch digester besides the chemical effect the main derivatives of pfs such as fe iii and sulfate as well as their aggregations would act as the electron acceptor and cause alterations of anaerobic biological processes which were explored in the following analyses fig 4 shows the profile curves of aqueous iron and sulfate sulfide in the 20 g kg ts pfs added digester dissolved fe iii and sulfate decreased gradually along with digestion time indicating the iron and sulfate reduction during anaerobic digestion of was yu et al 2018 correspondingly the fe ii increased substantially from 0 1 0 0 mg l to 2 6 0 1 mg l after 4 days of anaerobic digestion and the sulfide rose piecemeal in the whole digestion time 0 7 3 5 mg s l indicating the reduction of iron and sulfate which were driven by iron and sulfate reduction bacteria irb and srb respectively liu et al 2015 paulo et al 2015 however the fe ii concentration peaked on day 4 and then decreased immediately to nearly zero on day 16 which showed an inverse tendency with that of sulfide and could be attributed to the precipitation of fe ii with sulfide based on the preliminary balance analysis of iron and sulfur in the anaerobic digestion system it can be found that most of them were precipitated and or adsorbed in sediments 80 besides the behavior occurred in liquid phase there might exist some biological or chemical behaviors of pfs and its derivates in sediments that affecting methane producing process van den berg et al 1980 zeng et al 2020 which required to be further investigations in the future fig 4c further illustrates the h2s production in control and pfs added reactors during anaerobic digestion in the initial stage of anaerobic digestion 0 14 days the h2s production in pfs added reactors were all lower than that of control the inhibited production of h2s could be attributed to the mass transfer resistance between the sulfate and sulfate reducing bacteria caused by pfs and the precipitation of sulfide with fe ii however as anaerobic digestion progressed the cumulative h2s production in pfs added reactors exceeded that of control after 32 days of digestion the cumulative h2s production in the control was 93 2 4 8 10 4 ml g vs and the cumulative production in the 20 and 40 g kg ts pfs added reactor was respectively 107 3 5 5 10 4 and 118 7 6 0 10 4 ml g vs which was 115 1 and 127 4 of the control in fig 4b the concentration of sulfate in liquid phase showed no significant decrement after digestion of 14 days indicating that the occurrence of sulfate reduction in the solid phase and might be attributed to the reduction of sulfur containing compounds and the precipitated sulfate substance deserved from pfs as well it should be noted that h2s might have an inhibitory effect on some methanogenic species which might lower the methane production because the used seed sludge was not sulfate acclimatised in present study cetecioglu et al 2019 and this might be another reason for the decreased methane production in fig 1 the above results indicated that the addition of pfs in sludge increased the h2s production during anaerobic digestion which might damage methanogens in anaerobic digestion system and cause detrimental problems such as malodors health hazards and corrosion need to be taken seriously zeng et al 2020 3 3 identifying the effect of components of pfs on methane production addition of pfs would introduce three components i e hydroxyl polymers iron sulfate into the digestion system the different components of pfs might have different effect on sludge anaerobic digestion thus their respective impacts on methane yield were identified in this work fig s7 illustrates the methane production from the components added reactors along with the digestion time with the corresponding kinetic parameters of each case shown in fig 5 a 6 c it was clearly observed that all of these components from pfs significantly affected the methane production during anaerobic digestion of was p 0 05 in all studied cases the potassium sulfate as the substitute of sulfate from pfs showed a 17 5 0 1 inhibition on methane production as summarized in fig 5d the sulfate could induce the enrichment of srb and the competition of organic substrates with methanogens as well as the production of hydrogen sulfide in anaerobic digestion systems fig 4c which could diffuse across cell membranes and result in protein denaturation and enzyme inactivation thereby deteriorate the anaerobic digestion for methane production ge et al 2013 wei et al 2018b yuan et al 2016 this study further confirmed these conclusions similarly the addition of related dose of ferric sulfate led to a 11 1 0 1 decrement of methane production the reason for this result might be that the iron content was inadequate for sulfate precipitation in the presence of ferric chloride as the substitute of iron from pfs the methane production of was increased approximately 17 6 0 1 compared with that of the control this result was accorded with the favorable effect of iron on the anaerobic digestion process previously reported and as shown in fig 5d the improvement could be attributed to two aspects i being an essential component of microbial cells and ii serving as an accelerator for the hydrolysis acidification process and biodegradable organic matters generation liu et al 2015 wei et al 2018b yu et al 2015a 2015b compared to pfs the iron equivalent ferric sulfate showed less inhibition 11 1 versus 32 0 and this gap might be ascribed to the hydroxyl polymers to some extent our previous studies demonstrated that the organic polymer polyacrylamide would induce the aggregation of sludge flocs and increase the mass transfer resistance between the microbes and organic substrates thereby deteriorated the anaerobic digestion performances wang et al 2018 it is worth noting that the hydrolysis of ferric chloride also generates hydroxide polymers however such species are generally scattered in liquid solid phase at neutral conditions and easily decomposed by anaerobic microbes and further utilized for metabolism qin et al 2019 yu et al 2015a whereas the pfs derived hydroxide polymers could be expressed as feiok oh ij 2k i 3 j and multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers have more nucleus longer cross linked chains punchier aggregation 15 times higher coagulation efficiency jiang et al 1998 zouboulis et al 2008 might play a similar destroyer role toward anaerobic digestion in addition based on the variance analysis results within these cases fig 5a 5c it can be further demonstrated that among the main components and or forms of pfs present in anaerobic digester multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers and sulfate were unveiled to be the major contributors to the decreased biomethane potential p 0 02 and the multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers was the main buster to the slowed methane producing rate p 0 02 and the extended lag time p 0 01 it should be noted that the present identification was based on the stoichiometric composition of iron and sulfate in pfs with the physical differences between model reagents and the targeted derivates being ignored more works on the detailed biological or chemical behaviors and balance of sulfur and iron in the pfs added digestion system including gas liquid and solid phase should be carried later although the present results could provide an insight into the effect of components of pfs on methane production to some degree 3 4 effect of pfs on microbial community in long term operation of semi continuous digesters the microbial community was measured through high throughput 16s rrna sequencing to compare the community diversity structure and function in semi continuous digesters fig s8 illustrates the methane yield of the two semi continuous digesters which further confirmed that the presence of pfs inhibited the anaerobic methane production it can be found that after 2 months operation the methane yield in the two digesters did not change significantly with time indicating a stable state for microbial community measurement ecological diversity indices of the bacteria and archaea the simpsoneven simpson s e and shannon s h indices decreased in the pfs added reactor fig 6a in the presence of 20 g kg ts pfs the richness evenness and diversity metrics of 0 97 otus decreased from 1800 154 5 767 0 620 and 0 063 0 013 to 1466 130 0 050 0 009 and 5 214 0 480 the possible reason for this effect might contribute to the biotoxicity of pfs to anaerobic digestion process the results can be further revealed by a bipartite association network showing the associations of bacteria and archaea in each digester at genus level fig 6b and 7 c it can be found that of these species 88 7 bacteria and 100 archaea in pfs added digester were associated with the control indicating that the basic similarity of the communities in the two digesters however at pfs added digester the exclusive species regardless of bacteria and archaea were significantly lower than that of the control digester these results suggest that the presence of pfs can reduce microbial alpha diversity of digester sunburst plot based community analysis was carried out to reveal how the pfs affected the community structure of bacteria and archaea from the phylum level to genus level fig 7 for the bacteria community posted in fig 7a the chloroflexi bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in two detected digesters regardless of the presence or absence of pfs and no new dominant species emerged in the pfs added digesters which were consistent with the results outlined in fig 6 the predominant genera of bacteria were vadinha17 sp anaerolineaceae norank sp and longilinea sp which respectively affiliated to phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi and chloroflexi in the presence of 20 g kg ts pfs varied much from that of the control in relative abundances the anaerolineaceae norank sp and longilinea sp which were reported to have ability to degrade some carbohydrates and be associated to syntrophic communities of bacteria and methanogenic archaea xu et al 2017 yamada et al 2007 decreased to 7 7 and 8 8 in 20 g kg ts pfs added digester 13 1 and 12 7 in control digester respectively similar trends could be found in genera anaerolineaceae noclassified sp leptolinea sp and bd1 7 clade sp which have been documented to be hydrocarbon degraders and main participators in hydrolysis acidification process kim et al 2012 liu et al 2019 indicating that the pfs caused the shift of the microbial structure toward the direction against hydrolysis and acidogenesis which were in agreement with the deteriorated performances in hydrolysis and acidogenesis model experiments fig 3 the vadinha17 sp which was usually found in the environment rich in refractory and or complex organics such as pectin and hemicellulose accounted for 20 3 in the 20 g kg ts pfs added digester whereas this value was only 13 2 in the control was assumed to be the despondence for the formed multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers derived from pfs liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2011 specially the genera of thermodesulfovibrio sp belonged to phyla nitrospirae and is capable of sulfate and or iron reducing was enriched with the presence of pfs 3 04 versus 1 97 reflecting that the pfs stimulated the sulfate and or iron reducing bacteria during anaerobic digestion sekiguchi et al 2008 regarding the archaeal community the predominant genera of methanogens were methanosaeta sp methanobacterium sp candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and methanolinea sp which accounted for 47 2 21 9 11 9 and 6 65 of archaea 16s rrna gene sequences of the control fig 7b in the presence of pfs e g 20 g kg ts the structure of predominant genera of methanogens did not differ much from that of the control but their relative abundance shifted largely the genera of methanobacterium sp candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and methanolinea sp which have been proved to be hydrogenotrophic methanogens he et al 2019 sakai et al 2012 dropped to 11 5 7 83 and 3 13 respectively the genera of methanosaeta sp the only known strict acetoclastic methanogen narayanan et al 2009 increased significantly with the addition of 20 g pfs kg ts from 47 2 to 68 4 and the woesearchaeia norank sp has the ability to use h2 to reduce methyl compounds to produce ch4 gründger et al 2019 also increased to 3 93 these facts suggested that the pathway of ch4 production was partially transferred from hydrogenotrophic to acetotrophic methanogenesis which further confirmed that the presence of pfs showed a severer inhibition on hydrogenotrophic methanogens than acetotrophic methanogens as shown in fig 2c previous studies demonstrated that the diffusion of gas in polymer solutions is far less effective than low molecular organics thus it can be speculated that the severe mass transfer resistance of h2 between the syntrophs and methanogens caused by the formed multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers of pfs were the contributors to the transferred methanogenesis pathway and inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogens caulfied et al 2002 kawashima et al 1990 in addition as shown in fig 7a pfs stimulated the sulfate and or iron reducing bacteria during anaerobic digestion i e thermodesulfovibrio sp the genera of thermodesulfovibrio sp was proven to be a generalist participating in the metabolism of anaerobic intermediates and use pyruvate and hydrogen as electron donors in the presence of sulfate liang et al 2016 and more importantly they have a higher appetency for hydrogen than methanogens in the case of insufficient limited hydrogen content which might be the other reasons for the shift and or differences deciphered above harada et al 1994 3 6 implications for wastewater and sludge treatments this study investigated the effects of pfs on anaerobic digestion of was and underlying mechanisms for the first time through batch and long term tests using either synthetic wastewaters or real was as the digestion substrates it was found that the presence of pfs resulted in a terrible performance of anaerobic sludge digestion from macro to micro levels it was revealed that the physical enmeshment caused by pfs significantly lessened the levels of organic substrates for methane producing process the presence of pfs severely restrained the anaerobic bio processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis by lowering down the activities of the relevant enzymes and meanwhile the produced or surplus sulfide from pfs also had a toxicity on methanogens fig 8 which could be confirmed by microbial community results especially pfs s inhibitions to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was much severer than that to acetotrophic methanogenesis which could be further supported by the elevated abundances of methanosaeta sp and the dropped abundances of methanobacterium sp in pfs added digester and probably due to the severe mass transfer resistance of hydrogen between the syntrophs and methanogens caused by pfs as well as the higher hydrogen appetency of pfs induced sulfate reducing bacteria considering the negative effects of pfs on anaerobic sludge digestion more attentions should be paid when using in wastewater management and sludge treatments systems to avoid its entrance to the was anaerobic system although the use of flocculants such as pfs is inevitable there are two optimal solutions to lower down the possibility of pfs entering sludge anaerobic system one is to compound with other no or less toxicity flocculants such as ferric chloride chitosan starch and other microbial flocculants by which the usage amount of pfs could be significantly reduced in flocculants process wei et al 2018a yu et al 2015b the other one is to lessen the percentage of sulfate through modifying the pfs using some natural compounds such as sodium alginate and chitosan wu et al 2019a 2019b the sewage and sludge treatment should be coupled as a whole one should not consider only the performances enhancement of sewage pretreatment and or sludge dewatering by using plenty of flocculants and ignore the flocculant s potential effect to other biochemical processes such as biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion in addition the physical enmeshment caused by pfs and high ts of sludge was found to be one of the reasons for the decreased methane production thus it can be speculated that diluting the pfs contained sludge might be an effective way for mitigating pfs s negative effects however it is noticeable that this work mainly aimed to provide insights into the pfs involved anaerobic digestion system more effects should be devoted to mitigating pfs s negative effects in the future 4 conclusion this study revealed the effects of pfs on anaerobic digestion of was and underlying mechanisms for the first time the main conclusions are 1 the presence of pfs not only decreased biochemical methane potential but also inhibited the methane production rate and prolonged the start up period during anaerobic sludge digestion 2 pfs significantly lessened the levels of organic substrates for methane producing process and meanwhile severely restrained the anaerobic bio processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis 3 pfs decreased the microbial diversity and caused the shift of microbial structure toward the direction against hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis 4 multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers and sulfate from pfs were unveiled to be the major contributors to the decreased biomethane potential and the multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers were the chief buster to the slowed methane producing rate and the extended lag time the findings obtained herein would make a sound contribution to the mitigation of pfs

17358,poly ferric sulfate pfs one of the typical inorganic flocculants widely used in wastewater management and waste activated sludge was dewatering could be accumulated in was and inevitably entered in anaerobic digestion system at high levels however knowledge about its impact on methane production is virtually absent this study therefore aims to fill this gap and provide insights into the mechanisms involved through both batch and long term tests using either real was or synthetic wastewaters as the digestion substrates experimental results showed that the maximum methane potential and production rate of was was respectively retarded by 39 0 and 66 4 whereas the lag phase was extended by 237 0 at pfs of 40 g per kg of total solids mechanism explorations exhibited that pfs induced the physical enmeshment and disrupted the enzyme activity involved in anaerobic digestion resulting in an inhibitory state of the bioprocess of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis furthermore pfs s inhibition to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was much severer than that to acetotrophic methanogenesis which could be supported by the elevated abundances of methanosaeta sp and the dropped abundances of methanobacterium sp in pfs present digester and probably due to the severe mass transfer resistance of hydrogen between the syntrophic bacteria and methanogens as well as the higher hydrogen appetency of pfs induced sulfate reducing bacteria among the derivatives of pfs multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers and sulfate were unveiled to be the major contributors to the decreased methane potential while the multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers were identified to be the chief buster to the slowed methane producing rate and the extended lag time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords poly ferric sulfate waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion methane production hydroxyl polymers 1 introduction poly ferric sulfate pfs the polymerized iron salts can provide a variety of nucleic hydroxyl high valence complex ions and hydrolyze to the highly cross linked hydrophobic multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers after dissolving in aqueous phase making it possess the high coagulation efficiency jiang et al 1998 zouboulis et al 2008 compared with the conventionally inorganic coagulants such as ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate the pfs owns some advantages such as comparatively lower dose wider range of ph and temperature but more effective coagulation properties and contains no harmful substances jiang et al 1998 in sewage treatment system the potential pathway of pfs entering in sewage sludge is the wastewater pretreatment process such as the enhanced coagulation and chemical phosphorus removal process fig s1 in these processes pfs would firstly hydrolyze to macromolecular iron polymer containing hydroxyl and sulfate groups and then complex and precipitate with phosphorus or sludge flocs in which most of the pfs is inevitably absorbed and concentrated in primary sedimentation sludge ps chu et al 2018 moussas et al 2009 it was reported that the dosage of pfs in wastewater pretreatment process was generally at 10 60 mg l and highly depended on the source of wastewater quality chu et al 2018 zouboulis et al 2008 with the potential content of fe remained in chemically enhanced primary sedimentation sludge being in the range of 0 to 22 g per kg of total solid sludge ghyoot et al 1997 lin et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 moreover in some small scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps where anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was in situ in wwtps is not economically feasible and in some developing countries like china where most of the wwtps have not already been configured with anaerobic digesters was is firstly required to be dewatered and then gathered together for further treatment fig s1 as pfs is substantially added into was during mechanically dewatering process pfs levels in such sludges are inevitably at high levels it was reported that pfs content in dewatered sludge was in the range of 10 40 g kg dry sludge when the pfs was applied in sludge conditioning bratby et al 2016 watanabe et al 1999 wei et al 2018a in addition according to our survey on 4 wwtps in central china 90 of the pfs used in mechanical dewatering was remained in dewatered sludge and the pfs levels in such sludge reached at 3 0 48 5 g kg ts till now however most of the studies on pfs focused on its performance optimization few considered its accumulation in sewage sludge include ps and was and potential impacts on subsequent treatments such as anaerobic digestion fig s1 anaerobic digestion is not only a conventional technology for stabling sewage sludge but also a developing technology to be regained in energy self sufficient operation appels et al 2008 xu et al 2020a through anaerobic digestion the sludge volume can be effectively reduced the pathogenic microorganisms can be effectively killed and more importantly the carbon substrates can be transferred to renewable energy methane appels et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 it is known that sludge anaerobic digestion includes several biological conversions e g hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis executed by a series of microbes such as hydrolytic microorganisms acid producing microorganisms and methanogens wu et al 2020 zhen et al 2017 thus the accumulated pfs in sewage sludge might affect these bio conversions thereby affecting the performances of sludge anaerobic digestion when pfs is dissolved in hydrous media such as sewage sludge sulfate iron and their hydroxyl polymers will co exist as a compound being rich in iron pfs would provide the required iron element for the synthesis of iron containing enzymes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis or aceticlastic methanogenesis and meanwhile served as a scavenger for s2 in sludge which might be beneficial for methane production wei et al 2018b as a substance containing sulfate however pfs might serve as a special form of anaerobic respiration and terminal electron accepting process and thereby induced the enrichment of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and competition and or coexistence with methanogens for carbon and electrons as well as the production of hydrogen sulfide which could result in a shift in the metabolic pathways of organic substrates and the change of microbial community structure in anaerobic digestion cetecioglu et al 2019 hansen et al 1999 ozuolmez et al 2015 qiao et al 2016 and as the hydroxyl polymers such as fe3 oh 4 5 fe5o2 oh 6 5 which play a core role in coagulation process and have a similar but better performance with ferric hydroxide may induce the aggregation of sludge flocs and the alteration of subsequent anaerobic digestion performance moussas et al 2009 the effect of coagulant e g fecl3 and pacl on acidogenic fermentation of ps have been clearly reported by lin et al 2017 2018 which demonstrated that fecl3 dosed at 10 30 mg fe l sewage had little influence on sludge hydrolysis and volatile fatty acid production whereas an obvious inhibitory effect was observed for pacl in organic hydrolysis of the ps these excellent attempts open the box of coagulant s effect on anaerobic fermentation of ps however the was has different properties compared to ps for instance was is the sludge produced by biological process and it mainly contains biomass and extracellular polymeric substances whereas ps is the sludge composed of settleable particulate organics removed from wastewater pretreatment processes up to now however there is no information available on the effects of pfs the mixture or synthesis being made up of sulfate iron and hydroxyl polymer on the anaerobic digestion of real was and moreover the underlying mechanisms and microbial community response to pfs during anaerobic was digestion have not been yet thoroughly investigated thus the main objective of this work is to reveal the effects of pfs on the anaerobic was digestion firstly the effects of pfs at different dosages 0 5 10 20 or 40 g kg ts on methane production during anaerobic was digestion was investigated then the underlying mechanisms for pfs affecting the digestion were identified by assessing its effect on the solubilization of was the processes of was hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis the contributions of the intermediates decomposed from pfs to methane production the microbial community as well to our knowledge this is the first work reporting the adverse effects of pfs on the anaerobic digestion of real was the findings obtained will provide insights into the pfs involved anaerobic digestion system and are supposed to make a sound contribution to mitigate pfs s negative effects in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and pfs the was used in this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtp with sludge retention time of 20 d in changsha china where pfs was not used in wastewater treatment the was was concentrated by gravity thickening at 4 c for 24 h and screened with a 1 mm sieve to remove impurities before use the main characteristics of used was were as follows ph 6 8 0 1 total solids ts 38300 600 mg l volatile solids vs 24800 350 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand cod 170 10 mg l total cod 37000 420 mg l total carbohydrate 3900 160 mg cod l and total protein 17800 220 mg cod l the seed sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester fed with was in our lab and its main characteristics were ph 6 9 0 1 ts 16500 320 mg l vs 12300 350 mg l total cod 19800 380 mg l specific activity on acetate 0 12 g ch4 cod g vs d the pfs used in this study was purchased from chongqing reagent company which has a total iron value of 20 and with a residual ferrous content less than 0 1 2 2 methane production during was anaerobic digestion in the presence of different pfs levels anaerobic digestion of was in the presence of different pfs levels was conducted through batch experiments in five replicate serum reactors each with a working volume of 1 0 l first each reactor was fed with 800 ml was afterward different volumes of pfs solution 3 w w were added into those reactors to achieve the predetermined dosage at the beginning of the experiment followed by 120 rpm of stirring for 2 min and 60 rpm for 10 min zhang et al 2018 zouboulis et al 2008 the predetermined dosages of pfs addition were 0 control 5 10 20 and 40 g kg ts respectively next 400 ml of seed sludge was equally divided and added before the ph of these five reactors was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 with 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide then each reactor was diluted with milli q water to 1 0 l to exclude the methane production from seed sludge one blank reactor contained 80 ml of seed sludge and 920 ml of milli q water was also operated oxygen in all the reactors was removed by purging with nitrogen gas for 5 min after that all reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and incubated at 35 1 c in an air bath shaker 120 rpm the ph of all reactors was controlled at 7 0 0 1 in the whole digestion period the biogas yield methane and h2s content in biogas were determined every 2 days the calculation of the cumulative volume of methane was detailed in our previous publications wang et al 2018 it should be noted that all tests were conducted in triplicate in this study and the methane production reported were net values with the values measured in blank excluded 2 3 effect of pfs on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of anaerobic digestion in the digesters operated above the concentration of soluble protein carbohydrate in digestion supernate vss reduction and floc size of sludge were analyzed after digestion of 3 days and by comparing these results the impact of pfs on solubilization process could be indicated to assess the effect of pfs on the processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis the following batch tests using synthetic wastewaters were carried out angelidaki et al 2009 wang et al 2018 twelve reactors with working volume of 1 0 l each were first divided into four groups test i test ii test iii and test iv with three in each test i test ii test iii and test iv were respectively used to evaluate the impact of pfs on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetotrophic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis all these tests were lasted for 3 d test i the three reactors received 920 ml synthetic wastewater and 80 ml of the same seed sludge collected from a laboratory anaerobic sludge digester the synthetic wastewater contains 6 0 g bsa and 1 2 g dextran two reactors were respectively fed with 0 15 and 0 60 g pfs the amount of pfs is equal to that in the 5 and 20 g kg ts pfs digester respectively while the other reactor received no pfs and was set as the control all other conditions were the same as those described above by measuring the degradation rates of protein and dextran the effect of pfs on hydrolysis process could be indicated test ii this test was operated the same as that described in test i except that the substrates i e bsa and dextran in synthetic wastewater were replaced by 4 0 g l alanine model amino acid compound and 0 8 g glucose model monosaccharide compound respectively test iii the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as that described in test i except that 3 0 g sodium acetate was employed to replace bsa and dextran in synthetic wastewater test iv the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as that described in test i except that the mixture of standard gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen was employed to replace bsa and dextran in gas and liquid phase by flushing the configured standard gas for 5 min 2 4 identifying the effect of components of pfs on methane production as mentioned above the chemical components of pfs can be divided into three types hydroxyl polymers iron sulfate in hydrous media and sediments the addition of pfs would introduce these three components into the digestion system which might have different effects on anaerobic digestion to reveal this question the following batch test was carried out using real sludge as the digestion substrates in this test 5 replicate serum bottles with identical working volume 1 0 l were performed and each received 800 ml was among them one was served as the control without addition of any chemical while the other 4 bottles received 20 g kg ts pfs 11 6 g kg ts ferric chloride 20 6 g kg ts potassium sulfate or 14 3 g kg ts ferric sulfate respectively it should be noted that ferric chloride and potassium sulfate were set as substitute for iron and sulfate to evaluate their effect on methane production respectively with their initial concentrations selected based on the stoichiometric content of iron and sulfate in 20 g kg ts pfs because the hydroxyl polymers cannot be modeled the ferric sulfate was used as a substitute for co exist of iron and sulfate to qualitatively reflect its effect on methane production after the addition of the chemicals all the bottles were diluted with milli q water to 920 ml and inoculated with 80 ml seed sludge after flushing with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen all bottles were sealed closely and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm under 35 1 c all other operating steps were the same as those mentioned in section 2 2 2 5 long term operation of semi continuous digesters for microbial activities and community measurement to reveal the effect of pfs on anaerobic digestion of was from the point of microbial activities and community two semi continuous digesters were operated in this work the two reactors were fed with either 0 or 20 g kg ts pfs added sludge with the 20 g kg ts chosen as the representative dosage of pfs in the actual dewatered sludge at the start up phase from 0 to the day of maximum methane production occurred in batch tests the two semi continuous digesters were operated the same as 0 or 20 g kg ts pfs added reactors in section 2 2 respectively and then the sludge retention time in the two digesters was controlled at 20 and 26 d by withdrawing 50 1 and 38 5 ml of digestion mixtures and replacing with respective same volume of new sludge each day respectively based on the results of the batch experiments in section 2 2 after 2 months operation the daily methane production did not change significantly with time and then the measurements of key enzyme activities and microbial community were conducted 2 6 model based analysis methane production was simulated by the modified gompertz equation eq 1 and kinetic parameters mm maximal methane yield

releasing the pressure in the serum bottle using a 300 ml glass syringe to equilibrate with the room pressure according to the literature wang et al 2019a 2020 the composition of methane and h2s in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector according to the method documented in the literatures liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019b concentrations of aqueous

distribution analysis was performed using a malvern mastersizer 2000 instrument with a detection range of 0 01 3500 µm in addition the activities of protease acetate kinase amidase and coenzyme f420 in semi continuous digesters were measured based on the methods reported previously without major modifications du et al 2020 fu et al 2021 liu et al 2019 the microbial community in semi continuous digesters was determined using high throughput 16s rrna gene based illuminamiseq sequencing with the 515fmodf gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806rmodr ggactacnvgggtwtctaat chosen as pcr primers and the operational taxonomic units otus clustered with 97 similarity cutoff xu et al 2020b 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as mean standard deviation values an analysis of variance with least significant difference test was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pfs on methane production from anaerobic digestion of was fig 1 a shows the cumulative methane yield from was during anaerobic digestion in the presence of different levels of pfs after 32 days of digestion no significant increment of methane production can be found in each digester p 0 05 table s1 indicating that the complete anaerobic digestion had been achieved it can be observed that the optimum digestion time for the digester without pfs addition was 20 d and at this time the maximal methane yield was obtained i e 144 7 5 0 ml g vs although similar tendencies of methane accumulation were also observed in other digesters with pfs addition the methane yield was significantly inhibited by pfs the cumulative methane yield decreased gradually from 91 7 0 3 to 68 0 0 2 of the control with respect to the increasing pfs levels from 5 to 20 g kg ts and then further decreased to 56 7 0 2 of the control with increasing pfs level to 40 g kg ts further investigation determined that the maximal methane yield showed a well negative correlation with the pfs levels in the sludge y 152 14 3 15 x 0 04 x2 r2 0 9963 fig s2 to further understand the impact of pfs on anaerobic sludge digestion the anaerobic digestion kinetics were estimated using the modified gompertz model eq 2 the simulated methane production curves are shown in fig 1a which indicates the fit of methane production to the used model was satisfactory r2 0 96 in all studies cases three kinetic parameters i e maximal methane yield potential mm maximal methane production rate rm and lag phase time λ were obtained and showed in fig 1b and table s2 in general mm and rm decreased exponentially with the increased pfs levels while the λ presented a reverse tendency it has been reported that rm is directly relevant to the methanogenic activity while λ corresponds with the start up of digester and both of them depend on the acclimation period of microorganisms to a proper substrate and environmental condition in a batch culture batstone et al 2004 lay et al 1997 thus it can be concluded that the presence of pfs resulted in the variations of sludge characters and or digestion system conditions e g solubilization rate soluble organic components floc size which would be further uncovered in the following text the above results suggested that the presence of pfs not only decreased biochemical methane potential but also inhibited the rate of methane production and prolonged the start up period 3 2 details of how pfs affects the process of anaerobic digestion anaerobic sludge digestion generally contains solubilization of sludge particulate matters hydrolysis of macromolecular organics e g protein carbohydrate acidogenesis of micromolecular organics e g amino acid glucose and methanogenesis of acetate and co2 h2 fig s3 liu et al 2020a 2020b luo et al 2020a the above results indicated that the terminal product of anaerobic digestion methane was negatively affected by pfs but it is still unknown the potential effect of pfs on the four successive bioprocesses the following analyses were therefore conducted to uncover these gaps in this study the effect of pfs on solubilization process was indicated by comparing the concentration of soluble protein carbohydrate in digestion supernate vss reduction and floc size of sludge after digestion of 3 days when the solubilized organics from was had not been massively bio consumed for methane production fig s3 luo et al 2020b wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a both soluble protein and carbohydrate decreased significantly in pfs added reactors except for the lowest pfs dosage p 0 05 in all studied cases and with the increment of pfs addition the soluble protein and carbohydrate concentration decreased gradually in the 20 g kg ts pfs added reactor the soluble protein and carbohydrate were respectively 534 2 18 0 mg cod l and 121 7 5 5 mg cod l which were only approximately 66 6 and 69 5 of that in control suggesting that the addition of pfs inhibited the solubilization process of sludge this can be further confirmed by vss reduction fig 2b an index of specific meaning for sludge solubilization xu et al 2019 after 3 days digestion the vss reduction in the control was 13 2 0 5 whereas the corresponding value was only 7 3 0 4 in 40 g kg ts pfs added reactor the higher the pfs dosage the lower the sludge solubilization and the less the levels of organic substrates provided for subsequent methane producing process fig 2d r2 0 9822 the solubilization of sludge is defectively relevant to its floc size xu et al 2020a fig 2c illustrates the effect of pfs on the floc size distribution of sludge after digestion of 3 days the distribution of floc size moved to the increasing direction along with the pfs dosage the medium diameter of raw sludge was 34 7 2 0 μm with the addition of 20 g pfs kg ts for instance the medium diameter raised to 58 3 2 8 μm indicating the physical enmeshment increased with the increasing addition of pfs dosage as a result of physical enmeshment which increased the mass transfer resistance between the organics substrates and microbes chu et al 2005 it can be revealed why the increase addition of pfs inhibited the sludge solubilization process as well as the methane production fig 2d r2 0 9764 the results of batch tests using model organics as substrates were summarized in table s3 and fig s4 it can be observed that the degradations of all tested substrates were affected and the higher the pfs dosage the lower the degradation efficiency fig 3 shows the specific degradation rates of model compounds obtained by the zero order kinetic model it can be seen that the specific degradation rates of bsa dextran l alanine glucose acetate and hydrogen in the control were 1 39 0 51 1 02 0 24 0 89 and 0 089 l l d respectively however in the presence of 20 g kg ts pfs these values decreased to 0 69 0 27 0 58 0 13 0 49 and 0 040 l l d and which was 49 6 52 9 56 9 54 2 55 1 and 40 8 of that in control respectively suggesting that the process of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis involved in anaerobic digestion were severely restrained by pfs as indicated by the correlation analysis in fig s5 the degradation rate of these model compounds showed a linear correlation with methane production rate in fig 1b with r2 values higher than 0 97 in addition the activities of key enzymes i e protease acetate kinase and coenzyme f420 in the semi continuous digesters were detected and the results were out lined in fig s6 it can be found that the relative activities of protease acetate kinase and coenzyme f420 which respectively represents the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes in 20 g kg ts pfs added digester was 62 8 70 5 and 57 3 of that in control digester thus it can be speculated that the inhibited enzymes activity was one reason for the restrained bio processes fig 3 and the decreased methane production rate fig 1b our previous publications indicated that the polymers such as pam an organic macromolecular flocculant would cover both organic substrate and anaerobic microbes through its chemical characteristics resulting in the deterioration of normal enzyme metabolism wang et al 2018 the hydrolyzed pfs might play a similar role in the batch digester besides the chemical effect the main derivatives of pfs such as fe iii and sulfate as well as their aggregations would act as the electron acceptor and cause alterations of anaerobic biological processes which were explored in the following analyses fig 4 shows the profile curves of aqueous iron and sulfate sulfide in the 20 g kg ts pfs added digester dissolved fe iii and sulfate decreased gradually along with digestion time indicating the iron and sulfate reduction during anaerobic digestion of was yu et al 2018 correspondingly the fe ii increased substantially from 0 1 0 0 mg l to 2 6 0 1 mg l after 4 days of anaerobic digestion and the sulfide rose piecemeal in the whole digestion time 0 7 3 5 mg s l indicating the reduction of iron and sulfate which were driven by iron and sulfate reduction bacteria irb and srb respectively liu et al 2015 paulo et al 2015 however the fe ii concentration peaked on day 4 and then decreased immediately to nearly zero on day 16 which showed an inverse tendency with that of sulfide and could be attributed to the precipitation of fe ii with sulfide based on the preliminary balance analysis of iron and sulfur in the anaerobic digestion system it can be found that most of them were precipitated and or adsorbed in sediments 80 besides the behavior occurred in liquid phase there might exist some biological or chemical behaviors of pfs and its derivates in sediments that affecting methane producing process van den berg et al 1980 zeng et al 2020 which required to be further investigations in the future fig 4c further illustrates the h2s production in control and pfs added reactors during anaerobic digestion in the initial stage of anaerobic digestion 0 14 days the h2s production in pfs added reactors were all lower than that of control the inhibited production of h2s could be attributed to the mass transfer resistance between the sulfate and sulfate reducing bacteria caused by pfs and the precipitation of sulfide with fe ii however as anaerobic digestion progressed the cumulative h2s production in pfs added reactors exceeded that of control after 32 days of digestion the cumulative h2s production in the control was 93 2 4 8 10 4 ml g vs and the cumulative production in the 20 and 40 g kg ts pfs added reactor was respectively 107 3 5 5 10 4 and 118 7 6 0 10 4 ml g vs which was 115 1 and 127 4 of the control in fig 4b the concentration of sulfate in liquid phase showed no significant decrement after digestion of 14 days indicating that the occurrence of sulfate reduction in the solid phase and might be attributed to the reduction of sulfur containing compounds and the precipitated sulfate substance deserved from pfs as well it should be noted that h2s might have an inhibitory effect on some methanogenic species which might lower the methane production because the used seed sludge was not sulfate acclimatised in present study cetecioglu et al 2019 and this might be another reason for the decreased methane production in fig 1 the above results indicated that the addition of pfs in sludge increased the h2s production during anaerobic digestion which might damage methanogens in anaerobic digestion system and cause detrimental problems such as malodors health hazards and corrosion need to be taken seriously zeng et al 2020 3 3 identifying the effect of components of pfs on methane production addition of pfs would introduce three components i e hydroxyl polymers iron sulfate into the digestion system the different components of pfs might have different effect on sludge anaerobic digestion thus their respective impacts on methane yield were identified in this work fig s7 illustrates the methane production from the components added reactors along with the digestion time with the corresponding kinetic parameters of each case shown in fig 5 a 6 c it was clearly observed that all of these components from pfs significantly affected the methane production during anaerobic digestion of was p 0 05 in all studied cases the potassium sulfate as the substitute of sulfate from pfs showed a 17 5 0 1 inhibition on methane production as summarized in fig 5d the sulfate could induce the enrichment of srb and the competition of organic substrates with methanogens as well as the production of hydrogen sulfide in anaerobic digestion systems fig 4c which could diffuse across cell membranes and result in protein denaturation and enzyme inactivation thereby deteriorate the anaerobic digestion for methane production ge et al 2013 wei et al 2018b yuan et al 2016 this study further confirmed these conclusions similarly the addition of related dose of ferric sulfate led to a 11 1 0 1 decrement of methane production the reason for this result might be that the iron content was inadequate for sulfate precipitation in the presence of ferric chloride as the substitute of iron from pfs the methane production of was increased approximately 17 6 0 1 compared with that of the control this result was accorded with the favorable effect of iron on the anaerobic digestion process previously reported and as shown in fig 5d the improvement could be attributed to two aspects i being an essential component of microbial cells and ii serving as an accelerator for the hydrolysis acidification process and biodegradable organic matters generation liu et al 2015 wei et al 2018b yu et al 2015a 2015b compared to pfs the iron equivalent ferric sulfate showed less inhibition 11 1 versus 32 0 and this gap might be ascribed to the hydroxyl polymers to some extent our previous studies demonstrated that the organic polymer polyacrylamide would induce the aggregation of sludge flocs and increase the mass transfer resistance between the microbes and organic substrates thereby deteriorated the anaerobic digestion performances wang et al 2018 it is worth noting that the hydrolysis of ferric chloride also generates hydroxide polymers however such species are generally scattered in liquid solid phase at neutral conditions and easily decomposed by anaerobic microbes and further utilized for metabolism qin et al 2019 yu et al 2015a whereas the pfs derived hydroxide polymers could be expressed as feiok oh ij 2k i 3 j and multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers have more nucleus longer cross linked chains punchier aggregation 15 times higher coagulation efficiency jiang et al 1998 zouboulis et al 2008 might play a similar destroyer role toward anaerobic digestion in addition based on the variance analysis results within these cases fig 5a 5c it can be further demonstrated that among the main components and or forms of pfs present in anaerobic digester multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers and sulfate were unveiled to be the major contributors to the decreased biomethane potential p 0 02 and the multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers was the main buster to the slowed methane producing rate p 0 02 and the extended lag time p 0 01 it should be noted that the present identification was based on the stoichiometric composition of iron and sulfate in pfs with the physical differences between model reagents and the targeted derivates being ignored more works on the detailed biological or chemical behaviors and balance of sulfur and iron in the pfs added digestion system including gas liquid and solid phase should be carried later although the present results could provide an insight into the effect of components of pfs on methane production to some degree 3 4 effect of pfs on microbial community in long term operation of semi continuous digesters the microbial community was measured through high throughput 16s rrna sequencing to compare the community diversity structure and function in semi continuous digesters fig s8 illustrates the methane yield of the two semi continuous digesters which further confirmed that the presence of pfs inhibited the anaerobic methane production it can be found that after 2 months operation the methane yield in the two digesters did not change significantly with time indicating a stable state for microbial community measurement ecological diversity indices of the bacteria and archaea the simpsoneven simpson s e and shannon s h indices decreased in the pfs added reactor fig 6a in the presence of 20 g kg ts pfs the richness evenness and diversity metrics of 0 97 otus decreased from 1800 154 5 767 0 620 and 0 063 0 013 to 1466 130 0 050 0 009 and 5 214 0 480 the possible reason for this effect might contribute to the biotoxicity of pfs to anaerobic digestion process the results can be further revealed by a bipartite association network showing the associations of bacteria and archaea in each digester at genus level fig 6b and 7 c it can be found that of these species 88 7 bacteria and 100 archaea in pfs added digester were associated with the control indicating that the basic similarity of the communities in the two digesters however at pfs added digester the exclusive species regardless of bacteria and archaea were significantly lower than that of the control digester these results suggest that the presence of pfs can reduce microbial alpha diversity of digester sunburst plot based community analysis was carried out to reveal how the pfs affected the community structure of bacteria and archaea from the phylum level to genus level fig 7 for the bacteria community posted in fig 7a the chloroflexi bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in two detected digesters regardless of the presence or absence of pfs and no new dominant species emerged in the pfs added digesters which were consistent with the results outlined in fig 6 the predominant genera of bacteria were vadinha17 sp anaerolineaceae norank sp and longilinea sp which respectively affiliated to phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi and chloroflexi in the presence of 20 g kg ts pfs varied much from that of the control in relative abundances the anaerolineaceae norank sp and longilinea sp which were reported to have ability to degrade some carbohydrates and be associated to syntrophic communities of bacteria and methanogenic archaea xu et al 2017 yamada et al 2007 decreased to 7 7 and 8 8 in 20 g kg ts pfs added digester 13 1 and 12 7 in control digester respectively similar trends could be found in genera anaerolineaceae noclassified sp leptolinea sp and bd1 7 clade sp which have been documented to be hydrocarbon degraders and main participators in hydrolysis acidification process kim et al 2012 liu et al 2019 indicating that the pfs caused the shift of the microbial structure toward the direction against hydrolysis and acidogenesis which were in agreement with the deteriorated performances in hydrolysis and acidogenesis model experiments fig 3 the vadinha17 sp which was usually found in the environment rich in refractory and or complex organics such as pectin and hemicellulose accounted for 20 3 in the 20 g kg ts pfs added digester whereas this value was only 13 2 in the control was assumed to be the despondence for the formed multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers derived from pfs liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2011 specially the genera of thermodesulfovibrio sp belonged to phyla nitrospirae and is capable of sulfate and or iron reducing was enriched with the presence of pfs 3 04 versus 1 97 reflecting that the pfs stimulated the sulfate and or iron reducing bacteria during anaerobic digestion sekiguchi et al 2008 regarding the archaeal community the predominant genera of methanogens were methanosaeta sp methanobacterium sp candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and methanolinea sp which accounted for 47 2 21 9 11 9 and 6 65 of archaea 16s rrna gene sequences of the control fig 7b in the presence of pfs e g 20 g kg ts the structure of predominant genera of methanogens did not differ much from that of the control but their relative abundance shifted largely the genera of methanobacterium sp candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and methanolinea sp which have been proved to be hydrogenotrophic methanogens he et al 2019 sakai et al 2012 dropped to 11 5 7 83 and 3 13 respectively the genera of methanosaeta sp the only known strict acetoclastic methanogen narayanan et al 2009 increased significantly with the addition of 20 g pfs kg ts from 47 2 to 68 4 and the woesearchaeia norank sp has the ability to use h2 to reduce methyl compounds to produce ch4 gründger et al 2019 also increased to 3 93 these facts suggested that the pathway of ch4 production was partially transferred from hydrogenotrophic to acetotrophic methanogenesis which further confirmed that the presence of pfs showed a severer inhibition on hydrogenotrophic methanogens than acetotrophic methanogens as shown in fig 2c previous studies demonstrated that the diffusion of gas in polymer solutions is far less effective than low molecular organics thus it can be speculated that the severe mass transfer resistance of h2 between the syntrophs and methanogens caused by the formed multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers of pfs were the contributors to the transferred methanogenesis pathway and inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogens caulfied et al 2002 kawashima et al 1990 in addition as shown in fig 7a pfs stimulated the sulfate and or iron reducing bacteria during anaerobic digestion i e thermodesulfovibrio sp the genera of thermodesulfovibrio sp was proven to be a generalist participating in the metabolism of anaerobic intermediates and use pyruvate and hydrogen as electron donors in the presence of sulfate liang et al 2016 and more importantly they have a higher appetency for hydrogen than methanogens in the case of insufficient limited hydrogen content which might be the other reasons for the shift and or differences deciphered above harada et al 1994 3 6 implications for wastewater and sludge treatments this study investigated the effects of pfs on anaerobic digestion of was and underlying mechanisms for the first time through batch and long term tests using either synthetic wastewaters or real was as the digestion substrates it was found that the presence of pfs resulted in a terrible performance of anaerobic sludge digestion from macro to micro levels it was revealed that the physical enmeshment caused by pfs significantly lessened the levels of organic substrates for methane producing process the presence of pfs severely restrained the anaerobic bio processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis by lowering down the activities of the relevant enzymes and meanwhile the produced or surplus sulfide from pfs also had a toxicity on methanogens fig 8 which could be confirmed by microbial community results especially pfs s inhibitions to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was much severer than that to acetotrophic methanogenesis which could be further supported by the elevated abundances of methanosaeta sp and the dropped abundances of methanobacterium sp in pfs added digester and probably due to the severe mass transfer resistance of hydrogen between the syntrophs and methanogens caused by pfs as well as the higher hydrogen appetency of pfs induced sulfate reducing bacteria considering the negative effects of pfs on anaerobic sludge digestion more attentions should be paid when using in wastewater management and sludge treatments systems to avoid its entrance to the was anaerobic system although the use of flocculants such as pfs is inevitable there are two optimal solutions to lower down the possibility of pfs entering sludge anaerobic system one is to compound with other no or less toxicity flocculants such as ferric chloride chitosan starch and other microbial flocculants by which the usage amount of pfs could be significantly reduced in flocculants process wei et al 2018a yu et al 2015b the other one is to lessen the percentage of sulfate through modifying the pfs using some natural compounds such as sodium alginate and chitosan wu et al 2019a 2019b the sewage and sludge treatment should be coupled as a whole one should not consider only the performances enhancement of sewage pretreatment and or sludge dewatering by using plenty of flocculants and ignore the flocculant s potential effect to other biochemical processes such as biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion in addition the physical enmeshment caused by pfs and high ts of sludge was found to be one of the reasons for the decreased methane production thus it can be speculated that diluting the pfs contained sludge might be an effective way for mitigating pfs s negative effects however it is noticeable that this work mainly aimed to provide insights into the pfs involved anaerobic digestion system more effects should be devoted to mitigating pfs s negative effects in the future 4 conclusion this study revealed the effects of pfs on anaerobic digestion of was and underlying mechanisms for the first time the main conclusions are 1 the presence of pfs not only decreased biochemical methane potential but also inhibited the methane production rate and prolonged the start up period during anaerobic sludge digestion 2 pfs significantly lessened the levels of organic substrates for methane producing process and meanwhile severely restrained the anaerobic bio processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis 3 pfs decreased the microbial diversity and caused the shift of microbial structure toward the direction against hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis 4 multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers and sulfate from pfs were unveiled to be the major contributors to the decreased biomethane potential and the multinucleate and multichain hydroxyl polymers were the chief buster to the slowed methane producing rate and the extended lag time the findings obtained herein would make a sound contribution to the mitigation of pfs

the interaction of ceo2 nanoparticles cenps with mps generated from a disposable plastic container further rough mps r mps generated through mechanical abrasion of mps with sand were used to probe the impact of roughness to understand the sorption kinetics and underlying interaction processes batch experiments were carried out the results distinctly indicate that cenps sorption occurred on mps surfaces and was consistent with the pseudo second order kinetics model for pristine mps the sorption capacity was as high as 12 9 mg g while for r mps kinetic equilibrium was achieved faster and an enhanced sorption capacity 13 4 mg g was identified a rise in sorption with an increase in salinity was noted while ph and humic acid exhibited a negative correlation the observed interactions were attributed to the aggregation profile and surface charge of cenps and mps surprisingly cenps also got loaded onto mps in non agitated and undisturbed conditions the sorption process was influenced by

proficiency in manufacturing will soon leave the earth engulfed by plastic waste the exponential rise in demand for plastics in 2015 has led to an approximately 620 increase in plastic pellet resin production as compared to 1975 jambeck et al 2015 very recently tiny plastic particles have attracted a lot of attention in the scientific community this includes microplastics mps i e plastic particles of size smaller than 5 mm barnes et al 2009 thompson et al 2004 mps are categorized as primary and secondary based on their origin primary mps are intentionally produced for end user consumption derraik 2002 fendall and sewell 2009 whereas secondary mps are generated by the exertion of various environmental forces such as physical chemical and biological andrady 2011 the small

on account of reduced size and colorful appearance plastic particles are mistakenly ingested and then reside within the guts of aquatic organisms cole et al 2013 redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 rillig and bonkowski 2018 furthermore mps are known to interfere with reproduction gene expression and cause mortality alimba and faggio 2019 bhagat et al 2020 mps are of great concern as they have the propensity to bind contaminants from its surrounding based on contaminant properties partition coefficients and they are well known to co transport pollutants including pathogens browne et al 2007

in sediments teuten et al 2007 wang et al reported partitioning as the major interaction for contaminants such as perfluorooctanesulfonamide and perfluorooctanesulfonate with mps not hydrophobicity wang et al 2015 unlike glassy polymers rubbery polymers such as polyethylene can accommodate a higher concentration of pollutants rodrigues et al 2019 studies have reported significantly higher adsorption of pollutants on mp than in the environmental matrix including heavy metals brennecke et al 2016 hüffer et al 2018 munier and bendell 2018 few metals were found to be concentrated on mps owing to their proximity to the contaminated site carbery et al 2020 while another study has highlighted the local accumulation of heavy metals on mps to be higher than its ambient environment ashton et al 2010 another report has emphasized a higher adsorption affinity of weathered mps for metals due to the development of anionic sites on the surface holmes et al 2014 though there are studies on mps aided metal ion sorption and transport not much attention has been given to the interaction between mps and novel emerging nanoparticles nps in the environment unlike other pollutants nanoparticles such as nanometal oxides have unique physicochemical properties different from their bulk counterparts having a similar chemical composition which has promoted their widespread applications and commercialization to a great extent metal oxide nps are well known to occur in the environment and can generate reactive oxygen species which are a serious threat to microbiota plants as well as humans garner and keller 2014 yang et al 2013 nanoceria or cerium oxide nps cenps have extensive industrial applications as catalysts glass polishing agents solar cells as well as in bio medicals as antioxidants bhagat et al 2019 hu et al 2018 estimations suggest an increased utilization of cenps that has led to a higher production amounting to approximately 10 000 t year in 2010 of which 1800 t were ultimately deposited into air water and soil whereas the rest was dumped into landfills keller et al 2013 once these nps are in the environment they tend to interact with the pre existing mps several parameters control the partitioning between solid and aqueous phases of contaminants in an aquatic environment however no reports have so far addressed the sorption of cenps onto mps which may affect its potential impact on the ecosystem bhagat et al 2019 deng et al 2017 mps in the environment are exposed to physical weathering due to mechanical abrasion by sand wind or water along with uv light that causes photo oxidation and leads to chain scission or crosslinking of the polymer bonds song et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the decrease in mechanical strength also results in the development of surface features to produce brittle and rough plastics with cracks including alteration in roughness polarity surface charge and porosity torkzaban and bradford 2016 the nanoscale roughness of a surface governs physicochemical and mechanical properties and is known to alter bio attachment processes microbial colonization and surface area pan et al 2019 verran and boyd 2001 recent studies demonstrate that collector surface roughness and topography affect colloid retention and consequently its adhesion on the collector surfaces such as rock darbha et al 2012 krishna darbha et al 2012 although dramatic changes in the roughness of mps with varying degrees of micro cracks have been observed during weathering pan et al 2019 there is still a lack of information about how weathering leads to nanoscale roughness and subsequently affects the sorption of cenps on mps in addition to surface roughness other factors that influence sorption include ph temperature dissolved organic matter dom and ionic strength in an aqueous environment khandelwal et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to comprehend the interaction between nps and mps surface in its surrounding environment single use plastic containers often used to serve beverages can be a significant source of microplastics for the environment polyethylene polypropylene and expanded polystyrene along with several additives are being used to produce such disposable plastic containers the huge amount of these adds to the nuisance of plastic waste that is susceptible to form complexes with other pollutants in the environment this has promoted us to use mps from single use plastic containers in this work to uncover its interaction probability with cenps to the best knowledge of the authors to address the interaction and sorption of metal oxide nanoparticle and mps for the first time this study was conducted with the primary objectives i to assess the potential of cenps sorption to mps by interpreting sorption kinetic and isotherm studies and ii to understand the effect of surface roughness of mps on the sorption process besides we also investigated the sorption process in complex conditions and relevant aqueous matrices such as in presence of varying degrees of dom ph salinity absence of agitation and finally in synthetic freshwater sfw and ambient river water rw 2 materials

hcl naoh acetone n hexane suprapur nitric acid 65 and hydrochloric acid 30 were procured from merck whereas spectroscopy grade methanol was bought from finar india disposable plastic containers sanpac were acquired from a local supermarket kalyani west bengal india sand and water samples were collected from digha beach and hooghly river west bengal india respectively as provided in supplementary information si fig s1 2 2 pretreatment the sand sample was processed to remove large debris and existing microplastics thompson et al 2004 and finally heat treated before its use the river water was filtered through a 0 22 µm nylon membrane before it was used in the experiments plastic containers were carefully cut into uniform circular shape using a paper puncher precautions were taken to avoid any rubbing of the surfaces mps produced were washed repeatedly with 1 m hcl in methanol acetone followed by n hexane to remove any surface bound substances to generate artificially weathered rough mps r mps required for further experimentation sufficient amount of pristine mps p mps in 50 ml glass flasks containing pretreated sand and milli q water were kept in an incubator shaker scigenics biotech orbitek for 5 days in the dark at 250 rpm 25 c after that mps were collected using a tweezer washed as mentioned before and dried in a desiccator the original cenp suspension was sonicated and a stock solution of 1000 mg l 1 was prepared in milli q water the cenp stock was maintained at ph 6 5 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solution and stored at 4 c in dark till further use 2 3 characterization the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of cenps were measured using a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 the point of zero charge phpzc for cenps was determined using malvern zetasizer equipped with an auto titrator the type of polymer in mps produced from the disposable plastic container was identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet is5 with 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 recording from 400 to 4000 cm 1 zeta potential for mps was evaluated from streaming potential using a surpass apparatus anton paar with respect to ph as described earlier lützenkirchen and richter 2013 the surface morphologies of cenps and both mps were confirmed under the scanning electron microscope sem images were captured with carl zeiss supra 55vp field emission sem by fixing mps on the sticky carbon tape after coating with a sputter coater the size of mps thus produced was measured using a magnification of 0 75x under a leica m80 stereomicroscope equipped with a leica ec3 digital camera the nanoscale roughness of p mps and sand treated mps was analyzed using a ntegra atomic force microscope afm nt mdt santa clara ca at ambient condition first the scan range was evaluated for both types of mps to define the representative area si fig s2 to get reliable results using semi contact mode darbha et al 2012 roughness parameters were calculated by scanning the estimated scan area for mps subsequently the data obtained were processed using image metrology scanning probe image processing spip software sand samples were characterized for mineralogical phases si fig s3 and composition si table s1 river water ph dom and major ions content were determined si table s2 using a multi water parameter probe toc analyzer and titration method 2 4 batch sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed to elucidate the interaction between cenps and mps as evident from earlier studies a huge range of mps concentration from 0 5 g l 1 to 50 g l 1 was observed to be used in the batch experiments hüffer et al 2020 kasmuri and tarmizi 2019 yu et al 2020 therefore the target concentration of mps used in the present study was derived to be in between the ratio from earlier available studies while the concentration of cenps was selected based on the previous studies gupta et al 2020 tolaymat et al 2017 and preliminary examination to carry out sorption experiments 50 mg mps were added to 50 ml glass flasks containing 10 ml of 50 mg l 1 cenps suspension equivalent to 4 5 10 17 ml 1 particle number as calculated from eq 1 in si in milli q water samples were placed in an orbital incubator shaker at 250 rpm and 25 c in dark kinetic analysis of sorption at regular intervals for 48 hr suggested that an equilibration condition was achieved in 24 hr for mps therefore further sorption experiments were carried out for 24 hr the effect of cenp concentration on sorption on mps was evaluated in the sorption realm by varying concentrations in the range of 20 125 mg l 1 to study the effect of salinity artificial seawater was prepared 0 05 3 as reported rihan et al 2014 the effect of ph dom and a stagnant i e unstirred condition on the sorption capacity was also evaluated the complex environment was mimicked with prepared sfw and further in river water si table s2 all the experiments were also performed with r mps to understand the impact of roughness on sorption phenomenon all the sorption kinetics and isotherm experiments were performed in triplicate at ph 6 5 and 25 c unless otherwise specified sample elutes were recovered by filtering through a stainless steel mesh of 800 µm or mps were carefully pick using a tweezer whenever required for analysis 2 5 microwave digestion and icp oes analysis mps and reaction elutes were acid digested in a multiwave go microwave digestion system anton paar as specified in table 1 the digestion protocol was operated to achieve complete digestion in either case i e when using mps or elute of the reaction mixture after acid digestion the samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes thermo scientific thermo icap 7400 including qtegra software appropriate experimental and instrumental blanks were used during the investigation to confirm sorption on mps as given in si mass balance was used to calculate the amount of cenps sorbed from volume v of suspension onto mps of mass m as given below 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 and ce are concentrations of cenp estimated from icp oes as ce in aqueous condition at initial and equilibrium stage respectively 2 6 aggregation of ceo2 nanoparticles the behavior of cenps varies in different water chemistry tiwari et al 2020 that may direct their further interaction with mps therefore the hydrodynamic size of cenps was monitored using dynamic light scattering dls at an angle of 90 at different concentrations salinity ph and ha corresponding to that in batch experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ceo2 nanoparticles the estimated hydrodynamic diameter of cenps was found to be 100 0 6 nm fig 1 a the zeta potential varied from 38 2 0 4 to 6 5 1 7 in ph range 3 to 9 and phpzc was obtained at ph 8 4 fig 1b tiwari et al 2020 the size and morphology obtained from sem imaging represent cenps of 50 nm to be cubical fig 1c the size observed by dls was larger than that by sem because of the solvation effect 3 1 2 microplastics from disposable plastic glass the mp polymer type was identified to be polypropylene by comparing obtained ftir spectra with a pre existing library in omnic software the peaks at 2917 1437 and 1354 cm 1 reflect ch stretching ch2 deformation and ch3 deformation respectively and 1156 970 and 844 cm 1 represent bands for isotactic polypropylene fig 1d urbaniak domagala 2012 streaming potential performed as a function of ph yield zeta potentials for the mps produced from disposable containers that varied from 19 2 0 2 mv to 41 2 0 7 mv in the ph range 2 5 to 9 5 while phpzc was detected at ph 4 9 fig 1e kosmulski 2009 the size of mp particles was observed to be 5 mm under the stereomicroscope with uneven r mps surface as represented in fig 2 a b inset the morphology of p mps as depicted by the sem monographs was smooth and uniform without any cracks while the surface of r mps was irregular and coarse with lesions fig 2a b the afm roughness profile processed through spip software was used to estimate the roughness parameters and analyze the topography of mp surfaces the scan size of mp images was established to be 100 100 µm2 fig s2 the nanoscale roughness was estimated via various roughness parameters sa sq sz sv and sp value as represented in si table s3 after the physical weathering of mps with sand a remarkable increase in the root mean square sq in sand treated r mps 42 7 nm was calculated as compared to p mps 19 4 nm the r mps exposed to mechanical abrasion by sand were more than twice as rough as the unexposed p mps with irregular protrusions and asperities evident as positive peaks and negative valleys fig 2c d 3 2 sorption of ceo2 on mps 3 2 1 effect of contact time kinetic modeling the effect of contact time on sorption of cenps to mps surface was studied showing that cenps adhered to both p mps and r mps which were highly stable in suspension throughout 24 hr fig 3 a b experimental data represents an initial rapid increase in the sorption capacity of mps with time fig 3a however at optimum time a plateau was achieved at 24 hr and 12 hr for p mps and r mps respectively this reflects that the surface was not saturated until the equilibration was reached r mps sorption rate was higher and equilibration was attained faster as compared to p mps which was attributed to the easy exposure of active sites involved in sorption process in r mps this certainly indicates that mp surfaces are capable of transporting metal oxide nps the opposite surface charge at circumneutral ph may result in electrostatic interactions between mps and cenps fig 1b e although the roughness produced through mechanical abrasion by sand during very small period 5 days the experimental results demonstrated that surface features play a key role in sorption process of mps torkzaban and bradford found that nanoscale roughness influences carboxylate modified latex kinetics as the energy barrier to attachment decreases drastically torkzaban and bradford 2016 liang et al demonstrated that retention of ag np on rough and smooth sand was related to changes in the interaction energy profile liang et al 2019 to understand the sorption mechanism and rate limiting steps the kinetic results were modelled by widely used kinetics models i e pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso elovich and intra particle diffusion ipd models using linearized equations fig 3c f and table 2 the summary of the obtained model parameters for ceo2 sorption on mps is provided in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 was found to be highest in pso model for both mps 0 99 as compared to that for p mps and r mps in pfo 0 98 0 84 and elovich models 0 97 0 90 respectively furthermore the calculated sorption capacity of cenps by the pso equation i e 6 95 mg g 1 and 7 38 mg g 1 for p mps and r mps respectively agreed with the experimentally ascertained value therefore the goodness of fit suggests that sorption of cenps followed pso model the elovich model was applied to decipher the chemisorption nature of heterogeneous mp surfaces aydin et al 2018 as estimated through the elovich equation the rate constant was higher in r mps 94 28 mg g 1 hr 1 while desorption constant 1 10 mg g 1 was lower as compared to in p mps supporting less detachment of cenps from r mp surfaces the good fit may indeed indicate sorption mechanism involving chemisorption which can be an artifact of electrostatic attraction of cenps followed by their aggregation on the negatively charged mps surface the overall sorption process involves four mechanisms of transfer including the rapid mass transfer of cenps to mp surfaces film diffusion surface and pore diffusion and rapid attachment of cenps at active sites on mps aydin et al 2018 for any sorption process the ipd model predicts the rate limiting step the current data show three linear sections through ipd modeling fig 3f corresponding to film diffusion ipd and equilibration although there was a good correlation between data the ipd line does not pass through the origin indicating it is not the only rate limiting step the fact that ipd was faster in r mps may be attributed to the ease of interaction on the new sites generated 3 2 2 effect of concentration sorption isotherm modeling to comprehend the effect of concentration of cenps on sorption capacity of mps experiments were carried out at varying concentrations 25 mg l 1 to 125 mg l 1 as evident from fig 4 a both mps showed an increase in sorption capacity with increasing nps concentration though the cenps were stable exhibiting no self aggregation in the range of concentrations studied fig 4b a continuous increase in the sorption was confirmed due to the oppositely charged mps at ph 6 5 that served as sites to form cenps heteroaggregates overall an increase in sorption capacity was noticed for r mps because of the presence of nanoscale roughness which is known to reduce the energy barrier of the interaction bradford et al 2017 the study performed with varying initial concentrations of cenps was used to describe the equilibration sorption isotherm adsorption of cenps on mps at 25 c was evaluated by estimating langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich dkr and temkin isotherms parameters table 3 the langmuir isotherm was more obviously followed by p mps with higher r2 0 84 as compared to r mps r2 0 76 supporting monolayer sorption having active surface site on p nps with equal affinity for all the cenps instead r mps rather showed agreement with the freundlich isotherm r2 0 86 suggesting heterogeneous nature of the surface indicating that the roughness changed the surface to non ideal nature potentially including multilayer stacking of nps the freundlich adsorption intensity n value 0 n 1 1 n and n 1 indicate favorable unfavorable and irreversible sorption al ghouti and da ana 2020 the estimated n was 0 42 and 0 41 for p mps and r mps respectively which also indicates surface heterogeneity and favorable sorption the maximum monolayer sorption capacity from the langmuir model was identified to be 12 93 mg g 1 and 13 43 mg g 1 for p mps and r mps respectively the estimated excess cenps particle number concentration retained on r mps is equivalent to 0 01 1019 ml 1 m 2 than p mps calculation shown in si this can be explained based on roughness developed on mps surface with the more exposed active surface area for interaction mp surfaces can be chemically heterogeneous depending on crystallinity and amorphous domains mei et al 2020 roughness due to aging can produce a significant change in the alignment of functional groups contributing to a higher sorption capacity kasálková et al 2015 although the dkr isotherm supports physical sorption the poor fit suggests that the sorption may not be due to physical processes in contrast independent experimental data suggest electrostatic attraction as a dominant interaction mechanism al ghouti and da ana 2020 however a poor dkr fit can be an artifact of multi layer ceo2 stacking on mps surface resulting in apparent heterogeneity the temkin isotherm supports chemical sorption where the rise in sorption increases the site coverage which in turn decreases the heat of sorption al ghouti and da ana 2020 the r2 determined for temkin isotherm was higher than that obtained for dkr and the heat of sorption was calculated as 0 91and 0 88 kj mol 1 for p mps and r mps respectively 3 3 effect of various environmental parameters this part of the study was performed to delineate the influence of environmental conditions such as varying salinity ph and ha to represent dom on the interaction of cenps with mps the effect of mixing i e selected samples was not agitated during the experiment representing calm and stagnant conditions in the environment was also explored 3 3 1 effect of salinity ph and dom the influence of salinity ph and dom on cenp sorption to mps is presented in fig 5 albeit the affinity of cenps was low at less concentration of salinity higher binding with mps was discovered at higher salinity in the system fig 5a this can be attributed to the competitive ions present at the binding site at the low salt concentration where aggregation of cenps occurs slowly at higher ionic strength the significant amount of sorption was assigned to the dominant self aggregation phenomenon due to charge screening of cenps followed by attachment of aggregated particles on mp surfaces fig 5d as the competitive ions present in the saline system will cover the binding sites faster in case of exposed surfaces of r mps that are easily visible comparatively less amount of sorption was identified for p mps the ph of a system plays a significant role in the aggregation of nps particle adhesion as well as in sorption process fig 5b e the amount of sorption was strongly influenced by ph a decrease in sorption was observed with increasing ph fig 5b higher sorption was detected at ph 4 5 close to the phpzc for mps while at ph 6 5 cenps were positively charged and mps had negative surfaces fig 1b e resulting in electrostatic attraction besides aggregation of ceo2 was greater at higher ph 10 5 the decline in the sorption capacity can be explained by deprotonation of both cenps and mps resulting in repulsion between the surface of negatively charged mps and nps although a fall in sorption at high ph was observed a fraction of cenps showed a strong affinity for mps relatively r mps showed higher sorption capacity than p mps which can be ascribed to the retention of cenps as a factor of roughness dom had an inverse relation with the sorption of cenps i e decrease in sorption was recorded at a higher concentration of ha fig 5c cenps become stable in the suspension with an increasing quantity of dom as a result of more negative charge and steric repulsion by ha bulky groups resulting in less sorption fig 5f lv et al 2014 besides ha may form complexes at the binding sites of mps further reducing the sorption this result highlights the severity of widespread mps along with co present metal nanoparticles in a complex environmental matrix 3 3 2 effect of stirring in general mps are also found in lakes with little water mixing which may influence the process of sorption therefore the effect of the non agitated condition on sorption of cenps with mps was studied it was found that a fraction of ceo2 is permanently sorbed irrespective of shaking i e even without any perturbance fig 6 although only one side of mps was exposed in the absence of effective mixing a considerable amount of retention was recorded this was related to the brownian motion of cenps that allows the interaction between the colloids and the surfaces of mp although in non agitated conditions sorption and desorption were observed they followed different trends in comparison to agitated condition thus mixing plays a crucial role in the friction adhesion retention and transport of contaminants and colloids in the environment 3 4 sorption in complex aqueous matrices the process of cenps sorption by mps in the environment is controlled by several parameters we investigated the sorption phenomenon in the complex matrix i e in presence of sfw and rw cenps sorption was evident in all the cases including sfw and rw however it varied with the type of the aqueous matrix fig 7 minimum interaction was found in rw followed by sfw the ionic strength was calculated to be higher for rw 3 08 10 3 m as compared to sfw yet a severely decreased sorption was noted table s3 previous studies have demonstrated the significant role of individual ions such as carbonates tiwari et al 2020 and sulfates ferrizz et al 2002 in the stabilization of cenps this was also associated with a higher content of both dom and ph in rw dom 1 9 mg l 1 and ph 8 4 as compared to sfw dom 1 mg l 1 and ph 7 4 and deionized water di overall the trend for sorption was di r mps sfw r mps di p mps sfw p mps rw r mps rw p mps which is well explanatory based on the results from the previous section of the present study 3 5 mechanisms of sorption to gain insight into the sorption mechanism characterization techniques such as ftir sem and eds were employed fig 8 the ftir spectra were obtained in transmission mode for mps before and after the exposure of cenps as represented in fig 8a the vibrational band at 450 cm 1 was assigned to ce o vibration while bands at 1630 cm 1 and 3450 cm 1 were due to the presence of moisture on mps after the exposure to nps a drop in the broad band of ce o vibration at approximately 580 cm 1 was observed which indicates the interaction of ceo2 with mp surfaces besides it is evident from sem images that cenps were present on mp surfaces fig 8b which is expected due to the electrostatic interaction between the surfaces of mps and cenps moreover fig 8c confirms that r mps allow local accumulation resulting in higher retention of cenps elemental mapping confirms the presence of ceo2 on mps and higher atomic percentage of cerium was detected on the surface of r mps as compared to p mps thus the earlier findings in the study are confirmed i e a clear interaction between mps and cenps occurs 4 conclusion several studies have highlighted the wide occurrence and distribution of mps that also serve as a scavenger of contaminants in the environment however there is a severe knowledge gap on the interaction between mps and nps to the best of our knowledge for the first time we reported that mps can facilitate the transport of metal oxide nps by adsorbing them on their surface even in non turbulent conditions and complex aqueous matrices our study highlights the critical role of mps in accumulating and co transporting nps the experimental information obtained in this study delineates the interaction between cenps and mps from the disposable plastic container with varying degrees of roughness introduced by sand grains through mechanical abrasion the batch experiments revealed that mps readily adsorbed cenps in its pristine and mechanically abraded rough form sorption kinetics followed pso and equilibrium was attained within 24 hr for p mps but it was faster for r mps 12 hr increasing the concentration of cenps sorption capacity improved however saturation was not identified because of opposite charge of cenps and mps that induced electrostatic interaction the maximum absorption capacity for cenps was established to 12 9 mg g 1 with p mps and a higher value for r mps 13 4 mg g was confirmed unlike for salinity sorption was inversely correlated with ph and dom concentration substantial sorption was also observed in the absence of a turbulent environment in addition the type of water investigated to comprehend the sorption behavior in the real environment reveals less sorption of cenps in rw followed by sfw owing to varying water parameters our study indicates that mps readily interact with cenps in abraded as well as the pristine forms the composition pollutant properties as well as surrounding matrix are governing parameters of the sorption process the present study suggests that with a change in the environmental conditions nps on the surface of mps may mobilize and become bioavailable also it yields insight into the impact of sorption of co existing contaminants with mps credit authorship contribution statement nisha singh writing original draft data curation investigation

17359,the ubiquitous distribution of microplastics mps leads to inevitable interactions with the toxic pollutants present in the environment including metal oxide nanoparticles this study investigates the interaction of ceo2 nanoparticles cenps with mps generated from a disposable plastic container further rough mps r mps generated through mechanical abrasion of mps with sand were used to probe the impact of roughness to understand the sorption kinetics and underlying interaction processes batch experiments were carried out the results distinctly indicate that cenps sorption occurred on mps surfaces and was consistent with the pseudo second order kinetics model for pristine mps the sorption capacity was as high as 12 9 mg g while for r mps kinetic equilibrium was achieved faster and an enhanced sorption capacity 13 4 mg g was identified a rise in sorption with an increase in salinity was noted while ph and humic acid exhibited a negative correlation the observed interactions were attributed to the aggregation profile and surface charge of cenps and mps surprisingly cenps also got loaded onto mps in non agitated and undisturbed conditions the sorption process was influenced by the type of aqueous matrix and the sorption capacity at equilibrium followed the trend distilled water synthetic freshwater river water ftir spectra zeta potential sem imaging and elemental mapping revealed electrostatic interaction as the dominant mechanism this work contributes towards the knowledge gap on the environmental risk of mps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cerium oxide polypropylene sorption batch experiments roughness 1 introduction the increased production and consumption of plastics with high durability versatility structural strength resistance and proficiency in manufacturing will soon leave the earth engulfed by plastic waste the exponential rise in demand for plastics in 2015 has led to an approximately 620 increase in plastic pellet resin production as compared to 1975 jambeck et al 2015 very recently tiny plastic particles have attracted a lot of attention in the scientific community this includes microplastics mps i e plastic particles of size smaller than 5 mm barnes et al 2009 thompson et al 2004 mps are categorized as primary and secondary based on their origin primary mps are intentionally produced for end user consumption derraik 2002 fendall and sewell 2009 whereas secondary mps are generated by the exertion of various environmental forces such as physical chemical and biological andrady 2011 the small plastic fragments are found to be omnipresent in all components of the earth i e air water glaciers soil and aquatic lifeforms karbalaei et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 luoto et al 2019 tiwari et al 2019 on account of reduced size and colorful appearance plastic particles are mistakenly ingested and then reside within the guts of aquatic organisms cole et al 2013 redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 rillig and bonkowski 2018 furthermore mps are known to interfere with reproduction gene expression and cause mortality alimba and faggio 2019 bhagat et al 2020 mps are of great concern as they have the propensity to bind contaminants from its surrounding based on contaminant properties partition coefficients and they are well known to co transport pollutants including pathogens browne et al 2007 hüffer et al 2018 koelmans et al 2016 l teuten et al 2007 wang et al 2018 phenanthrene a hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah was reported to accumulate on plastics in a greater amount than in sediments teuten et al 2007 wang et al reported partitioning as the major interaction for contaminants such as perfluorooctanesulfonamide and perfluorooctanesulfonate with mps not hydrophobicity wang et al 2015 unlike glassy polymers rubbery polymers such as polyethylene can accommodate a higher concentration of pollutants rodrigues et al 2019 studies have reported significantly higher adsorption of pollutants on mp than in the environmental matrix including heavy metals brennecke et al 2016 hüffer et al 2018 munier and bendell 2018 few metals were found to be concentrated on mps owing to their proximity to the contaminated site carbery et al 2020 while another study has highlighted the local accumulation of heavy metals on mps to be higher than its ambient environment ashton et al 2010 another report has emphasized a higher adsorption affinity of weathered mps for metals due to the development of anionic sites on the surface holmes et al 2014 though there are studies on mps aided metal ion sorption and transport not much attention has been given to the interaction between mps and novel emerging nanoparticles nps in the environment unlike other pollutants nanoparticles such as nanometal oxides have unique physicochemical properties different from their bulk counterparts having a similar chemical composition which has promoted their widespread applications and commercialization to a great extent metal oxide nps are well known to occur in the environment and can generate reactive oxygen species which are a serious threat to microbiota plants as well as humans garner and keller 2014 yang et al 2013 nanoceria or cerium oxide nps cenps have extensive industrial applications as catalysts glass polishing agents solar cells as well as in bio medicals as antioxidants bhagat et al 2019 hu et al 2018 estimations suggest an increased utilization of cenps that has led to a higher production amounting to approximately 10 000 t year in 2010 of which 1800 t were ultimately deposited into air water and soil whereas the rest was dumped into landfills keller et al 2013 once these nps are in the environment they tend to interact with the pre existing mps several parameters control the partitioning between solid and aqueous phases of contaminants in an aquatic environment however no reports have so far addressed the sorption of cenps onto mps which may affect its potential impact on the ecosystem bhagat et al 2019 deng et al 2017 mps in the environment are exposed to physical weathering due to mechanical abrasion by sand wind or water along with uv light that causes photo oxidation and leads to chain scission or crosslinking of the polymer bonds song et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the decrease in mechanical strength also results in the development of surface features to produce brittle and rough plastics with cracks including alteration in roughness polarity surface charge and porosity torkzaban and bradford 2016 the nanoscale roughness of a surface governs physicochemical and mechanical properties and is known to alter bio attachment processes microbial colonization and surface area pan et al 2019 verran and boyd 2001 recent studies demonstrate that collector surface roughness and topography affect colloid retention and consequently its adhesion on the collector surfaces such as rock darbha et al 2012 krishna darbha et al 2012 although dramatic changes in the roughness of mps with varying degrees of micro cracks have been observed during weathering pan et al 2019 there is still a lack of information about how weathering leads to nanoscale roughness and subsequently affects the sorption of cenps on mps in addition to surface roughness other factors that influence sorption include ph temperature dissolved organic matter dom and ionic strength in an aqueous environment khandelwal et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to comprehend the interaction between nps and mps surface in its surrounding environment single use plastic containers often used to serve beverages can be a significant source of microplastics for the environment polyethylene polypropylene and expanded polystyrene along with several additives are being used to produce such disposable plastic containers the huge amount of these adds to the nuisance of plastic waste that is susceptible to form complexes with other pollutants in the environment this has promoted us to use mps from single use plastic containers in this work to uncover its interaction probability with cenps to the best knowledge of the authors to address the interaction and sorption of metal oxide nanoparticle and mps for the first time this study was conducted with the primary objectives i to assess the potential of cenps sorption to mps by interpreting sorption kinetic and isotherm studies and ii to understand the effect of surface roughness of mps on the sorption process besides we also investigated the sorption process in complex conditions and relevant aqueous matrices such as in presence of varying degrees of dom ph salinity absence of agitation and finally in synthetic freshwater sfw and ambient river water rw 2 materials

stereomicroscope equipped with a leica ec3 digital camera the nanoscale roughness of p mps and sand treated mps was analyzed using a ntegra atomic force microscope afm nt mdt santa clara ca at ambient condition first the scan range was evaluated for both types of mps to define the representative area si fig s2 to get reliable results using semi contact mode darbha et al 2012 roughness parameters were calculated by scanning the estimated scan area for mps subsequently the data obtained were processed using image metrology scanning probe image processing spip software sand samples were characterized for mineralogical phases si fig s3 and composition si table s1 river water ph dom and major ions content were determined si table s2 using a multi water parameter probe toc analyzer and titration method 2 4 batch sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed to elucidate the interaction between cenps and mps as evident from earlier studies a huge range of mps concentration from 0 5 g l 1 to 50 g l 1 was observed to be used in the batch experiments hüffer et al 2020 kasmuri and tarmizi 2019 yu et al 2020 therefore the target concentration of mps used in the present study was derived to be in between the ratio from earlier available studies while the concentration of cenps was selected based on the previous studies gupta et al 2020 tolaymat et al 2017 and preliminary examination to carry out sorption experiments 50 mg mps were added to 50 ml glass flasks containing 10 ml of 50 mg l 1 cenps suspension equivalent to 4 5 10 17 ml 1 particle number as calculated from eq 1 in si in milli q water samples were placed in an orbital incubator shaker at 250 rpm and 25 c in dark kinetic analysis of sorption at regular intervals for 48 hr suggested that an equilibration condition was achieved in 24 hr for mps therefore further sorption experiments were carried out for 24 hr the effect of cenp concentration on sorption on mps was evaluated in the sorption realm by varying concentrations in the range of 20 125 mg l 1 to study the effect of salinity artificial seawater was prepared 0 05 3 as reported rihan et al 2014 the effect of ph dom and a stagnant i e unstirred condition on the sorption capacity was also evaluated the complex environment was mimicked with prepared sfw and further in river water si table s2 all the experiments were also performed with r mps to understand the impact of roughness on sorption phenomenon all the sorption kinetics and isotherm experiments were performed in triplicate at ph 6 5 and 25 c unless otherwise specified sample elutes were recovered by filtering through a stainless steel mesh of 800 µm or mps were carefully pick using a tweezer whenever required for analysis 2 5 microwave digestion and icp oes analysis mps and reaction elutes were acid digested in a multiwave go microwave digestion system anton paar as specified in table 1 the digestion protocol was operated to achieve complete digestion in either case i e when using mps or elute of the reaction mixture after acid digestion the samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes thermo scientific thermo icap 7400 including qtegra software appropriate experimental and instrumental blanks were used during the investigation to confirm sorption on mps as given in si mass balance was used to calculate the amount of cenps sorbed from volume v of suspension onto mps of mass m as given below 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 and ce are concentrations of cenp estimated from icp oes as ce in aqueous condition at initial and equilibrium stage respectively 2 6 aggregation of ceo2 nanoparticles the behavior of cenps varies in different water chemistry tiwari et al 2020 that may direct their further interaction with mps therefore the hydrodynamic size of cenps was monitored using dynamic light scattering dls at an angle of 90 at different concentrations salinity ph and ha corresponding to that in batch experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ceo2 nanoparticles the estimated hydrodynamic diameter of cenps was found to be 100 0 6 nm fig 1 a the zeta potential varied from 38 2 0 4 to 6 5 1 7 in ph range 3 to 9 and phpzc was obtained at ph 8 4 fig 1b tiwari et al 2020 the size and morphology obtained from sem imaging represent cenps of 50 nm to be cubical fig 1c the size observed by dls was larger than that by sem because of the solvation effect 3 1 2 microplastics from disposable plastic glass the mp polymer type was identified to be polypropylene by comparing obtained ftir spectra with a pre existing library in omnic software the peaks at 2917 1437 and 1354 cm 1 reflect ch stretching ch2 deformation and ch3 deformation respectively and 1156 970 and 844 cm 1 represent bands for isotactic polypropylene fig 1d urbaniak domagala 2012 streaming potential performed as a function of ph yield zeta potentials for the mps produced from disposable containers that varied from 19 2 0 2 mv to 41 2 0 7 mv in the ph range 2 5 to 9 5 while phpzc was detected at ph 4 9 fig 1e kosmulski 2009 the size of mp particles was observed to be 5 mm under the stereomicroscope with uneven r mps surface as represented in fig 2 a b inset the morphology of p mps as depicted by the sem monographs was smooth and uniform without any cracks while the surface of r mps was irregular and coarse with lesions fig 2a b the afm roughness profile processed through spip software was used to estimate the roughness parameters and analyze the topography of mp surfaces the scan size of mp images was established to be 100 100 µm2 fig s2 the nanoscale roughness was estimated via various roughness parameters sa sq sz sv and sp value as represented in si table s3 after the physical weathering of mps with sand a remarkable increase in the root mean square sq in sand treated r mps 42 7 nm was calculated as compared to p mps 19 4 nm the r mps exposed to mechanical abrasion by sand were more than twice as rough as the unexposed p mps with irregular protrusions and asperities evident as positive peaks and negative valleys fig 2c d 3 2 sorption of ceo2 on mps 3 2 1 effect of contact time kinetic modeling the effect of contact time on sorption of cenps to mps surface was studied showing that cenps adhered to both p mps and r mps which were highly stable in suspension throughout 24 hr fig 3 a b experimental data represents an initial rapid increase in the sorption capacity of mps with time fig 3a however at optimum time a plateau was achieved at 24 hr and 12 hr for p mps and r mps respectively this reflects that the surface was not saturated until the equilibration was reached r mps sorption rate was higher and equilibration was attained faster as compared to p mps which was attributed to the easy exposure of active sites involved in sorption process in r mps this certainly indicates that mp surfaces are capable of transporting metal oxide nps the opposite surface charge at circumneutral ph may result in electrostatic interactions between mps and cenps fig 1b e although the roughness produced through mechanical abrasion by sand during very small period 5 days the experimental results demonstrated that surface features play a key role in sorption process of mps torkzaban and bradford found that nanoscale roughness influences carboxylate modified latex kinetics as the energy barrier to attachment decreases drastically torkzaban and bradford 2016 liang et al demonstrated that retention of ag np on rough and smooth sand was related to changes in the interaction energy profile liang et al 2019 to understand the sorption mechanism and rate limiting steps the kinetic results were modelled by widely used kinetics models i e pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso elovich and intra particle diffusion ipd models using linearized equations fig 3c f and table 2 the summary of the obtained model parameters for ceo2 sorption on mps is provided in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 was found to be highest in pso model for both mps 0 99 as compared to that for p mps and r mps in pfo 0 98 0 84 and elovich models 0 97 0 90 respectively furthermore the calculated sorption capacity of cenps by the pso equation i e 6 95 mg g 1 and 7 38 mg g 1 for p mps and r mps respectively agreed with the experimentally ascertained value therefore the goodness of fit suggests that sorption of cenps followed pso model the elovich model was applied to decipher the chemisorption nature of heterogeneous mp surfaces aydin et al 2018 as estimated through the elovich equation the rate constant was higher in r mps 94 28 mg g 1 hr 1 while desorption constant 1 10 mg g 1 was lower as compared to in p mps supporting less detachment of cenps from r mp surfaces the good fit may indeed indicate sorption mechanism involving chemisorption which can be an artifact of electrostatic attraction of cenps followed by their aggregation on the negatively charged mps surface the overall sorption process involves four mechanisms of transfer including the rapid mass transfer of cenps to mp surfaces film diffusion surface and pore diffusion and rapid attachment of cenps at active sites on mps aydin et al 2018 for any sorption process the ipd model predicts the rate limiting step the current data show three linear sections through ipd modeling fig 3f corresponding to film diffusion ipd and equilibration although there was a good correlation between data the ipd line does not pass through the origin indicating it is not the only rate limiting step the fact that ipd was faster in r mps may be attributed to the ease of interaction on the new sites generated 3 2 2 effect of concentration sorption isotherm modeling to comprehend the effect of concentration of cenps on sorption capacity of mps experiments were carried out at varying concentrations 25 mg l 1 to 125 mg l 1 as evident from fig 4 a both mps showed an increase in sorption capacity with increasing nps concentration though the cenps were stable exhibiting no self aggregation in the range of concentrations studied fig 4b a continuous increase in the sorption was confirmed due to the oppositely charged mps at ph 6 5 that served as sites to form cenps heteroaggregates overall an increase in sorption capacity was noticed for r mps because of the presence of nanoscale roughness which is known to reduce the energy barrier of the interaction bradford et al 2017 the study performed with varying initial concentrations of cenps was used to describe the equilibration sorption isotherm adsorption of cenps on mps at 25 c was evaluated by estimating langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich dkr and temkin isotherms parameters table 3 the langmuir isotherm was more obviously followed by p mps with higher r2 0 84 as compared to r mps r2 0 76 supporting monolayer sorption having active surface site on p nps with equal affinity for all the cenps instead r mps rather showed agreement with the freundlich isotherm r2 0 86 suggesting heterogeneous nature of the surface indicating that the roughness changed the surface to non ideal nature potentially including multilayer stacking of nps the freundlich adsorption intensity n value 0 n 1 1 n and n 1 indicate favorable unfavorable and irreversible sorption al ghouti and da ana 2020 the estimated n was 0 42 and 0 41 for p mps and r mps respectively which also indicates surface heterogeneity and favorable sorption the maximum monolayer sorption capacity from the langmuir model was identified to be 12 93 mg g 1 and 13 43 mg g 1 for p mps and r mps respectively the estimated excess cenps particle number concentration retained on r mps is equivalent to 0 01 1019 ml 1 m 2 than p mps calculation shown in si this can be explained based on roughness developed on mps surface with the more exposed active surface area for interaction mp surfaces can be chemically heterogeneous depending on crystallinity and amorphous domains mei et al 2020 roughness due to aging can produce a significant change in the alignment of functional groups contributing to a higher sorption capacity kasálková et al 2015 although the dkr isotherm supports physical sorption the poor fit suggests that the sorption may not be due to physical processes in contrast independent experimental data suggest electrostatic attraction as a dominant interaction mechanism al ghouti and da ana 2020 however a poor dkr fit can be an artifact of multi layer ceo2 stacking on mps surface resulting in apparent heterogeneity the temkin isotherm supports chemical sorption where the rise in sorption increases the site coverage which in turn decreases the heat of sorption al ghouti and da ana 2020 the r2 determined for temkin isotherm was higher than that obtained for dkr and the heat of sorption was calculated as 0 91and 0 88 kj mol 1 for p mps and r mps respectively 3 3 effect of various environmental parameters this part of the study was performed to delineate the influence of environmental conditions such as varying salinity ph and ha to represent dom on the interaction of cenps with mps the effect of mixing i e selected samples was not agitated during the experiment representing calm and stagnant conditions in the environment was also explored 3 3 1 effect of salinity ph and dom the influence of salinity ph and dom on cenp sorption to mps is presented in fig 5 albeit the affinity of cenps was low at less concentration of salinity higher binding with mps was discovered at higher salinity in the system fig 5a this can be attributed to the competitive ions present at the binding site at the low salt concentration where aggregation of cenps occurs slowly at higher ionic strength the significant amount of sorption was assigned to the dominant self aggregation phenomenon due to charge screening of cenps followed by attachment of aggregated particles on mp surfaces fig 5d as the competitive ions present in the saline system will cover the binding sites faster in case of exposed surfaces of r mps that are easily visible comparatively less amount of sorption was identified for p mps the ph of a system plays a significant role in the aggregation of nps particle adhesion as well as in sorption process fig 5b e the amount of sorption was strongly influenced by ph a decrease in sorption was observed with increasing ph fig 5b higher sorption was detected at ph 4 5 close to the phpzc for mps while at ph 6 5 cenps were positively charged and mps had negative surfaces fig 1b e resulting in electrostatic attraction besides aggregation of ceo2 was greater at higher ph 10 5 the decline in the sorption capacity can be explained by deprotonation of both cenps and mps resulting in repulsion between the surface of negatively charged mps and nps although a fall in sorption at high ph was observed a fraction of cenps showed a strong affinity for mps relatively r mps showed higher sorption capacity than p mps which can be ascribed to the retention of cenps as a factor of roughness dom had an inverse relation with the sorption of cenps i e decrease in sorption was recorded at a higher concentration of ha fig 5c cenps become stable in the suspension with an increasing quantity of dom as a result of more negative charge and steric repulsion by ha bulky groups resulting in less sorption fig 5f lv et al 2014 besides ha may form complexes at the binding sites of mps further reducing the sorption this result highlights the severity of widespread mps along with co present metal nanoparticles in a complex environmental matrix 3 3 2 effect of stirring in general mps are also found in lakes with little water mixing which may influence the process of sorption therefore the effect of the non agitated condition on sorption of cenps with mps was studied it was found that a fraction of ceo2 is permanently sorbed irrespective of shaking i e even without any perturbance fig 6 although only one side of mps was exposed in the absence of effective mixing a considerable amount of retention was recorded this was related to the brownian motion of cenps that allows the interaction between the colloids and the surfaces of mp although in non agitated conditions sorption and desorption were observed they followed different trends in comparison to agitated condition thus mixing plays a crucial role in the friction adhesion retention and transport of contaminants and colloids in the environment 3 4 sorption in complex aqueous matrices the process of cenps sorption by mps in the environment is controlled by several parameters we investigated the sorption phenomenon in the complex matrix i e in presence of sfw and rw cenps sorption was evident in all the cases including sfw and rw however it varied with the type of the aqueous matrix fig 7 minimum interaction was found in rw followed by sfw the ionic strength was calculated to be higher for rw 3 08 10 3 m as compared to sfw yet a severely decreased sorption was noted table s3 previous studies have demonstrated the significant role of individual ions such as carbonates tiwari et al 2020 and sulfates ferrizz et al 2002 in the stabilization of cenps this was also associated with a higher content of both dom and ph in rw dom 1 9 mg l 1 and ph 8 4 as compared to sfw dom 1 mg l 1 and ph 7 4 and deionized water di overall the trend for sorption was di r mps sfw r mps di p mps sfw p mps rw r mps rw p mps which is well explanatory based on the results from the previous section of the present study 3 5 mechanisms of sorption to gain insight into the sorption mechanism characterization techniques such as ftir sem and eds were employed fig 8 the ftir spectra were obtained in transmission mode for mps before and after the exposure of cenps as represented in fig 8a the vibrational band at 450 cm 1 was assigned to ce o vibration while bands at 1630 cm 1 and 3450 cm 1 were due to the presence of moisture on mps after the exposure to nps a drop in the broad band of ce o vibration at approximately 580 cm 1 was observed which indicates the interaction of ceo2 with mp surfaces besides it is evident from sem images that cenps were present on mp surfaces fig 8b which is expected due to the electrostatic interaction between the surfaces of mps and cenps moreover fig 8c confirms that r mps allow local accumulation resulting in higher retention of cenps elemental mapping confirms the presence of ceo2 on mps and higher atomic percentage of cerium was detected on the surface of r mps as compared to p mps thus the earlier findings in the study are confirmed i e a clear interaction between mps and cenps occurs 4 conclusion several studies have highlighted the wide occurrence and distribution of mps that also serve as a scavenger of contaminants in the environment however there is a severe knowledge gap on the interaction between mps and nps to the best of our knowledge for the first time we reported that mps can facilitate the transport of metal oxide nps by adsorbing them on their surface even in non turbulent conditions and complex aqueous matrices our study highlights the critical role of mps in accumulating and co transporting nps the experimental information obtained in this study delineates the interaction between cenps and mps from the disposable plastic container with varying degrees of roughness introduced by sand grains through mechanical abrasion the batch experiments revealed that mps readily adsorbed cenps in its pristine and mechanically abraded rough form sorption kinetics followed pso and equilibrium was attained within 24 hr for p mps but it was faster for r mps 12 hr increasing the concentration of cenps sorption capacity improved however saturation was not identified because of opposite charge of cenps and mps that induced electrostatic interaction the maximum absorption capacity for cenps was established to 12 9 mg g 1 with p mps and a higher value for r mps 13 4 mg g was confirmed unlike for salinity sorption was inversely correlated with ph and dom concentration substantial sorption was also observed in the absence of a turbulent environment in addition the type of water investigated to comprehend the sorption behavior in the real environment reveals less sorption of cenps in rw followed by sfw owing to varying water parameters our study indicates that mps readily interact with cenps in abraded as well as the pristine forms the composition pollutant properties as well as surrounding matrix are governing parameters of the sorption process the present study suggests that with a change in the environmental conditions nps on the surface of mps may mobilize and become bioavailable also it yields insight into the impact of sorption of co existing contaminants with mps credit authorship contribution statement nisha singh writing original draft data curation investigation
