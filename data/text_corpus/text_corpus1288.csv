6440,soil hydraulic properties play a primary role in water infiltration and movement and transport of nutrients and contaminants through the soil profile however the determination of soil hydraulic properties especially the hydraulic conductivity at lower depths within the soil profile is very challenging we investigated the use of inverse modelling based on apsim agricultural production simulation model to determine likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation ksat and field capacity kdul for a slowly permeable subsurface horizon simulations were run for the poorly drained otokia silt loam in the otago region of new zealand apsim simulations were set up either according to the site specific soil profile description or based on the national soils database s map pedotransfer functions simulated temporal soil moisture data were compared to measurements from a field experiment within a sensitivity analysis ksat values of the subsurface soil were varied from 2 4 to 192 mm d and values for kdul from 0 05 to 1 mm d finally simulations were run over 45 years using three climatic conditions with annual rainfall amounts of 582 628 and 730 mm the effect of varying the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface fragipan horizon cx on the wetness status of the overlying b2g horizon was determined by calculating the average annual duration of soil moisture above field capacity these were then used to estimate ranges of the hydraulic conductivity that contributes to a soil being imperfectly or poorly drained the results highlight the significant influence that kdul has on the reliability of modelling the hydraulic behaviour of soils with slowly permeable subsoils keywords saturated hydraulic conductivity soil wetness status inverse modelling apsim 1 introduction agricultural models are widely used to assess management practices that conform to farming within environmental limits while being economically viable beukes et al 2011 chapman et al 2012 however the accuracy of such models is highly dependent on the description of the model input parameters including the description of soil hydraulic properties namely soil water retention curve θ h and hydraulic conductivity curve k h dann et al 2006 londra and kargas 2018 hydraulic properties govern many different soil functions including the provision of water for plant uptake and water infiltration and redistribution the soil moisture status and the duration and frequency of water saturation also effect many microbial mediated processes including mineralisation nitrification and denitrification tete et al 2015 for example low soil water content and saturation restrict mineralisation and nitrification while anaerobic conditions promote denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions mosier et al 2002 saggar et al 2013 apart from climatic conditions rainfall and temperature the temporal soil water status is mainly driven by the soil s hydraulic properties 1 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat is often assumed to be one of the most important transport related properties søvik and aagaard 2003 but it is also one of the most variable soil properties kutilek and nielsen 1994 webb et al 2000 and consequently predictions have high uncertainty reflecting this uncertainty soil survey datasets have traditionally classified soils into permeability classes according to their saturated hydraulic conductivity typically based on limited measurements or more commonly inferred from soil morphology characteristics such as soil texture structure and reductimorphic mottles a summary of permeability classes used in different countries in presented in table 1 however kutilek and nielsen 1994 argue that due to the large variability of k sat it would be more appropriate to consider the frequency distribution of k sat and also that the position within the soil profile should be considered many experimental techniques have been proposed for measuring k sat in situ or by taking undisturbed soil columns into the laboratory pachepsky et al 2001 reynolds and elrick 1991 youngs 1987 apart from being very time consuming concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of such measurements due to either measurement errors carrick et al 2010 pollacco et al 2017 the method used to derive k sat from infiltration measurements morbidelli et al 2017 pollacco et al 2017 reynolds et al 2000 or the high spatial variability which requires a large number of samples to properly characterise a site timlin et al 2004 pedotransfer functions ptfs e g cichota et al 2013 rawls and brakensiek 1989 saxton et al 1986 vereecken et al 1990 estimating k sat from easily measurable soil physical properties are also extensively used but are generally only applicable for the conditions under which they were developed mcbratney et al 2002 while the textural class of a soil has a large influence on k sat the genetic development of the soil the climate and the management also play an important role an alternative is the use of inverse modelling methods whereby modelling results are compared with measured data e g a time series of soil water or water infiltration gribb et al 1999 kool and parker 1988 nakhaei and šimůnek 2014 graham et al 2018 compared four different methods of soil hydraulic parameterisation and found that inverse parameter estimation based on field soil moisture data yielded the best prediction of drainage by the hydrus 1d model apart from ksat the shape of the k θ relationship especially near saturation is also important when simulating water movement and nutrient contaminant transport in the unsaturated zone børgesen et al 2006 generally k θ is obtained by extrapolating measured k sat using a hydraulic conductivity function linked to the soil water retention curve mualem 1976 many undisturbed soils however do not have a unimodal pore distribution but exhibit different pore domains with research indicating that this is the norm rather than the exception for new zealand soils pollacco et al 2017 this can be due to either the specific particle size distributions or to the formation of secondary pore systems macropores by various soil genetic processes such as soil aggregation or biological soil forming durner 1994 while the importance of such multi or bimodal soil hydraulic characterization for predicting the soil water balance has been demonstrated mohanty et al 1997 romano and nasta 2016 this requires estimation of the soil hydraulic conductivity at various tensions many hydraulic databases have been compiled to enable parameterisation of agricultural models among others the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi weynants et al 2013 the soil water infiltration global database rahmati et al 2018 hypres wösten et al 1999 the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda leij et al 1996 and rosetta schaap et al 2001 in new zealand s map a digital spatial soil information system manaaki whenua 2015 lilburne et al 2012 has been developed to integrate data available in various forms maps survey measurements etc and also to provide inputs required by simulation models carrick et al 2014 lilburne et al 2014 in s map soils are grouped into soil families based on the parent rock type soil profile material and texture in the top 600 mm as well as the permeability of the slowest horizon these soil families are further refined into soil siblings with respect to physical properties including the depth to rock stoniness drainage class and texture a current constraint within the s map is the lack of information on the permeability of slow draining horizons which was identified as a significant limitation to modelling saturated hydraulic conductivity for a range of new zealand soils pollacco et al 2017 thus the k sat of slow draining horizons is by default assumed to be 4 mm d based on traditional soil permeability class ratings table 1 for dense subsoil fragipans a drainage capacity of 96 mm day would under most climatic conditions be too high to result in substantial periodic saturation to cause the observed impeded drainage and sustained subsoil wetness that is observed in large areas of new zealand soils with fragipans kutilek and nielsen 1994 suggest a minimum k sat of 100 mm day for silty loam and 1 mm day for clay while k sat values for compacted clays range between 0 001 and 0 1 mm day 1 2 profile soil drainage the soils profile drainage characteristic of is one of the key properties affecting plant growth and thus the land suitability for agricultural production water infiltration and movement and transport of nutrients and contaminants through the soil profile it also affects the transformation of nutrients such as nitrate nitrogen no3 which is a major contaminant of water worldwide under reducing conditions no3 can be denitrified thereby acting as a natural attenuation process prediction of the soil drainage conditions defined as the degree and frequency of wet periods is therefore critical for estimating the fate of nitrogen in agricultural systems wilson et al 2018 drainage conditions are generally determined by observations of water tables soil wetness landscape position and soil morphology soil colours are expressed in terms of hue value and chroma in accordance with the standardized munsell color system munsell colour company 1975 soil survey staff 1951 a grey soil colour low chroma or occurrence of soil mottling indicate a significant period of saturation over the year either due to a seasonal high groundwater level or due to a slow permeable layer in the subsoil which causes drainage water to perch and subject the horizons above to periods of saturation anaerobic conditions result in the reduction of the oxidized iron fe3 to the mobile fe2 which results in the redistribution of iron throughout the soil profile the longer the saturation period the more pronounced the reduction process and the grayer the soil becomes subsequent drainage restores aerobic conditions especially in larger pores where fe3 precipitates and forms reddish brown spots also called mottles or redox segregations several studies have been conducted to correlate duration of water saturation with morphological properties such as the percentage of the surface area with low chroma colours or mottling evans and franzmeier 1988 jien et al 2004 van huyssteen et al 1997 correlated soil colour indices with duration of water saturation in soils from south africa and found good correlation between the dry colour chroma and dry colour chroma plus hue in new zealand soil drainage class is a key attribute that is defined for all soil types in s map based on the abundance of grey colours and redox mottles and the depth at which these occur within the soil profile poorly drained soils are identified by dominance of grey colours within 15 cm of the base of the topsoil or between 30 and 60 cm depth for imperfectly drained soils whereas well drained soils have less than 2 mottling within 90 cm of the soil surface these drainage classes were based on the correlation of field observed soil wetness duration with climate based modelling of soil moisture regimes used in united states soil taxonomy jackson and watt 1977 watt 1979 in new zealand poorly drained soils are estimated to have annual periods of three to six months wetter than field capacity compared to one to two months for imperfectly drained soils bruce 1972 taylor and pohlen 1979 although soil drainage class is one of the most extensively used soil attributes from s map it is important to note that the class definitions were largely qualitative and concerns have been raised about the absence of quantitative wetness information for new zealand soils increasingly this is becoming a limitation for environmental modelling with computations of both soil greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen leaching highly sensitive to the soil internal wetness state vogeler et al 2017 in new zealand this is particularly important as soils with imperfect or poor drainage are widely mapped with a significant proportion attributed to perching of water within the soil profile due to a slowly permeable lower horizon such as the dense fragipans of soils formed in silty loess deposits loess is widespread across new zealand and their drainage class varies with rainfall although the soil structure texture and horizon layering are similar bruce 1972 schmidt et al 2005 these fragipan loess soils provide a useful test bed to determine likely quantitative values of subsoil hydraulic conductivity that correlate with differences in field observed soil drainage class watt 1976 watt 1977 the objective of this study was to define limits for hydraulic conductivities for low permeability soil layers using an inverse modelling approach the approach was firstly tested against results from a field experiment in which temporal measurements of soil moisture throughout a poorly drained soil were made over a period of two years the measurements were compared to simulations using the apsim model with the soil properties either based on site specific measurements or those estimated by the s map pedotransfer function within a sensitivity analysis the values of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation and field capacity were changed simulations were then done for a period of 45 years and also for three different climatic conditions the duration of the soil wetness status days at 90 of saturation and above field capacity were used to define limits for hydraulic conductivity values that contribute to a soil being imperfectly or poorly drained 2 methods and materials 2 1 apsim model description apsim agricultural production systems simulator www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 is a modular process oriented simulation framework which has initially focused on the prediction of crop yield as influenced by the availability of water and nitrogen the model has also been extensively used to guide n fertilisation vogeler and cichota 2016 and investigate environmental impacts of farming systems such as nitrate leaching and n2o emissions hoffmann et al 2018 thorburn et al 2010 the primary modules used in the simulation for this study included swim3 huth et al 2012 based on richards equation for water movement and the convection dispersion equation for solute transport surfaceom and soiln probert et al 1998 modules for surface organic matter and soil c and n transformations agpasture li et al 2011 for simulating a pasture mix of ryegrass lolium perenne l and white clover trifolium repens l swim3 is based on a two domain model for hydraulic conductivity comprising a macropore and a soil matrix domain huth et al 2012 the value of k sat is a model input and the hydraulic conductivity at a potential of 100 cm k dul equivalent to the soil moisture at the drained upper limit dul or field capacity is by default set to 0 1 mm day the soil matrix s hydraulic conductivity below dul is related to the water retention curve and the soil macropore conductivity is described by a simple power function for details see huth et al 2012 2 2 apsim model setup all simulations were conducted using the apsim version 7 10 simulations were run for a pastoral system with grazing every three weeks 2 3 experimental study the effects of using soil hydraulic parameters derived using two different approaches on apsim were evaluated by comparing temporal soil moisture predictions with those measured during a two year experiment described in detail in watt 1977 in this experiment performed on a poorly drained otokia silt loam in the otago region of new zealand soil moisture was measured over 2 full years 1972 and 1973 via neutron probes in the various soil horizons to a depth of 2 m at the time of the experiment the site was under ryegrass white clover pasture for intensive fat lamb production the annual average rainfall in this site is 730 mm and the average temperature 10 6 c watt 1976 the otokia silt loam is a poorly drained soil formed into silty textured loess nz soil classification fragic perch gley pallic soil usda taxonomy fragiaquepts hewitt 2013 the topsoil horizons 0 300 mm have moderate to fine nut structure with a dark grey colour and iron manganese concretions indicative of seasonal water logging the upper subsoil of the b2g horizon at a depth from about 300 to 500 mm has strong gleying and mottling features and weak coarse blocky structure below 500 mm is the dense fragipan cx horizon with the massive structure and a more yellow brown colour indicating that drainage water perches on this slowly permeable horizon causing seasonal saturation and thus gley features in the horizons above data from the a horizon 0 150 mm the ab horizon 150 300 mm the gleyed b2g horizon depth from 300 to 500 mm and the underlying dense cx horizon 500 800 mm were used in this study as there were very little temporal changes in soil moisture below 800 mm 2 4 soil profile descriptions to assess the effect that the soil profile description especially the value of ksat of the low permeability cx horizon has on the temporal moisture regime within the overlying soil profile modelling scenarios were first set up with the site specific soil description of the field experiment described above as k sat measurements for the various horizons were lacking estimates from the national scale s map pedotransfer function for k sat were used in the second setup clar 59a sibling the same site specific and estimated data was used except for the soil water retention curve values which were based on the national s map pedotransfer function mcneill et al 2018 the soil profiles were set up to a depth of 1500 mm the key soil hydraulic properties for both setups are provided in table 2 next to determine bounds for k sat and k dul of the low permeability soil layer horizon cx the values of k were varied in a sensitivity analysis where k sat was set to either 2 4 6 12 24 48 96 or 192 mm d 1 and k dul to 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 or 1 mm d 1 2 5 effect of climate conditions on seasonal soil wetness to determine the effect of kdul of the cx horizon on the degree of wetness in the overlying b2g horizon long term simulations were run with both the otokia and the clar 59 soil profile descriptions for a period of 45 years as the simulations for the experimental study showed very little effect of ksat on the duration of the soil wetness status see results below simulations were only run with a ksat value of 24 mm d the simulations were run with daily weather data accessed from the niwa virtual climate station network vcsn tait et al 2006 three different climatic conditions the wet wingatui climate 45 875s 170 375e with an average annual rainfall rf of 730 mm the medium lincoln climate 43 625s 172 475e with an average rf of 628 mm and the dry timaru climate 44 375s 171 225e with an average rf of 582 mm the wingatui climate correlates with the poorly drained otokia soil in the experimental study and the timaru climate correlates with large areas of loess soils with the same horizons and attributes as the otokia but under the timaru climate the soil morphology is typically imperfectly drained implying less frequent saturation in the upper subsoil compared to the otokia soil 2 6 statistical analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the modelled soil water data when compared with the observed data common measures were used including the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse score franz and hogue 2011 the nse score compares the model mean square error with the variance of the observations and its value can vary from to 1 a positive nse value indicates that the model has more predictive power than simply applying the mean observed value while reported performance ratings for nse values are variable moriasi et al 2007 suggested for monthly time steps values of 0 75 nse 1 as very good 0 65 nse 0 75 as good 0 5 nse 65 as satisfactory and nse 0 5 as unsatisfactory 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal soil moisture content the temporal variation in soil water contents for the different horizons was generally well described by apsim when based on the site specific soil description this is shown in fig 1 for a ksat value of 24 mm d and a kdul of 0 25 mm d for the slowly permeable subsoil horizon cx when using the s map soil description for the otokia soil clar 59a the prediction of the temporal soil moisture in the a horizon nse of 0 68 and the ab horizon nse of 0 75 is good however the prediction in the b2g horizon is unsatisfactory nse of 0 49 and in the cx horizon the soil moisture is very poorly predicted negative nse this is due to the much higher value for the field capacity of these two layers in the clar 59a compared to the measured data table 2 the effect of this on the annual duration of the saturation is discussed further down depending on the combination of ksat kdul used for the cx horizon nse values for the site specific description otokia soil ranged from 0 52 to 0 64 in horizon a from 0 53 to 0 86 in horizon ab 0 76 to 0 85 in horizon b2g and 0 17 to 0 73 in horizon cx at a given kdul the value of ksat had very little effect on the prediction accuracy apart from in the ab horizon appendix table 5 changing the value of kdul in the cx has a more pronounced effect on the prediction accuracy the rmse at the kdul of 1 mm d is much higher 0 023 0 024 m3 m 3 compared to those with lower values of kdul rmse ranging from 0 019 to 0 021 m3 m 3 the lowest rmse 0 019 to 0 02 m3 m 3 for soil moisture in the b2g horizon across the range of ksat values investigated was found for a kdul of 0 25 mm d fig 2 and best prediction of soil moisture were found with kdul values 0 25 mm d and ksat values 12 mm d these are consistent with previous estimates for similar new zealand loess soils where the kdul of the cx was measured at 0 04 0 01 mm d gradwell 1979 in a different study joe and watt 1984 measured ksat values of 20 22 mm d which is much higher compared with the ksat of 0 1 mm d estimated by watt 1976 for the otokia soil both of these studies used small cores and as such the measurements encompass a high uncertainty this uncertainty was identified as a major impediment in the development of the national ksat pedotransfer function model for s map pollacco et al 2017 the inverse modelling approach shown here demonstrates the value of such an approach for refining this uncertainty and to identify the most likely range of soil hydraulic conductivity parameters by using a sensitivity analysis the bounds of acceptable uncertainty can be identified in terms of the relative impact on predicting measured soil moisture status response as well as on the correlation with regional differences in long term soil wetness status as discussed further down 3 2 saturation degree similar to the prediction of the temporal soil moisture content the value of ksat of the cx horizon had little effect on the annual days at which the b2g horizon was above field capacity fig 3 in 1972 a wet year with 861 mm rainfall high values of kdul of the cx horizon 0 5 and 1 mm d significantly reduced the annual days above field capacity fc whereas between 0 05 and 0 25 mm d there was little difference in contrast in 1973 a dry year with 581 mm rainfall the value of kdul had an effect on the days above fc throughout the range investigated this difference in the days above fc for the two different years is in line with results by watt 1977 who estimated that the soil moisture in the b2g horizon was at or above fc for 140 and 30 days in the moist season of 1972 and 1973 note that the days above field capacity here are for the entire year and thus higher compared to those reported in watt 1977 our long term simulations described further down indicate that annual days fc are likely to be 15 25 greater than those estimated in watt 1977 the values of ksat of the cx horizon had a larger effect on the annual days the b2g horizon was above 90 of the saturation fig 4 for example in 1972 with a kdul of 0 5 mm d the days above 90 of saturation were reduced by 20 as the saturation degree of a soil is important for the transition between nitrification and denitrification accurate prediction of the duration and fluctuation of soil saturation is important for example van der weerden et al 2014 found that n2o emissions increased exponentially with the degree of soil moisture saturation up to a water filled pore space of 89 however again the value of kdul had a larger effect on the days above 90 saturation than ksat using the s map soil description for the otokia soil clar 59a affected the annual wetness differently depending on the year and the value of kdul this is shown in fig 5 for a ksat value of 24 mm d in general the clar 59a results in slightly more days on which the soil is above fc but apart from the simulation in 1973 with a kdul of 0 25 mm d difference of 21 days the annual days above fc are within 12 days when compared to using the measured site specific soil hydraulic parameters 3 3 duration of seasonal soil wetness status long term simulations results from the long term simulation over 45 years also show that the value of kdul had a large effect on the annual days table 3 and the annual days in the wet season table 4 in which soil moisture was above fc with more days at lower kdul this reflects the sensitivity of predictions to kdul during dry years fig 6 where days above fc in the moist season varied much more higher coefficient of variation with lower rainfall due to changes in kdul this is also consistent with the experimental data where days above fc varied much more with kdul during the dry 1973 year compared to the wetter 1972 year fig 3 regional soil survey mapping shows that imperfectly drained soils occur predominantly in loess soils with fragipan in the timaru climate whereas under the wetter wingatui climate these soils are mostly classified as poorly drained field based observations suggest that poorly drained soils are above field capacity for three to six months this is compared to one to two months for imperfectly drained soils bruce 1972 taylor and pohlen 1979 these different annual wetness durations are consistent with the long term simulations of wetness durations during the wet season from june to september table 4 particularly for predictions when using kdul values 0 25 mm d however the simulation results also show that days above fc are highly variable fig 7 reflecting the year to year variation in rainfall see also fig 6 for the range of rf in the wet season this variability varies with climate as well as with the choice of the kdul value for example under the wingatui climate the variability is similar for all kdul values whereas under the timaru climate the variability decreases with increasing kdul comparisons between s map predictions and site specific measured data shows similar variability in the saturation degree between years the high variability highlights the risk of using a simple annual average when characterizing the duration of wetness for different soils although the class based approach of bruce 1972 and taylor and pohlen 1979 to describe the range of annual wetness duration does better encapsulate the year to year variation shown in our long term simulations the results do overlap between different climates indicating that the differences in wetness duration between poor and imperfectly drained soils maybe best compared as probability distribution functions this is consistent with the approach suggested by kutilek and nielsen 1994 who argue that due to the large variability of k sat soil surveys and hydraulic modelling characterization would be more appropriate to consider using the frequency distribution of k sat to represent and compare differences in hydraulic character of contrasting soils the description of the soil profile also affected the average amount of days over 45 years at which the soil moisture was above fc table 3 with more days for the clar 59a compared with the site specific otokia description however consistent with the findings using the experimental years in the previous section the overall differences are not large particularly during the moist season table 4 at between 0 and 9 days the predictions of inter year variability fig 7 are also very similar between the clar 59a and site specific description both soil descriptions give a consistent relative difference between the different climates and correlate with the field based estimates of regional wetness duration under these climates bruce 1972 taylor and pohlen 1979 overall the long term simulations indicate that the estimates of seasonal wetness are significantly more sensitive to the soil hydraulic conductivity values than the soil water storage parameters that s map currently predicts for these types of soils 4 conclusions and recommendations the results of this study highlight the significant value that inverse modelling can have for the determination of the soil hydraulic conductivity especially for slowly permeable subsoil horizons that are challenging to measure yet can exert a controlling influence over the hydraulic behaviour of the whole soil profile characterisation of these slowly permeable horizons is also particularly sensitive to uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity values as relatively small changes can lead to significant differences in modelling the resultant soil hydraulic behavior our inverse modelling approach has provided clarity around the likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation ksat and field capacity kdul for a slowly permeable subsurface fragipan horizon that is spatially extensive in the loess soils of new zealand it has also identified that these soils are less sensitive to the soil water storage parameters predicted by s map than to the conductivity attribute predictions leading to a recommendation that s map revises the conductivity predictions for slowly permeable horizons this use of small scale core measurements with inverse modelling for identifying likely ranges of hydraulic conductivity values is a valuable approach for upscaling hydraulic properties for larger areas and for characterizing the hydraulic behaviour of soils based on the drainage class morphology characteristic and wetness duration at the landscape scale under different climate zones the results also highlight that for slowly permeable horizons the unsaturated conductivity function is of critical importance for modelling soil hydraulic behavior and that ksat on its own is not sufficient as an input parameter for the apsim simulation model when representing a bimodal pore system we conclude that kdul has a significant influence on modelling of the hydraulic behavior and recommend that for slowly permeable horizons kdul should not be set to a constant value to support this we recommend that soil information systems such as s map provide beside ksat values also the values for kdul conflict of interest estimation of soil subsurface hydraulic

to 192 mm d and values for kdul from 0 05 to 1 mm d finally simulations were run over 45 years using three climatic conditions with annual rainfall amounts of 582 628 and 730 mm the effect of varying the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface fragipan horizon cx on the wetness status of the overlying b2g horizon was determined by calculating the average annual duration of soil moisture above

multi or bimodal soil hydraulic characterization for predicting the soil water balance has been demonstrated mohanty et al 1997 romano and nasta 2016 this requires estimation of the soil hydraulic conductivity at various tensions many hydraulic databases have been compiled to enable parameterisation of agricultural models among others the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi weynants et al 2013 the soil water infiltration global database rahmati et al 2018 hypres wösten et al 1999 the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda leij et al 1996 and rosetta schaap et al 2001 in new zealand s map a digital spatial soil information system manaaki whenua 2015 lilburne et al 2012 has been developed to integrate data available in various forms maps survey measurements etc and also to provide inputs required by simulation models carrick et al 2014 lilburne et al 2014 in s map soils are grouped into soil families based on the parent rock type soil profile material and texture in the top 600 mm as well as the permeability of the slowest horizon these soil families are further refined into soil siblings with respect to physical properties including the depth to rock stoniness drainage class and texture a current constraint within the s map is the lack of information on the permeability of slow draining horizons which was identified as a significant limitation to modelling saturated hydraulic conductivity for a range of new zealand soils pollacco et al 2017 thus the k sat of slow draining horizons is by default assumed to be 4 mm d based on traditional soil permeability class ratings table 1 for dense subsoil fragipans a drainage capacity of 96 mm day would under most climatic conditions be too high to result in substantial periodic saturation to cause the observed impeded drainage and sustained subsoil wetness that is observed in large areas of new zealand soils with fragipans kutilek and nielsen 1994 suggest a minimum k sat of 100 mm day for silty loam and 1 mm day for clay while k sat values for compacted clays range between 0 001 and 0 1 mm day 1 2 profile soil drainage the soils profile drainage characteristic of is one of the key properties affecting plant growth and thus the land suitability for agricultural production water infiltration and movement and transport of nutrients and contaminants through the soil profile it also affects the transformation of nutrients such as nitrate nitrogen no3 which is a major contaminant of water worldwide under reducing conditions no3 can be denitrified thereby acting as a natural attenuation process prediction of the soil drainage conditions defined as the degree and frequency of wet periods is therefore critical for estimating the fate of nitrogen in agricultural systems wilson et al 2018 drainage conditions are generally determined by observations of water tables soil wetness landscape position and soil morphology soil colours are expressed in terms of hue value and chroma in accordance with the standardized munsell color system munsell colour company 1975 soil survey staff 1951 a grey soil colour low chroma or occurrence of soil mottling indicate a significant period of saturation over the year either due to a seasonal high groundwater level or due to a slow permeable layer in the subsoil which causes drainage water to perch and subject the horizons above to periods of saturation anaerobic conditions result in the reduction of the oxidized iron fe3 to the mobile fe2 which results in the redistribution of iron throughout the soil profile the longer the saturation period the more pronounced the reduction process and the grayer the soil becomes subsequent drainage restores aerobic conditions especially in larger pores where fe3 precipitates and forms reddish brown spots also called mottles or redox segregations several studies have been conducted to correlate duration of water saturation with morphological properties such as the percentage of the surface area with low chroma colours or mottling evans and franzmeier 1988 jien et al 2004 van huyssteen et al 1997 correlated soil colour indices with duration of water saturation in soils from south africa and found good correlation between the dry colour chroma and dry colour chroma plus hue in new zealand soil drainage class is a key attribute that is defined for all soil types in s map based on the abundance of grey colours and redox mottles and the depth at which these occur within the soil profile poorly drained soils are identified by dominance of grey colours within 15 cm of the base of the topsoil or between 30 and 60 cm depth for imperfectly drained soils whereas well drained soils have less than 2 mottling within 90 cm of the soil surface these drainage classes were based on the correlation of field observed soil wetness duration with climate based modelling of soil moisture regimes used in united states soil taxonomy jackson and watt 1977 watt 1979 in new zealand poorly drained soils are estimated to have annual periods of three to six months wetter than field capacity compared to one to two months for imperfectly drained soils bruce 1972 taylor and pohlen 1979 although soil drainage class is one of the most extensively used soil attributes from s map it is important to note that the class definitions were largely qualitative and concerns have been raised about the absence of quantitative wetness information for new zealand soils increasingly this is becoming a limitation for environmental modelling with computations of both soil greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen leaching highly sensitive to the soil internal wetness state vogeler et al 2017 in new zealand this is particularly important as soils with imperfect or poor drainage are widely mapped with a significant proportion attributed to perching of water within the soil profile due to a slowly permeable lower horizon such as the dense fragipans of soils formed in silty loess deposits loess is widespread across new zealand and their drainage class varies with rainfall although the soil structure texture and horizon layering are similar bruce 1972 schmidt et al 2005 these fragipan loess soils provide a useful test bed to determine likely quantitative values of subsoil hydraulic conductivity that correlate with differences in field observed soil drainage class watt 1976 watt 1977 the objective of this study was to define limits for hydraulic conductivities for low permeability soil layers using an inverse modelling approach the approach was firstly tested against results from a field experiment in which temporal measurements of soil moisture throughout a poorly drained soil were made over a period of two years the measurements were compared to simulations using the apsim model with the soil properties either based on site specific measurements or those estimated by the s map pedotransfer function within a sensitivity analysis the values of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation and field capacity were changed simulations were then done for a period of 45 years and also for three different climatic conditions the duration of the soil wetness status days at 90 of saturation and above field capacity were used to define limits for hydraulic conductivity values that contribute to a soil being imperfectly or poorly drained 2 methods and materials 2 1 apsim model description apsim agricultural production systems simulator www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 is a modular process oriented simulation framework which has initially focused on the prediction of crop yield as influenced by the availability of water and nitrogen the model has also been extensively used to guide n fertilisation vogeler and cichota 2016 and investigate environmental impacts of farming systems such as nitrate leaching and n2o emissions hoffmann et al 2018 thorburn et al 2010 the primary modules used in the simulation for this study included swim3 huth et al 2012 based on richards equation for water movement and the convection dispersion equation for solute transport surfaceom and soiln probert et al 1998 modules for surface organic matter and soil c and n transformations agpasture li et al 2011 for simulating a pasture mix of ryegrass lolium perenne l and white clover trifolium repens l swim3 is based on a two domain model for hydraulic conductivity comprising a macropore and a soil matrix domain huth et al 2012 the value of k sat is a model input and the hydraulic conductivity at a potential of 100 cm k dul equivalent to the soil moisture at the drained upper limit dul or field capacity is by default set to 0 1 mm day the soil matrix s hydraulic conductivity below dul is related to the water retention curve and the soil macropore conductivity is described by a simple power function for details see huth et al 2012 2 2 apsim model setup all simulations were conducted using the apsim version 7 10 simulations were run for a pastoral system with grazing every three weeks 2 3 experimental study the effects of using soil hydraulic parameters derived using two different approaches on apsim were evaluated by comparing temporal soil moisture predictions with those measured during a two year experiment described in detail in watt 1977 in this experiment performed on a poorly drained otokia silt loam in the otago region of new zealand soil moisture was measured over 2 full years 1972 and 1973 via neutron probes in the various soil horizons to a depth of 2 m at the time of the experiment the site was under ryegrass white clover pasture for intensive fat lamb production the annual average rainfall in this site is 730 mm and the average temperature 10 6 c watt 1976 the otokia silt loam is a poorly drained soil formed into silty textured loess nz soil classification fragic perch gley pallic soil usda taxonomy fragiaquepts hewitt 2013 the topsoil horizons 0 300 mm have moderate to fine nut structure with a dark grey colour and iron manganese concretions indicative of seasonal water logging the upper subsoil of the b2g horizon at a depth from about 300 to 500 mm has strong gleying and mottling features and weak coarse blocky structure below 500 mm is the dense fragipan cx horizon with the massive structure and a more yellow brown colour indicating that drainage water perches on this slowly permeable horizon causing seasonal saturation and thus gley features in the horizons above data from the a horizon 0 150 mm the ab horizon 150 300 mm the gleyed b2g horizon depth from 300 to 500 mm and the underlying dense cx horizon 500 800 mm were used in this study as there were very little temporal changes in soil moisture below 800 mm 2 4 soil profile descriptions to assess the effect that the soil profile description especially the value of ksat of the low permeability cx horizon has on the temporal moisture regime within the overlying soil profile modelling scenarios were first set up with the site specific soil description of the field experiment described above as k sat measurements for the various horizons were lacking estimates from the national scale s map pedotransfer function for k sat were used in the second setup clar 59a sibling the same site specific and estimated data was used except for the soil water retention curve values which were based on the national s map pedotransfer function mcneill et al 2018 the soil profiles were set up to a depth of 1500 mm the key soil hydraulic properties for both setups are provided in table 2 next to determine bounds for k sat and k dul of the low permeability soil layer horizon cx the values of k were varied in a sensitivity analysis where k sat was set to either 2 4 6 12 24 48 96 or 192 mm d 1 and k dul to 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 or 1 mm d 1 2 5 effect of climate conditions on seasonal soil wetness to determine the effect of kdul of the cx horizon on the degree of wetness in the overlying b2g horizon long term simulations were run with both the otokia and the clar 59 soil profile descriptions for a period of 45 years as the simulations for the experimental study showed very little effect of ksat on the duration of the soil wetness status see results below simulations were only run with a ksat value of 24 mm d the simulations were run with daily weather data accessed from the niwa virtual climate station network vcsn tait et al 2006 three different climatic conditions the wet wingatui climate 45 875s 170 375e with an average annual rainfall rf of 730 mm the medium lincoln climate 43 625s 172 475e with an average rf of 628 mm and the dry timaru climate 44 375s 171 225e with an average rf of 582 mm the wingatui climate correlates with the poorly drained otokia soil in the experimental study and the timaru climate correlates with large areas of loess soils with the same horizons and attributes as the otokia but under the timaru climate the soil morphology is typically imperfectly drained implying less frequent saturation in the upper subsoil compared to the otokia soil 2 6 statistical analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the modelled soil water data when compared with the observed data common measures were used including the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse score franz and hogue 2011 the nse score compares the model mean square error with the variance of the observations and its value can vary from to 1 a positive nse value indicates that the model has more predictive power than simply applying the mean observed value while reported performance ratings for nse values are variable moriasi et al 2007 suggested for monthly time steps values of 0 75 nse 1 as very good 0 65 nse 0 75 as good 0 5 nse 65 as satisfactory and nse 0 5 as unsatisfactory 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal soil moisture content the temporal variation in soil water contents for the different horizons was generally well described by apsim when based on the site specific soil description this is shown in fig 1 for a ksat value of 24 mm d and a kdul of 0 25 mm d for the slowly permeable subsoil horizon cx when using the s map soil description for the otokia soil clar 59a the prediction of the temporal soil moisture in the a horizon nse of 0 68 and the ab horizon nse of 0 75 is good however the prediction in the b2g horizon is unsatisfactory nse of 0 49 and in the cx horizon the soil moisture is very poorly predicted negative nse this is due to the much higher value for the field capacity of these two layers in the clar 59a compared to the measured data table 2 the effect of this on the annual duration of the saturation is discussed further down depending on the combination of ksat kdul used for the cx horizon nse values for the site specific description otokia soil ranged from 0 52 to 0 64 in horizon a from 0 53 to 0 86 in horizon ab 0 76 to 0 85 in horizon b2g and 0 17 to 0 73 in horizon cx at a given kdul the value of ksat had very little effect on the prediction accuracy apart from in the ab horizon appendix table 5 changing the value of kdul in the cx has a more pronounced effect on the prediction accuracy the rmse at the kdul of 1 mm d is much higher 0 023 0 024 m3 m 3 compared to those with lower values of kdul rmse ranging from 0 019 to 0 021 m3 m 3 the lowest rmse 0 019 to 0 02 m3 m 3 for soil moisture in the b2g horizon across the range of ksat values investigated was found for a kdul of 0 25 mm d fig 2 and best prediction of soil moisture were found with kdul values 0 25 mm d and ksat values 12 mm d these are consistent with previous estimates for similar new zealand loess soils where the kdul of the cx was measured at 0 04 0 01 mm d gradwell 1979 in a different study joe and watt 1984 measured ksat values of 20 22 mm d which is much higher compared with the ksat of 0 1 mm d estimated by watt 1976 for the otokia soil both of these studies used small cores and as such the measurements encompass a high uncertainty this uncertainty was identified as a major impediment in the development of the national ksat pedotransfer function model for s map pollacco et al 2017 the inverse modelling approach shown here demonstrates the value of such an approach for refining this uncertainty and to identify the most likely range of soil hydraulic conductivity parameters by using a sensitivity analysis the bounds of acceptable uncertainty can be identified in terms of the relative impact on predicting measured soil moisture status response as well as on the correlation with regional differences in long term soil wetness status as discussed further down 3 2 saturation degree similar to the prediction of the temporal soil moisture content the value of ksat of the cx horizon had little effect on the annual days at which the b2g horizon was above field capacity fig 3 in 1972 a wet year with 861 mm rainfall high values of kdul of the cx horizon 0 5 and 1 mm d significantly reduced the annual days above field capacity fc whereas between 0 05 and 0 25 mm d there was little difference in contrast in 1973 a dry year with 581 mm rainfall the value of kdul had an effect on the days above fc throughout the range investigated this difference in the days above fc for the two different years is in line with results by watt 1977 who estimated that the soil moisture in the b2g horizon was at or above fc for 140 and 30 days in the moist season of 1972 and 1973 note that the days above field capacity here are for the entire year and thus higher compared to those reported in watt 1977 our long term simulations described further down indicate that annual days fc are likely to be 15 25 greater than those estimated in watt 1977 the values of ksat of the cx horizon had a larger effect on the annual days the b2g horizon was above 90 of the saturation fig 4 for example in 1972 with a kdul of 0 5 mm d the days above 90 of saturation were reduced by 20 as the saturation degree of a soil is important for the transition between nitrification and denitrification accurate prediction of the duration and fluctuation of soil saturation is important for example van der weerden et al 2014 found that n2o emissions increased exponentially with the degree of soil moisture saturation up to a water filled pore space of 89 however again the value of kdul had a larger effect on the days above 90 saturation than ksat using the s map soil description for the otokia soil clar 59a affected the annual wetness differently depending on the year and the value of kdul this is shown in fig 5 for a ksat value of 24 mm d in general the clar 59a results in slightly more days on which the soil is above fc but apart from the simulation in 1973 with a kdul of 0 25 mm d difference of 21 days the annual days above fc are within 12 days when compared to using the measured site specific soil hydraulic parameters 3 3 duration of seasonal soil wetness status long term simulations results from the long term simulation over 45 years also show that the value of kdul had a large effect on the annual days table 3 and the annual days in the wet season table 4 in which soil moisture was above fc with more days at lower kdul this reflects the sensitivity of predictions to kdul during dry years fig 6 where days above fc in the moist season varied much more higher coefficient of variation with lower rainfall due to changes in kdul this is also consistent with the experimental data where days above fc varied much more with kdul during the dry 1973 year compared to the wetter 1972 year fig 3 regional soil survey mapping shows that imperfectly drained soils occur predominantly in loess soils with fragipan in the timaru climate whereas under the wetter wingatui climate these soils are mostly classified as poorly drained field based observations suggest that poorly drained soils are above field capacity for three to six months this is compared to one to two months for imperfectly drained soils bruce 1972 taylor and pohlen 1979 these different annual wetness durations are consistent with the long term simulations of wetness durations during the wet season from june to september table 4 particularly for predictions when using kdul values 0 25 mm d however the simulation results also show that days above fc are highly variable fig 7 reflecting the year to year variation in rainfall see also fig 6 for the range of rf in the wet season this variability varies with climate as well as with the choice of the kdul value for example under the wingatui climate the variability is similar for all kdul values whereas under the timaru climate the variability decreases with increasing kdul comparisons between s map predictions and site specific measured data shows similar variability in the saturation degree between years the high variability highlights the risk of using a simple annual average when characterizing the duration of wetness for different soils although the class based approach of bruce 1972 and taylor and pohlen 1979 to describe the range of annual wetness duration does better encapsulate the year to year variation shown in our long term simulations the results do overlap between different climates indicating that the differences in wetness duration between poor and imperfectly drained soils maybe best compared as probability distribution functions this is consistent with the approach suggested by kutilek and nielsen 1994 who argue that due to the large variability of k sat soil surveys and hydraulic modelling characterization would be more appropriate to consider using the frequency distribution of k sat to represent and compare differences in hydraulic character of contrasting soils the description of the soil profile also affected the average amount of days over 45 years at which the soil moisture was above fc table 3 with more days for the clar 59a compared with the site specific otokia description however consistent with the findings using the experimental years in the previous section the overall differences are not large particularly during the moist season table 4 at between 0 and 9 days the predictions of inter year variability fig 7 are also very similar between the clar 59a and site specific description both soil descriptions give a consistent relative difference between the different climates and correlate with the field based estimates of regional wetness duration under these climates bruce 1972 taylor and pohlen 1979 overall the long term simulations indicate that the estimates of seasonal wetness are significantly more sensitive to the soil hydraulic conductivity values than the soil water storage parameters that s map currently predicts for these types of soils 4 conclusions and recommendations the results of this study highlight the significant value that inverse modelling can have for the determination of the soil hydraulic conductivity especially for slowly permeable subsoil horizons that are challenging to measure yet can exert a controlling influence over the hydraulic behaviour of the whole soil profile characterisation of these slowly permeable horizons is also particularly sensitive to uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity values as relatively small changes can lead to significant differences in modelling the resultant soil hydraulic behavior our inverse modelling approach has provided clarity around the likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation ksat and field capacity kdul for a slowly permeable subsurface fragipan horizon that is spatially extensive in the loess soils of new zealand it has also identified that these soils are less sensitive to the soil water storage parameters predicted by s map than to the conductivity attribute predictions leading to a recommendation that s map revises the conductivity predictions for slowly permeable horizons this use of small scale core measurements with inverse modelling for identifying likely ranges of hydraulic conductivity values is a valuable approach for upscaling hydraulic properties for larger areas and for characterizing the hydraulic behaviour of soils based on the drainage class morphology characteristic and wetness duration at the landscape scale under different climate zones the results also highlight that for slowly permeable horizons the unsaturated conductivity function is of critical importance for modelling soil hydraulic behavior and that ksat on its own is not sufficient as an input parameter for the apsim simulation model when representing a bimodal pore system we conclude that kdul has a significant influence on modelling of the hydraulic behavior and recommend that for slowly permeable horizons kdul should not be set to a constant value to support this we recommend that soil information systems such as s map provide beside ksat values also the values for kdul conflict of interest estimation of soil subsurface hydraulic

6441,evapotranspiration et plays an important role in determining the available water resources of a basin in past decades the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china has suffered severe water crisis and ecological problems due to large land cover changes lccs especially oases expansion for irrigation agriculture this study quantifies the et variations due to lccs in the hrb from 2000 to 2015 using the ecological assimilation of land and climate observations ealco model and detailed lcc measurements large variations in et with land cover type is seen in the hrb in the past fifteen years crop expansion from bare soil or desert grass caused most of the increase in et while the conversion of alpine grass to desert grass caused most of the decrease in et as a result a net 1 03 billion m3 of increased water consumption per year resulted from the overall lccs in the hrb this increased water use for et largely intensified the water crisis in the hrb and deteriorated the health of the downstream ecosystems our results show that the water consumed in crop expansion can be used to recover almost ten times the area of the degraded desert grass ecosystem a stricter policy that limits agriculture expansion is recommended in land use planning for a sustainable ecosystem development in the basin this study also helps to better understand et changes from lccs and manage the limited water resources for sustainable ecosystem development in other arid regions of the world keywords evapotranspiration water resource land cover change crop expansion land surface model ealco model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et plays an important role in the water energy in the form of latent heat and carbon cycles french et al 2015 fisher et al 2017 huntington 2006 jung et al 2010 wang et al 2015a globally et is the second largest component after precipitation and returns approximately 60 of precipitation to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 in arid areas the ratio of et to precipitation is much larger and can even be 100 due to the more xeric environment for higher et demand indicating that et is a highly sensitive indicator of water consumption in arid regions gowda et al 2008 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 xu et al 2013 physically and physiologically et is driven by not only climatic factors such as temperature precipitation wind speed atmosphere pressure humidity and solar radiation but also changes in environmental factors such as co2 nitrogen deposition and land covers shi et al 2013 jung et al 2010 indicated that the global et increased at an average rate of 0 71 mm year during 1982 1997 mainly due to an increased evaporative demand derived by rising radiative forcing but decreasing up until 2008 probably because of the increasing soil moisture limitations zhang et al 2015 reported a similar trend of the global annual et between 1998 and 2008 and found a recovery trend after 2008 although considerable efforts have been made to improve our understanding of et including its variability climate effects and responses to environmental factors at the global scale the mechanisms and factors that govern et changes have not been investigated much at the regional scale especially in arid regions land cover changes lccs have a significant impact on terrestrial et because they can alter the properties of surfaces such as the land surface roughness albedo leaf area index lai and canopy hydraulic conductance dunn and mackay 1995 mahmood et al 2014 schilling et al 2008 zhang and schilling 2006 these property changes will directly affect water transfer processes and energy partitioning in the soil plant atmosphere continuum twine et al 2004 wang 2008 wang et al 2013 for example an increase in albedo i e a brightening of the surface by deforestation or road construction decreases the net radiation and thus reduces the energy available for partitioning to sensible heat and latent heat the et response to lccs is highly complex and related to lots of geophysical and geobiological processes e g soil moisture transfer root water uptake plant photosynthesis leaf stoma adjustment different types of lccs generally result in different impacts on et for example the conversion from grass to bare soil will significantly reduce the lai and thereafter decrease the transpiration while increasing the soil evaporation charney 1975 deng et al 2015 in contrast the conversion from desert grass to crops will cause an increased transpiration and decreased soil evaporation due to amplified lai and reduced surface albedo the et effects may be different even with similar lccs for example the conversion from forest to crop was found to reduce et twine et al 2004 or increase et liu et al 2008a due to different climate and geographic conditions a number of studies have focused on basin level et changes due to lccs in an early study charney 1975 analyzed the impact of lccs on et in the sahara desert and found that the grass degradation decreased the latent heat and increased sensible heat fluxes matheussen et al 2000 analyzed the hydrological effects of vegetation changes in the columbia river basin using the variable infiltration capacity vic model and found that the ets in different sub basins were decreased by approximately 3 1 12 1 twine et al 2004 studied the water and energy changes derived from lccs in the mississippi river basin using the integrated biosphere simulator ibis model and found that the net radiation and et were both substantially decreased after the conversion of closed forest to crop and both substantially increased after grass was converted to crop liu et al 2008a pongratz et al 2006 and sakai et al 2004 also found that et decreased after conversion of forest to crop in the amazon river basin and in northeast china further liu et al 2008a suggested that the ratio of et to net radiation did not change significantly after grass conversion to crop li et al 2009 assessed the lccs impact on the surface hydrology of a small river basin in the loess plateau of china using the soil and water assessment tools swat model and found that the overall et increased by 4 mm from 1981 to 2000 due to all the lccs in the region deng et al 2015 simulated the et change due to lccs in heihe river basin hrb during 2000 2010 using the weather research and forecasting wrf model and found that the et in summer autumn and winter decreased after the conversion of grass to bare soil yuan et al 2017 found that the annual et increased by 13 32 mm year from 2001 to 2012 in xinjiang in china owing to the expansion of croplands sterling et al 2013 found that the global terrestrial et decreased by approximately 26 mm year 5 due to the global lccs accurately quantifying the impacts of lccs on et is challenging because of the variety and complexity of land covers the quality of input data and the limitations in et modelling algorithms and their validation in reproducing the ecohydrological responses to lccs previous research has reported contradictory results regarding the effects of lccs on et for example twine et al 2004 concluded that et is substantially decreased after the conversion of closed forest to crop while liu et al 2008a arrived at the opposite conclusion the main reasons for the differences in the conclusions may include the following three reasons the first is the difference in the land cover classification schemes which in most of the previous studies were relatively coarse for example the majority of the studies did not recognize the differences in grass types when simulating et however various grass types such as alpine grass meadow typical grass steppe and desert grass may cause large differences in among others lai surface albedo and phenology which may result in significant differences in et using coarse land cover classification schemes could lead to biased estimates in regional et the second reason is the difference in the input data e g atmospheric forcing data and soil texture data for example the quality and spatial resolution of the commonly used atmosphere forcing datasets such as the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 the national centers for environmental prediction ncep the national center for atmospheric research reanalysis ncar kalnay et al 1996 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the interim reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the princeton datasets sheffield et al 2006 may cause significant difference in et model results wang et al 2015b finally the third reason is the difference in the modelling algorithms and their validations different models can have largely different et modelling algorithms even for the process based and widely used land surface models large differences may exist these may include the one layer vs multi layer canopy models for canopy radiation absorption and stomatal conductance simulations one layer bucket vs multi layer numerical soil models for soil thermal and water simulations parameterized vs dynamic snow schemes carbon and nitrogen decoupled vs coupled canopy energy balance solutions implicit vs explicit plant water transfer models for root water uptake and plant water storage and transpiration simulations the differences in the modelling algorithms and their possible impacts on the et simulation have been examined in several model inter comparison studies boone et al 2009 hanson et al 2004 henderson sellers 1995 potter et al 2001 the land cover in arid regions of northwest china has been hugely altered in the past 40 years one of the dominant land cover conversion types was the desert to cropland conversion under the land reclamation practice the rapid oases expansion for agriculture have greatly increased the demand for water for irrigation and intensified the shortage of water resources in the region the hrb is a major river basin in northwest china the obvious consequence is that two terminal lakes in the lower reach namely the west juyan lake and east juyan lake dried out in 1961 and 1992 respectively this directly resulted in the substantial wilting of the tamarisk and euphratica forests posing a huge threat to the ecological security in the lower reach however information on the water loss from et due to the lccs over the region is very limited this study aims at filling this knowledge gap by quantifying the impacts of lccs on et in the hrb using the ealco model with rigorous calibrations a detailed land cover classification scheme and high spatial resolution atmospheric forcing data the results will provide support for making science informed water use policies and land use planning in the hrb 2 study area 2 1 the heihe river basin hrb

surface cropland desert grass tamarisk and euphratica at the end of the heihe river due to its extremely dry climate with annual rainfall of less than 50 mm li et al 2013 the annual average temperature in the lower reach is roughly the same as that in the middle reach while its potential et is much higher than that of the middle reach 1185 mm the bareground area i e sand and gobi deserts desert grass alpine grass cropland and forests account for approximately 67 6 15 5 9 5 4 4 and 1 of the entire hrb area respectively because of the very limited rainfall the oasis agricultural region in the middle reach heavily relies on water supply from heihe river chen et al 2018 however most of the heihe river water is exhausted by agriculture irrigation in the middle reach leaving very little water flowing into the lower reach for the vast desert grass in recent decades the water competition between the agriculture use in the middle reach and the ecosystem in the lower reach has become increasingly fiercer which significantly affected the local socio economic development and national water use strategies 2 2 measurement sites a total of nine sites distributed in the hrb with different land cover types were used to calibrate the ealco model fig 2 these nine sites were selected because they can generally represent all the land cover types in the hrb these sites are all installed with tower flux measurements using the eddy covariance ec technique the detailed site information and available data are provided in table 1 in summary there are three grass sites a rou dashalong and huazhaizi one crop site daman one wetland site shidi two bare ground sites bajitan and shenshawo one shrub site sidaoqiao and one deciduous broadleaf site huyanglin all the vegetation sites consist of c3 plants except the crop site which consists of c4 plants there are two five and two sites located in the upper middle and lower reaches respectively each site was installed with both automatic weather instruments and ec instruments supported by the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater project li et al 2013 3 data 3 1 land cover change lcc detailed land cover data is used to assign vegetation types and parameters related to the physiological processes in the ealco in this study land cover datasets with a spatial resolution of 30 m were retrieved from landsat images from 2000 to 2015 chen 2018 a classification scheme with a total of 14 classes i e evergreen conifer forest ecf deciduous conifer shrub dcs deciduous broadleaf forest dbf wetland alpine swamp as alpine grass ag desert grass dg c3 crop c4 crop impervious surface area isa bareground bg water body wb and permanent now and ice pni were considered for the entire hrb a hybrid decision tree classifier based on expert knowledge and land cover samples was applied for the two years classification a total of 316 samples derived from field surveys and google earth maps were used for validation the land cover product has an overall accuracy of 89 87 for all the classified classes and most land covers have a producer s or users accuracy of at least 85 all the land cover datasets were transformed into albers equal area aea projection and resampled to 1 km by using the majority algorithm the land cover change between 2000 and 2015 was analyzed by calculating the transition matrix table 2 3 2 atmosphere forcing the model forcing data includes eight meteorological variables downward short wave radiation downward long wave radiation air temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure and co2 concentration the first seven variables used for spatial modelling were obtained from the heihe plan science data center hpsdc http www heihedata org pan et al 2012 we used this dataset because it was produced specifically for hrb research this spatial dataset has fine temporal resolution an hourly time step and spatial resolution 0 05 latitude longitude and has been validated in several other studies hou and nan 2012 pan and li 2011 wu et al 2015 overall compared to other global or regional forcing datasets such as gldas rodell et al 2004 ncep ncar kalnay et al 1996 era interim dee et al 2011 and princeton data sheffield et al 2006 this product has been found to be more accurate in the hrb especially for precipitation measurements hou and nan 2012 the co2 concentration data was obtained from the co2 earth website https www co2 earth spatial variations of atmosphere s co2 concentration over the basin were not considered fig 3 a and b shows the annual average temperature and precipitation from 2000 to 2015 respectively 3 3 leaf area index lai the quality of the lai data is crucial in simulating et because it can largely affect the transpiration and leaf surficial evaporation an 8 day composite lai dataset from 2000 produced by liao et al 2013 and a 4 day composite lai dataset from 2015 produced by yin et al 2015 were used in this study the spatial resolution of both datasets is 1 km similar to the atmosphere forcing data we used these two lai datasets because they were produced specifically for hrb research although the quality of this satellite lai is high it could be still biased from the ground truth in some areas to further reduce the uncertainty from the lai we focused on key phenology stages i e leaf emerging green peaking and leaf senescence and the corresponding lais were adjusted close to the ground truth from heihe plan science data center http www heihedata org fig 3c specifically the dates of leaf emergence and senescence in the model were modified according to the time series of the lai using timesat packages jönsson and eklundh 2004 3 4 soil texture data the quality of the soil texture data is also important in et simulations because it can largely impact the hydraulic conductance which determines the transfer ability of the soil moisture in this study we used a local soil texture dataset 1 1 000 000 scale soil map fig 3d with fine spatial resolution obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences shi et al 2004 this soil texture data includes the percentage of sand silt and clay the soil bulk density and the content of soil organic matter which are the input data in the ealco model 3 5 flux the flux data used for model benchmarking see section 4 2 for the nine sites were downloaded from heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater at the heihe plan science data center http www heihedata org xu et al 2017 these data were measured using ec measurements csat3 from campbell scientific inc and li7500 from li cor fig 2 the data include wind direction wind speed m s friction wind speed m s sensible heat flux w m2 and latent heat flux w m2 all the data were previously processed and quality checked before release xu et al 2013 in summary the data processing includes three major steps first the raw records collected at a 10 hz sampling frequency from the ec were used to calculate the half hourly latent heat and sensible heat fluxes using the edire software package liu et al 2010 the processing includes spike detection lag correction of h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component sonic virtual temperature correction coordinating rotation using the planar fit method corrections for density fluctuation wpl correction and frequency response correction then the data obtained in the following conditions were rejected 1 sensor malfunction occurred 2 precipitation occurred 1 h before or after recording 3 the missing ratio was higher than 10 in the raw data within half hour or 4 the friction velocity was less than 0 2 m s during the night finally the rejected data were reconstructed by using the gap filled methods described in liu et al 2010 the corrected ec data can be downloaded from the hpsdc and have been widely used in previous studies liu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 xu et al 2013 xu et al 2017 4 model 4 1 the ealco model the ealco model is a physically based numerical model for simulating the ecological and hydrological processes of terrestrial ecosystems using in situ and remote sensing observations wang 2008 wang et al 2013 the model runs at half hourly time steps and includes five major modules for simulating land surface radiation transfer wang 2005 wang et al 2007 energy balance wang et al 2002a zhang et al 2008 water dynamics wang 2008 and carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles wang et al 2001 2002b the et in ealco is obtained by simulating its components of canopy transpiration evaporation or sublimation from intercepted rain snow dew or frost soil evaporation and snow sublimation at ground surface and evaporation from water surface e g water bodies see the supplementary materials for detailed et algorithms these simulations are conducted in the water module in which they are dynamically coupled with the other four modules in the ealco the ealco was used in this study because it has comprehensive algorithms for simulating the land surface water transfer processes which include the carbon and nitrogen coupled canopy et solutions root water uptake plant water storage soil water transfers and soil water groundwater interactions the ealco also includes comprehensive algorithms for simulating other et related ecosystem processes such as canopy radiation absorption which uses a multiple wavelengths multi layer canopy ray tracing scheme canopy stomatal conductance which is specifically optimized for arid regions wang et al 2009a b wang 2012 snow and soil processes which use dynamic layering schemes for temperature water and freeze thaw simulations zhang et al 2008 and carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles which affect the plant conditions for root water extraction and leaf transpiration the model fits well with our study region which has a large area with diverse climate and vegetation conditions the detailed modelling algorithms take the advantages of our detailed land cover and other in situ datasets for fine model calibrations the ealco model has been tested in a number of studies using the long term and intensive field measurements including the boreal ecosystem atmosphere study boreas study amthor et al 2001 potter et al 2001 the us walker branch throughfall displacement experiment tde and the ameriflux sites hanson et al 2004 the fluxnet canada research network fcrn sites grant et al 2005 2009 2006 the carbon flux studies of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in china mi et al 2010 and the rami4pilps suite of virtual experiments in which models were evaluated under perfectly controlled experimental conditions in order to eliminate uncertainties arising from an incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the canopy characteristics typical for model testing with in situ observations in particular the ealco model was tested using a new assumption centered model inter comparison approach in the free air co2 enrichment face model data synthesis project using the information gathered in two forest face experiments this new approach evaluated models against experimental data based on the hypothesis and ways in which they represent key ecological processes kauwe et al 2014 zaehle et al 2014 walker et al 2014 medlyn et al 2015 recent assessments of its et results can be found in wang et al 2014a b 2015a b the ealco has demonstrated its robustness in these tests and it provides confidence for its effective application in this study two major modifications in ealco were made in this study to better fit our research objectives first simulations of the default plant types found in the hrb were further specified into the corresponding subclasses for example the grass was divided into wetland alpine swamp alpine grass and desert grass crops were divided into c3 and c4 types the wetland alpine swamp alpine grass desert grass and c3 and c4 crops were recognized and simulated separately the plant parameters including the specific leaf area and tree density of these subclasses were specifically set for each type the plant phenology algorithm which was mainly based on the accumulated daily temperature was revised by using satellites lai observations the dates of leaf emergence and senescence were modified according to the time series of the lai observations 4 2 model parameterization calibration and performance assessment the ealco includes a large number of parameters representing soil and plant s physical and physiological characteristics wang et al 2002a in this study most of the plant and soil s parameter values for each site were determined using local measurements and field surveys when measurements were not available parameter values from other studies over this region were adopted three parameters i e the maximum capacity of rubisco to perform the carboxylase function the slope in the biochemical model of farquhar et al 1980 and the water table which play critical roles in simulating et and were adopted from wang 2008 were further fine tuned manually to achieve the best model performance in simulating measured fluxes i e net radiation sensible heat and latent heat specifically the fine tuning process includes 1 performing the simulation using the given value 2 comparing the three measured and simulated variables net radiation sensible heat and latent heat 3 assessing whether reasonable results have been obtained using the statistical methods the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to assess the model performance and were obtained as follows 1 r i 1 n e i e o i o i 1 n e i e 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 r m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 3 n s e 1 i 1 n e i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 b i a s i 1 n e i o i i 1 n o i 100 where o i and e i are the observed and simulated values respectively o and e are the mean observed value and the mean simulated value and n is the total number of validation records 4 if the results obtained from the statistical method are not reasonable adjusting the initial value within a certain range and 5 repeating the process until the best results have been obtained arnold et al 2012 after all the parameter values table 3 were determined for each plant and soil type the model was applied spatially to simulate regional et from 2000 to 2015 using the land covers mentioned in section 3 see section 4 3 for details 4 3 experimental design of spatial modelling a pair of simulations was designed to quantify the contributions of land cover change on et the simulations are termed lc2000 clim00 15 and lc2015 clim00 15 representing the et for the land cover in 2000 and 2015 under the same climate from 2000 to 2015 respectively to eliminate the impact of different climates the climate data was set to be same for both land cover statuses the lai from 2000 and 2015 were used for all the years in the simulation of lc2000 clim00 15 and lc2015 clim00 15 respectively therefore the et difference between this two simulations is solely due to the impacts of lccs on et in the hrb from 2000 to 2015 5 results 5 1 model performance in the hrb fig 4 and table 4 show the comparisons of the ealco simulated vs measured net radiation latent heat and sensible heat in all the nine sites the scatterplots in fig 4a indicate high correlations r 0 95 between simulated and observed net radiation in every site implying that the ealco can accurately simulate the radiation transfer process for all the land cover types found in the hrb this can be further evidenced by the high nse 0 86 low rmse lower than 35 w m2 in most sites and low bias in each site as shown in table 4 scatterplots of latent heat fig 4b and sensible heat fig 4c also indicate good correlations r 0 82 between the simulations and observations the high nse low rmse and low bias of latent and sensible heats in most of the sites shown in table 4 further demonstrate the good performance of the ealco on the simulation of water and heat transfer over the hrb 5 2 spatiotemporal variations of et in the hrb the daily temporal variations of et in all the sites indicate the three key factors in determining et namely the air temperature precipitation and lai fig 5 when the daily temperature is below 0 c the daily et is very small in all the sites thus sites with warmer climate generally have longer duration of et peak stages than those with a colder climate for example the peak duration of the daily et at the sd site wetland in the middle reach fig 5g is much longer than that at the ar site alpine grass in the upper reach fig 5a because the climate in the middle reach is much warmer than that in the upper reach the precipitation dominantly determines the daily et in non vegetation sites in the middle reach for example each spike of the daily et profiles at the bjt site gobi in the middle reach and ssw site sand desert in the middle reach is basically a direct response to rainfall events the lai directly determines the transpiration thus it largely controls the daily et in each vegetated site in the growing period the peak of the daily lai is generally correlated with the peak of the daily et in most of the vegetated sites it is worth noting that in some vegetation sites that have relatively low total water supply from precipitation such as the dm sd sdq and hyl the results also showed a high daily et in the growing season this is because these site have water supplies from other sources such as irrigation using surface water at the dm site ground water uptake by the deep roots of tamarix and euphratica at the sdq and hyl sites and the surface water storage at the sd wetland site a significant spatial heterogeneity of the annual et characterized by high values in the middle and upper reaches and low values in the lower reach is observed fig 6 a the spatial pattern of the annual et is closely related to the land cover types and climate conditions the et values in the upper reach range from 250 to 600 mm with higher et in the east and lower et in the west this is mainly because the annual precipitation is higher in the east than in the west fig 3a and the average temperature is approximately the same in the two regions fig 3b the spatial heterogeneity of et in the middle reach is very large ranging from less than 100 mm in bareground areas to 600 mm in crop dominated areas the spatial pattern of the et in the middle reach is highly correlated with land cover types similarly the annual et in the lower reach is well correlated with the land cover types to quantitatively compare the et among different land cover types over the hrb the average annual et of each land cover type was calculated fig 6b as expected among all the land cover types the water body has the highest average annual et 1357 mm followed by the wetland which has an average annual et of 923 mm the average annual et of the c4 crop 619 mm is slightly larger than that of the c3 crop 575 mm this is mainly caused by the climate conditions of the two crop types the c4 crop maize is mainly distributed in the middle reach while the c3 crop wheat is mainly planted in the upper middle reach and the temperature in the lower middle reach is higher than that in the upper middle reach fig 3b the average annual et of the alpine grass 543 mm is close to that of the deciduous forest mainly euphratica 515 mm the average annual et of the evergreen conifer forest spruce forest 340 mm is close to that of the deciduous conifer shrubs mainly tamarisk 358 mm the contributions of the annual et for these four land cover types are different mostly the precipitation for et consumption of alpine grass and evergreen conifer forest while more groundwater is up taken for the et consumption of the deciduous forest and deciduous conifer shrub due to the shorter phenology period caused by the lower temperatures the average annual et of the alpine swamp 448 mm is much lower than that of the alpine grass 543 mm the average annual et of the desert grass 248 mm is also much lower than the alpine grass one due to the much lower annual precipitation the average annual ets of the permanent snow and bareground are 366 and 87 mm respectively the impervious surface area has the lowest annual et 66 mm among all the land cover types fig 7 shows the average seasonal et of each land cover type in 2015 all the land cover types have the highest et in summer june july and august and the lowest average et in winter december january and february it is worth noting that the average et of each land cover type in spring march april and may is larger than that in autumn september october and november though the average temperatures in the two seasons are nearly the same this is mainly because most of the snow stored in the previous winter melted in spring leading to more available water for et consumption in spring than in autumn 5 3 contributions of lccs to et the spatial pattern of et changes indicates that the lccs had significant impacts on the et in the hrb during 2000 2015 fig 8 the spatial extent of the increased et is much larger than the area of decreased et eight major land cover change types caused an increase of et including conversions from desert grass to alpine grass approximately 98 mm and desert grass to alpine swamp approximately 64 mm in the upper reach bareground and desert grass to c4 crops approximately 420 and 426 mm respectively in the middle reach desert grass to c3 crops approximately 182 mm bareground to desert grass approximately 39 mm and bareground to water body approximately 1334 mm in the lower reach fig 9 it can be seen that the conversion from bareground to water body constitutes the largest increase in et approximately 1334 mm while the conversion from bareground to desert grass has the lowest increase in et approximately 39 mm fig 9 increased ets derived from conversions of desert grass to c4 crops and bareground to c4 crops are similar approximately 420 mm however the former is much higher than the et increase derived from the conversion of desert grass to c3 crops approximately 181 mm this is mainly attributed to the climate difference of these two crop distributions as mentioned above i e most c3 crops were planted in the upper reach where the climate is much colder than that in the middle reach where most c4 crops were planted the increased et from conversion of desert grass to alpine grass is higher than that from the conversion of desert grass to alpine swamp the reason is that the growing period of alpine grass is longer than that of the alpine swamp leading to a longer transpiration period for alpine grass another six conversions caused a decrease in et including that from alpine grass to desert grass approximately 212 mm bareground to isa approximately 28 mm desert grass to isa approximately 124 mm c4 crop to desert grass approximately 383 mm desert grass to bareground approximately 15 mm and c4 crop to isa approximately 597 mm fig 9 which is mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches the conversion from c4 crop to isa has the largest decrease of et approximately 567 mm while conversion from desert grass to bareground approximately 15 mm has the lowest increase of et fig 9 the et decrease from the conversion of desert grass to isa is larger than that from the conversion of bareground to isa and the yearly et of the desert grass is higher than that of the bareground fig 6 the seasonal variations of et changes derived from land cover conversions indicate that almost all the land cover conversions contributed to most of the et changes in summer except for the conversions of desert grass to bareground table 5 the contribution of et changes in spring is larger than those in autumn the winter et has the smallest contribution on et changes among the four seasons it is worth noting that not all the land cover conversion types have the same et change direction in all four seasons for example the conversion of desert grass to c3 crop caused an et decrease of 4 38 mm in autumn which is totally opposite to that in the other three seasons a possible reason is that c3 crops mainly wheat in the upper reach are generally harvested in september table 6 shows the total water consumption in terms of volume from et changes derived from each land cover conversion in the hrb between 2000 and 2015 approximately 1 03 billion m3 of increased water consumption resulted from all the land cover conversions although the conversion of desert grass to c4 crops did not contribute to the largest increase of the average et fig 9 it contributed to most of the total water consumption among all the land cover conversions reaching an increase of 3 87 billion m3 which accounts for 37 55 of the total change in water consumption conversion of bareground to desert grass also significantly contributed to the increased water consumption of 2 21 billion m3 because of its substantial converted area the conversion of bareground to water body has the third largest increase in total water consumption although it contributed to the largest increase of the average et fig 9 conversion of desert grass to alpine grass had the smallest increased in water consumption the largest decrease of water consumption occurred with the conversion of alpine grass to desert grass which was 1 51 billion m3 owing to the very small converted area conversion of bareground to isa contributed the least to the decrease in water consumption with only 0 02 billion m3 6 discussion energy and water change e g et runoff and soil moisture from lccs have been extensively investigated in many regions of the world due to the lack of available studies on et changes from lccs in the hrb studies on global regions and other regions with similar climate were selected for comparison with this study based on the ealco model the total et increase from lccs in this study is approximately 0 50 mm year from 2000 to 2015 which is more than two times lower than the result estimated in the xinjiang province in china by yuan et al 2017 who found an et increase of 1 11 mm year from 2001 to 2012 in contrast our result is more than two times higher than the result estimated in another heihe river catchment in the shanxi province in china by li et al 2009 who reported an et increase of 0 20 mm year from 1981 to 2000 compared to the global result estimated by sterling et al 2013 who found that the terrestrial et decreased by approximately 26 mm year due to the global lccs the et change from lccs in the hrb is rather small additionally it is worth noting that the directions of et change from lccs between these three arid regions and the global study are completely opposite in this study detailed land cover types were considered to improve the accuracy of the et simulations for example the general grass was further classified into wetland alpine grass alpine swamp and desert grass and the crop was further classified into c3 and c4 types a more physiologically based land surface model ealco was used to simulate ets the ealco includes sophisticated radiation transfer schemes carbon coupled energy balance and water transfer schemes grant et al 2006 hanson et al 2004 wang et al 2001 2002b 2007 widlowski et al 2015 and detailed soil and snow schemes for heat and water simulations and is therefore very suitable for this study area the study also took advantage of the relatively large number of flux measurement sites which enabled a rigorous model calibration for the major land cover types in the hrb uncertainties in the spatial modelling results could have been caused by the classification accuracy of the land cover types the quality of the model forcing data and the uncertainties in model parameterization and calibration process although the overall accuracy of the land cover classification is as high as almost 90 the misclassified classes from the omission and commission could still bring errors in both et simulations and basin scale assessment although a much finer land cover scheme was developed in this study uncertainty from our scheme still exists because the heterogeneity of the same land cover type in different pixels cannot be avoided land cover re sampling from high resolution to low resolution resulted in higher configuration heterogeneity thus affecting the et of each simulated grid the spatial forcing dataset used in this study has fine temporal resolution an hourly time step and spatial resolution 0 05 latitude longitude and is specially generated for ecological and land surface modelling in the hrb pan et al 2012 however the difference between this product and the real meteorological observations may also lead to uncertainties in the regional et the time periods of available field measurements at the 9 sites vary from 1 to 2 years these data were used for benchmarking the model during the model calibration phase i e fine tuning the values for the three parameter mentioned above due to the limitations of the field data no additional model tests were conducted all the flux measurements were used for benchmarking the model to maximize the potential of the limited field data in finding the best values for the three parameters so that the model could achieve the best performance and accuracy compared with the observations which increases the confidence in the following regional simulations obviously due to the limited time for observations it is not possible to evaluate the model under extreme climate conditions this needs to be addressed when more field data from the region are available although in previous studies the et changes from climate variability were found to be much larger than those from lccs in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2009 yuan et al 2017 maintaining the limited water resources through the alteration of climate at such large scales is much more difficult than doing it through the management of lccs a science informed land use planning is very important in the hrb due to the limited water supply and its high competition for food production in the middle reach and ecology security in the lower reach therefore an explicit investigation of et water consumption from crop expansion and desert grass recovering in the hrb is very critical based on the results from this study we found that et water consumption derived from crop expansion in 2000 2015 was 508 million m3 which is approximately three times larger than that from desert grass recovering 184 million m3 in other words et water consumption from crop expansion was approximately 359 000 m3 km2 while that from desert grass recovering was only 36 000 m3 km2 this implies that the water consumed per unit area by crop expansion in the middle reach can be used in recovering almost ten times the area of desert grass because the water consumption from crop expansion is much higher than that by desert grass we suggest that a stricter policy that limits the agriculture expansion in the middle reach be adopted in land use planning in order to sustain the ecosystems in the lower reach some planting areas might be suitable according to the results as follows 1 upper reach where alpine grass is located and the temperature is suitable for crops with crop resistance e g green barley 2 mountain bottoms in the transition between the evergreen conifer forest and the sand desert 3 middle reach near the river reservoirs or irrigation channels to reduce evaporation from exposed water 7 conclusions this study investigated the et effects derived from lccs in the hrb from 2000 to 2015 using the ealco model results show that all the lccs resulted in approximately 7 92 mm year of increased et the conversion of desert grass to c4 crop caused the largest increase in water consumption with 3 87 billion m3 while conversion of alpine grass to desert grass caused the lowest decrease with 1 51 billion m3 this increased water use for et largely intensified the water crisis in the hrb and deteriorated the health of the downstream ecosystems the results show that the water consumed by crop expansion can be used to recover almost ten times the area of the degraded desert grass ecosystem a stricter policy for limiting agriculture expansions should be adopted in future s land use planning for a sustainable ecosystem development in the basin this research will help better understand et changes from lccs and manage the limited water resources in the future s land and water allocations in arid regions acknowledgments this work was

6441,evapotranspiration et plays an important role in determining the available water resources of a basin in past decades the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china has suffered severe water crisis and ecological problems due to large land cover changes lccs especially oases expansion for irrigation agriculture this study quantifies the et variations due to lccs in the hrb from 2000 to 2015 using the ecological assimilation of land and climate observations ealco model and detailed lcc measurements large variations in et with land cover type is seen in the hrb in the past fifteen years crop expansion from bare soil or desert grass caused most of the increase in et while the conversion of alpine grass to desert grass caused most of the decrease in et as a result a net 1 03 billion m3 of increased water consumption per year resulted from the overall lccs in the hrb this increased water use for et largely intensified the water crisis in the hrb and deteriorated the health of the downstream ecosystems our results show that the water consumed in crop expansion can be used to recover almost ten times the area of the degraded desert grass ecosystem a stricter policy that limits agriculture expansion is recommended in land use planning for a sustainable ecosystem development in the basin this study also helps to better understand et changes from lccs and manage the limited water resources for sustainable ecosystem development in other arid regions of the world keywords evapotranspiration water resource land cover change crop expansion land surface model ealco model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et plays an important role in the water energy in the form of latent heat and carbon cycles french et al 2015 fisher et al 2017 huntington 2006 jung et al 2010 wang et al 2015a globally et is the second largest component after precipitation and returns approximately 60 of precipitation to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 in arid areas the ratio of et to precipitation is much larger and can even be 100 due to the more xeric environment for higher et demand indicating that et is a highly sensitive indicator of water consumption in arid regions gowda et al 2008 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 xu et al 2013 physically and physiologically et is driven by not only climatic factors such as temperature precipitation wind speed atmosphere pressure humidity and solar radiation but also changes in environmental factors such as co2 nitrogen deposition and land covers shi et al 2013 jung et al 2010 indicated that the global et increased at an average rate of 0 71 mm year during 1982 1997 mainly due to an increased evaporative demand derived by rising radiative forcing but decreasing up until 2008 probably because of the increasing soil moisture limitations zhang et al 2015 reported a similar trend of the global annual et between 1998 and 2008 and found a recovery trend after 2008 although considerable efforts have been made to improve our understanding of et including its variability climate effects and responses to environmental factors at the global scale the mechanisms and factors that govern et changes have not been investigated much at the regional scale especially in arid regions land cover changes lccs have a significant impact on terrestrial et because they can alter the properties of surfaces such as the land surface roughness albedo leaf area index lai and canopy hydraulic conductance dunn and mackay 1995 mahmood et al 2014 schilling et al 2008 zhang and schilling 2006 these property changes will directly affect water transfer processes and energy partitioning in the soil plant atmosphere continuum twine et al 2004 wang 2008 wang et al 2013 for example an increase in albedo i e a brightening of the surface by deforestation or road construction decreases the net radiation and thus reduces the energy available for partitioning to sensible heat and latent heat the et response to lccs is highly complex and related to lots of geophysical and geobiological processes e g soil moisture transfer root water uptake plant photosynthesis leaf stoma adjustment different types of lccs generally result in different impacts on et for example the conversion from grass to bare soil will significantly reduce the lai and thereafter decrease the transpiration while increasing the soil evaporation charney 1975 deng et al 2015 in contrast the conversion from desert grass to crops will cause an increased transpiration and decreased soil evaporation due to amplified lai and reduced surface albedo the et effects may be different even with similar lccs for example the conversion from forest to crop was found to reduce et twine et al 2004 or increase et liu et al 2008a due to different climate and geographic conditions a number of studies have focused on basin level et changes due to lccs in an early study charney 1975 analyzed the impact of lccs on et in the sahara desert and found that the grass degradation decreased the latent heat and increased sensible heat fluxes matheussen et al 2000 analyzed the hydrological effects of vegetation changes in the columbia river basin using the variable infiltration capacity vic model and found that the ets in different sub basins were decreased by approximately 3 1 12 1 twine et al 2004 studied the water and energy changes derived from lccs in the mississippi river basin using the integrated biosphere simulator ibis model and found that the net radiation and et were both substantially decreased after the conversion of closed forest to crop and both substantially increased after grass was converted to crop liu et al 2008a pongratz et al 2006 and sakai et al 2004 also found that et decreased after conversion of forest to crop in the amazon river basin and in northeast china further liu et al 2008a suggested that the ratio of et to net radiation did not change significantly after grass conversion to crop li et al 2009 assessed the lccs impact on the surface hydrology of a small river basin in the loess plateau of china using the soil and water assessment tools swat model and found that the overall et increased by 4 mm from 1981 to 2000 due to all the lccs in the region deng et al 2015 simulated the et change due to lccs in heihe river basin hrb during 2000 2010 using the weather research and forecasting wrf model and found that the et in summer autumn and winter decreased after the conversion of grass to bare soil yuan et al 2017 found that the annual et increased by 13 32 mm year from 2001 to 2012 in xinjiang in china owing to the expansion of croplands sterling et al 2013 found that the global terrestrial et decreased by approximately 26 mm year 5 due to the global lccs accurately quantifying the impacts of lccs on et is challenging because of the variety and complexity of land covers the quality of input data and the limitations in et modelling algorithms and their validation in reproducing the ecohydrological responses to lccs previous research has reported contradictory results regarding the effects of lccs on et for example twine et al 2004 concluded that et is substantially decreased after the conversion of closed forest to crop while liu et al 2008a arrived at the opposite conclusion the main reasons for the differences in the conclusions may include the following three reasons the first is the difference in the land cover classification schemes which in most of the previous studies were relatively coarse for example the majority of the studies did not recognize the differences in grass types when simulating et however various grass types such as alpine grass meadow typical grass steppe and desert grass may cause large differences in among others lai surface albedo and phenology which may result in significant differences in et using coarse land cover classification schemes could lead to biased estimates in regional et the second reason is the difference in the input data e g atmospheric forcing data and soil texture data for example the quality and spatial resolution of the commonly used atmosphere forcing datasets such as the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 the national centers for environmental prediction ncep the national center for atmospheric research reanalysis ncar kalnay et al 1996 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the interim reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the princeton datasets sheffield et al 2006 may cause significant difference in et model results wang et al 2015b finally the third reason is the difference in the modelling algorithms and their validations different models can have largely different et modelling algorithms even for the process based and widely used land surface models large differences may exist these may include the one layer vs multi layer canopy models for canopy radiation absorption and stomatal conductance simulations one layer bucket vs multi layer numerical soil models for soil thermal and water simulations parameterized vs dynamic snow schemes carbon and nitrogen decoupled vs coupled canopy energy balance solutions implicit vs explicit plant water transfer models for root water uptake and plant water storage and transpiration simulations the differences in the modelling algorithms and their possible impacts on the et simulation have been examined in several model inter comparison studies boone et al 2009 hanson et al 2004 henderson sellers 1995 potter et al 2001 the land cover in arid regions of northwest china has been hugely altered in the past 40 years one of the dominant land cover conversion types was the desert to cropland conversion under the land reclamation practice the rapid oases expansion for agriculture have greatly increased the demand for water for irrigation and intensified the shortage of water resources in the region the hrb is a major river basin in northwest china the obvious consequence is that two terminal lakes in the lower reach namely the west juyan lake and east juyan lake dried out in 1961 and 1992 respectively this directly resulted in the substantial wilting of the tamarisk and euphratica forests posing a huge threat to the ecological security in the lower reach however information on the water loss from et due to the lccs over the region is very limited this study aims at filling this knowledge gap by quantifying the impacts of lccs on et in the hrb using the ealco model with rigorous calibrations a detailed land cover classification scheme and high spatial resolution atmospheric forcing data the results will provide support for making science informed water use policies and land use planning in the hrb 2 study area 2 1 the heihe river basin hrb located in northwest china fig 1 the hrb 97 6 e 101 58 e 37 44 n 42 44 n covers approximately 0 13 million km2 it is the second largest inland river basin in china three reaches up middle and low with different topography climate and plant category compose the whole watershed from south to north the upper reach in the southern mountainous area is dominated by alpine swamp alpine grass and spruce forest with an annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 800 mm and annual average temperature ranging from 1 5 to 2 0 c the potential et of the upper reach is approximately 770 mm the middle reach is under a semi arid climate with an annual rainfall of less than 200 mm and annual average temperature ranging from 2 8 to 7 6 c oases including impervious surface area cropland wetland and desert grass and deserts co exist in this region the potential et in this reach is approximately 990 mm the lower reach in the north is characterized by huge gobi and sand desert and small oases including impervious surface cropland desert grass tamarisk and euphratica at the end of the heihe river due to its extremely dry climate with annual rainfall of less than 50 mm li et al 2013 the annual average temperature in the lower reach is roughly the same as that in the middle reach while its potential et is much higher than that of the middle reach 1185 mm the bareground area i e sand and gobi deserts desert grass alpine grass cropland and forests account for approximately 67 6 15 5 9 5 4 4 and 1 of the entire hrb area respectively because of the very limited rainfall the oasis agricultural region in the middle reach heavily relies on water supply from heihe river chen et al 2018 however most of the heihe river water is exhausted by agriculture irrigation in the middle reach leaving very little water flowing into the lower reach for the vast desert grass in recent decades the water competition between the agriculture use in the middle reach and the ecosystem in the lower reach has become increasingly fiercer which significantly affected the local socio economic development and national water use strategies 2 2 measurement sites a total of nine sites distributed in the hrb with different land cover types were used to calibrate the ealco model fig 2 these nine sites were selected because they can generally represent all the land cover types in the hrb these sites are all installed with tower flux measurements using the eddy covariance ec technique the detailed site information and available data are provided in table 1 in summary there are three grass sites a rou dashalong and huazhaizi one crop site daman one wetland site shidi two bare ground sites bajitan and shenshawo one shrub site sidaoqiao and one deciduous broadleaf site huyanglin all the vegetation sites consist of c3 plants except the crop site which consists of c4 plants there are two five and two sites located in the upper middle and lower reaches respectively each site was installed with both automatic weather instruments and ec instruments supported by the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater project li et al 2013 3 data 3 1 land cover change lcc detailed land cover data is used to assign vegetation types and parameters related to the physiological processes in the ealco in this study land cover datasets with a spatial resolution of 30 m were retrieved from landsat images from 2000 to 2015 chen 2018 a classification scheme with a total of 14 classes i e evergreen conifer forest ecf deciduous conifer shrub dcs deciduous broadleaf forest dbf wetland alpine swamp as alpine grass ag desert grass dg c3 crop c4 crop impervious surface area isa bareground bg water body wb and permanent now and ice pni were considered for the entire hrb a hybrid decision tree classifier based on expert knowledge and land cover samples was applied for the two years classification a total of 316 samples derived from field surveys and google earth maps were used for validation the land cover product has an overall accuracy of 89 87 for all the classified classes and most land covers have a producer s or users accuracy of at least 85 all the land cover datasets were transformed into albers equal area aea projection and resampled to 1 km by using the majority algorithm the land cover change between 2000 and 2015 was analyzed by calculating the transition matrix table 2 3 2 atmosphere forcing the model forcing data includes eight meteorological variables downward short wave radiation downward long wave radiation air temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure and co2 concentration the first seven variables used for spatial modelling were obtained from the heihe plan science data center hpsdc http www heihedata org pan et al 2012 we used this dataset because it was produced specifically for hrb research this spatial dataset has fine temporal resolution an hourly time step and spatial resolution 0 05 latitude longitude and has been validated in several other studies hou and nan 2012 pan and li 2011 wu et al 2015 overall compared to other global or regional forcing datasets such as gldas rodell et al 2004 ncep ncar kalnay et al 1996 era interim dee et al 2011 and princeton data sheffield et al 2006 this product has been found to be more accurate in the hrb especially for precipitation measurements hou and nan 2012 the co2 concentration data was obtained from the co2 earth website https www co2 earth spatial variations of atmosphere s co2 concentration over the basin were not considered fig 3 a and b shows the annual average temperature and precipitation from 2000 to 2015 respectively 3 3 leaf area index lai the quality of the lai data is crucial in simulating et because it can largely affect the transpiration and leaf surficial evaporation an 8 day composite lai dataset from 2000 produced by liao et al 2013 and a 4 day composite lai dataset from 2015 produced by yin et al 2015 were used in this study the spatial resolution of both datasets is 1 km similar to the atmosphere forcing data we used these two lai datasets because they were produced specifically for hrb research although the quality of this satellite lai is high it could be still biased from the ground truth in some areas to further reduce the uncertainty from the lai we focused on key phenology stages i e leaf emerging green peaking and leaf senescence and the corresponding lais were adjusted close to the ground truth from heihe plan science data center http www heihedata org fig 3c specifically the dates of leaf emergence and senescence in the model were modified according to the time series of the lai using timesat packages jönsson and eklundh 2004 3 4 soil texture data the quality of the soil texture data is also important in et simulations because it can largely impact the hydraulic conductance which determines the transfer ability of the soil moisture in this study we used a local soil texture dataset 1 1 000 000 scale soil map fig 3d with fine spatial resolution obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences shi et al 2004 this soil texture data includes the percentage of sand silt and clay the soil bulk density and the content of soil organic matter which are the input data in the ealco model 3 5 flux the flux data used for model benchmarking see section 4 2 for the nine sites were downloaded from heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater at the heihe plan science data center http www heihedata org xu et al 2017 these data were measured using ec measurements csat3 from campbell scientific inc and li7500 from li cor fig 2 the data include wind direction wind speed m s friction wind speed m s sensible heat flux w m2 and latent heat flux w m2 all the data were previously processed and quality checked before release xu et al 2013 in summary the data processing includes three major steps first the raw records collected at a 10 hz sampling frequency from the ec were used to calculate the half hourly latent heat and sensible heat fluxes using the edire software package liu et al 2010 the processing includes spike detection lag correction of h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component sonic virtual temperature correction coordinating rotation using the planar fit method corrections for density fluctuation wpl correction and frequency response correction then the data obtained in the following conditions were rejected 1 sensor malfunction occurred 2 precipitation occurred 1 h before or after recording 3 the missing ratio was higher than 10 in the raw data within half hour or 4 the friction velocity was less than 0 2 m s during the night finally the rejected data were reconstructed by using the gap filled methods described in liu et al 2010 the corrected ec data can be downloaded from the hpsdc and have been widely used in previous studies liu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 xu et al 2013 xu et al 2017 4 model 4 1 the ealco model the ealco model is a physically based numerical model for simulating the ecological and hydrological processes of terrestrial ecosystems using in situ and remote sensing observations wang 2008 wang et al 2013 the model runs at half hourly time steps and includes five major modules for simulating land surface radiation transfer wang 2005 wang et al 2007 energy balance wang et al 2002a zhang et al 2008 water dynamics wang 2008 and carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles wang et al 2001 2002b the et in ealco is obtained by simulating its components of canopy transpiration evaporation or sublimation from intercepted rain snow dew or frost soil evaporation and snow sublimation at ground surface and evaporation from water surface e g water bodies see the supplementary materials for detailed et algorithms these simulations are conducted in the water module in which they are dynamically coupled with the other four modules in the ealco the ealco was used in this study because it has comprehensive algorithms for simulating the land surface water transfer processes which include the carbon and nitrogen coupled canopy et solutions root water uptake plant water storage soil water transfers and soil water groundwater interactions the ealco also includes comprehensive algorithms for simulating other et related ecosystem processes such as canopy radiation absorption which uses a multiple wavelengths multi layer canopy ray tracing scheme canopy stomatal conductance which is specifically optimized for arid regions wang et al 2009a b wang 2012 snow and soil processes which use dynamic layering schemes for temperature water and freeze thaw simulations zhang et al 2008 and carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles which affect the plant conditions for root water extraction and leaf transpiration the model fits well with our study region which has a large area with diverse climate and vegetation conditions the detailed modelling algorithms take the advantages of our detailed land cover and other in situ datasets for fine model calibrations the ealco model has been tested in a number of studies using the long term and intensive field measurements including the boreal ecosystem atmosphere study boreas study amthor et al 2001 potter et al 2001 the us walker branch throughfall displacement experiment tde and the ameriflux sites hanson et al 2004 the fluxnet canada research network fcrn sites grant et al 2005 2009 2006 the carbon flux studies of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in china mi et al 2010 and the rami4pilps suite of virtual experiments in which models were evaluated under perfectly controlled experimental conditions in order to eliminate uncertainties arising from an incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the canopy characteristics typical for model testing with in situ observations in particular the ealco model was tested using a new assumption centered model inter comparison approach in the free air co2 enrichment face model data synthesis project using the information gathered in two forest face experiments this new approach evaluated models against experimental data based on the hypothesis and ways in which they represent key ecological processes kauwe et al 2014 zaehle et al 2014 walker et al 2014 medlyn et al 2015 recent assessments of its et results can be found in wang et al 2014a b 2015a b the ealco has demonstrated its robustness in these tests and it provides confidence for its effective application in this study two major modifications in ealco were made in this study to better fit our research objectives first simulations of the default plant types found in the hrb were further specified into the corresponding subclasses for example the grass was divided into wetland alpine swamp alpine grass and desert grass crops were divided into c3 and c4 types the wetland alpine swamp alpine grass desert grass and c3 and c4 crops were recognized and simulated separately the plant parameters including the specific leaf area and tree density of these subclasses were specifically set for each type the plant phenology algorithm which was mainly based on the accumulated daily temperature was revised by using satellites lai observations the dates of leaf emergence and senescence were modified according to the time series of the lai observations 4 2 model parameterization calibration and performance assessment the ealco includes a large number of parameters representing soil and plant s physical and physiological characteristics wang et al 2002a in this study most of the plant and soil s parameter values for each site were determined using local measurements and field surveys when measurements were not available parameter values from other studies over this region were adopted three parameters i e the maximum capacity of rubisco to perform the carboxylase function the slope in the biochemical model of farquhar et al 1980 and the water table which play critical roles in simulating et and were adopted from wang 2008 were further fine tuned manually to achieve the best model performance in simulating measured fluxes i e net radiation sensible heat and latent heat specifically the fine tuning process includes 1 performing the simulation using the given value 2 comparing the three measured and simulated variables net radiation sensible heat and latent heat 3 assessing whether reasonable results have been obtained using the statistical methods the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to assess the model performance and were obtained as follows 1 r i 1 n e i e o i o i 1 n e i e 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 r m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 3 n s e 1 i 1 n e i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 b i a s i 1 n e i o i i 1 n o i 100 where o i and e i are the observed and simulated values respectively o and e are the mean observed value and the mean simulated value and n is the total number of validation records 4 if the results obtained from the statistical method are not reasonable adjusting the initial value within a certain range and 5 repeating the process until the best results have been obtained arnold et al 2012 after all the parameter values table 3 were determined for each plant and soil type the model was applied spatially to simulate regional et from 2000 to 2015 using the land covers mentioned in section 3 see section 4 3 for details 4 3 experimental design of spatial modelling a pair of simulations was designed to quantify the contributions of land cover change on et the simulations are termed lc2000 clim00 15 and lc2015 clim00 15 representing the et for the land cover in 2000 and 2015 under the same climate from 2000 to 2015 respectively to eliminate the impact of different climates the climate data was set to be same for both land cover statuses the lai from 2000 and 2015 were used for all the years in the simulation of lc2000 clim00 15 and lc2015 clim00 15 respectively therefore the et difference between this two simulations is solely due to the impacts of lccs on et in the hrb from 2000 to 2015 5 results 5 1 model performance in the hrb fig 4 and table 4 show the comparisons of the ealco simulated vs measured net radiation latent heat and sensible heat in all the nine sites the scatterplots in fig 4a indicate high correlations r 0 95 between simulated and observed net radiation in every site implying that the ealco can accurately simulate the radiation transfer process for all the land cover types found in the hrb this can be further evidenced by the high nse 0 86 low rmse lower than 35 w m2 in most sites and low bias in each site as shown in table 4 scatterplots of latent heat fig 4b and sensible heat fig 4c also indicate good correlations r 0 82 between the simulations and observations the high nse low rmse and low bias of latent and sensible heats in most of the sites shown in table 4 further demonstrate the good performance of the ealco on the simulation of water and heat transfer over the hrb 5 2 spatiotemporal variations of et in the hrb the daily temporal variations of et in all the sites indicate the three key factors in determining et namely the air temperature precipitation and lai fig 5 when the daily temperature is below 0 c the daily et is very small in all the sites thus sites with warmer climate generally have longer duration of et peak stages than those with a colder climate for example the peak duration of the daily et at the sd site wetland in the middle reach fig 5g is much longer than that at the ar site alpine grass in the upper reach fig 5a because the climate in the middle reach is much warmer than that in the upper reach the precipitation dominantly determines the daily et in non vegetation sites in the middle reach for example each spike of the daily et profiles at the bjt site gobi in the middle reach and ssw site sand desert in the middle reach is basically a direct response to rainfall events the lai directly determines the transpiration thus it largely controls the daily et in each vegetated site in the growing period the peak of the daily lai is generally correlated with the peak of the daily et in most of the vegetated sites it is worth noting that in some vegetation sites that have relatively low total water supply from precipitation such as the dm sd sdq and hyl the results also showed a high daily et in the growing season this is because these site have water supplies from other sources such as irrigation using surface water at the dm site ground water uptake by the deep roots of tamarix and euphratica at the sdq and hyl sites and the surface water storage at the sd wetland site a significant spatial heterogeneity of the annual et characterized by high values in the middle and upper reaches and low values in the lower reach is observed fig 6 a the spatial pattern of the annual et is closely related to the land cover types and climate conditions the et values in the upper reach range from 250 to 600 mm with higher et in the east and lower et in the west this is mainly because the annual precipitation is higher in the east than in the west fig 3a and the average temperature is approximately the same in the two regions fig 3b the spatial heterogeneity of et in the middle reach is very large ranging from less than 100 mm in bareground areas to 600 mm in crop dominated areas the spatial pattern of the et in the middle reach is highly correlated with land cover types similarly the annual et in the lower reach is well correlated with the land cover types to quantitatively compare the et among different land cover types over the hrb the average annual et of each land cover type was calculated fig 6b as expected among all the land cover types the water body has the highest average annual et 1357 mm followed by the wetland which has an average annual et of 923 mm the average annual et of the c4 crop 619 mm is slightly larger than that of the c3 crop 575 mm this is mainly caused by the climate conditions of the two crop types the c4 crop maize is mainly distributed in the middle reach while the c3 crop wheat is mainly planted in the upper middle reach and the temperature in the lower middle reach is higher than that in the upper middle reach fig 3b the average annual et of the alpine grass 543 mm is close to that of the deciduous forest mainly euphratica 515 mm the average annual et of the evergreen conifer forest spruce forest 340 mm is close to that of the deciduous conifer shrubs mainly tamarisk 358 mm the contributions of the annual et for these four land cover types are different mostly the precipitation for et consumption of alpine grass and evergreen conifer forest while more groundwater is up taken for the et consumption of the deciduous forest and deciduous conifer shrub due to the shorter phenology period caused by the lower temperatures the average annual et of the alpine swamp 448 mm is much lower than that of the alpine grass 543 mm the average annual et of the desert grass 248 mm is also much lower than the alpine grass one due to the much lower annual precipitation the average annual ets of the permanent snow and bareground are 366 and 87 mm respectively the impervious surface area has the lowest annual et 66 mm among all the land cover types fig 7 shows the average seasonal et of each land cover type in 2015 all the land cover types have the highest et in summer june july and august and the lowest average et in winter december january and february it is worth noting that the average et of each land cover type in spring march april and may is larger than that in autumn september october and november though the average temperatures in the two seasons are nearly the same this is mainly because most of the snow stored in the previous winter melted in spring leading to more available water for et consumption in spring than in autumn 5 3 contributions of lccs to et the spatial pattern of et changes indicates that the lccs had significant impacts on the et in the hrb during 2000 2015 fig 8 the spatial extent of the increased et is much larger than the area of decreased et eight major land cover change types caused an increase of et including conversions from desert grass to alpine grass approximately 98 mm and desert grass to alpine swamp approximately 64 mm in the upper reach bareground and desert grass to c4 crops approximately 420 and 426 mm respectively in the middle reach desert grass to c3 crops approximately 182 mm bareground to desert grass approximately 39 mm and bareground to water body approximately 1334 mm in the lower reach fig 9 it can be seen that the conversion from bareground to water body constitutes the largest increase in et approximately 1334 mm while the conversion from bareground to desert grass has the lowest increase in et approximately 39 mm fig 9 increased ets derived from conversions of desert grass to c4 crops and bareground to c4 crops are similar approximately 420 mm however the former is much higher than the et increase derived from the conversion of desert grass to c3 crops approximately 181 mm this is mainly attributed to the climate difference of these two crop distributions as mentioned above i e most c3 crops were planted in the upper reach where the climate is much colder than that in the middle reach where most c4 crops were planted the increased et from conversion of desert grass to alpine grass is higher than that from the conversion of desert grass to alpine swamp the reason is that the growing period of alpine grass is longer than that of the alpine swamp leading to a longer transpiration period for alpine grass another six conversions caused a decrease in et including that from alpine grass to desert grass approximately 212 mm bareground to isa approximately 28 mm desert grass to isa approximately 124 mm c4 crop to desert grass approximately 383 mm desert grass to bareground approximately 15 mm and c4 crop to isa approximately 597 mm fig 9 which is mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches the conversion from c4 crop to isa has the largest decrease of et approximately 567 mm while conversion from desert grass to bareground approximately 15 mm has the lowest increase of et fig 9 the et decrease from the conversion of desert grass to isa is larger than that from the conversion of bareground to isa and the yearly et of the desert grass is higher than that of the bareground fig 6 the seasonal variations of et changes derived from land cover conversions indicate that almost all the land cover conversions contributed to most of the et changes in summer except for the conversions of desert grass to bareground table 5 the contribution of et changes in spring is larger than those in autumn the winter et has the smallest contribution on et changes among the four seasons it is worth noting that not all the land cover conversion types have the same et change direction in all four seasons for example the conversion of desert grass to c3 crop caused an et decrease of 4 38 mm in autumn which is totally opposite to that in the other three seasons a possible reason is that c3 crops mainly wheat in the upper reach are generally harvested in september table 6 shows the total water consumption in terms of volume from et changes derived from each land cover conversion in the hrb between 2000 and 2015 approximately 1 03 billion m3 of increased water consumption resulted from all the land cover conversions although the conversion of desert grass to c4 crops did not contribute to the largest increase of the average et fig 9 it contributed to most of the total water consumption among all the land cover conversions reaching an increase of 3 87 billion m3 which accounts for 37 55 of the total change in water consumption conversion of bareground to desert grass also significantly contributed to the increased water consumption of 2 21 billion m3 because of its substantial converted area the conversion of bareground to water body has the third largest increase in total water consumption although it contributed to the largest increase of the average et fig 9 conversion of desert grass to alpine grass had the smallest increased in water consumption the largest decrease of water consumption occurred with the conversion of alpine grass to desert grass which was 1 51 billion m3 owing to the very small converted area conversion of bareground to isa contributed the least to the decrease in water consumption with only 0 02 billion m3 6 discussion energy and water change e g et runoff and soil moisture from lccs have been extensively investigated in many regions of the world due to the lack of available studies on et changes from lccs in the hrb studies on global regions and other regions with similar climate were selected for comparison with this study based on the ealco model the total et increase from lccs in this study is approximately 0 50 mm year from 2000 to 2015 which is more than two times lower than the result estimated in the xinjiang province in china by yuan et al 2017 who found an et increase of 1 11 mm year from 2001 to 2012 in contrast our result is more than two times higher than the result estimated in another heihe river catchment in the shanxi province in china by li et al 2009 who reported an et increase of 0 20 mm year from 1981 to 2000 compared to the global result estimated by sterling et al 2013 who found that the terrestrial et decreased by approximately 26 mm year due to the global lccs the et change from lccs in the hrb is rather small additionally it is worth noting that the directions of et change from lccs between these three arid regions and the global study are completely opposite in this study detailed land cover types were considered to improve the accuracy of the et simulations for example the general grass was further classified into wetland alpine grass alpine swamp and desert grass and the crop was further classified into c3 and c4 types a more physiologically based land surface model ealco was used to simulate ets the ealco includes sophisticated radiation transfer schemes carbon coupled energy balance and water transfer schemes grant et al 2006 hanson et al 2004 wang et al 2001 2002b 2007 widlowski et al 2015 and detailed soil and snow schemes for heat and water simulations and is therefore very suitable for this study area the study also took advantage of the relatively large number of flux measurement sites which enabled a rigorous model calibration for the major land cover types in the hrb uncertainties in the spatial modelling results could have been caused by the classification accuracy of the land cover types the quality of the model forcing data and the uncertainties in model parameterization and calibration process although the overall accuracy of the land cover classification is as high as almost 90 the misclassified classes from the omission and commission could still bring errors in both et simulations and basin scale assessment although a much finer land cover scheme was developed in this study uncertainty from our scheme still exists because the heterogeneity of the same land cover type in different pixels cannot be avoided land cover re sampling from high resolution to low resolution resulted in higher configuration heterogeneity thus affecting the et of each simulated grid the spatial forcing dataset used in this study has fine temporal resolution an hourly time step and spatial resolution 0 05 latitude longitude and is specially generated for ecological and land surface modelling in the hrb pan et al 2012 however the difference between this product and the real meteorological observations may also lead to uncertainties in the regional et the time periods of available field measurements at the 9 sites vary from 1 to 2 years these data were used for benchmarking the model during the model calibration phase i e fine tuning the values for the three parameter mentioned above due to the limitations of the field data no additional model tests were conducted all the flux measurements were used for benchmarking the model to maximize the potential of the limited field data in finding the best values for the three parameters so that the model could achieve the best performance and accuracy compared with the observations which increases the confidence in the following regional simulations obviously due to the limited time for observations it is not possible to evaluate the model under extreme climate conditions this needs to be addressed when more field data from the region are available although in previous studies the et changes from climate variability were found to be much larger than those from lccs in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2009 yuan et al 2017 maintaining the limited water resources through the alteration of climate at such large scales is much more difficult than doing it through the management of lccs a science informed land use planning is very important in the hrb due to the limited water supply and its high competition for food production in the middle reach and ecology security in the lower reach therefore an explicit investigation of et water consumption from crop expansion and desert grass recovering in the hrb is very critical based on the results from this study we found that et water consumption derived from crop expansion in 2000 2015 was 508 million m3 which is approximately three times larger than that from desert grass recovering 184 million m3 in other words et water consumption from crop expansion was approximately 359 000 m3 km2 while that from desert grass recovering was only 36 000 m3 km2 this implies that the water consumed per unit area by crop expansion in the middle reach can be used in recovering almost ten times the area of desert grass because the water consumption from crop expansion is much higher than that by desert grass we suggest that a stricter policy that limits the agriculture expansion in the middle reach be adopted in land use planning in order to sustain the ecosystems in the lower reach some planting areas might be suitable according to the results as follows 1 upper reach where alpine grass is located and the temperature is suitable for crops with crop resistance e g green barley 2 mountain bottoms in the transition between the evergreen conifer forest and the sand desert 3 middle reach near the river reservoirs or irrigation channels to reduce evaporation from exposed water 7 conclusions this study investigated the et effects derived from lccs in the hrb from 2000 to 2015 using the ealco model results show that all the lccs resulted in approximately 7 92 mm year of increased et the conversion of desert grass to c4 crop caused the largest increase in water consumption with 3 87 billion m3 while conversion of alpine grass to desert grass caused the lowest decrease with 1 51 billion m3 this increased water use for et largely intensified the water crisis in the hrb and deteriorated the health of the downstream ecosystems the results show that the water consumed by crop expansion can be used to recover almost ten times the area of the degraded desert grass ecosystem a stricter policy for limiting agriculture expansions should be adopted in future s land use planning for a sustainable ecosystem development in the basin this research will help better understand et changes from lccs and manage the limited water resources in the future s land and water allocations in arid regions acknowledgments this work was

6442,riparian zones adjacent to revetments as the last position of the entire riparian are the last barrier to intercept runoff nitrogen pollution they are also the areas where hyporheic exchange occurs when soil is submerged by river water revetments can be classified into impervious revetments and permeable revetments according to their permeability it has been realized that impervious revetments are not conducive to exchange between rivers and riparian zones tidal riparian zones undergo water level changes more frequently than normal riparian zones thus revetments in tidal riparian zones may have a greater impact on nitrogen cycling however the quantitative influence of revetment types on nitrogen removal in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones is not clear resulting in the lack of scientific support for the revetments construction removal of nitrogen from riparian zones primarily occurs through plant uptake microbial immobilization and denitrification however nitrogen will be released into soil again after plants die or microorganisms decompose while denitrification can completely remove nitrogen through transferring nitrate no3 into gaseous nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 in this study we used three revetment types permeable concrete pile revetments pr impervious masonry stone revetments ir and no revetments nr as examples to quantify the effects of revetment types on soil denitrification in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones at three distances from the revetments 0 3 m 0 6 m 1 0 m by measuring the soil 0 20 cm denitrification potential dp and

are conduits to both lakes and oceans excessive nitrogen in rivers has caused eutrophication in worldwide water bodies alexander et al 2000 woodward et al 2009 gal et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 as the

removal of nitrogen from riparian zones primarily occurs through plant uptake microbial immobilization and denitrification woodward et al 2009 death of plants and decomposition of microorganisms could both lead to the release of nitrogen into the soil while denitrification can completely remove nitrogen through transferring nitrate no3 into gaseous nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 fellows et al 2011 thus soil denitrification potential dp is an indicator commonly used to assess the ability to remove nitrogen in riparian zones philippot 2002 vidon and hill 2004 kandeler et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 woodward et al 2009 in addition n2o as a product of denitrification is a greenhouse gas and has also received a great deal of attention flechard et al 2007 signor and cerri 2013 wang et al 2014 ribeiro et al 2016 shaaban et al 2018 urbanization is accelerating worldwide resulting in the destruction of natural riverbanks seriously affecting ecological functions of riparian zones white and greer 2006 lewis and maslin 2015 in tidal urban areas with narrow riparian and high human disturbance it is necessary to construct revetments in riparian zones to prevent soil erosion because of hydraulic scouring rainfall tides and other factors revetments can be classified into impervious revetments and permeable revetments according to their permeability zhang 2003 it has been realized that the impervious revetments are not conducive to exchange between rivers and riparian zones wu et al 2007 tidal riparian zones undergo water level changes more frequently than normal riparian zones thus revetments in tidal riparian zones may have a greater impact on nitrogen cycling however the relationship between revetment types and soil denitrification in the tidal urban riparian zones is unclear resulting in the lack of scientific support for the revetments construction it may lead to a decline in the soil denitrification function and aggravate nitrogen pollution in rivers therefore it is of practical significance to study the effects of the revetment types on denitrification in the tidal urban riparian zones riparian zones adjacent to the revetments can be regarded as the last barrier to intercept runoff nitrogen pollution mckergow et al 2003 wang et al 2009 olley et al 2015 furthermore during the process of submerging the soil the hyporheic exchange happens in this area shrestha et al 2014 some studies have investigated the vegetation and hydrologic pulsing change denitrification community structure and affect the rate of denitrification in natural riparian zones rassam et al 2006 fellows et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 buzhdygan et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 ye et al 2017a ye et al 2017b in addition the revetment is an important factor changing the structures of riparian previous studies have focused more on the revetment itself and have demonstrated the purification functions of different revetment materials and the microbial community status of biofilms formed on the revetments guo et al 2006 wu et al 2007 xue et al 2008 wu 2011 tang et al 2017 however the quantitative influence of revetment types on soil denitrification in the adjacent tidal urban riparian ecosystem is still unclear shanghai the most developed city in china has a typical tidal river network the total length of river is 21646 29 km with nitrogen pollution zuo et al 2009 tn concentration in some rivers exceeds the minimum standard of grade v in the environmental quality standard for surface water of china gb3838 2002 zhang 2018 the river network is mainly affected by tides of the east china sea in shanghai impervious revetments commonly used are masonry stone revetments and concrete retaining walls while common permeable revetments include gabion banks stone revetment banks wooden pile revetments imitation wooden pile revetments and ecological concrete revetments zuo et al 2009 this study used the permeable concrete pile revetments pr the impervious masonry stone revetments ir and no revetments nr as examples to study the effects of different revetment types on soil denitrification in riparian zones by analyzing the basic soil physicochemical properties the denitrification potential dp and the n2o production rates n2or the results of this study can be used to guide the construction of revetments in tidal urban riparian zones there were three main objectives in this study 1 to quantify the positive or negative influence of the revetment types on denitrification in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones 2 to reveal main influence factors on soil denitrification caused by different revetment types and 3 to identify a better revetment type for improving the denitrification of the tidal urban riparian zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description the sample sites of the selected pr ir and nr fig 1 are located in the minhang district of the danshui river shanghai which has a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual rainfall in shanghai is about 1200 mm and about 50 of the annual rainfall is concentrated from june to september according to relevant data provided by the water affairs bureau of the minhang district and field surveys during the sampling period the river level h1 varies from 2 45 m to 3 10 m when the river level exceeds 3 0 m it submerges the revetments and the flooding does not generally last for more than 48 h due to rainfall upstream water and tides the daily river level fluctuation during the sampling period is 0 16 0 51 m d 1 the sample sites are chosen relatively closed to each other to ensure the consistency of the water level fluctuation frequency riparian slope and river quality after the riparian zones are constructed the vegetation is less affected by human activities the riparian zones are 10 15 m wide and the vegetation is mainly artificially planted willows toon heather shrubs and some herbaceous species the pr is made of concrete while the ir is made of stone filled mortar the pr and ir are vertical to the river and the nr is almost vertical fig 1d e f both pr and ir have been built over ten years the ir is 1 5 m deep and 0 3 m wide the pr is 1 5 2 0 m deep and 0 2 m wide and there is a 1 2 cm gap between wooden stakes due to soil erosion plants find it difficult to grow in the riparian zones adjacent to nr the height h2 between the sampling point and the high river level is 7 10 cm in riparian zones adjacent to three revetments fig 2 b the width of riparian zones submerged by the high river level ranges from 1 2 to 1 5 m therefore tidal riparian zones with a width of 1 m were targeted in this study considering high curb adjacent to the road in upper riparian zones road surface runoff pollution cannot enter the riparian zones in addition no aquatic plants grow in river the effects of aquatic plants and external runoff pollution can be neglected 2 2 field sampling from march 20th to april 20th 2018 the river was sampled every 10 days the river quality results are shown in table 1 the river ph was between 7 47 and 8 07 with an average of 7 71 the average values of total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were 3 69 mg l 1 0 37 mg l 1 and 2 07 mg l 1 respectively the minimum total organic carbon toc content was 7 63 mg l 1 and the maximum was 8 97 mg l 1 with an average of 8 33 mg l 1 based on these five parameters tn concentration exceeded the minimum standard of grade v in the environmental quality standard for surface water of china gb3838 2002 soil samples 0 20 cm were collected three times on april 7th 10th and 14th following a weeklong rain free period at the sampling sites we set up 3 plots 20 m 1 m each for each revetment type to collect soil samples every 20 m using a 6 5 cm diameter auger fig 2a at each plot 3 replicate soil samples were collected every 10 m at 0 3 m 0 6 m 1 0 m away from the revetments fig 2a b respectively a total of 81 soil samples 27 for each type were collected for three revetments after sampling three replicate soil samples mixed and homogenized to form a composite sample part of each sample was air dried to determine the soil physicochemical properties and part of each fresh sample was refrigerated at 4 c for the denitrification culture 2 3 soil dp and n2or soil dp reflects the maximum denitrification capacity of samples during indoor culture n2o as a product of denitrification is a greenhouse gas and soil n2or reflects the maximum n2o production rates of samples during indoor culture liu et al 2016 the soil dp was determined using the acetylene inhibition technique liu et al 2016 with slight modifications briefly 10 g of fresh soil was placed in a 50 ml culture bottle with 20 ml of incubation solution final concentrations 1 0 g l 1 chloramphenicol 0 1 g l 1 potassium nitrate 0 18 g l 1 glucose all of the bottles were sealed and purged with n2 gas for 3 min to create anaerobic conditions and acetylene gas was added to a final concentration of 10 v v in the headspace the bottles were incubated in the dark for 24 h at 23 25 c room temperature the soil n2or was determined using a similar procedure but without the addition of acetylene n2o concentration was monitored before and after the reaction using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890n agilent technologies inc usa equipped with an electron capture detector the dp and n2or were analyzed using the similar equation 1 n 1 1000 δ c v tm 2 n 2 δ c v tm where n1 and n2 are the dp mg kg 1h 1 and n2or ug kg 1h 1 respectively δc is the change in the concentration of n2o gas before and after the 24 h culture μg l 1 v is the gas volume in the incubation bottle ml t is the incubation time h m is the dry weight of the soil g 2 4 soil physicochemical properties in the laboratory the soil ph and electrical conductivity were measured in a fresh soil to water ratio of 1 5 using a ph meter and a conductivity meter respectively the soil bulk density was measured by weighing 100 cm3 of fresh soil after drying overnight at 105 c liu et al 2018 the water filled pore space wfps synonymous with the relative saturation was calculated using the method of aulakh et al 2001 the soil samples were air dried and sieved 2 mm before the next analysis nh4 n and no3 n were measured using an automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer smartchem200 alliance company french in preparation for this analysis a 15 g of soil sample was extracted by shaking with 100 ml of 2 moll 1 kcl for 1 h ye et al 2017a the sand 0 02 2 0 mm clay 0 002 mm and silt 0 002 0 02 mm contents were measured using a hydrometer the soil organic carbon soc and tn were determined using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh germany 2 5 statistical analyses the normality of all of the data was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov s test before statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was conducted repeatedly to test the statistical significance of the revetment types and the distances on the soil physicochemical properties dp and n2or the pearson correlation analyses was performed to correlate the soil dp and n2or with the soil physicochemical properties all of these processes were performed using spss 17 0 structural equation modeling sem is a method of establishing estimating and testing causality models the model contains both observable explicit variables and implicit variables that cannot be directly observed sem was used to further examine the effects of revetment types on the riparian dp and n2or we first developed a conceptual model fig 3 based on the existing literature inwood et al 2007 hopfensperger 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and ecological principles we used the results from pearson correlation analysis to select the promising explanatory variables to include in the sem models prior to the path analysis principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the variable number of soil texture sand clay and silt contents the chi square χ2 test comparative fit index cfi and standardized root mean square residual srmr were used to evaluate the overall fit of the sem models an insignificant χ2 statistic p 0 05 a cfi value 0 9 and srmr value 0 08 indicated that the sem models fit the data well inwood et al 2007 hopfensperger 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 the path coefficients r squared direct and indirect effects and model fit parameters were calculated in stata version 14 0 3 results 3 1 soil dp and n2or as shown in fig 4 soil dp and n2or in the distance of 0 3 1 0 m were influenced by revetment types significantly p 0 01 the soil dp and n2or in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the pr were significantly higher than those adjacent to the ir and nr the average soil dp adjacent to the pr 0 97 0 07 mg kg 1h 1 was 4 22 and 3 03 times higher than those adjacent to the ir 0 23 0 04 mg kg 1h 1 and nr 0 32 0 06 mg kg 1h 1 respectively the horizontal distances affected on soil dp and n2or significantly p 0 05 overall the farther away from the river the lower the soil dp and the higher the soil n2or in tidal urban riparian zones 3 2 soil physical properties revetment types significantly affected soil texture sand clay and silt contents electrical conductivity wfps and bulk density p 0 05 fig 5 the sand contents of the soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the nr were significantly higher than those adjacent to the pr and ir while the clay and silt contents of the soil adjacent to the ir were higher than those adjacent to the nr and pr the horizontal distances had a significant effect on the sand clay silt contents electrical conductivity wfps and bulk density p 0 05 the farther away from the riparian zones the lower the soil wfps and the wfps at 0 3 m was higher than that at 1 0 m 3 3 soil chemical properties as shown in fig 6 that revetment types had a significant impact on the soil ph nh4 n no3 n tn soc and soc tn p 0 05 in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones the ph soc and tn in riparian zones adjacent to the pr were significantly higher than those adjacent to the ir and nr the order of the soc in riparian zones was as follows pr 10 51 1 39 g kg 1 nr 8 44 1 17 g kg 1 ir 7 55 0 65 g kg 1 the horizontal distances only had a significant effect on the soc p 0 01 the closer was the sample to river the higher was the soc in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones 3 4 relationship between soil dp n2or and soil physicochemical properties soil dp and n2or were both positively associated with ph no3 n tn and soc table 2 in the dp model χ2 1 850 p 0 174 cfi 0 989 srmr 0 034 fig 7 a soc r 0 162 had the strongest total effects on soil dp table 3 for the model of n2or χ2 1 850 p 0 174 cfi 0 987 srmr 0 034 fig 7b both soil texture r 0 876 wfps r 0 296 and soc r 0 543 were significant explanatory variables for the n2or soil no3 n had an insignificant effect on dp r 0 037 and n2or r 0 026 respectively although soil texture could regulate the soil dp and n2or both directly and indirectly fig 4 the indirect effects were considerably higher than the direct effects mediated through changes in wfps and soc table 3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of revetment types on soil dp denitrification requires a suitable ph range and nitrogen availability and soc can provide more substrate and energy for denitrifying bacteria which promotes denitrification wang et al 2009 fellows et al 2011 xiong et al 2015 in this study according to the pearson correlation analysis table 2 ph nh4 n no3 n tn and soc showed significant positive correlations with the soil dp p 0 05 and soc had the strongest total effects on the soil dp fig 7a and table 3 these findings are consistent with previous studies indicating that soil properties can affect denitrification and soc can promote denitrification hayakawa et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 ye et al 2017a b liu et al 2018 in the range of 0 3 1 0 m soil denitrification at 0 3 m was significantly higher than it at 1 0 m p 0 05 fig 3a the probable main reason for these differences was that the soc in the adjacent riparian zones was higher at 0 3 m than that at 1 0 m fig 6e compared with the natural riparian zones nr pr significantly improved while ir significantly inhibited soil denitrification in the adjacent riparian zones p 0 05 fig 3a the probable main reasons were that compared with the nr soc and nitrogen in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the pr were significantly higher while those adjacent to the ir were significantly lower fig 6d e these differences could be explained from three aspects 1 the pr and nr can provide more hyporheic exchange than the ir in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones the hyporheic exchange is conducive to the denitrification process roley et al 2012 hester et al 2018 no external runoff pollution was found in sample areas and material exchange between riparian zones and rivers was the primary result of hydraulic gradient generated by changed river level the no3 n tn and toc of the river water were high table 1 during high river levels water suspended and dissolved materials and organisms are exchanged laterally between the river and soil in riparian zones junk 1989 shrestha et al 2014 gomez velez et al 2015 in tidal riparian zones the water level fluctuates frequently and the ir impedes normal hyporheic exchange reducing the chance of obtaining soil nitrogen and organic carbon from river our results also indicated that soil nh4 n no3 n and soc were lowest in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the ir fig 6b c e the closer to the river more frequent was the exchange and higher was the soc as indicated by our results that the soc in the adjacent riparian zones was higher at 0 3 m than that at 1 0 m fig 6e 2 another factor was soil texture due to hydrological erosion soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the nr had a higher sand contents and lower clay and silt contents than those adjacent to the pr fig 5a b c studies have shown that the higher the clay contents the stronger the soil adsorption capacity jha et al 2010 xiong et al 2015 paz ferreiro et al 2018 thus in the hyporheic exchange process the soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the pr had higher soc compared to those adjacent to the nr 3 the third factor was plants some herbaceous plant species grow in riparian zones adjacent to pr and ir fig 1d e due to serious soil erosion the soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to nr was basically bare and had almost no plants growth fig 1f the presence of plants could increase the soc syversen 2005 booth and stark 2005 cheng et al 2010 therefore soils in riparian zones adjacent to pr had the highest soc meanwhile soc would be lower if no vegetation is established in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to ir as a result the soil dp in the riparian zones adjacent to the pr was higher than those adjacent to the ir and nr and soil dp at 0 3 m was higher than at both 0 6 m and 1 0 m in this study different soil properties caused by revetment types accounted for the differences in soil denitrification soc was a main direct chemical factor and soil texture was a main indirect physical factor 4 2 effect of revetment types on soil n2or the revetment types had a significant effect on soil n2or in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones p 0 01 fig 4b in the range of 0 3 1 0 m soil n2or in the riparian zones adjacent to pr was significantly higher than those adjacent to ir and nr the soil n2or was not significantly different in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to nr and ir at both 0 3 and 0 6 m but the soil n2or adjacent to nr was significantly higher than ir at 1 0 m according to the pearson correlation analysis table 2 ph no3 n tn and soc showed significant positive correlations with the soil n2or while wfps showed significant negative correlations with soil n2or p 0 05 and soc and wfps had significantly stronger total effects on the soil n2or fig 7b and table 3 the main reasons for these differences were identified 1 soc soc can provide more substrate and energy for denitrifying bacteria which promotes denitrification n2o is one of the products of denitrification higher dp is beneficial to increase n2or morley et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in the range of 0 3 1 0 m the soil dp in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to pr were significantly higher than ir and nr fig 4a so the soil n2or in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to pr were significantly higher than ir and nr 2 soil wfps in the process of nitrate conversion n2o is only an intermediate product of denitrification and the final product is n2 the process involves many microbial reactions and there are many influencing factors skiba and smith 2000 flechard et al 2007 morley et al 2008 signor and cerri 2013 wang et al 2014 the higher the wfps is the more favorable it is to form an anaerobic environment which promotes denitrification hedin et al 1998 ranalli and macalady 2010 diem et al 2013 however the maximum of soil n2or generally occurs in soil with wfps of 60 to 80 when the wfps is greater than 80 as the wfps increases the structure of the denitrifying bacteria changes and the diffusion and solubility of the n2o in the soil increases the n2 content increases and the ratio of n2o n2o n2 decreases smith 2003 elmi et al 2005 chapuis lardy et al 2007 fowler et al 2009 case et al 2012 in this study according to tables 2 3 and fig 7b the wfps was significantly effects on soil n2or p 0 01 as shown fig 5f soil wfps adjacent to nr and ir were close to 80 at 0 3 0 6 m but soil wfps adjacent to nr was 73 86 1 15 at 1 0 m while the soil wfps adjacent to ir was still up to 84 36 2 07 it was not conducive to n2o production thus the soil n2or in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to nr was not significantly higher than ir at 0 3 0 6 m but the soil n2or adjacent to nr was significantly higher than ir at 1 0 m 5 conclusions the results in this study indicated that the revetment types had a significant effect on soil denitrification in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones compared with the natural riparian zones nr pr significantly improved while ir significantly inhibited soil denitrification different soil properties caused by revetment types accounted for the differences in soil denitrification soc was the main direct chemical factor and soil texture was the main indirect physical factor soil dp decreased with increasing distances while n2or increased with increasing distances which was primarily caused by differences in the soil wfps based on these results revetments construction did not necessarily inhibit soil denitrification in natural riparian zones and priority should be given to building permeable revetments to increase soil denitrification of tidal urban riparian ecosystem especially given the current serious nitrogen pollution of rivers

6442,riparian zones adjacent to revetments as the last position of the entire riparian are the last barrier to intercept runoff nitrogen pollution they are also the areas where hyporheic exchange occurs when soil is submerged by river water revetments can be classified into impervious revetments and permeable revetments according to their permeability it has been realized that impervious revetments are not conducive to exchange between rivers and riparian zones tidal riparian zones undergo water level changes more frequently than normal riparian zones thus revetments in tidal riparian zones may have a greater impact on nitrogen cycling however the quantitative influence of revetment types on nitrogen removal in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones is not clear resulting in the lack of scientific support for the revetments construction removal of nitrogen from riparian zones primarily occurs through plant uptake microbial immobilization and denitrification however nitrogen will be released into soil again after plants die or microorganisms decompose while denitrification can completely remove nitrogen through transferring nitrate no3 into gaseous nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 in this study we used three revetment types permeable concrete pile revetments pr impervious masonry stone revetments ir and no revetments nr as examples to quantify the effects of

significantly inhibited it 0 23 0 04 mg kg 1h 1 in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones p 0 01 changes in soil properties caused by revetment types accounted for the differences in soil

both lead to the release of nitrogen into the soil while denitrification can completely remove nitrogen through transferring nitrate no3 into gaseous nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 fellows et al 2011 thus soil denitrification potential dp is an indicator commonly used to assess the ability to remove nitrogen in riparian zones philippot 2002 vidon and hill 2004 kandeler et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 woodward et al 2009 in addition n2o as a product of denitrification is a greenhouse gas and has also received a great deal of attention flechard et al 2007 signor and cerri 2013 wang et al 2014 ribeiro et al 2016 shaaban et al 2018 urbanization is accelerating worldwide resulting in the destruction of natural riverbanks seriously affecting ecological functions of riparian zones white and greer 2006 lewis and maslin 2015 in tidal urban areas with narrow riparian and high human disturbance it is necessary to construct revetments in riparian zones to prevent soil erosion because of hydraulic scouring rainfall tides and other factors revetments can be classified into impervious revetments and permeable revetments according to their permeability zhang 2003 it has been realized that the impervious revetments are not conducive to exchange between rivers and riparian zones wu et al 2007 tidal riparian zones undergo water level changes more frequently than normal riparian zones thus revetments in tidal riparian zones may have a greater impact on nitrogen cycling however the relationship between revetment types and soil denitrification in the tidal urban riparian zones is unclear resulting in the lack of scientific support for the revetments construction it may lead to a decline in the soil denitrification function and aggravate nitrogen pollution in rivers therefore it is of practical significance to study the effects of the revetment types on denitrification in the tidal urban riparian zones riparian zones adjacent to the revetments can be regarded as the last barrier to intercept runoff nitrogen pollution mckergow et al 2003 wang et al 2009 olley et al 2015 furthermore during the process of submerging the soil the hyporheic exchange happens in this area shrestha et al 2014 some studies have investigated the vegetation and hydrologic pulsing change denitrification community structure and affect the rate of denitrification in natural riparian zones rassam et al 2006 fellows et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 buzhdygan et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 ye et al 2017a ye et al 2017b in addition the revetment is an important factor changing the structures of riparian previous studies have focused more on the revetment itself and have demonstrated the purification functions of different revetment materials and the microbial community status of biofilms formed on the revetments guo et al 2006 wu et al 2007 xue et al 2008 wu 2011 tang et al 2017 however the quantitative influence of revetment types on soil denitrification in the adjacent tidal urban riparian ecosystem is still unclear shanghai the most developed city in china has a typical tidal river network the total length of river is 21646 29 km with nitrogen pollution zuo et al 2009 tn concentration in some rivers exceeds the minimum standard of grade v in the environmental quality standard for surface water of china gb3838 2002 zhang 2018 the river network is mainly affected by tides of the east china sea in shanghai impervious revetments commonly used are masonry stone revetments and concrete retaining walls while common permeable revetments include gabion banks stone revetment banks wooden pile revetments imitation wooden pile revetments and ecological concrete revetments zuo et al 2009 this study used the permeable concrete pile revetments pr the impervious masonry stone revetments ir and no revetments nr as examples to study the effects of different revetment types on soil denitrification in riparian zones by analyzing the basic soil physicochemical properties the denitrification potential dp and the n2o production rates n2or the results of this study can be used to guide the construction of revetments in tidal urban riparian zones there were three main objectives in this study 1 to quantify the positive or negative influence of the revetment types on denitrification in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones 2 to reveal main influence factors on soil denitrification caused by different revetment types and 3 to identify a better revetment type for improving the denitrification of the tidal urban riparian zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description the sample sites of the selected pr ir and nr fig 1 are located in the minhang district of the danshui river shanghai which has a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual rainfall in shanghai is about 1200 mm and about 50 of the annual rainfall is concentrated from june to september according to relevant data provided by the water affairs bureau of the minhang district and field surveys during the sampling period the river level h1 varies from 2 45 m to 3 10 m when the river level exceeds 3 0 m it submerges the revetments and the flooding does not generally last for more than 48 h due to rainfall upstream water and tides the daily river level fluctuation during the sampling period is 0 16 0 51 m d 1 the sample sites are chosen relatively closed to each other to ensure the consistency of the water level fluctuation frequency riparian slope and river quality after the riparian zones are constructed the vegetation is less affected by human activities the riparian zones are 10 15 m wide and the vegetation is mainly artificially planted willows toon heather shrubs and some herbaceous species the pr is made of concrete while the ir is made of stone filled mortar the pr and ir are vertical to the river and the nr is almost vertical fig 1d e f both pr and ir have been built over ten years the ir is 1 5 m deep and 0 3 m wide the pr is 1 5 2 0 m deep and 0 2 m wide and there is a 1 2 cm gap between wooden stakes due to soil erosion plants find it difficult to grow in the riparian zones adjacent to nr the height h2 between the sampling point and the high river level is 7 10 cm in riparian zones adjacent to three revetments fig 2 b the width of riparian zones submerged by the high river level ranges from 1 2 to 1 5 m therefore tidal riparian zones with a width of 1 m were targeted in this study considering high curb adjacent to the road in upper riparian zones road surface runoff pollution cannot enter the riparian zones in addition no aquatic plants grow in river the effects of aquatic plants and external runoff pollution can be neglected 2 2 field sampling from march 20th to april 20th 2018 the river was sampled every 10 days the river quality results are shown in table 1 the river ph was between 7 47 and 8 07 with an average of 7 71 the average values of total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were 3 69 mg l 1 0 37 mg l 1 and 2 07 mg l 1 respectively the minimum total organic carbon toc content was 7 63 mg l 1 and the maximum was 8 97 mg l 1 with an average of 8 33 mg l 1 based on these five parameters tn concentration exceeded the minimum standard of grade v in the environmental quality standard for surface water of china gb3838 2002 soil samples 0 20 cm were collected three times on april 7th 10th and 14th following a weeklong rain free period at the sampling sites we set up 3 plots 20 m 1 m each for each revetment type to collect soil samples every 20 m using a 6 5 cm diameter auger fig 2a at each plot 3 replicate soil samples were collected every 10 m at 0 3 m 0 6 m 1 0 m away from the revetments fig 2a b respectively a total of 81 soil samples 27 for each type were collected for three revetments after sampling three replicate soil samples mixed and homogenized to form a composite sample part of each sample was air dried to determine the soil physicochemical properties and part of each fresh sample was refrigerated at 4 c for the denitrification culture 2 3 soil dp and n2or soil dp reflects the maximum denitrification capacity of samples during indoor culture n2o as a product of denitrification is a greenhouse gas and soil n2or reflects the maximum n2o production rates of samples during indoor culture liu et al 2016 the soil dp was determined using the acetylene inhibition technique liu et al 2016 with slight modifications briefly 10 g of fresh soil was placed in a 50 ml culture bottle with 20 ml of incubation solution final concentrations 1 0 g l 1 chloramphenicol 0 1 g l 1 potassium nitrate 0 18 g l 1 glucose all of the bottles were sealed and purged with n2 gas for 3 min to create anaerobic conditions and acetylene gas was added to a final concentration of 10 v v in the headspace the bottles were incubated in the dark for 24 h at 23 25 c room temperature the soil n2or was determined using a similar procedure but without the addition of acetylene n2o concentration was monitored before and after the reaction using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890n agilent technologies inc usa equipped with an electron capture detector the dp and n2or were analyzed using the similar equation 1 n 1 1000 δ c v tm 2 n 2 δ c v tm where n1 and n2 are the dp mg kg 1h 1 and n2or ug kg 1h 1 respectively δc is the change in the concentration of n2o gas before and after the 24 h culture μg l 1 v is the gas volume in the incubation bottle ml t is the incubation time h m is the dry weight of the soil g 2 4 soil physicochemical properties in the laboratory the soil ph and electrical conductivity were measured in a fresh soil to water ratio of 1 5 using a ph meter and a conductivity meter respectively the soil bulk density was measured by weighing 100 cm3 of fresh soil after drying overnight at 105 c liu et al 2018 the water filled pore space wfps synonymous with the relative saturation was calculated using the method of aulakh et al 2001 the soil samples were air dried and sieved 2 mm before the next analysis nh4 n and no3 n were measured using an automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer smartchem200 alliance company french in preparation for this analysis a 15 g of soil sample was extracted by shaking with 100 ml of 2 moll 1 kcl for 1 h ye et al 2017a the sand 0 02 2 0 mm clay 0 002 mm and silt 0 002 0 02 mm contents were measured using a hydrometer the soil organic carbon soc and tn were determined using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh germany 2 5 statistical analyses the normality of all of the data was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov s test before statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was conducted repeatedly to test the statistical significance of the revetment types and the distances on the soil physicochemical properties dp and n2or the pearson correlation analyses was performed to correlate the soil dp and n2or with the soil physicochemical properties all of these processes were performed using spss 17 0 structural equation modeling sem is a method of establishing estimating and testing causality models the model contains both observable explicit variables and implicit variables that cannot be directly observed sem was used to further examine the effects of revetment types on the riparian dp and n2or we first developed a conceptual model fig 3 based on the existing literature inwood et al 2007 hopfensperger 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and ecological principles we used the results from pearson correlation analysis to select the promising explanatory variables to include in the sem models prior to the path analysis principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the variable number of soil texture sand clay and silt contents the chi square χ2 test comparative fit index cfi and standardized root mean square residual srmr were used to evaluate the overall fit of the sem models an insignificant χ2 statistic p 0 05 a cfi value 0 9 and srmr value 0 08 indicated that the sem models fit the data well inwood et al 2007 hopfensperger 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 the path coefficients r squared direct and indirect effects and model fit parameters were calculated in stata version 14 0 3 results 3 1 soil dp and n2or as shown in fig 4 soil dp and n2or in the distance of 0 3 1 0 m were influenced by revetment types significantly p 0 01 the soil dp and n2or in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the pr were significantly higher than those adjacent to the ir and nr the average soil dp adjacent to the pr 0 97 0 07 mg kg 1h 1 was 4 22 and 3 03 times higher than those adjacent to the ir 0 23 0 04 mg kg 1h 1 and nr 0 32 0 06 mg kg 1h 1 respectively the horizontal distances affected on soil dp and n2or significantly p 0 05 overall the farther away from the river the lower the soil dp and the higher the soil n2or in tidal urban riparian zones 3 2 soil physical properties revetment types significantly affected soil texture sand clay and silt contents electrical conductivity wfps and bulk density p 0 05 fig 5 the sand contents of the soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the nr were significantly higher than those adjacent to the pr and ir while the clay and silt contents of the soil adjacent to the ir were higher than those adjacent to the nr and pr the horizontal distances had a significant effect on the sand clay silt contents electrical conductivity wfps and bulk density p 0 05 the farther away from the riparian zones the lower the soil wfps and the wfps at 0 3 m was higher than that at 1 0 m 3 3 soil chemical properties as shown in fig 6 that revetment types had a significant impact on the soil ph nh4 n no3 n tn soc and soc tn p 0 05 in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones the ph soc and tn in riparian zones adjacent to the pr were significantly higher than those adjacent to the ir and nr the order of the soc in riparian zones was as follows pr 10 51 1 39 g kg 1 nr 8 44 1 17 g kg 1 ir 7 55 0 65 g kg 1 the horizontal distances only had a significant effect on the soc p 0 01 the closer was the sample to river the higher was the soc in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones 3 4 relationship between soil dp n2or and soil physicochemical properties soil dp and n2or were both positively associated with ph no3 n tn and soc table 2 in the dp model χ2 1 850 p 0 174 cfi 0 989 srmr 0 034 fig 7 a soc r 0 162 had the strongest total effects on soil dp table 3 for the model of n2or χ2 1 850 p 0 174 cfi 0 987 srmr 0 034 fig 7b both soil texture r 0 876 wfps r 0 296 and soc r 0 543 were significant explanatory variables for the n2or soil no3 n had an insignificant effect on dp r 0 037 and n2or r 0 026 respectively although soil texture could regulate the soil dp and n2or both directly and indirectly fig 4 the indirect effects were considerably higher than the direct effects mediated through changes in wfps and soc table 3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of revetment types on soil dp denitrification requires a suitable ph range and nitrogen availability and soc can provide more substrate and energy for denitrifying bacteria which promotes denitrification wang et al 2009 fellows et al 2011 xiong et al 2015 in this study according to the pearson correlation analysis table 2 ph nh4 n no3 n tn and soc showed significant positive correlations with the soil dp p 0 05 and soc had the strongest total effects on the soil dp fig 7a and table 3 these findings are consistent with previous studies indicating that soil properties can affect denitrification and soc can promote denitrification hayakawa et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 ye et al 2017a b liu et al 2018 in the range of 0 3 1 0 m soil denitrification at 0 3 m was significantly higher than it at 1 0 m p 0 05 fig 3a the probable main reason for these differences was that the soc in the adjacent riparian zones was higher at 0 3 m than that at 1 0 m fig 6e compared with the natural riparian zones nr pr significantly improved while ir significantly inhibited soil denitrification in the adjacent riparian zones p 0 05 fig 3a the probable main reasons were that compared with the nr soc and nitrogen in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the pr were significantly higher while those adjacent to the ir were significantly lower fig 6d e these differences could be explained from three aspects 1 the pr and nr can provide more hyporheic exchange than the ir in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones the hyporheic exchange is conducive to the denitrification process roley et al 2012 hester et al 2018 no external runoff pollution was found in sample areas and material exchange between riparian zones and rivers was the primary result of hydraulic gradient generated by changed river level the no3 n tn and toc of the river water were high table 1 during high river levels water suspended and dissolved materials and organisms are exchanged laterally between the river and soil in riparian zones junk 1989 shrestha et al 2014 gomez velez et al 2015 in tidal riparian zones the water level fluctuates frequently and the ir impedes normal hyporheic exchange reducing the chance of obtaining soil nitrogen and organic carbon from river our results also indicated that soil nh4 n no3 n and soc were lowest in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the ir fig 6b c e the closer to the river more frequent was the exchange and higher was the soc as indicated by our results that the soc in the adjacent riparian zones was higher at 0 3 m than that at 1 0 m fig 6e 2 another factor was soil texture due to hydrological erosion soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the nr had a higher sand contents and lower clay and silt contents than those adjacent to the pr fig 5a b c studies have shown that the higher the clay contents the stronger the soil adsorption capacity jha et al 2010 xiong et al 2015 paz ferreiro et al 2018 thus in the hyporheic exchange process the soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to the pr had higher soc compared to those adjacent to the nr 3 the third factor was plants some herbaceous plant species grow in riparian zones adjacent to pr and ir fig 1d e due to serious soil erosion the soil in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to nr was basically bare and had almost no plants growth fig 1f the presence of plants could increase the soc syversen 2005 booth and stark 2005 cheng et al 2010 therefore soils in riparian zones adjacent to pr had the highest soc meanwhile soc would be lower if no vegetation is established in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to ir as a result the soil dp in the riparian zones adjacent to the pr was higher than those adjacent to the ir and nr and soil dp at 0 3 m was higher than at both 0 6 m and 1 0 m in this study different soil properties caused by revetment types accounted for the differences in soil denitrification soc was a main direct chemical factor and soil texture was a main indirect physical factor 4 2 effect of revetment types on soil n2or the revetment types had a significant effect on soil n2or in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones p 0 01 fig 4b in the range of 0 3 1 0 m soil n2or in the riparian zones adjacent to pr was significantly higher than those adjacent to ir and nr the soil n2or was not significantly different in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to nr and ir at both 0 3 and 0 6 m but the soil n2or adjacent to nr was significantly higher than ir at 1 0 m according to the pearson correlation analysis table 2 ph no3 n tn and soc showed significant positive correlations with the soil n2or while wfps showed significant negative correlations with soil n2or p 0 05 and soc and wfps had significantly stronger total effects on the soil n2or fig 7b and table 3 the main reasons for these differences were identified 1 soc soc can provide more substrate and energy for denitrifying bacteria which promotes denitrification n2o is one of the products of denitrification higher dp is beneficial to increase n2or morley et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in the range of 0 3 1 0 m the soil dp in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to pr were significantly higher than ir and nr fig 4a so the soil n2or in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to pr were significantly higher than ir and nr 2 soil wfps in the process of nitrate conversion n2o is only an intermediate product of denitrification and the final product is n2 the process involves many microbial reactions and there are many influencing factors skiba and smith 2000 flechard et al 2007 morley et al 2008 signor and cerri 2013 wang et al 2014 the higher the wfps is the more favorable it is to form an anaerobic environment which promotes denitrification hedin et al 1998 ranalli and macalady 2010 diem et al 2013 however the maximum of soil n2or generally occurs in soil with wfps of 60 to 80 when the wfps is greater than 80 as the wfps increases the structure of the denitrifying bacteria changes and the diffusion and solubility of the n2o in the soil increases the n2 content increases and the ratio of n2o n2o n2 decreases smith 2003 elmi et al 2005 chapuis lardy et al 2007 fowler et al 2009 case et al 2012 in this study according to tables 2 3 and fig 7b the wfps was significantly effects on soil n2or p 0 01 as shown fig 5f soil wfps adjacent to nr and ir were close to 80 at 0 3 0 6 m but soil wfps adjacent to nr was 73 86 1 15 at 1 0 m while the soil wfps adjacent to ir was still up to 84 36 2 07 it was not conducive to n2o production thus the soil n2or in the tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to nr was not significantly higher than ir at 0 3 0 6 m but the soil n2or adjacent to nr was significantly higher than ir at 1 0 m 5 conclusions the results in this study indicated that the revetment types had a significant effect on soil denitrification in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones compared with the natural riparian zones nr pr significantly improved while ir significantly inhibited soil denitrification different soil properties caused by revetment types accounted for the differences in soil denitrification soc was the main direct chemical factor and soil texture was the main indirect physical factor soil dp decreased with increasing distances while n2or increased with increasing distances which was primarily caused by differences in the soil wfps based on these results revetments construction did not necessarily inhibit soil denitrification in natural riparian zones and priority should be given to building permeable revetments to increase soil denitrification of tidal urban riparian ecosystem especially given the current serious nitrogen pollution of rivers

6443,quantifying vertical flows in long screened or open wells is essential for their reliable use in all types of groundwater investigations in ambient conditions a flow profile shows the producing receiving zones of head driven flow the relative vertical head gradient in the aquifer system and potential bias in chemistry samples a flow profile while pumping can be used to quantify aquifer heterogeneity and the sampled water mixtures this paper describes a novel approach to a single well tracer test to quantify the flow regime in a pumped well which is unique in its utility over a wide range of discharge rates during constant pumping a tracer is injected at the opposite end of the well and as it is drawn towards the pump the tracer is diluted in proportion to each inflow a dilution model using the advection dispersion equation is used to visually fit a flow profile that explains all tracer profiles pre injection transient phase and steady state results compare favourably to borehole em flowmeter data particularly if tracer density issues are correctly interpreted and head loss in the flowmeter is avoided a dimensionless froude number is provided to assist both with understanding and minimising the role of free convection when planning all types of in well tracer tests involving a density contrast like the flowmeter this method is particularly suited to screened wells where packers are ineffective used together or separately in existing wells these in well methods can provide considerable information on aquifer well hydraulics without the cost of additional drilling keywords borehole flow tracer dilution single well method long screened well open borehole well 1 introduction installation of wells or piezometers for groundwater investigations is expensive particularly in remote areas so the economical approach is to use available infrastructure where possible however wells designed for purposes such as water production have much longer screened or open intervals than those for collecting data from discrete depths this means that traditional methods average hydraulic properties water levels and chemistry over an unhelpfully large interval of the aquifer system although straddle packers can be used to obtain depth specific data they rely on isolating specific intervals of the well this is not possible if bypass flow occurs in the gravel pack around the screen or between the packer and an uneven borehole wall in such situations it can be more effective to maintain the well as the path of lowest hydraulic resistance and work with the in well flow regime in both ambient un pumped and pumped conditions specifically this approach enables the vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity and head to be derived e g day lewis et al 2011 sawdey and reeve 2012 and water samples to be properly interpreted e g poulsen et al 2018 borehole flowmeters are established and commercially available geophysical tools for measuring in well flow profiles they are relatively efficient to operate and can be used in ambient and pumped conditions there are three types of flowmeter newhouse et al 2005 young and pearson 1995 heat pulse mainly suited to low flows electromagnetic em suited to a wide range of flows and the impeller spinner best suited to higher flows these wireline instruments measure fluid velocity past a sensor as function of depth in the well in stationary or trolling mode tracer dilution tests within a well can be used instead of or complementary to a borehole flowmeter to improve resolution of in well flows with multiple lines of evidence for ambient conditions and low pumping rates a tracer is introduced to the fluid column in the well uniformly or at a point or the entire water column is replaced then successive tracer profiles in the well over time show the moving front of inflowing aquifer water displacing and or diluting the tracer evolution of the tracer profile over time can be converted into borehole flow using a mass balance paillet 2012 or the advection dispersion equation in a spreadsheet model maurice et al 2011 or a numerical code doughty and tsang 2005 for higher pumping rates when there is a shorter residence time of water in the well a tracer pulse test can be used goldrath et al 2015 izbicki et al 1999 or the constant rate tracer dilution approach reported here the tracer pulse test is time consuming because for each point measurement of in well flow rate the tracer must travel from the injection point to the sensor at the surface and many point measurements are required to generate a flow profile in comparison this constant rate tracer dilution method is more efficient because it requires little more than a single tracer travel time from injection point to the pump aside from the tracer pulse test the objective of existing single well pumped tracer tests were mainly to characterise individual fractures in low yield bedrock wells with weak ambient flow regimes e g brainerd and robbins 2004 chlebica and robbins 2013 libby and robbins 2014 tsang et al 1990 transient methods are problematic in high yield wells because a slug test would recover far too quickly for tracer profiles to be measured a low pumping rate would cause insufficient drawdown to overcome ambient flows while a high pumping rate may flush the single fluid column of tracer out of the well before multiple concentration profiles can be collected and a strong ambient flow regime would complicate the uniform emplacement of tracer in the water column in the first place in contrast our constant rate method is suited to high yield wells and particularly situations where a higher pumping rate is needed to overcome ambient flows and generate inflow from all aquifer zones intersected in this paper we present a combined field and numerical method that is unique in its efficacy and applicability over a wide range of pumping rates in both screened and open borehole wells a constant rate approach with simultaneous pumping and injection of tracer is used in a similar manner to brainerd and robbins 2004 however we use common salt as the tracer instead of a dye due to its availability and ease of measurement and collect continuous fluid column electrical conductivity logs before and during the transient phase of the test and at steady state analysis using the advection dispersion equation enables flow rate to be quantified at all depths in the well field data from two high yield long screened wells and an open borehole well are used to demonstrate the utility of the method we compare the results with borehole em flowmeter data from the same wells at similar pumping rates and provide some important considerations for the use of both methods 2 theory at a pumping rate sufficient to overcome the ambient flow regime see section 8 4 a well can be conceptualised as a linear network with monotonically increasing flow in one direction fig 1 a analogous to a gaining river water enters the well according to the hydraulic conductivity and head distribution in the surrounding aquifer and the hydraulic stress induced by pumping if a tracer is injected continually at a constant rate near the distal end of the well it is drawn towards the pump and diluted in proportion to each of the inflows movement of the tracer front during the initial transient phase indicates velocity in the well and its shape is determined by the degree of dispersion mixing and aquifer inflows once the tracer has reached the pump a steady state situation arises where there is no further change in the tracer concentration profile assuming that all fluxes are constant and dispersion becomes insignificant which is a key advantage of this approach at this point the shape of the tracer concentration profile fig 1 b is primarily determined by the distribution of inflows from the aquifer and with or without the transient profiles it can be inverted to give the inflow profile by quantifying the tracer mass balance to each element in the network fig 1 c and d flow velocities along the length of a well range from zero to the applied pumping rate with increases resulting from lateral inflows from the aquifer flow varies across the well diameter according to the type of flow regime from a minimum at its wall to a maximum at its centre we considered it impractical to explicitly quantify the full flow velocity field so we made some simplifying choices to model tracer dilution in a well 1 we neglect radial variations in flow velocity and solute concentration and simply consider the averages at each depth 2 we assume that the advection dispersion equation commonly used for porous media is a reasonable approximation of transport in a well over the range of flows we encountered mostly laminar tending to turbulent 3 we approximate dispersion as the product of average velocity a dispersivity constant and diffusion eq 2 and 4 we assume monotonically increasing flow between the injection point and the pump on this basis the rate of change of mass in the well with depth z and time t is expressed with a one dimensional form of the advection dispersion equation maurice et al 2011 1 a c z t t q z c z t z a z d z c z t z q i c i where a is the cross sectional area of the well l2 q is flow rate in the well l3 l t qi is the groundwater inflow rate l3 l t c and ci are the concentrations in the well and the groundwater inflow respectively z is the vertical position in the well l and dz is the dispersion coefficient l2 t by adjusting qici at each depth to fit the measured c z profile the inflow profile to the well can be obtained for the known pumping rate tracer injection rate and tracer concentration since qi and ci are both unknowns this method is limited to situations where ci z 0 where ci z is assumed to equal the concentration of pumped discharge from the well or where ci z can be estimated for each inflowing zone the shape of the tracer front is governed by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient 2 d z α v z d m where α is the dispersivity l vz is the average flow velocity l t and dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t this form of the advection dispersion equation is appropriate when dispersivity is constant in laminar flow conditions dispersivity is reduced in turbulent flow because eddies and random motion homogenise the flow velocities hart et al 2013 in addition to dispersion a certain distance along the well is required for complete mixing of flow with tracer at the injection point and with each inflow from the aquifer this mixing length is much shorter in turbulent flow than in laminar flow an example from the water treatment industry gives a mixing length of 10 times the pipe diameter where chlorine is introduced mid stream in turbulent pipe flow pizzi 2009 p186 this translates to a length of 2 m for the 0 2 m diameter wells used in this work although flows are usually laminar in the vicinity of the tracer injection point lateral inflow from the aquifer causes small eddies and enhances tracer mixing martin hayden et al 2014 martin hayden and wolfe 2000 for pipe flow the type of

flow above 0 95 m min 30 l min where a tracer test involves fluids with contrasting density e g different salinity tracer movement occurs by two mechanisms forced convection and free convection ataie ashtiani et al 2018 forced convection is due to an external pressure gradient e g pumping or the natural head difference between depths of the aquifer system connected by the well and is often referred to as advection whereas free convection is the buoyant fluid movement driven by a density contrast if there is a density contrast between the tracer and water in the well free convection may affect tracer mixing and initial transport in the case of a dense tracer injected into an upward flow regime the mixing zone may extend below the injection point to a depth depending on the strength of the pumping induced flow relative to the density contrast van sommeren et al 2013 the assisting or opposing effect of free convention in tracer transport is not explicitly included in our model but we do explore and discuss ways to assess its role in the test a characteristic of dilution is that the change in concentration is relative to the concentration difference between the two fluids so the change of tracer concentration in the well for equal aquifer inflow becomes exponentially less as dilution progresses if the concentration of aquifer inflow is constant thus the method is sensitive to small inflows only when tracer concentration is increased significantly above background over the entire tested interval of the well to help choose an appropriate tracer concentration the maximum extent of dilution expected in pumped discharge cpss is given with a simple steady state mass balance 4 c pss q inj c inj c p 0 q p c p 0 where qinj is the tracer injection rate l3 t qp is the pumping rate l3 t cinj is the undiluted tracer concentration and cp0 is the tracer concentration of pumped water before the test which is readily measured tracer concentrations can be in units of m l3 or an analogue such as electrical conductivity siemens l 3 site description the method was initially tested in an open borehole well in the fractured bedrock of the adelaide hills south australia it was then applied in two long screened wells in the remote pilbara region of western australia with one providing a relatively straightforward example and the other illustrating a more challenging situation table 1 gives details of these three wells 3 1 adelaide hills well 6628 21204 is one of several wells installed in fractured adelaidean sedimentary rock at a research site near the town of balhannah in the western mount lofty ranges harrington et al 2004 the aquifer media is compact laminated metasiltstone tending to sandstone with quartzite in places and groundwater flowing exclusively in fractures a borehole camera was used to establish that this 0 204 m diameter well is uncased below 6 m and it appears to be open to near the full drilled depth of 55 7 m timber steel debris lodged below 53 7 m the borehole is generally competent but the wall is variably rough and enlarged in places airlift yield at the time of drilling was recorded at 1 9 l s in our testing pumping rates of up to 0 2 l s induced about 2 m drawdown in the well with a pumping water level of 12 m this well had a 43 7 m effective open interval 3 2 pilbara the pilbara is known for its globally significant iron ore deposits which are mined in open pits and for its unique natural environment including groundwater dependent ecosystems rojas et al 2018 the competing interests of maintaining dry mining conditions dewatering and maintaining groundwater levels to support surface ecosystems are driving research to characterise groundwater ages and recharge rates in the region s aquifers e g cook et al 2017 mccallum et al 2017 however virtually all available wells have long screens designed to maximise discharge capacity or to monitor overall responses to dewatering this means that pumped samples are a mixture of groundwater from a wide range of depths which limits the utility of any chemical analyses thus the purpose of applying this method of measuring in well flows in the pilbara is to enable better informed sampling by quantifying specific inflow zones the two test wells lhrp4 and wb11ah001 used in this work are in the hope downs area of the southern hamersley basin they were installed as supply wells for railway construction and as such they are remote from the mining areas and they have been disused for several years well lhrp4 is screened in variably weathered and fractured dolomite of the wittenoom formation and the overlying gravelly detrital sediments a borehole camera was used to establish that the pvc casing of this 0 195 m diameter well is machine slotted below 66 m and although a total depth of 144 m was originally logged it is now silted up to 142 m giving a 78 m long screened interval gravel pack is recorded for the entire borehole annulus except for a cemented surface collar with telescoping hole diameters of 0 45 m 3 70 m 0 32 m 70 134 m and 0 27 m 134 144 m a previous aquifer test indicates the well has a high transmissivity 12 900 m2 d and it was pumped at 25 l s with 2 6 m drawdown aquaterra 2007 in our tests pumping rates of up to 1 l s induced up to 0 09 m drawdown well wb11ah001 is in a particularly complex geological setting with logged material ranging from clayey gravel to gravel and then fault gouge with depth the latter containing fragments of crystalline dolomite shale banded iron formation and chert a borehole camera was used to establish that the pvc casing of this 0 203 m diameter well was machine slotted below 35 2 m and the total open depth of 142 8 m gave a 107 6 m long screened interval gravel pack is recorded for the entire borehole annulus consistently 0 3 m diameter except for a 2 m bentonite seal above the screen 24 26 m and a cemented surface collar a previous aquifer test gave transmissivity in the range 2690 6360 m2 d with pumping at 25 l s and just 0 64 m drawdown aquaterra 2011 in our tests pumping rates of up to 0 85 l s induced up to 0 04 m drawdown 4 field methods as illustrated in fig 1 a this test involves collecting a sequence of tracer profiles in the well while simultaneously pumping from one end of the screen and injecting tracer at the other end in each case the test was repeated with the pumping and injection locations reversed to provide a check on the uniqueness of the interpreted flow profile and to assess whether the test worked better in one orientation than the other due to the distribution of inflows this resulted in the six tests summarised in table 1 electrical conductivity ec as specific conductance at 25 c was used as the tracer with sodium chloride cooking salt without anti caking agent used to create the tracer solution as others have shown e g tsang et al 1990 ec is linearly related to salt concentration in water at relatively dilute concentrations ec 7 ms cm so we used it directly in our inversion model as an analogue for concentration with the focus being on relative differences the initial tracer ec and pumped discharge ec were measured with a calibrated field meter wtw model multi 3420 accuracy 0 5 of measured value ec profiles were recorded with a multi parameter sonde ysi model 600xlm deep depth accuracy 0 3 m ec accuracy 0 5 of reading lowered and raised using a hand operated winch the sonde recorded ec and pressure depth at one second intervals giving measurements with a median spacing of 0 1 0 2 m throughout the water column trolling in the downward direction was preferable because the ec sensor located on the bottom of the instrument was first to contact undisturbed water in the upward direction passage of the instrument body 0 042 m diameter 0 54 m length ahead of the sensor caused a smearing effect in the ec profiles ideally the tracer measuring instruments should be calibrated together here the difference between the surface meter reading of pumped discharge and the flow weighted average of background ec determined from the tracer profiles was subtracted from the profiles to bring them into line with the meter reading field logistics dictated a manageable volume of tracer solution so the tracer injection rates were a small percentage 0 8 6 1 of the pumping discharge rates with the low volume injection relatively high tracer concentrations 17 40 ms cm were used so that dilution was measurable throughout the test intervals initial mixing in the well rapidly reduced ec to more dilute levels after measuring the standing water level an ambient ec profile was collected before the well was disturbed by pumping then the ¼ inch nylon tracer injection tubing and submersible pump grundfos model mp1 or sqen3 were placed near the top or bottom of the well depending on the orientation of the test pumping commenced 10 66 3 l min and while water level drawdown was stabilising 10 60 min the tracer solution was prepared in a 200 l drum using aquifer water and pre mixed salt concentrate before starting the test one or more ec profiles were collected during pumping to establish the initial conditions the test began when tracer entered the well at the injection point which occurred once the injection tube filled with tracer a few minutes after the injection pump started tracer was injected at a constant low rate 0 51 0 61 l min using a peristaltic pump pegasus model athena a diffuser consisting of a short length 0 15 m of perforated pipe with an end cap was used to help direct the tracer radially into the well the diffuser was not centralised so the well s vertical alignment was probably the main control on the position of the tracer injection point and the ec sonde each time it was lowered and raised during the test regular ec profiles were collected and downloaded from the sonde to give real time tracking of tracer migration in the well and to assess when the steady state condition was reached later checked with model simulations regular measurements of injection rate and pumping rate volume time method and ec of pumped discharge were also made the test was complete when the tracer had reached the pump ec in pumped discharge had stabilised and successive tracer profiles had the same shape 4 1 borehole flowmeter vertical flow measurements were made with a borehole em flowmeter century geophysical llc model 9721 in well lhrp4 and well wb11ah001 and historical data were obtained for well 6628 21204 for comparison with the pumped tracer dilution test results in all cases the instrument was used in stationary mode at regular intervals while the well was being pumped at a similar rate to that used in the tracer dilution test ambient flow profiles were also collected according to the manufacturer the response range for the flowmeter is 0 05 40 l min with an accuracy of 0 02 l min the product description also indicates when using the tool to measure low velocity flow rates a rubber skirt is attached to the outside of the sensor to block off the bore hole and force the fluid to pass through the 1 in diameter opening inside the sensor coil when measuring faster flow rates the rubber skirt is typically removed and the tool is run in either the static station or dynamic mode we include this statement because it has a strong bearing on the results we used such a rubber skirt flow diverter in all profiles and maintained flow through the sensor below the stated upper end of the response range 40 l min for example on well lhrp4 flow through the sensor was limited to 29 l min when pumping at 50 l min by using an under sized flow diverter 0 188 m compared to the well diameter 0 195 m however according to arnold and molz 2000 head loss across the meter becomes significant when flow through the sensor exceeds 10 l min see discussion for details at each well a two point calibration procedure was used with the instrument positioned in the water column above the top of the screen in ambient conditions this comprised a stationary zero point followed by trolling the instrument at a known rate and using the well diameter to calculate flow rate through the sensor in pumped conditions the second point was recalibrated to the known pumping rate with the instrument held stationary because the calibrations were done with the flow diverter in place any bypass flow was built in assuming the well diameter remained constant 5 numerical methods to quantify the vertical profile of flow in the well the measured tracer profiles were modelled with a finite element formulation of the one dimensional advection dispersion equation eq 1 the well was discretised into a network of nodes and elements e g fig 1 c and aquifer inflows were visually identified in the tracer dilution profiles at the resolution of the node spacing grid convergence was achieved with node spacing of 0 05 m which was near the minimum numerically practical spacing for solution time this fine discretisation was necessary to represent strong gradients of tracer concentration particularly around the injection point according to the peclet number constraint node spacing did not exceed the dispersivity length so that dispersion characteristics of the model were not unduly affected discrete inflows can be assigned to individual elements or inflow zones can span many elements with the proportion of total inflow distributed evenly over the zone tracer injection and pumped discharge were assigned per element so the fluxes were split between two nodes when the pump was placed below the injection point an adjusted cross sectional area of the well was used in the model given by subtracting the pump hose cross sectional area from that of the well the area of the injection hose was negligible the laplace transform galerkin method sudicky 1989 was used to generate a time continuous solution for the measured pre test transient and steady state tracer profiles simultaneously this was advantageous because the collection time for each profile i e the time taken to troll the length of the well 10 min was non negligible relative to flow velocities in the well 2 m min the time continuous solution was inverted back to real time values using the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm at the time of each measurement in the tracer profiles the laplace transform provides a time continuous solution so the usual courant number constraint that solute mass must not move more than the node spacing per time step was unnecessary the model was implemented as a python class and a graphical user interface was developed to assist with the iterative fitting process a best fit of the modelled tracer concentration profiles to their measured equivalents was achieved by manually adjusting the fraction of discharge and background tracer concentration for each inflow zone the background tracer concentrations in aquifer inflows were estimated by including the pre test tracer profile obtained while pumping the well but before commencing tracer injection in the model fitting process dispersivity was adjusted to fit the shape of the tracer dilution front in the transient profiles for all simulations dispersion included molecular diffusion at a rate of 9 7 10 8 m2 min a value appropriate for sodium chloride in water cook and herczeg 2000 the field steady state tracer concentration profile was verified theoretically by modelling a profile at a large time 1440 min compared to the test duration 420 min 6 results the three field examples illustrate the general utility and some challenges of the method in both open borehole wells and long screened wells in a range of hydrogeological situations table 1 provides summary information including ambient flow rates and pumping induced drawdown for each test fig 2 shows the ec of pumped discharge from each well before and during the tests mainly to help interpret the results in all cases the composite background ec is clearly identified first horizontal line when this was used in eq 4 with the applied pumping and tracer injection rates we could estimate the expected steady state concentration of discharge second horizontal line deviations from these predictions are explained in each case the time elapsed between first arrival of tracer at the pump and the observed steady state concentration indicates the effect of dispersion and this is also seen as the s shaped curve in the transient tracer profiles presented below in figs 3 4 and 6 panels a and c show the tracer profiles these look different for each orientation of the test because of the different position of the injection and pumping locations with respect to the inflows to the well while panels b and d give the interpreted inflow zones and resulting flow profiles for direct comparison with each other and with the flowmeter data shown in panel e in theory these three independent interpretations of the inflows should be identical while the resulting flow profiles are cumulative in the direction of flow so they depend on the position of the pump in the well 6 1 well 6628 21204 in the first test fig 3 c a downward flow regime was created by placing the pump at 45 m and tracer was injected at 20 m to provide opportunity for enough flow from above to drive transport the tracer profiles showed a large concentration increase at the injection point and slow downward transport indicating a small fraction of flow was sourced from above the pump and even less from above the injection point first tracer arrival at the pump occurred after 183 min but concentration was still approaching the predicted steady state by the end of the day fig 2 a this is consistent with the modelling fig 3 c which indicated the last measured concentration profile was short of the theoretical steady state profile the test in the reverse orientation fig 3 a clearly showed that the majority of inflow was from below the injection point at 50 m there was large dilution at the injection point and rapid transport of the tracer to the pump with first arrival at 113 min and steady state a short time later fig 2 a the best fits of the model to each dataset show similar flow distributions with 72 and 67 of flow from the lower zone 50 55 7 m for the tests with injection at the top and bottom respectively fig 3 b and d the good agreement between the dilution tests and the em flowmeter data fig 3 e suggests that the main features of the flow profile are correctly identified in fitting the model to the measured data dispersivity was unexpectedly found to differ by an order of magnitude between the two tracer tests despite flows in both tests being laminar re 100 1000 a dispersivity of 0 5 m was obtained with tracer injection at the top when flow rates in the tested interval were slow 0 04 0 09 m min this large value is clearly manifest in the ec of pumped discharge fig 2a with a very disperse tracer front the time between first arrival and steady state concentration being 53 of the total test duration in the reverse direction with faster flow rates in the tested interval 0 25 0 34 m min the best fit dispersivity was 0 05 m and the time between first arrival and steady state was just 16 of the test duration the exact reason for this difference in dispersivity is unclear but we note that this bedrock well had very rough walls so perhaps the effect of wall roughness on dispersivity is actually non negligible in laminar flows e g gloss and herwig 2010 and tracer transport was impeded more in the slower flow regime particularly if the injection point was against the borehole wall 6 2 well lhrp4 in the first test on lhrp4 tracer injection was at 139 m the pump was above the screen and pumping induced in well flow rates were up to 1 48 m min tracer arrival at the surface took 75 min and steady state was established after 96 min fig 2 b with the difference being 22 of the test duration the amount of dilution was much more than expected at the applied pumping rate fig 2 b and the measured ec profiles clearly show loss of tracer into a stagnant zone below the injection point fig 4 a this discrepancy was due to free convection of tracer in the slow upward flow 0 17 m min at the injection point in fitting the dilution model the only way to match both the moving tracer front in the transient phase and the steady state profile was to assign an effective injection rate less than the actual injection rate a good model fit was achieved with an effective injection rate of 0 31 l min travelling upwards giving 0 25 l min of tracer lost to density convection over the duration of the test to steady state this loss rate is consistent with the amount of tracer mass required to generate the observed concentrations below the injection point in contrast with injection at the top the pump placed at 139 m and pumping induced in well flow rates up to 1 87 m min it took slightly longer for tracer to arrive at the surface 92 min and to establish steady state conditions 118 min but the proportion of the test duration was the same 22 and the amount of dilution was as expected fig 2 b the steady state tracer profiles in both orientations fig 4 a and c clearly show two producing zones separated by an interval with no inflow the interpreted flow profiles fig 4 b and d have very similar inflow zones generally consistent with those identified in the em flowmeter data fig 4 e however the proportions of inflow were different with the tracer tests indicating more flow from the lower zone 71 80 than the flowmeter 51 59 estimated dispersivity was 0 2 and 0 1 m for the downward and upward flow regimes respectively the difference between the two is likely due to differing flow regimes through the middle part of this well that is flow in the downward direction 19 l min was laminar to transitional whereas flow in the upward direction 39 l min was above the turbulent threshold 30 l min turbulence homogenises flow velocities and causes turbulent diffusion which reduces dispersivity intraborehole flow in this well was a complicating factor in the first test borehole flowmeter data collected in ambient conditions showed downwards head driven flow from the upper aquifer zone into the lower zone data not shown so ec in the well prior to pumping was dominated by the upper zone whereas during pumping from above the screen ec in the well was that of water drawn upwards from the lower zone however the water produced from the lower zone was actually in part the intraborehole flow plume i e water from the upper zone until such time as the plume was purged in analysing the data from the first tracer test we identified that the upper zone had an ec of approximately 0 12 ms cm higher than the lower zone this manifested in the tracer test in three distinct stages indicated by the numbering on fig 5 1 there was an initial period during pumping prior to starting the test where ec in the well decreased as water from the lower zone was drawn upwards replacing the water from the upper zone this is shown in fig 5 a by the difference in the profiles at 20 min and 0 min 2 after the transient phase of the test once the tracer had reached the pump theory dictates that the tracer profile should remain steady which should have occurred at around the 102 min profile fig 5 a prior to this time inflow from the lower zone was of consistent ec note 39 59 79 and 102 min profiles plotting over each other at approximately 1 25 ms cm interpreted to be from the intraborehole flow plume 3 but rather than remaining steady in the 102 min position the profile then shifted leftwards on fig 5 b starting with a decrease at the lower inflow zone which propagated upwards until a steady state was reached with multiple identical profiles obtained 255 288 and 318 min fig 5 b this is interpreted to be the period during which there was a decreasing fraction of intraborehole flow plume water inflowing to the well before the plume was fully purged 176 min profile but it wasn t until the consistent ec of native groundwater had travelled the length of the well that a stable tracer profile was established 255 min profile on completing this test pumping continued 67 l min 139 m maximum pump insertion depth for 20 min after tracer injection ceased to remove as much of the tracer as possible ahead of the next test with injection and pumping in reverse positions the next day prior to starting the test pumping continued for 138 min 67 l min 139 m and multiple ec profiles were collected to confirm a stable initial ec profile this stable profile cyan curve in fig 5 a is similar to the pre injection profile used for analysis of the first test it also shows residual high concentration of tracer in the bottom of the well even after considerable purging this together with the high ec at the injection point 139 m indicates very little flow from beneath and places the base of the lower producing zone at approximately 140 m the dataset used in the tracer dilution analysis of the first test fig 4 a is essentially that shown in fig 5 a except that the 102 min profile was replaced with the 318 min profile as shown by the arrows in fig 5 b because it provided better resolution of the inflow features the test also relies on a stable background tracer concentration so we estimated this from the parts of the transient profiles where the tracer front had not yet reached as indicated by the dashed profile 0 min in fig 5 a with the first test showing the majority of tracer dilution was caused by inflow from the lower zone it seemed clear that a lesser proportion of inflow was sourced from the upper zone thus the tracer would travel more slowly downward through the test interval when the pump was placed at the bottom so the second test was done at a higher pumping rate 66 3 l min to ensure it could be completed in a day the injection point was at a similar depth as the top of screen 66 m and the smaller tracer spike 6 5 ms cm indicates immediate inflow at this depth presence of tracer above the injection point fig 4 c is attributed to repeated upward passage of the ec sonde which dragged tracer into the stagnant zone above the screen integration of tracer mass associated with this concentration increase above the screen gave 2 9 of total mass lost so an effective injection rate of 0 54 l min was used in model fitting to account for this loss at all other points in the well this mechanical dispersion effect was overwhelmed by advection 6 3 well wb11ah001 applying the tracer dilution test in well wb11ah001 was problematic because of the low proportion of inflow sourced from below about 60 m and the strong head driven intraborehole flow regime that was not overcome by pumping however the em flowmeter readily measured the in well flow regimes in ambient and pumped conditions so these results are described first to illustrate the situation fig 6 e an interesting feature of the ambient flow regime is that upward and downward flow occurred simultaneously over different intervals specifically upward flow of 3 7 l min was produced from a zone between 85 and 105 m and exited the well near the top of the screen meanwhile downward flow of 7 9 l min occurred in the zone between 110 and 125 m this downward flow regime continued when the well was pumped from above the screen at the maximum achievable rate 45 l min yield to the pump was mainly sourced from above 60 m with a small portion from 68 to 71 m 2 and 85 105 m 12 to test the finding of downward flow below 105 m during pumping tracer was injected at 110 m fig 6 a 1st injection the tracer indeed travelled downwards however when the injection point was raised to 90 m the same downward transport occurred at a point where the flowmeter data indicate slow up flow of around 0 12 m min the injection point was then raised to 70 m and downward transport again occurred with evidence of a small component of upward transport flowmeter up flow of 0 19 m min finally the injection point was raised to 60 m and tracer travelled upwards to the pump flowmeter up flow of 0 22 m min at 62 m and 0 71 m min at 59 m with total dilution as expected fig 2 c the downward transport of tracer in an upward flow field must be due to free convection of the higher density salt tracer ec 20 ms cm in the relatively slow advective flow of fresher aquifer water ec 1 ms cm below the main inflow zone the spike of tracer at 60 m followed by such rapid and near complete dilution indicates that the injection point was right on the base of the major flow zone the test was repeated with pumping from 70 m and tracer injected at 38 m just below the top of the screen fig 6 c a clear dilution profile was obtained from a peak concentration of around 5 ms cm to near full dilution at the pump the steady state dilution profile indicates fairly discrete zones of inflow that match those in the borehole flowmeter profile fig 6 e even providing greater resolution of flowing features however the dilution model could not be applied because an excessive amount of dilution was observed a calculation using eq 4 suggests that at least five times the applied pumping rate would be required to explain the observed dilution in pumped discharge fig 2 c open black circles but interestingly the observed first arrival of tracer at the pump can be reproduced if the inflow profile from the flowmeter is used to directly model flow velocities not shown 7 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the dilution model to the fitting parameters was assessed using the dataset from well lhrp4 with injection at the top the results fig 7 show the effect of varying the individual model parameters by 10 from the best fit to the measured data shown in fig 4 c although the model was insensitive to dispersivity over this range of variation fig 7 a dispersivity does control the shape of the tracer front when varied over a larger range to illustrate this the effect of varying dispersivity by 50 is also shown blue lines a larger dispersivity value increases the time distance between the leading edge of the tracer front and the steady state concentration and vice versa the model is insensitive to all values of dispersivity at steady state because the tracer front is no longer in the well varying tracer injection rate fig 7 b and concentration fig 7 c shifts the position of the steady state concentration profile without changing the tracer velocity indicated by the transient profiles in contrast varying the pumping rate changes both the tracer velocity and the overall amount of dilution indicated by the steady state profile fig 7 d finally shifting the background tracer concentration profile has a similar effect on the steady state profile and a smaller effect on the transient profiles fig 7 e the pumping rate injection rate and injected tracer concentration were carefully and regularly measured during the test and there is little scope for more than 1 2 error the background tracer concentrations are constrained by the pre injection profile measured while pumping but before commencing tracer injection and uncertainty is less than used in this sensitivity analysis 8 discussion successful use of this constant rate pumped tracer dilution test requires that 1 drawdown in the well stabilises so that the inflow profile is consistent this also applies with the borehole flowmeter 2 the in well flow rate increases monotonically between the injection point and pump so that tracer mass is conserved i e pumping must overcome the ambient flow regime so that water tracer are not lost back into the aquifer 3 tracer concentration remains sufficiently above background over the test interval and 4 flow velocity at the injection point is sufficient to overcome tracer density issues or the loss of tracer to free convection is resolved these conditions appear to have been met in the tests on well 6628 21204 with very similar flow profiles in both orientations no evidence of tracer density issues and good agreement with the em flowmeter data this indicates that the theoretical basis of our modelling approach e g laminar flow no density driven transport is sufficiently robust for well lhrp4 these conditions were also met once we identified the effective injection rates here the key to solving the effective injection rate issue due to partial free convection of injected tracer was recognising that the correct inflow profile must explain both the transient profiles tracer front progress indicating flow velocities and the steady state profile overall dilutions that is reducing the injection rate allowed the model to fit the steady state profile without altering the fit to the transient profiles as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis fig 7 b by identifying in well flow velocities and thus qi z the transient profiles also helped constrain the other unknown ci z for each aquifer inflow thus while the method can be used with just the steady state profile these points highlight how good transient profiles can improve confidence in the results for lhrp4 the interpreted inflow zones were similar between the two tracer test orientations and the flowmeter but the flowmeter gave significantly different proportions from each zone for well wb11ah001 the situation was complicated by heterogeneity and a strong ambient flow regime here we examine each of these important issues tracer density potential inflow bias with the flowmeter and issues with strong ambient flows and heterogeneity 8 1 tracer density issues the relative importance of forced convection and free convection in a mixed flow regime can be assessed with a mixed convection ratio although both forms of convection are always active for practical purposes mixed convection is considered where free and forced convection are roughly of commensurate strength a mixed convection ratio or dimensionless number allows thresholds to be established beyond which one type of convection dominates over the other this has been done for porous media in the groundwater literature e g massmann et al 2006 while the fluid mechanics literature provides an analogue for mixed convective flow within a well van sommeren et al 2013 describe experiments in which a dense solute was injected into upward flow in a vertical square pipe for different combinations of flow rate and density contrast each characterised by a densiometric froude number although it is found in a range of forms for different applications the dimensionless froude number fr for this purpose is defined as van sommeren et al 2013 5 fr u u d 1 3 b s 1 3 where uu is the advective flow velocity l t in the well at the point of interest d is the well diameter l and bs is the buoyant source term which accounts for the density difference between the two fluids using the boussinesq approximation as 6 b s g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 q s where g is acceleration due to gravity l t t ρ and ρ0 are the density m l3 of the source tracer and background aquifer water respectively and qs is the source injection rate or inflow rate l3 t we interpreted their results on the depth of the buoyant mixing zone as a function of froude number to indicate a threshold for considering tracer density issues fig 8 at about fr 0 1 free convection dominated and the mixing zone was large or did not stabilise while at fr 0 6 forced convection dominated and the mixing zone was small to negligible meaning that all of the solute was transported upwards a region of mixed convection occurred within these bounds 0 1 fr 0 6 in which a steady depth of mixing developed although not tested we can infer that buoyancy assists rather than opposes transport of a dense tracer in a downward flow regime the strength of this effect is uncertain but based on our results from well 6628 21204 which showed very good agreement of both test orientations we infer that the effect is probably small over the timeframe of this test with a threshold established i e fr 0 6 we can assess the role of free convection in our tracer tests and provide a tool for planning all types of in well tracer tests involving a density contrast this includes those where de ionised water is used to contrast with the natural salinity of groundwater e g doughty and tsang 2005 for example if the salt concentration is zero in a well and 726 mg l in inflowing aquifer water t 15 c the flow velocity in the well would need to be at least 0 21 m min for buoyancy not to affect how that water moves in fig 8 this point is where the orange line drops below the grey mixed convection zone with the tracer test described in this paper the large initial contrast between tracer solution and aquifer water quickly reduces as the low volume injection mixes with the high volume of water in the well so it is perhaps more realistic to consider the peak density difference measured in the well during the test for the purpose of calculating the density difference solute concentration was estimated as total dissolved solids from the measured ec tds mg l 0 6 ec us cm in well 6628 21204 we measured a maximum density contrast of 0 56 kg m3 t 15 c and an upward flow velocity of 0 25 m min at the injection point this gives fr 0 68 which is above the threshold for balanced mixed convection fig 8 indicating that forced convection dominates and indeed we did not observe any buoyancy effects in contrast in well lhrp4 we measured a maximum density contrast of 5 81 kg m3 t 30 c and an upward flow velocity of 0 17 m min at the injection point this gives fr 0 21 which is within the balanced mixed convection zone tending towards dominance of free convection fig 8 this is consistent with our experience of nearly half of the injected tracer sinking downwards instead of moving upwards as intended while in well wb11ah001 with a density contrast of just 0 45 kg m3 t 30 c the upwards flow needed to be at least 0 21 m min fr 0 6 to fully overcome buoyancy issues this was only achieved at the final injection location at 60 m according to the flowmeter data below that with injection at 70 m fr 0 56 and 90 m fr 0 35 the tracer moved downwards instead of upwards as intended buoyancy flows can enhance or retard transport in the vertical dimension depending on whether the advective flow is moving with gravity or against it jackson et al 1989 nield and bejan 2017 here the tracer was denser than aquifer water so it would tend to sink downwards under free convection thus tracer transport would be enhanced when free convection assists forced convection downward flow and retarded when it opposes forced convection upward flow in well lhrp4 this would cause the proportion of flow from the upper zone to be underestimated in both test orientations however the first arrival of tracer at the pump was slower with injection at the top than with injection at the bottom despite a higher pumping rate and the assisting downward flow with gravity this clearly indicates a smaller proportion of yield from the upper zone therefore we can say that opposing assisting free convection is not the main reason that the tracer test and flowmeter results differ although it may in part explain the difference between the two tracer test orientations 8 2 inflow bias with the flowmeter the unexpected small scale vertical fluctuations in the flowmeter measurements at the higher flow rates are repeatable two flow profiles are shown in fig 4 e but others were collected at different pumping rates on both well lhrp4 and well wb11ah001 and all show similar fluctuations at consistent depths this repeatability suggests a physical basis for the phenomenon e g voids existing in the gravel pack within the borehole annulus and hints at a potential issue with the data when using the flowmeter with the flow diverter the effective diameter of the well is the 0 025 m instrument annulus in this situation arnold and molz 2000 showed that head loss across the instrument is increasingly significant at flows above 10 l min using the nozzle equation verified by their work we calculated head loss profiles for our flowmeter data fig 9 a for reference the 10 l min threshold equates to a head loss of 0 007 m with the major inflow zone near the bottom of well lhrp4 flow rates quickly increased above the head loss threshold whereas in well wb11ah001 head loss was negligible until the major inflow zone in the upper part of the well in the upper part of both wells the head loss through the meter exceeded the drawdown 0 05 m induced by pumping thus it seems clear that the flowmeter was not the lowest resistance pathway to flow at these higher flow rates zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 clearly show the problem in this situation with more inflow drawn from the interval between the pump and flowmeter and the proportion of flow sourced from below i e passing through the meter being underestimated relative to the unimpeded inflow profile when we compare the flowmeter profiles to the flow profiles derived from the tracer test fig 9 b which did not obstruct the wellbore we can clearly see enhanced inflow from the uppermost zone in the flowmeter profiles which converged on the top of the screen this is also evident in the different positions of the vertical section of the profile 70 120 m in fig 9 b the fraction of flow from the lower inflow zone i e below the flowmeter was less in both flowmeter profiles than in the tracer tests particularly at the higher pumping rate thus we conclude that the flowmeter data are impacted by head losses whereas the tracer test is not and the correct flow profile is probably an average of the two tracer test orientations to avoid head loss issues with the flowmeter the flow diverter can be under sized more than we did or removed entirely and used with a centraliser clemo et al 2009 or even without one if flows are strong enough i e turbulent and the trolling mode is used newhouse et al 2005 a bypass flow factor is then included in the instrument calibration or in post processing the data e g paillet 2004 newhouse et al 2005 demonstrate that the em flowmeter is actually capable of measuring much higher flows than stated by the manufacturer however the trade off is a reduced sensitivity to slower flows because only a fraction passes through the sensor while a spinner meter could have measured the upper end of the flow regime in our wells 30 l min it would not be sensitive the majority of flow rates encountered thus it is challenging to accurately sense a wide range of in well flow rates in a single flowmeter profile a practical solution might be to combine the results of two separate profiles one with the full flow diverter and another with an under sized flow diverter to measure the higher flow rates 8 3 issues with strong ambient flows and heterogeneity our attempts to do the pumped tracer dilution test on well wb11ah001 illustrate the challenges with strong ambient flows heterogeneity and buoyancy issues with the ec tracer at low flow velocities in the well in the simple theoretical modelling of poulsen et al 2018 a weak ambient flow regime 0 5 l min was overcome with pumping at 4 5 times the ambient flow rate however this field example shows that the ambient regime is not so easily overcome in a heterogeneous environment with strong head gradients our pumping at 45 l min from above the screen only slightly reduced the downward ambient flow occurring in the lower part of the well while slightly enhancing the overlying upward flow regime fig 6 e we believe the two ambient regimes would be additive when considering a pumping rate to overcome them thus while our pumping rate was 3 9 times the total ambient flow rate 11 6 l min it seems a significantly higher rate would be needed to reverse the downward flow in the lower part of the well i e to draw down the water level in the well below the head in the aquifer we were unable to cause more than 0 04 m of drawdown in this high transmissivity well table 1 although the flowmeter is undoubtedly a practical solution to measure flows in wells like wb11ah001 a carefully designed tracer test could be applied in the interval over which flow can be induced towards the pump with a highly productive zone near the top it was difficult to generate flow lower in the well by pumping above the screen our tracer test could have been improved by using a neutrally buoyant tracer in the upward flow orientation or by placing the pump much lower in the downward flow orientation for the latter inflow from the upper producing zone would rapidly transport tracer downwards to the pump fitting the dilution model then requires an effective pumping rate the difference from the actual pumping rate would give the fraction of inflow from the un tested interval of the well below the pump 8 4 prognosis tracer dilution tests are of particular value to assess in well flows when a borehole flowmeter is not available but also to provide a complimentary line of evidence a good starting point is an un pumped tracer test e g maurice et al 2011 paillet 2012 to identify the ambient flow regime in the well to help with designing the pumped tracer test orientation injection depth pumping rate the ambient flow profile shows the actively outflowing zones which need to be reversed to inflowing to use the method reported here successful reversal would be evidenced by tracer dilution in those zones without some knowledge of vertical head gradients in the groundwater system the amount of pumping induced drawdown in the well necessary to cause inflow from all aquifer zones is uncertain however our experience suggests it would be prudent for the pumping rate to be at least an order of magnitude more than the ambient flow rate our method and that of brainerd and robbins 2004 is particularly suited to high discharge rates where water disposal is not an issue when there is a short tracer travel time in the well and turbulent flows actually assist with mixing tracer and aquifer inflows in the well there are practical limitations with long travel times so it is best to design the test to be completed in a single day simple calculations of velocities travel times and froude numbers for a range of potential scenarios can be used to assist with planning a test the choice of tracer type should be made with consideration to the potentially competing interests of achieving measurable concentration in pumped discharge and avoiding buoyancy issues at the injection point which may be subject to low flows even at high pumping rates thus any prior knowledge of flow zones gained from an ambient flow test would be valuable in positioning the injection point so that there is some driving flow in practice one must be prepared to do the tracer test in both orientations and or refine the configuration to optimise the results if there is a tracer buoyancy issue an unresolved effective injection rate is problematic for the test e g our first test on well wb11ah001 although it can still provide useful qualitative information about the flow regime an ideal tracer has zero background concentration and thus provides a wider range of detection but we believe there is merit in using a salt ec tracer because of its ready availability and ease of measurement obviously it is limited to situations where ec can be made significantly different than the background ec over the whole test interval which could mean using a low ec tracer in saline environments the utility of this method could be improved by 1 refining the theoretical basis of the model to properly deal with turbulent flow 2 experimentally assessing the role of free convection in the upwards and downwards orientations and 3 testing the utility of the dimensionless froude number reported here alternatively it would be advantageous to explore the use of a more neutrally buoyant tracer that can be measured at high resolution with a wireline sonde examples of such tracers that could be adapted for use in this test include fluorescent dye e g libby and robbins 2014 artificially increased dissolved oxygen e g chlebica and robbins 2013 or artificially altered temperature e g klepikova et al 2011 read et al 2014 9 conclusion this paper presents a combined field method and numerical model for a single well tracer dilution test to quantify the pumped flow regime in long screened or open borehole wells controlled boundary conditions are established by pumping to create a monotonically increasing flow regime in the well and simultaneously injecting a tracer at the opposite end of the interval to be characterised the test is unique in its efficacy to characterise the entire length of a well over a wide range of flow rates requiring little more than the time taken for tracer to travel from the injection point to the pump sequentially measured tracer concentration profiles are modelled with the advection dispersion equation by specifying for each inflow zone depth interval background tracer concentration and fraction of total yield the test results are consistent with em flowmeter data especially if density issues with the tracer are avoided or correctly interpreted the main challenges with ec as a tracer are determining the background concentration for each flowing zone and managing density related issues that arise at low flow rates this test not only provides an accessible alternative to a borehole flowmeter but it also provides a complimentary line of evidence to improve resolution of the in well flow regime it has the potential to provide a wider dynamic range of flow rate sensitivity particularly in situations where using a packer with the flowmeter is problematic such as screened and gravel packed wells this approach using existing wells can provide considerable information on aquifer hydraulics and chemistry without the cost of

6443,quantifying vertical flows in long screened or open wells is essential for their reliable use in all types of groundwater investigations in ambient conditions a flow profile shows the producing receiving zones of head driven flow the relative vertical head gradient in the aquifer system and potential bias in chemistry samples a flow profile while pumping can be used to quantify aquifer heterogeneity and the sampled water mixtures this paper describes a novel approach to a single well tracer test to quantify the flow regime in a pumped well which is unique in its utility over a wide range of discharge rates during constant pumping a tracer is injected at the opposite end of the well and as it is drawn towards the pump the tracer is diluted in proportion to each inflow a dilution model using the advection dispersion equation is used to visually fit a flow profile that explains all tracer profiles pre injection transient phase and steady state results compare favourably to borehole em flowmeter data particularly if tracer density issues are correctly interpreted and head loss in the flowmeter is avoided a dimensionless froude number is provided to assist both with understanding and minimising the role of free convection when planning all types of in well tracer tests involving a density contrast like the flowmeter this method is particularly suited to screened wells where packers are ineffective used together or separately in existing wells these in well methods can provide considerable information on aquifer well hydraulics without the cost of additional drilling keywords borehole flow tracer dilution single well method long screened well open borehole well 1 introduction installation of wells or piezometers for groundwater investigations is expensive particularly in remote areas so the economical approach is to use available infrastructure where possible however wells designed for purposes such as water production have much longer screened or open intervals than those for collecting data from discrete depths this means that traditional methods average hydraulic properties water levels and chemistry over an unhelpfully large interval of the aquifer system although straddle packers can be used to obtain depth specific data they rely on isolating specific intervals of the well this is not possible if bypass flow occurs in the gravel pack around the screen or between the packer and an uneven borehole wall in such situations it can be more effective to maintain the well as the path of lowest hydraulic resistance and work with the in well flow regime in both ambient un pumped and pumped conditions specifically this approach enables the vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity and head to be derived e g day lewis et al 2011 sawdey and reeve 2012 and water samples to be properly interpreted e g poulsen et al 2018 borehole flowmeters are established and commercially available geophysical tools for measuring in well flow profiles they are relatively efficient to operate and can be used in ambient and pumped conditions there are three types of flowmeter newhouse et al 2005 young and pearson 1995 heat pulse mainly suited to low flows electromagnetic em suited to a wide range of flows and the impeller spinner best suited to higher flows these wireline instruments measure fluid velocity past a sensor as function of depth in the well in stationary or trolling mode tracer dilution tests within a well can be used instead of or complementary to a borehole flowmeter to improve resolution of in well flows with multiple lines of evidence for ambient conditions and low pumping rates a tracer is introduced to the fluid column in the well uniformly or at a point or the entire water column is replaced then successive tracer profiles in the well over time show the moving front of inflowing aquifer water displacing and or diluting the tracer evolution of the tracer profile over time can be converted into borehole flow using a mass balance paillet 2012 or the advection dispersion equation in a spreadsheet model maurice et al 2011 or a numerical code doughty and tsang 2005 for higher pumping rates when there is a shorter residence time of water in the well a tracer pulse test can be used goldrath et al 2015 izbicki et al 1999 or the constant rate tracer dilution approach reported here the tracer pulse test is time consuming because for each point measurement of in well flow rate the tracer must travel from the injection point to the sensor at the surface and many point measurements are required to generate a flow profile in comparison this constant rate tracer dilution method is more efficient because it requires little more than a single tracer travel time from injection point to the pump aside from the tracer pulse test the objective of existing single well pumped tracer tests were mainly to characterise individual fractures in low yield bedrock wells with weak ambient flow regimes e g brainerd and robbins 2004 chlebica and robbins 2013 libby and robbins 2014 tsang et al 1990 transient methods are problematic in high yield wells because a slug test would recover far too quickly for tracer profiles to be measured a low pumping rate would cause insufficient drawdown to overcome ambient flows while a high pumping rate may flush the single fluid column of tracer out of the well before multiple concentration profiles can be collected and a strong ambient flow regime would complicate the uniform emplacement of tracer in the water column in the first place in contrast our constant rate method is suited to high yield wells and particularly situations where a higher pumping rate is needed to overcome ambient flows and generate inflow from all aquifer zones intersected in this paper we present a combined field and numerical method that is unique in its efficacy and applicability over a wide range of pumping rates in both screened and open borehole wells a constant rate approach with simultaneous pumping and injection of tracer is used in a similar manner to brainerd and robbins 2004 however we use common salt as the tracer instead of a dye due to its availability and ease of measurement and collect continuous fluid column electrical conductivity logs before and during the transient phase of the test and at steady state analysis using the advection dispersion equation enables flow rate to be quantified at all depths in the well field data from two high yield long screened wells and an open borehole well are used to demonstrate the utility of the method we compare the results with borehole em flowmeter data from the same wells at similar pumping rates and provide some important considerations for the use of both methods 2 theory at a pumping rate sufficient to overcome the ambient flow regime see section 8 4 a well can be conceptualised as a linear network with monotonically increasing flow in one direction fig 1 a analogous to a gaining river water enters the well according to the hydraulic conductivity and head distribution in the surrounding aquifer and the hydraulic stress induced by pumping if a tracer is injected continually at a constant rate near the distal end of the well it is drawn towards the pump and diluted in proportion to each of the inflows movement of the tracer front during the initial transient phase indicates velocity in the well and its shape is determined by the degree of dispersion mixing and aquifer inflows once the tracer has reached the pump a steady state situation arises where there is no further change in the tracer concentration profile assuming that all fluxes are constant and dispersion becomes insignificant which is a key advantage of this approach at this point the shape of the tracer concentration profile fig 1 b is primarily determined by the distribution of inflows from the aquifer and with or without the transient profiles it can be inverted to give the inflow profile by quantifying the tracer mass balance to each element in the network fig 1 c and d flow velocities along the length of a well range from zero to the applied pumping rate with increases resulting from lateral inflows from the aquifer flow varies across the well diameter according to the type of flow regime from a minimum at its wall to a maximum at its centre we considered it impractical to explicitly quantify the full flow velocity field so we made some simplifying choices to model tracer dilution in a well 1 we neglect radial variations in flow velocity and solute concentration and simply consider the averages at each depth 2 we assume that the advection dispersion equation commonly used for porous media is a reasonable approximation of transport in a well over the range of flows we encountered mostly laminar tending to turbulent 3 we approximate dispersion as the product of average velocity a dispersivity constant and diffusion eq 2 and 4 we assume monotonically increasing flow between the injection point and the pump on this basis the rate of change of mass in the well with depth z and time t is expressed with a one dimensional form of the advection dispersion equation maurice et al 2011 1 a c z t t q z c z t z a z d z c z t z q i c i where a is the cross sectional area of the well l2 q is flow rate in the well l3 l t qi is the groundwater inflow rate l3 l t c and ci are the concentrations in the well and the groundwater inflow respectively z is the vertical position in the well l and dz is the dispersion coefficient l2 t by adjusting qici at each depth to fit the measured c z profile the inflow profile to the well can be obtained for the known pumping rate tracer injection rate and tracer concentration since qi and ci are both unknowns this method is limited to situations where ci z 0 where ci z is assumed to equal the concentration of pumped discharge from the well or where ci z can be estimated for each inflowing zone the shape of the tracer front is governed by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient 2 d z α v z d m where α is the dispersivity l vz is the average flow velocity l t and dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t this form of the advection dispersion equation is appropriate when dispersivity is constant in laminar flow conditions dispersivity is reduced in turbulent flow because eddies and random motion homogenise the flow velocities hart et al 2013 in addition to dispersion a certain distance along the well is required for complete mixing of flow with tracer at the injection point and with each inflow from the aquifer this mixing length is much shorter in turbulent flow than in laminar flow an example from the water treatment industry gives a mixing length of 10 times the pipe diameter where chlorine is introduced mid stream in turbulent pipe flow pizzi 2009 p186 this translates to a length of 2 m for the 0 2 m diameter wells used in this work although flows are usually laminar in the vicinity of the tracer injection point lateral inflow from the aquifer causes small eddies and enhances tracer mixing martin hayden et al 2014 martin hayden and wolfe 2000 for pipe flow the type of flow regime is assessed with the dimensionless reynolds number re 3 re ρ ν z d μ where ρ is the density m l3 and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water m l t both depend on water temperature vz is the average flow velocity l t and d is the diameter of the pipe l indicatively laminar flow prevails for re 2100 and turbulent flow occurs where re 4000 with the intervening flows in the transitional range where either flow type may occur e g avila et al 2011 reynolds number calculations for the 0 2 m diameter wells used in this work indicate laminar flow up to 0 51 m min 16 l min and turbulent flow above 0 95 m min 30 l min where a tracer test involves fluids with contrasting density e g different salinity tracer movement occurs by two mechanisms forced convection and free convection ataie ashtiani et al 2018 forced convection is due to an external pressure gradient e g pumping or the natural head difference between depths of the aquifer system connected by the well and is often referred to as advection whereas free convection is the buoyant fluid movement driven by a density contrast if there is a density contrast between the tracer and water in the well free convection may affect tracer mixing and initial transport in the case of a dense tracer injected into an upward flow regime the mixing zone may extend below the injection point to a depth depending on the strength of the pumping induced flow relative to the density contrast van sommeren et al 2013 the assisting or opposing effect of free convention in tracer transport is not explicitly included in our model but we do explore and discuss ways to assess its role in the test a characteristic of dilution is that the change in concentration is relative to the concentration difference between the two fluids so the change of tracer concentration in the well for equal aquifer inflow becomes exponentially less as dilution progresses if the concentration of aquifer inflow is constant thus the method is sensitive to small inflows only when tracer concentration is increased significantly above background over the entire tested interval of the well to help choose an appropriate tracer concentration the maximum extent of dilution expected in pumped discharge cpss is given with a simple steady state mass balance 4 c pss q inj c inj c p 0 q p c p 0 where qinj is the tracer injection rate l3 t qp is the pumping rate l3 t cinj is the undiluted tracer concentration and cp0 is the tracer concentration of pumped water before the test which is readily measured tracer concentrations can be in units of m l3 or an analogue such as electrical conductivity siemens l 3 site description the method was initially tested in an open borehole well in the fractured bedrock of the adelaide hills south australia it was then applied in two long screened wells in the remote pilbara region of western australia with one providing a relatively straightforward example and the other illustrating a more challenging situation table 1 gives details of these three wells 3 1 adelaide hills well 6628 21204 is one of several wells installed in fractured adelaidean sedimentary rock at a research site near the town of balhannah in the western mount lofty ranges harrington et al 2004 the aquifer media is compact laminated metasiltstone tending to sandstone with quartzite in places and groundwater flowing exclusively in fractures a borehole camera was used to establish that this 0 204 m diameter well is uncased below 6 m and it appears to be open to near the full drilled depth of 55 7 m timber steel debris lodged below 53 7 m the borehole is generally competent but the wall is variably rough and enlarged in places airlift yield at the time of drilling was recorded at 1 9 l s in our testing pumping rates of up to 0 2 l s induced about 2 m drawdown in the well with a pumping water level of 12 m this well had a 43 7 m effective open interval 3 2 pilbara the pilbara is known for its globally significant iron ore deposits which are mined in open pits and for its unique natural environment including groundwater dependent ecosystems rojas et al 2018 the competing interests of maintaining dry mining conditions dewatering and maintaining groundwater levels to support surface ecosystems are driving research to characterise groundwater ages and recharge rates in the region s aquifers e g cook et al 2017 mccallum et al 2017 however virtually all available wells have long screens designed to maximise discharge capacity or to monitor overall responses to dewatering this means that pumped samples are a mixture of groundwater from a wide range of depths which limits the utility of any chemical analyses thus the purpose of applying this method of measuring in well flows in the pilbara is to enable better informed sampling by quantifying specific inflow zones the two test wells lhrp4 and wb11ah001 used in this work are in the hope downs area of the southern hamersley basin they were installed as supply wells for railway construction and as such they are remote from the mining areas and they have been disused for several years well lhrp4 is screened in variably weathered and fractured dolomite of the wittenoom formation and the overlying gravelly detrital sediments a borehole camera was used to establish that the pvc casing of this 0 195 m diameter well is machine slotted below 66 m and although a total depth of 144 m was originally logged it is now silted up to 142 m giving a 78 m long screened interval gravel pack is recorded for the entire borehole annulus except for a cemented surface collar with telescoping hole diameters of 0 45 m 3 70 m 0 32 m 70 134 m and 0 27 m 134 144 m a previous aquifer test indicates the well has a high transmissivity 12 900 m2 d and it was pumped at 25 l s with 2 6 m drawdown aquaterra 2007 in our tests pumping rates of up to 1 l s induced up to 0 09 m drawdown well wb11ah001 is in a particularly complex geological setting with logged material ranging from clayey gravel to gravel and then fault gouge with depth the latter containing fragments of crystalline dolomite shale banded iron formation and chert a borehole camera was used to establish that the pvc casing of this 0 203 m diameter well was machine slotted below 35 2 m and the total open depth of 142 8 m gave a 107 6 m long screened interval gravel pack is recorded for the entire borehole annulus consistently 0 3 m diameter except for a 2 m bentonite seal above the screen 24 26 m and a cemented surface collar a previous aquifer test gave transmissivity in the range 2690 6360 m2 d with pumping at 25 l s and just 0 64 m drawdown aquaterra 2011 in our tests pumping rates of up to 0 85 l s induced up to 0 04 m drawdown 4 field methods as illustrated in fig 1 a this test involves collecting a sequence of tracer profiles in the well while simultaneously pumping from one end of the screen and injecting tracer at the other end in each case the test was repeated with the pumping and injection locations reversed to provide a check on the uniqueness of the interpreted flow profile and to assess whether the test worked better in one orientation than the other due to the distribution of inflows this resulted in the six tests summarised in table 1 electrical conductivity ec as specific conductance at 25 c was used as the tracer with sodium chloride cooking salt without anti caking agent used to create the tracer solution as others have shown e g tsang et al 1990 ec is linearly related to salt concentration in water at relatively dilute concentrations ec 7 ms cm so we used it directly in our inversion model as an analogue for concentration with the focus being on relative differences the initial tracer ec and pumped discharge ec were measured with a calibrated field meter wtw model multi 3420 accuracy 0 5 of measured value ec profiles were recorded with a multi parameter sonde ysi model 600xlm deep depth accuracy 0 3 m ec accuracy 0 5 of reading lowered and raised using a hand operated winch the sonde recorded ec and pressure depth at one second intervals giving measurements with a median spacing of 0 1 0 2 m throughout the water column trolling in the downward direction was preferable because the ec sensor located on the bottom of the instrument was first to contact undisturbed water in the upward direction passage of the instrument body 0 042 m diameter 0 54 m length ahead of the sensor caused a smearing effect in the ec profiles ideally the tracer measuring instruments should be calibrated together here the difference between the surface meter reading of pumped discharge and the flow weighted average of background ec determined from the tracer profiles was subtracted from the profiles to bring them into line with the meter reading field logistics dictated a manageable volume of tracer solution so the tracer injection rates were a small percentage 0 8 6 1 of the pumping discharge rates with the low volume injection relatively high tracer concentrations 17 40 ms cm were used so that dilution was measurable throughout the test intervals initial mixing in the well rapidly reduced ec to more dilute levels after measuring the standing water level an ambient ec profile was collected before the well was disturbed by pumping then the ¼ inch nylon tracer injection tubing and submersible pump grundfos model mp1 or sqen3 were placed near the top or bottom of the well depending on the orientation of the test pumping commenced 10 66 3 l min and while water level drawdown was stabilising 10 60 min the tracer solution was prepared in a 200 l drum using aquifer water and pre mixed salt concentrate before starting the test one or more ec profiles were collected during pumping to establish the initial conditions the test began when tracer entered the well at the injection point which occurred once the injection tube filled with tracer a few minutes after the injection pump started tracer was injected at a constant low rate 0 51 0 61 l min using a peristaltic pump pegasus model athena a diffuser consisting of a short length 0 15 m of perforated pipe with an end cap was used to help direct the tracer radially into the well the diffuser was not centralised so the well s vertical alignment was probably the main control on the position of the tracer injection point and the ec sonde each time it was lowered and raised during the test regular ec profiles were collected and downloaded from the sonde to give real time tracking of tracer migration in the well and to assess when the steady state condition was reached later checked with model simulations regular measurements of injection rate and pumping rate volume time method and ec of pumped discharge were also made the test was complete when the tracer had reached the pump ec in pumped discharge had stabilised and successive tracer profiles had the same shape 4 1 borehole flowmeter vertical flow measurements were made with a borehole em flowmeter century geophysical llc model 9721 in well lhrp4 and well wb11ah001 and historical data were obtained for well 6628 21204 for comparison with the pumped tracer dilution test results in all cases the instrument was used in stationary mode at regular intervals while the well was being pumped at a similar rate to that used in the tracer dilution test ambient flow profiles were also collected according to the manufacturer the response range for the flowmeter is 0 05 40 l min with an accuracy of 0 02 l min the product description also indicates when using the tool to measure low velocity flow rates a rubber skirt is attached to the outside of the sensor to block off the bore hole and force the fluid to pass through the 1 in diameter opening inside the sensor coil when measuring faster flow rates the rubber skirt is typically removed and the tool is run in either the static station or dynamic mode we include this statement because it has a strong bearing on the results we used such a rubber skirt flow diverter in all profiles and maintained flow through the sensor below the stated upper end of the response range 40 l min for example on well lhrp4 flow through the sensor was limited to 29 l min when pumping at 50 l min by using an under sized flow diverter 0 188 m compared to the well diameter 0 195 m however according to arnold and molz 2000 head loss across the meter becomes significant when flow through the sensor exceeds 10 l min see discussion for details at each well a two point calibration procedure was used with the instrument positioned in the water column above the top of the screen in ambient conditions this comprised a stationary zero point followed by trolling the instrument at a known rate and using the well diameter to calculate flow rate through the sensor in pumped conditions the second point was recalibrated to the known pumping rate with the instrument held stationary because the calibrations were done with the flow diverter in place any bypass flow was built in assuming the well diameter remained constant 5 numerical methods to quantify the vertical profile of flow in the well the measured tracer profiles were modelled with a finite element formulation of the one dimensional advection dispersion equation eq 1 the well was discretised into a network of nodes and elements e g fig 1 c and aquifer inflows were visually identified in the tracer dilution profiles at the resolution of the node spacing grid convergence was achieved with node spacing of 0 05 m which was near the minimum numerically practical spacing for solution time this fine discretisation was necessary to represent strong gradients of tracer concentration particularly around the injection point according to the peclet number constraint node spacing did not exceed the dispersivity length so that dispersion characteristics of the model were not unduly affected discrete inflows can be assigned to individual elements or inflow zones can span many elements with the proportion of total inflow distributed evenly over the zone tracer injection and pumped discharge were assigned per element so the fluxes were split between two nodes when the pump was placed below the injection point an adjusted cross sectional area of the well was used in the model given by subtracting the pump hose cross sectional area from that of the well the area of the injection hose was negligible the laplace transform galerkin method sudicky 1989 was used to generate a time continuous solution for the measured pre test transient and steady state tracer profiles simultaneously this was advantageous because the collection time for each profile i e the time taken to troll the length of the well 10 min was non negligible relative to flow velocities in the well 2 m min the time continuous solution was inverted back to real time values using the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm at the time of each measurement in the tracer profiles the laplace transform provides a time continuous solution so the usual courant number constraint that solute mass must not move more than the node spacing per time step was unnecessary the model was implemented as a python class and a graphical user interface was developed to assist with the iterative fitting process a best fit of the modelled tracer concentration profiles to their measured equivalents was achieved by manually adjusting the fraction of discharge and background tracer concentration for each inflow zone the background tracer concentrations in aquifer inflows were estimated by including the pre test tracer profile obtained while pumping the well but before commencing tracer injection in the model fitting process dispersivity was adjusted to fit the shape of the tracer dilution front in the transient profiles for all simulations dispersion included molecular diffusion at a rate of 9 7 10 8 m2 min a value appropriate for sodium chloride in water cook and herczeg 2000 the field steady state tracer concentration profile was verified theoretically by modelling a profile at a large time 1440 min compared to the test duration 420 min 6 results the three field examples illustrate the general utility and some challenges of the method in both open borehole wells and long screened wells in a range of hydrogeological situations table 1 provides summary information including ambient flow rates and pumping induced drawdown for each test fig 2 shows the ec of pumped discharge from each well before and during the tests mainly to help interpret the results in all cases the composite background ec is clearly identified first horizontal line when this was used in eq 4 with the applied pumping and tracer injection rates we could estimate the expected steady state concentration of discharge second horizontal line deviations from these predictions are explained in each case the time elapsed between first arrival of tracer at the pump and the observed steady state concentration indicates the effect of dispersion and this is also seen as the s shaped curve in the transient tracer profiles presented below in figs 3 4 and 6 panels a and c show the tracer profiles these look different for each orientation of the test because of the different position of the injection and pumping locations with respect to the inflows to the well while panels b and d give the interpreted inflow zones and resulting flow profiles for direct comparison with each other and with the flowmeter data shown in panel e in theory these three independent interpretations of the inflows should be identical while the resulting flow profiles are cumulative in the direction of flow so they depend on the position of the pump in the well 6 1 well 6628 21204 in the first test fig 3 c a downward flow regime was created by placing the pump at 45 m and tracer was injected at 20 m to provide opportunity for enough flow from above to drive transport the tracer profiles showed a large concentration increase at the injection point and slow downward transport indicating a small fraction of flow was sourced from above the pump and even less from above the injection point first tracer arrival at the pump occurred after 183 min but concentration was still approaching the predicted steady state by the end of the day fig 2 a this is consistent with the modelling fig 3 c which indicated the last measured concentration profile was short of the theoretical steady state profile the test in the reverse orientation fig 3 a clearly showed that the majority of inflow was from below the injection point at 50 m there was large dilution at the injection point and rapid transport of the tracer to the pump with first arrival at 113 min and steady state a short time later fig 2 a the best fits of the model to each dataset show similar flow distributions with 72 and 67 of flow from the lower zone 50 55 7 m for the tests with injection at the top and bottom respectively fig 3 b and d the good agreement between the dilution tests and the em flowmeter data fig 3 e suggests that the main features of the flow profile are correctly identified in fitting the model to the measured data dispersivity was unexpectedly found to differ by an order of magnitude between the two tracer tests despite flows in both tests being laminar re 100 1000 a dispersivity of 0 5 m was obtained with tracer injection at the top when flow rates in the tested interval were slow 0 04 0 09 m min this large value is clearly manifest in the ec of pumped discharge fig 2a with a very disperse tracer front the time between first arrival and steady state concentration being 53 of the total test duration in the reverse direction with faster flow rates in the tested interval 0 25 0 34 m min the best fit dispersivity was 0 05 m and the time between first arrival and steady state was just 16 of the test duration the exact reason for this difference in dispersivity is unclear but we note that this bedrock well had very rough walls so perhaps the effect of wall roughness on dispersivity is actually non negligible in laminar flows e g gloss and herwig 2010 and tracer transport was impeded more in the slower flow regime particularly if the injection point was against the borehole wall 6 2 well lhrp4 in the first test on lhrp4 tracer injection was at 139 m the pump was above the screen and pumping induced in well flow rates were up to 1 48 m min tracer arrival at the surface took 75 min and steady state was established after 96 min fig 2 b with the difference being 22 of the test duration the amount of dilution was much more than expected at the applied pumping rate fig 2 b and the measured ec profiles clearly show loss of tracer into a stagnant zone below the injection point fig 4 a this discrepancy was due to free convection of tracer in the slow upward flow 0 17 m min at the injection point in fitting the dilution model the only way to match both the moving tracer front in the transient phase and the steady state profile was to assign an effective injection rate less than the actual injection rate a good model fit was achieved with an effective injection rate of 0 31 l min travelling upwards giving 0 25 l min of tracer lost to density convection over the duration of the test to steady state this loss rate is consistent with the amount of tracer mass required to generate the observed concentrations below the injection point in contrast with injection at the top the pump placed at 139 m and pumping induced in well flow rates up to 1 87 m min it took slightly longer for tracer to arrive at the surface 92 min and to establish steady state conditions 118 min but the proportion of the test duration was the same 22 and the amount of dilution was as expected fig 2 b the steady state tracer profiles in both orientations fig 4 a and c clearly show two producing zones separated by an interval with no inflow the interpreted flow profiles fig 4 b and d have very similar inflow zones generally consistent with those identified in the em flowmeter data fig 4 e however the proportions of inflow were different with the tracer tests indicating more flow from the lower zone 71 80 than the flowmeter 51 59 estimated dispersivity was 0 2 and 0 1 m for the downward and upward flow regimes respectively the difference between the two is likely due to differing flow regimes through the middle part of this well that is flow in the downward direction 19 l min was laminar to transitional whereas flow in the upward direction 39 l min was above the turbulent threshold 30 l min turbulence homogenises flow velocities and causes turbulent diffusion which reduces dispersivity intraborehole flow in this well was a complicating factor in the first test borehole flowmeter data collected in ambient conditions showed downwards head driven flow from the upper aquifer zone into the lower zone data not shown so ec in the well prior to pumping was dominated by the upper zone whereas during pumping from above the screen ec in the well was that of water drawn upwards from the lower zone however the water produced from the lower zone was actually in part the intraborehole flow plume i e water from the upper zone until such time as the plume was purged in analysing the data from the first tracer test we identified that the upper zone had an ec of approximately 0 12 ms cm higher than the lower zone this manifested in the tracer test in three distinct stages indicated by the numbering on fig 5 1 there was an initial period during pumping prior to starting the test where ec in the well decreased as water from the lower zone was drawn upwards replacing the water from the upper zone this is shown in fig 5 a by the difference in the profiles at 20 min and 0 min 2 after the transient phase of the test once the tracer had reached the pump theory dictates that the tracer profile should remain steady which should have occurred at around the 102 min profile fig 5 a prior to this time inflow from the lower zone was of consistent ec note 39 59 79 and 102 min profiles plotting over each other at approximately 1 25 ms cm interpreted to be from the intraborehole flow plume 3 but rather than remaining steady in the 102 min position the profile then shifted leftwards on fig 5 b starting with a decrease at the lower inflow zone which propagated upwards until a steady state was reached with multiple identical profiles obtained 255 288 and 318 min fig 5 b this is interpreted to be the period during which there was a decreasing fraction of intraborehole flow plume water inflowing to the well before the plume was fully purged 176 min profile but it wasn t until the consistent ec of native groundwater had travelled the length of the well that a stable tracer profile was established 255 min profile on completing this test pumping continued 67 l min 139 m maximum pump insertion depth for 20 min after tracer injection ceased to remove as much of the tracer as possible ahead of the next test with injection and pumping in reverse positions the next day prior to starting the test pumping continued for 138 min 67 l min 139 m and multiple ec profiles were collected to confirm a stable initial ec profile this stable profile cyan curve in fig 5 a is similar to the pre injection profile used for analysis of the first test it also shows residual high concentration of tracer in the bottom of the well even after considerable purging this together with the high ec at the injection point 139 m indicates very little flow from beneath and places the base of the lower producing zone at approximately 140 m the dataset used in the tracer dilution analysis of the first test fig 4 a is essentially that shown in fig 5 a except that the 102 min profile was replaced with the 318 min profile as shown by the arrows in fig 5 b because it provided better resolution of the inflow features the test also relies on a stable background tracer concentration so we estimated this from the parts of the transient profiles where the tracer front had not yet reached as indicated by the dashed profile 0 min in fig 5 a with the first test showing the majority of tracer dilution was caused by inflow from the lower zone it seemed clear that a lesser proportion of inflow was sourced from the upper zone thus the tracer would travel more slowly downward through the test interval when the pump was placed at the bottom so the second test was done at a higher pumping rate 66 3 l min to ensure it could be completed in a day the injection point was at a similar depth as the top of screen 66 m and the smaller tracer spike 6 5 ms cm indicates immediate inflow at this depth presence of tracer above the injection point fig 4 c is attributed to repeated upward passage of the ec sonde which dragged tracer into the stagnant zone above the screen integration of tracer mass associated with this concentration increase above the screen gave 2 9 of total mass lost so an effective injection rate of 0 54 l min was used in model fitting to account for this loss at all other points in the well this mechanical dispersion effect was overwhelmed by advection 6 3 well wb11ah001 applying the tracer dilution test in well wb11ah001 was problematic because of the low proportion of inflow sourced from below about 60 m and the strong head driven intraborehole flow regime that was not overcome by pumping however the em flowmeter readily measured the in well flow regimes in ambient and pumped conditions so these results are described first to illustrate the situation fig 6 e an interesting feature of the ambient flow regime is that upward and downward flow occurred simultaneously over different intervals specifically upward flow of 3 7 l min was produced from a zone between 85 and 105 m and exited the well near the top of the screen meanwhile downward flow of 7 9 l min occurred in the zone between 110 and 125 m this downward flow regime continued when the well was pumped from above the screen at the maximum achievable rate 45 l min yield to the pump was mainly sourced from above 60 m with a small portion from 68 to 71 m 2 and 85 105 m 12 to test the finding of downward flow below 105 m during pumping tracer was injected at 110 m fig 6 a 1st injection the tracer indeed travelled downwards however when the injection point was raised to 90 m the same downward transport occurred at a point where the flowmeter data indicate slow up flow of around 0 12 m min the injection point was then raised to 70 m and downward transport again occurred with evidence of a small component of upward transport flowmeter up flow of 0 19 m min finally the injection point was raised to 60 m and tracer travelled upwards to the pump flowmeter up flow of 0 22 m min at 62 m and 0 71 m min at 59 m with total dilution as expected fig 2 c the downward transport of tracer in an upward flow field must be due to free convection of the higher density salt tracer ec 20 ms cm in the relatively slow advective flow of fresher aquifer water ec 1 ms cm below the main inflow zone the spike of tracer at 60 m followed by such rapid and near complete dilution indicates that the injection point was right on the base of the major flow zone the test was repeated with pumping from 70 m and tracer injected at 38 m just below the top of the screen fig 6 c a clear dilution profile was obtained from a peak concentration of around 5 ms cm to near full dilution at the pump the steady state dilution profile indicates fairly discrete zones of inflow that match those in the borehole flowmeter profile fig 6 e even providing greater resolution of flowing features however the dilution model could not be applied because an excessive amount of dilution was observed a calculation using eq 4 suggests that at least five times the applied pumping rate would be required to explain the observed dilution in pumped discharge fig 2 c open black circles but interestingly the observed first arrival of tracer at the pump can be reproduced if the inflow profile from the flowmeter is used to directly model flow velocities not shown 7 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the dilution model to the fitting parameters was assessed using the dataset from well lhrp4 with injection at the top the results fig 7 show the effect of varying the individual model parameters by 10 from the best fit to the measured data shown in fig 4 c although the model was insensitive to dispersivity over this range of variation fig 7 a dispersivity does control the shape of the tracer front when varied over a larger range to illustrate this the effect of varying dispersivity by 50 is also shown blue lines a larger dispersivity value increases the time distance between the leading edge of the tracer front and the steady state concentration and vice versa the model is insensitive to all values of dispersivity at steady state because the tracer front is no longer in the well varying tracer injection rate fig 7 b and concentration fig 7 c shifts the position of the steady state concentration profile without changing the tracer velocity indicated by the transient profiles in contrast varying the pumping rate changes both the tracer velocity and the overall amount of dilution indicated by the steady state profile fig 7 d finally shifting the background tracer concentration profile has a similar effect on the steady state profile and a smaller effect on the transient profiles fig 7 e the pumping rate injection rate and injected tracer concentration were carefully and regularly measured during the test and there is little scope for more than 1 2 error the background tracer concentrations are constrained by the pre injection profile measured while pumping but before commencing tracer injection and uncertainty is less than used in this sensitivity analysis 8 discussion successful use of this constant rate pumped tracer dilution test requires that 1 drawdown in the well stabilises so that the inflow profile is consistent this also applies with the borehole flowmeter 2 the in well flow rate increases monotonically between the injection point and pump so that tracer mass is conserved i e pumping must overcome the ambient flow regime so that water tracer are not lost back into the aquifer 3 tracer concentration remains sufficiently above background over the test interval and 4 flow velocity at the injection point is sufficient to overcome tracer density issues or the loss of tracer to free convection is resolved these conditions appear to have been met in the tests on well 6628 21204 with very similar flow profiles in both orientations no evidence of tracer density issues and good agreement with the em flowmeter data this indicates that the theoretical basis of our modelling approach e g laminar flow no density driven transport is sufficiently robust for well lhrp4 these conditions were also met once we identified the effective injection rates here the key to solving the effective injection rate issue due to partial free convection of injected tracer was recognising that the correct inflow profile must explain both the transient profiles tracer front progress indicating flow velocities and the steady state profile overall dilutions that is reducing the injection rate allowed the model to fit the steady state profile without altering the fit to the transient profiles as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis fig 7 b by identifying in well flow velocities and thus qi z the transient profiles also helped constrain the other unknown ci z for each aquifer inflow thus while the method can be used with just the steady state profile these points highlight how good transient profiles can improve confidence in the results for lhrp4 the interpreted inflow zones were similar between the two tracer test orientations and the flowmeter but the flowmeter gave significantly different proportions from each zone for well wb11ah001 the situation was complicated by heterogeneity and a strong ambient flow regime here we examine each of these important issues tracer density potential inflow bias with the flowmeter and issues with strong ambient flows and heterogeneity 8 1 tracer density issues the relative importance of forced convection and free convection in a mixed flow regime can be assessed with a mixed convection ratio although both forms of convection are always active for practical purposes mixed convection is considered where free and forced convection are roughly of commensurate strength a mixed convection ratio or dimensionless number allows thresholds to be established beyond which one type of convection dominates over the other this has been done for porous media in the groundwater literature e g massmann et al 2006 while the fluid mechanics literature provides an analogue for mixed convective flow within a well van sommeren et al 2013 describe experiments in which a dense solute was injected into upward flow in a vertical square pipe for different combinations of flow rate and density contrast each characterised by a densiometric froude number although it is found in a range of forms for different applications the dimensionless froude number fr for this purpose is defined as van sommeren et al 2013 5 fr u u d 1 3 b s 1 3 where uu is the advective flow velocity l t in the well at the point of interest d is the well diameter l and bs is the buoyant source term which accounts for the density difference between the two fluids using the boussinesq approximation as 6 b s g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 q s where g is acceleration due to gravity l t t ρ and ρ0 are the density m l3 of the source tracer and background aquifer water respectively and qs is the source injection rate or inflow rate l3 t we interpreted their results on the depth of the buoyant mixing zone as a function of froude number to indicate a threshold for considering tracer density issues fig 8 at about fr 0 1 free convection dominated and the mixing zone was large or did not stabilise while at fr 0 6 forced convection dominated and the mixing zone was small to negligible meaning that all of the solute was transported upwards a region of mixed convection occurred within these bounds 0 1 fr 0 6 in which a steady depth of mixing developed although not tested we can infer that buoyancy assists rather than opposes transport of a dense tracer in a downward flow regime the strength of this effect is uncertain but based on our results from well 6628 21204 which showed very good agreement of both test orientations we infer that the effect is probably small over the timeframe of this test with a threshold established i e fr 0 6 we can assess the role of free convection in our tracer tests and provide a tool for planning all types of in well tracer tests involving a density contrast this includes those where de ionised water is used to contrast with the natural salinity of groundwater e g doughty and tsang 2005 for example if the salt concentration is zero in a well and 726 mg l in inflowing aquifer water t 15 c the flow velocity in the well would need to be at least 0 21 m min for buoyancy not to affect how that water moves in fig 8 this point is where the orange line drops below the grey mixed convection zone with the tracer test described in this paper the large initial contrast between tracer solution and aquifer water quickly reduces as the low volume injection mixes with the high volume of water in the well so it is perhaps more realistic to consider the peak density difference measured in the well during the test for the purpose of calculating the density difference solute concentration was estimated as total dissolved solids from the measured ec tds mg l 0 6 ec us cm in well 6628 21204 we measured a maximum density contrast of 0 56 kg m3 t 15 c and an upward flow velocity of 0 25 m min at the injection point this gives fr 0 68 which is above the threshold for balanced mixed convection fig 8 indicating that forced convection dominates and indeed we did not observe any buoyancy effects in contrast in well lhrp4 we measured a maximum density contrast of 5 81 kg m3 t 30 c and an upward flow velocity of 0 17 m min at the injection point this gives fr 0 21 which is within the balanced mixed convection zone tending towards dominance of free convection fig 8 this is consistent with our experience of nearly half of the injected tracer sinking downwards instead of moving upwards as intended while in well wb11ah001 with a density contrast of just 0 45 kg m3 t 30 c the upwards flow needed to be at least 0 21 m min fr 0 6 to fully overcome buoyancy issues this was only achieved at the final injection location at 60 m according to the flowmeter data below that with injection at 70 m fr 0 56 and 90 m fr 0 35 the tracer moved downwards instead of upwards as intended buoyancy flows can enhance or retard transport in the vertical dimension depending on whether the advective flow is moving with gravity or against it jackson et al 1989 nield and bejan 2017 here the tracer was denser than aquifer water so it would tend to sink downwards under free convection thus tracer transport would be enhanced when free convection assists forced convection downward flow and retarded when it opposes forced convection upward flow in well lhrp4 this would cause the proportion of flow from the upper zone to be underestimated in both test orientations however the first arrival of tracer at the pump was slower with injection at the top than with injection at the bottom despite a higher pumping rate and the assisting downward flow with gravity this clearly indicates a smaller proportion of yield from the upper zone therefore we can say that opposing assisting free convection is not the main reason that the tracer test and flowmeter results differ although it may in part explain the difference between the two tracer test orientations 8 2 inflow bias with the flowmeter the unexpected small scale vertical fluctuations in the flowmeter measurements at the higher flow rates are repeatable two flow profiles are shown in fig 4 e but others were collected at different pumping rates on both well lhrp4 and well wb11ah001 and all show similar fluctuations at consistent depths this repeatability suggests a physical basis for the phenomenon e g voids existing in the gravel pack within the borehole annulus and hints at a potential issue with the data when using the flowmeter with the flow diverter the effective diameter of the well is the 0 025 m instrument annulus in this situation arnold and molz 2000 showed that head loss across the instrument is increasingly significant at flows above 10 l min using the nozzle equation verified by their work we calculated head loss profiles for our flowmeter data fig 9 a for reference the 10 l min threshold equates to a head loss of 0 007 m with the major inflow zone near the bottom of well lhrp4 flow rates quickly increased above the head loss threshold whereas in well wb11ah001 head loss was negligible until the major inflow zone in the upper part of the well in the upper part of both wells the head loss through the meter exceeded the drawdown 0 05 m induced by pumping thus it seems clear that the flowmeter was not the lowest resistance pathway to flow at these higher flow rates zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 clearly show the problem in this situation with more inflow drawn from the interval between the pump and flowmeter and the proportion of flow sourced from below i e passing through the meter being underestimated relative to the unimpeded inflow profile when we compare the flowmeter profiles to the flow profiles derived from the tracer test fig 9 b which did not obstruct the wellbore we can clearly see enhanced inflow from the uppermost zone in the flowmeter profiles which converged on the top of the screen this is also evident in the different positions of the vertical section of the profile 70 120 m in fig 9 b the fraction of flow from the lower inflow zone i e below the flowmeter was less in both flowmeter profiles than in the tracer tests particularly at the higher pumping rate thus we conclude that the flowmeter data are impacted by head losses whereas the tracer test is not and the correct flow profile is probably an average of the two tracer test orientations to avoid head loss issues with the flowmeter the flow diverter can be under sized more than we did or removed entirely and used with a centraliser clemo et al 2009 or even without one if flows are strong enough i e turbulent and the trolling mode is used newhouse et al 2005 a bypass flow factor is then included in the instrument calibration or in post processing the data e g paillet 2004 newhouse et al 2005 demonstrate that the em flowmeter is actually capable of measuring much higher flows than stated by the manufacturer however the trade off is a reduced sensitivity to slower flows because only a fraction passes through the sensor while a spinner meter could have measured the upper end of the flow regime in our wells 30 l min it would not be sensitive the majority of flow rates encountered thus it is challenging to accurately sense a wide range of in well flow rates in a single flowmeter profile a practical solution might be to combine the results of two separate profiles one with the full flow diverter and another with an under sized flow diverter to measure the higher flow rates 8 3 issues with strong ambient flows and heterogeneity our attempts to do the pumped tracer dilution test on well wb11ah001 illustrate the challenges with strong ambient flows heterogeneity and buoyancy issues with the ec tracer at low flow velocities in the well in the simple theoretical modelling of poulsen et al 2018 a weak ambient flow regime 0 5 l min was overcome with pumping at 4 5 times the ambient flow rate however this field example shows that the ambient regime is not so easily overcome in a heterogeneous environment with strong head gradients our pumping at 45 l min from above the screen only slightly reduced the downward ambient flow occurring in the lower part of the well while slightly enhancing the overlying upward flow regime fig 6 e we believe the two ambient regimes would be additive when considering a pumping rate to overcome them thus while our pumping rate was 3 9 times the total ambient flow rate 11 6 l min it seems a significantly higher rate would be needed to reverse the downward flow in the lower part of the well i e to draw down the water level in the well below the head in the aquifer we were unable to cause more than 0 04 m of drawdown in this high transmissivity well table 1 although the flowmeter is undoubtedly a practical solution to measure flows in wells like wb11ah001 a carefully designed tracer test could be applied in the interval over which flow can be induced towards the pump with a highly productive zone near the top it was difficult to generate flow lower in the well by pumping above the screen our tracer test could have been improved by using a neutrally buoyant tracer in the upward flow orientation or by placing the pump much lower in the downward flow orientation for the latter inflow from the upper producing zone would rapidly transport tracer downwards to the pump fitting the dilution model then requires an effective pumping rate the difference from the actual pumping rate would give the fraction of inflow from the un tested interval of the well below the pump 8 4 prognosis tracer dilution tests are of particular value to assess in well flows when a borehole flowmeter is not available but also to provide a complimentary line of evidence a good starting point is an un pumped tracer test e g maurice et al 2011 paillet 2012 to identify the ambient flow regime in the well to help with designing the pumped tracer test orientation injection depth pumping rate the ambient flow profile shows the actively outflowing zones which need to be reversed to inflowing to use the method reported here successful reversal would be evidenced by tracer dilution in those zones without some knowledge of vertical head gradients in the groundwater system the amount of pumping induced drawdown in the well necessary to cause inflow from all aquifer zones is uncertain however our experience suggests it would be prudent for the pumping rate to be at least an order of magnitude more than the ambient flow rate our method and that of brainerd and robbins 2004 is particularly suited to high discharge rates where water disposal is not an issue when there is a short tracer travel time in the well and turbulent flows actually assist with mixing tracer and aquifer inflows in the well there are practical limitations with long travel times so it is best to design the test to be completed in a single day simple calculations of velocities travel times and froude numbers for a range of potential scenarios can be used to assist with planning a test the choice of tracer type should be made with consideration to the potentially competing interests of achieving measurable concentration in pumped discharge and avoiding buoyancy issues at the injection point which may be subject to low flows even at high pumping rates thus any prior knowledge of flow zones gained from an ambient flow test would be valuable in positioning the injection point so that there is some driving flow in practice one must be prepared to do the tracer test in both orientations and or refine the configuration to optimise the results if there is a tracer buoyancy issue an unresolved effective injection rate is problematic for the test e g our first test on well wb11ah001 although it can still provide useful qualitative information about the flow regime an ideal tracer has zero background concentration and thus provides a wider range of detection but we believe there is merit in using a salt ec tracer because of its ready availability and ease of measurement obviously it is limited to situations where ec can be made significantly different than the background ec over the whole test interval which could mean using a low ec tracer in saline environments the utility of this method could be improved by 1 refining the theoretical basis of the model to properly deal with turbulent flow 2 experimentally assessing the role of free convection in the upwards and downwards orientations and 3 testing the utility of the dimensionless froude number reported here alternatively it would be advantageous to explore the use of a more neutrally buoyant tracer that can be measured at high resolution with a wireline sonde examples of such tracers that could be adapted for use in this test include fluorescent dye e g libby and robbins 2014 artificially increased dissolved oxygen e g chlebica and robbins 2013 or artificially altered temperature e g klepikova et al 2011 read et al 2014 9 conclusion this paper presents a combined field method and numerical model for a single well tracer dilution test to quantify the pumped flow regime in long screened or open borehole wells controlled boundary conditions are established by pumping to create a monotonically increasing flow regime in the well and simultaneously injecting a tracer at the opposite end of the interval to be characterised the test is unique in its efficacy to characterise the entire length of a well over a wide range of flow rates requiring little more than the time taken for tracer to travel from the injection point to the pump sequentially measured tracer concentration profiles are modelled with the advection dispersion equation by specifying for each inflow zone depth interval background tracer concentration and fraction of total yield the test results are consistent with em flowmeter data especially if density issues with the tracer are avoided or correctly interpreted the main challenges with ec as a tracer are determining the background concentration for each flowing zone and managing density related issues that arise at low flow rates this test not only provides an accessible alternative to a borehole flowmeter but it also provides a complimentary line of evidence to improve resolution of the in well flow regime it has the potential to provide a wider dynamic range of flow rate sensitivity particularly in situations where using a packer with the flowmeter is problematic such as screened and gravel packed wells this approach using existing wells can provide considerable information on aquifer hydraulics and chemistry without the cost of

6444,growing demand for biomass derived fuels has resulted in an increase in bioenergy projects in recent years a trend that is expected to continue however broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences accordingly the goal of this study is to investigate how forest based bioenergy development may affect hydrological systems at the watershed scale specifically this study addresses hybrid poplar cultivation for biofuel production in a snow dominated watershed in northern wisconsin usa the soil and water assessment tool swat calibrated and validated for streamflow and biomass production cycles is used to evaluate the effects of land use change corresponding to a range of biofuel development scenarios the biofuel scenarios follow physically based rules for land use conversion to poplar plantations from hay pasture and forested lands along with a suite of alternative management practices including rotation time planting density fertilizer application and irrigation trade offs between biomass production fertilizer use and hydrologic alteration are evaluated for the feedstock production system the highest density 1111 trees 100 m2 and shortest rotation 5 year treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass the high efficiency is due to optimal relationships between leaf area index biomass production and n uptake at annual or greater time scales the simulated conversion to poplar had minimal effect on et and streamflows however in summer months the et from the poplar substantially exceeds that of the original land use so that streamflows decrease by as much as 50 irrigation to meet soil water deficits increased biomass

biofuel feedstock will be 42 2 million hectares fraiture et al 2008 several researchers have argued that biomass production could eventually be the largest water consumer around the world e g berndes 2002 fraiture et al 2008 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 replacing existing crops with biofuel crops can influence effective rainfall and soil moisture apart from altering the climate due to a change in interception and evapotranspiration which can have significant implications for surface runoff and groundwater recharge stephens et al 2001 the expansion of bioenergy crop production will increase the amount of water use through evapotranspiration and reallocate water resources from available water for human consumption to the atmosphere as water vapor berndes 2002 this evaporative loss could reduce already impacted groundwater recharge rates and exacerbate the water table declines that are occurring in many parts of the world king et al 2013 several studies have addressed the hydrologic impacts of first generation bioenergy feedstock development e g schilling et al 2008 love and nejadhashemi 2011 babel et al 2011 yield and biomass production for some second generation biofuel crops have also been investigated truax et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 and several studies have addressed the hydrologic impacts of second generation biofuel feedstock production cibin et al 2016 fischer et al 2013 wu and liu 2012 wu et al 2012 ng et al 2010 however none of these previous studies of second generation feedstock have directly addressed the tradeoff between biomass production and hydrologic impact second generation bioenergy is based on the cellulosic fraction of crops or other biomass including woody biomass intensive planting short rotation cultivation of trees is one strategy to increase woody biomass productivity in short rotations dry matter and bark production can be three to five times higher than natural stands producing up to 20 000 kg ha year hansen and baker 1979 poplar in particular can be a very productive genus if planted in high density and short rotation moreover it is a valuable raw material for reconstituted forest products due to its genetic diversity rapid growth vegetative propagation ease and coppice regeneration guo et al 2015 while cellulosic feedstocks can provide environmental benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services their potential impact on streamflow within a watershed should be carefully considered usepa 2018 moreover studies are needed to determine the extent to which observed hydrologic changes associated with changes in land use and land management can be attributed to biofuel feedstock production usepa 2018 this emphasizes the need for more research on various second generation biofuels crops because the local effects of biofuel crop production are dependent on the selected feedstock soil climate and watershed management practices engel et al 2010 promotion of sustainable biofuel production projects that have minimal hydrologic and water quality impacts calls for the scientific assessment of regional feedstock production impacts on watershed scales gopalakrishnan et al 2009 engel et al 2010 watkins et al 2015 in any given geographic and climatic context it is vital to identify biofuel crops and management strategies that have minimal adverse consequences on the environment thomas et al 2009 as in any cropping system understanding the interactions between the time scales of crop cultivation and hydroclimatology is critical for assessing the impacts of biofuel feedstocks on the hydrologic cycle the important time scales include those of crop planting rate of growth and harvesting and seasonality of precipitation runoff solar radiation and temperature furthermore variations in crop cultivation practices such as planting intensity harvest time irrigation and fertilizer application can be considerable and may have substantial impacts on water quantity and quality however little attention has been paid to temporal interactions and variations in cultivation practices in the literature on the hydrologic impacts of bioenergy feedstock development watershed models are essential tools for investigating the complex nature of processes that affect the hydrologic cycle in response to land use changes agricultural activities and best management practices singh et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 argued that proper parametrization of crops to improve growth simulation cycles is a crucial step for assessing the sustainability of bioenergy feedstock production and several studies have focused on improving plant growth parameters for more accurate production estimates e g guo et al 2018 guo et al 2015 ng et al 2010 accordingly the goals of this study are to use watershed and plant growth modeling tools to determine how biofuel feedstock cultivation will impact hydrological systems and to assess the tradeoffs between hydrologic impacts and biomass production specific objectives are to calibrate and validate a soil and water assessment tool swat model for a case study of poplar cultivation in a watershed in northern wisconsin usa including calibration of both hydrologic and poplar growth sub models the calibrated model is used to assess impacts of planting intensities and harvest cycles additional objectives are to improve understanding of relationships between leaf area index lai biomass growth and hydrologic impacts as well as evaluate the interannual variability of the impacts model results are presented as tradeoffs between biomass yield water use and fertilizer application 2 model setup calibration and validation 2 1 study area the upper mississippi river basin umrb which includes wisconsin plays a central role in the u s production of biofuel wu et al 2012 and a significant portion of the feedstock required for the u s biofuel industry to meet renewable energy targets could be grown in the umrb therefore this case study focuses on cellulosic ethanol from poplar plantations in northern wisconsin usa the spirit river watershed in lincoln county wisconsin fig 1 was selected based on data availability and a proposed cellulosic ethanol plant in the western upper peninsula of michigan within an economically viable harvest radius the watershed is representative of the area that is heavily forested and includes wetlands and forested wetlands with a mix of state federal and private forests in the state of wisconsin forests make up 6 9 million hectares kurtz 2017 in the northern part of the state 70 of the forests stands are aspen populus spp dnr 2016 field measurements in vilas and oneida counties found the aspen ages to range from 11 to 45 years these aspen dominated sites were originally clear cut and left to regenerate without additional management phifer 2017 2 2 model input and setup swat was chosen as the hydrologic modeling platform for this study swat is a physically based complex continuous simulation model with spatially explicit parameterization arnold et al 2000 it allows simultaneous simulation of hydrology plant growth and nutrient balances furthermore the model simulates a variety of agricultural practices fertilizer and manure application tillage irrigation wetlands ponds as well as buffer strips and it has been used to simulate biofuel development around the world for different crops including poplar hillard 2017 love and nejadhashemi 2011 powers et al 2011 cibin et al 2016 the spirit river at spirit falls wisconsin usgs hydrologic station usgs 05393500 was selected as the watershed outlet and long term daily flow data 1978 2010 were assembled the contributing area to the gage was found to be 222 km2 using the 10 m digital elevation model from the national elevation dataset and arcgis 10 4 land use land cover data from the national land cover database nlcd 1992 2001 2006 and 2011 and soil survey geographic database ssurgo were downloaded from the us department of agriculture geospatial data gateway soil survey staff the four land cover maps were analyzed to determine the changes in the land cover of the area and to produce the business as usual trend based on the observed changes maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation data were compiled from the noaa national center for environmental information from five nearby weather stations the area receives an average of 810 mm of precipitation annually with the majority of rainfall occurring during the period of june through september the average annual temperature is 4 5 c the area receives a significant amount of snowfall annually 170 mm water equivalent based on swat snowmelt simulations with the majority of snowfall occurring from november to april snow accumulation and snowmelt are dominant hydrological processes in the watershed fig 2 shows the intra annual variation of streamflow temperature and precipitation the highest monthly average streamflow is in april as a result of snowmelt runoff efficiency was calculated as the ratio of annual stream flow to annual precipitation in the watershed lo 1992 the average runoff efficiency is around 0 4 with a range from 0 25 to 0 58 depending on the amount and distribution of precipitation each year although the months of june to september receive a considerable amount of precipitation the average stream flow is low because of high et rates during that period a rainfall runoff analysis shows that most rain events during these months do not result in high stream flows because much of the rainfall is intercepted by the canopy or infiltrates into dry soils however rainfall events during october and november typically contribute significantly to the streamflow arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 winchell et al 2013 was used to set up the model the watershed was divided into 9 sub watersheds in order to represent spatial variability the sub basins are further subdivided into non contiguous hydrologic response units hrus which represent homogeneous areas within the sub basin with unique combinations of land use soil type and slope class during the hru definition thresholds for retaining classes of land surface properties of 0 10 and 15 were selected for land use land cover lulc soils and slope classes respectively resulting in 286 hrus forested wetlands and open water comprise 19 of the watershed land cover and thus wetlands were introduced into the model wetland functionality is described in detail in swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 and the details on wetlands parametrization are presented in the supplementary materials 2 3 model calibration and validation calibration and validation focused on both the hydrologic and plant growth components of the model analysis was performed for 32 years from 1980 to 2011 in order to include a combination of dry and wet years in both the calibration period 1980 1999 and validation period 2000 2011 the model was calibrated on a daily time step for higher accuracy however the poplar growth simulations were conducted on a monthly time step the hydrologic calibration proceeded through a multiple step process using a combination of manual adjustments and an automatic calibration method performance metrics included the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias gupta et al 1999 in order to improve model reliability the ratio of baseflow to total flow was also required to be in a reasonable range the first step in the calibration process was to analyze long term daily flow data to separate baseflow from surface runoff using arnold s method arnold and allen 1999 a sensitivity analysis resulted in ratios of baseflow to total flow ranging from 0 42 to 0 59 on an annual basis the next step was to conduct sensitivity analysis to identify critical model parameters based on literature arnold et al 2012 and prior experience 23 parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis which was conducted using the p value and t statistic sensitivity tests in swatcup sufi2 abbaspour 2013 a total of 500 iterations were performed with each parameter varying within a feasible range results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in table s1 of the supplementary materials the final calibration step involved adjusting the sensitive parameters to values available in literature which ensures that each parameter stays in a range that is physically feasible in this step parameters were grouped according to hydrologic process including runoff snowmelt baseflow and routing detailed calibration steps and the final adjusted parameter values are presented in table s1 in supplementary materials calibration of the plant growth model in swat was based on measured poplar growth data in wisconsin including lai total biomass and leaves biomass zavitkovski 1983 table s2 the poplar plantations were short rotation intensive plantations at the united states department of agriculture usda forest service harshaw experimental farm near rhinelander with measurements occurring over the period of 1970 to 1976 hansen and baker 1979 ek and dawson 1976 since swat does not have a parameter for planting density three parameters were adjusted to represent that management variable maximum potential leaf area index blai years to maximum lai and light extinction coefficient the leaf area index lai is typically higher for higher planting intensities while the years to maximum lai can be expected to be shorter for higher planting densities because they reach a high lai in only a few years matching the lai is important because it is a key driver of the actual transpiration therefore lai was first calibrated by changing blai and years to maximum lai and then the biomass production parameters were adjusted to match observed biomass the light extinction coefficient is related to the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and is expected to be higher for short rotation high intensities jiang et al 2017 several of the plant parameters suggested by guo et al 2015 were also used to improve the simulation of hybrid poplar growth table s3 in the supplementary materials lists the adjusted plant parameters full descriptions of each parameter are presented in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 to calibrate the poplar growth parameters a second swat model hereafter referred to as usda watershed was set up to represent the experimental plots at the usda facility a small watershed 13 5 km2 encompassing the facility was delineated see fig 1 maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation data were compiled from the noaa national center for environmental information for the rhinelander wi station ghcnd usc00477113 for the period of 1968 to 1980 representing climatic conditions similar to those of the nearby spirit falls watershed all planting density and rotation treatments were simulated assuming optimal irrigation and fertilization and results were compared to the measured biomass at the usda facility and the simulated biomass in the spirit falls watershed 2 4 modeling scenarios the calibrated and validated model was used to simulate 70 biofuel development scenarios to investigate the impacts of planting density harvest timing fertilizer application and irrigation on biomass generation nutrient accumulation in the soil and water demand as summarized in table s4 in these scenarios the base case refers to the 2011 land cover conditions fig 1c before any biofuel development scenario is imposed for the biofuel development scenarios five planting density harvesting rotations reported by hansen and baker 1979 and zavitkovski 1983 were used in this study table s2 including a density of 1111 trees 100 m2 and a 5 year rotation 278 trees 100 m2 and 5 year rotation 83 trees 100 m2 and 6 year rotation 25 trees 100 m2 and 6 year rotation and 17 trees 100 m2 and 10 year rotation the fertilization rate of 164 kg n ha year reported by guo et al 2015 was used for the highest fertilization treatment scenario along with five lower fertilizer application rates 5 1 10 2 20 5 41 82 kg n ha year and a no fertilization scenario in order to study fertilizer impacts on biomass production lastly no irrigation and supplemental irrigation scenarios were simulated the supplemental irrigation rates were based on plant water demand simulated by swat and it was assumed that the water comes from a source outside of the watershed treatments are identified according to the number of trees per 100 m2 and the harvest cycle length followed by ir if they were irrigated e g 83 6ir means a fully fertilized treatment with 83 trees 100 m2 in a 6 year rotation with irrigation land cover analysis showed little change in the land cover from 1992 to 2011 with the dominant land cover 66 5 being forest fig 1 assumptions for determining areas for biofuel development were that plantations would not compete with food crops paine et al 1996 and no urban or wetland areas would be converted leaving forest hay and rangelands as available area following a spin up period to obtain initial conditions each simulation occurs over the 30 year period 1981 to 2010 using the corresponding hydroclimate time series this period allows for a range of climate conditions to be represented as well as several rotations for each harvesting interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation as shown in fig 3 the simulated versus the measured discharges at the outlet of the watershed demonstrate that the calibration and verification performance of the hydrologic model was good the nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 8 r2 of 0 8 and pbias of 1 also indicate good hydrologic model performance moriasi et al 2007 table 1 results of the lai and biomass calibration for the usda watershed are shown in fig 4 the simulated lai also matches the observed lai reasonably well as shown in fig 4b except for two years before harvest although the biomass growth model overpredicts the biomass in the years leading up to harvest fig 4a it is the biomass at the time of harvest that accounts for total biomass production and the final biomass is matched closely by the biomass growth model accurately simulating the entire growth cycle and variation of lai and biomass has been reported as beyond the abilities of swat and even plant growth models such as almanac guo et al 2015 the agreement between the simulated and observed lai is important because the lai controls et fluxes and canopy interception in the swat model the results of the lai and biomass growth simulations in the spirit falls watershed are very similar to the simulated values in the nearby usda watershed although lai and growth are modeled over several rotations these results are shown in table 2 and fig 5 with fig 5 clearly showing the cyclic nature of the rotations table s4 in the supplementary materials provides a comparison of the simulated aboveground biomass in the spirit falls watershed with the measured biomass in the nearby usda watershed 3 2 impacts of planting density rotation lengths and fertilizer application the results from 50 of the 70 simulations are summarized in table s5 including planting intensity harvest cycle biomass production nitrogen applied and remaining nitrogen in the soil irrigation water applied et at the watershed scale and over the converted area and streamflow the watershed outlet treatments with more than 41 kg n ha yr are omitted as more fertilizer did not produce additional biomass fig 6 shows the relationship between fertilizer application rate and biomass production for all the irrigated treatments these results indicate that the biomass production is heavily dependent on nitrogen availability and for most treatments there is a maximum fertilizer application rate at which minimal improvement in biomass growth is achieved the strong dependency of the poplar growth on nitrogen availability and the occurrence of maximum fertilizer application rates has been reported in many hybrid poplar growth studies truax et al 2012 brown and driessche 2002 stanruf et al 2001 coleman et al 2006 chemical input during the feedstock production stage has the highest water quality impact across biofuel production processes usepa 2011 accordingly avoiding over fertilization is crucial to mitigate this impact for all applied fertilizer amounts the 1111 5 treatment produces the highest biomass followed by the 278 5 treatment the higher biomass from more intensive planting is a result of higher light interception the 25 6 treatment has significantly poorer performance in terms of biomass production mainly as a result of lower light interception and lower lai early in the harvest cycle a longer rotation might improve production under the 25 6 treatment scenario considering interannual variability the 1987 1992 rotation produces less biomass than other rotations 2 5 ton ha harvest cycle lower than average the limiting factor preventing optimal growth was temperature stress resulting from cold weather during the 1992 season a similar trend for the 1111 5 and 278 5 treatments during the 1991 1995 rotation was observed resulting in approximately 3 ton ha harvest cycle lower production it should be noted that during calibration the base temperature and optimum temperature parameters were reduced to simulate this particular hybrid poplar species 3 3 impacts on water use for hydrologic impact analysis additional water use associated with the conversion from existing land cover to poplar cultivation is defined as the water used for irrigation and the difference in et between the existing land uses and the land converted to poplar fig 7 shows the average inter and intra annual et rates in the converted portion of the watershed for the 83 6 irrigated treatment demonstrating a substantial increase in et due to poplar cultivation averaged across all simulated treatments the et rates for the converted area are 555 mm year and 534 mm year for irrigated and non irrigated conditions respectively which are 29 and 24 higher than for the existing land covers these et rates for poplar are in the middle of ranges reported values from europe asia us and canada fischer et al 2013 the et cycles in fig 7a are a result of annual climate variations for the base case existing land uses the cycles for the 83 6 irrigated treatment on the other hand are influenced by both climate variations and the timing of the poplar harvest the et rate is continuously increasing as the tree biomass and lai increase each year until the trees are harvested fig 7b shows that the et rates for the converted portion of the watershed are significantly higher during the growing season with the peak difference during the month of june the effect of irrigation on watershed wide streamflow is demonstrated in fig 8 where the reduction in streamflow due to a given treatment is plotted against the increase in watershed wide et for the treatment as expected for the no irrigation treatments the decrease in streamflow roughly correlates with the increase in et for the no irrigation treatments increases in watershed wide et range between 8 and 23 and decreases in watershed wide streamflow range from 10 to 25 the irrigated treatments have higher et because there is more available water greater biomass production and lai but the impact of higher et on streamflow is offset directly by return flows from irrigation and indirectly due to higher soil moisture that reduces the soil infiltration capacity and increases runoff from subsequent rainfall events on average across the treatments the annual irrigation of 38 mm year results in an increase of et by 20 mm year and the remainder contributes to the streamflow as return flow scenario a in fig 8 corresponding to the 1111 5ir fertilized treatment 5 1 kg n ha year has a high biomass production as well as high nitrogen and water use efficiency the 1111 5 treatments in general have the highest biomass production and highest nutrient and water use efficiency in contrast scenario b which represents the 17 10ir fertilized treatment 20 5 kg n ha year has significantly higher et due to irrigation this can be explained by the fact that in longer rotations the trees maintain high lai over longer periods several years leading to higher et and water demand while in shorter rotations the trees are harvested as they reach a high lai in swat et is directly influenced by the lai and the effect of lai on et rate is reported in other studies e g fischer et al 2013 in comparing point b with point c which represents the 25 6ir fertilized 20 5 kg n ha year treatment the reason for the smaller decrease in streamflow for the 17 10 ir point b treatment is that this treatment receives much more irrigation water which contributes to the streamflow 3 4 tradeoffs fig 9 summarizes the tradeoffs between annual biomass production water use and fertilizer application for irrigated and non irrigated cases the x and y axes show biomass production vs water use respectively and the size of the symbol relates to the magnitude of fertilizer use the no irrigation and irrigation treatments with the largest cumulative biomass production and lowest increased water use are labelled as points d e f and g all of these are 1111 5 treatments suggesting that high planting densities and short rotations offer the best tradeoff between biomass production and water use fertilizer application rates for points d and f are 41 kg n ha year and the rates for points e and g are 20 5 kg n ha year indicating that the higher fertilization rate produces only 1 2 more biomass the remaining points in fig 9 have substantially lower biomass production lower fertilizer application rates and either lower planting densities or longer rotations resulting in substantially lower biomass production comparison of points d and e with points f and g indicates that biomass is increased by 3 and 6 with irrigation but at the cost of increases in water use of 13 although the simulations show that irrigation does not produce substantially more biomass on average irrigation can be critical for mitigating the impacts of dry years especially when a dry year coincides with later years in the rotation cycle when the trees have higher water demand the average irrigation rates over the rotation cycles range from as low as 13 8 mm year in the 1981 86 cycle when wet years average 1037 mm year occur in the last two years of rotation the highest average irrigation requirement over a rotation 64 2 mm year occurred in the 2001 05 cycle as a result of two dry years average 681 mm year precipitation at the end of the rotation fig 10 shows that intra and interannual variations in climate can produce severe decreases in streamflow due to conversion to poplar fig 10a shows that july is the most critical month with an average decrease of 48 in average monthly flows in fig 10b the cumulative probability density of july streamflows over the simulation period indicates a significant shift downward in high flows q90 q95 and q99 decreases by 45 high flows are reduced due to lower soil moisture and higher canopy interception for the poplar converted land compared to the existing forest cover especially in the last years of each rotation when lai and water demand are high low flows indicated by q1 q5 and q10 decreased on average by 32 on average for all the planting intensities to produce 1 ton of poplar biomass on 1 ha of land there is a need for around 128 mm of water and 9 4 kg n to be applied with 5 1 kg n uptake by the trees table 3 shows that the 1111 5 treatment requires the least amount of total and extra water followed by the 278 5 treatment however it should be noted that hybrid poplar plantations with lower planting densities have longer rotations and more flexible harvest scheduling as well as lower costs strong and hansen 1993 which are not considered in this analysis it remains to be seen whether high density short rotation treatments will be adopted by poplar plantation managers to evaluate the potential for large scale biofuel feedstock development in the region the four surrounding counties oneida lincoln price and taylor were analyzed and found to have 50 forested land similar to the case study watershed hay rangelands and herbaceous cover accounted for 4 of the area therefore the scenario implemented in the model can be considered representative for the four county region where up to 6200 km2 could be available for biofuel development water quality measurements were not available for this study and thus simulated n transport and water quality were not reported however the n uptake in swat is based on measured n content of the tree in three life stages based on these results the quantities of n added n uptake and n available for potential pollution impacts are provided see table s5 for detailed results a study of water quality impacts of poplar development in this region remain as important future work 4 conclusions a swat model was calibrated and validated to simulate the daily streamflow of a relatively humid watershed in northern wisconsin the plant growth component of the model was also calibrated to match the lai growth and biomass production of poplar trees using measured data from a nearby research plot the plant growth improvements enabled the model to simulate different planting densities as there is no direct parameter in swat to account for different planting densities seventy different scenarios of poplar plantation with different management treatments densities harvest period irrigation and fertilization over a 30 year period were simulated results show that poplar development increases the total et of the watershed substantially during the growing season june to december this causes lower streamflow during the growing season and makes the already low flow months of july and august more critical furthermore the decline in streamflow becomes more severe in the final years of each rotation when trees have higher lai and more water demand analysis of the stream flow shows that the poplar trees take up the moisture from the soil and cause the baseflow to be more affected than the surface flow inspection of the interannual impacts led to two important discoveries first temperature stress can reduce biomass production even if the trees are fertilized and irrigated second in a relatively humid watershed the average impact of irrigation on biomass production may be minimal but there may be a significant benefit from irrigation if the last year in a harvest cycle is a dry year in contrast to the effects of irrigation tree growth and biomass production are significantly dependent on n availability making fertilization a necessary management treatment model results indicate that adding fertilizer leads to remarkably higher biomass production up to a level of about 41 kgn ha year but additional fertilizer beyond this level does not enhance biomass production but only increases the amount of n remaining in the soil with the potential to contribute to non point source pollution the highest density 1111 trees 100 m2 and shortest rotation 5 year treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass the next highest density 278 trees 100 m2 treatments follow closely in terms of production and efficiency high density plantings and short rotations are found to be efficient in terms of water and fertilizer inputs because the trees are harvested as soon as they reach maximum lai values while in longer rotations the trees are kept at higher lai for longer periods leading to higher water use moreover the higher planting densities capture more solar radiation represented by a higher light extinction coefficient which results in higher biomass production declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

6444,growing demand for biomass derived fuels has resulted in an increase in bioenergy projects in recent years a trend that is expected to continue however broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences accordingly the goal of this study is to investigate how forest based bioenergy development may affect hydrological systems at the watershed scale specifically this study addresses hybrid poplar cultivation for biofuel production in a snow dominated watershed in northern wisconsin usa the soil and water assessment tool swat calibrated and validated for streamflow and biomass production cycles is used to evaluate the effects of land use change corresponding to a range of biofuel development scenarios the biofuel scenarios follow physically based rules for land use conversion to poplar plantations from hay pasture and forested lands along with a suite of alternative management practices including rotation time planting density fertilizer application and irrigation trade offs between biomass production fertilizer use and hydrologic alteration are evaluated for the feedstock production system the highest density 1111 trees 100 m2 and shortest rotation 5 year treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass the high efficiency is due to optimal relationships between leaf area index biomass production and n uptake at annual or greater time scales the simulated conversion to poplar had minimal effect on et and streamflows however in summer months the et from the poplar substantially exceeds that of the original land use so that streamflows decrease by as much as 50 irrigation to meet soil water deficits increased biomass production but only by 4 on average which is not surprising for a temperate humid watershed keywords bioenergy development watershed modeling energy water nexus cultivation practices hydrologic impacts 1 introduction climate change mitigation and energy security are two of the primary motivations for moving toward renewable energy gerbens leenes et al 2012 energy demand is predicted to increase one third by 2035 howells et al 2013 and the prospect of sustained high oil prices is encouraging the use of alternative forms of energy guo et al 2015 for example using bioenergy sources such as drop in biofuels can address the growing need for cleaner and sustainable fuels in the transportation sector gerbens leenes et al 2012 winjobi et al 2018 the energy independence and security act eisa has set a target amount of 136 billion l year of renewable fuel in the u s transportation fuel mix and cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel are expected to contribute 44 and 3 respectively to this goal usepa 2010 as progress is made towards this goal the number of bioenergy projects in the u s is expected to grow globally it has been estimated that by 2030 the area of land devoted to biofuel feedstock will be 42 2 million hectares fraiture et al 2008 several researchers have argued that biomass production could eventually be the largest water consumer around the world e g berndes 2002 fraiture et al 2008 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 replacing existing crops with biofuel crops can influence effective rainfall and soil moisture apart from altering the climate due to a change in interception and evapotranspiration which can have significant implications for surface runoff and groundwater recharge stephens et al 2001 the expansion of bioenergy crop production will increase the amount of water use through evapotranspiration and reallocate water resources from available water for human consumption to the atmosphere as water vapor berndes 2002 this evaporative loss could reduce already impacted groundwater recharge rates and exacerbate the water table declines that are occurring in many parts of the world king et al 2013 several studies have addressed the hydrologic impacts of first generation bioenergy feedstock development e g schilling et al 2008 love and nejadhashemi 2011 babel et al 2011 yield and biomass production for some second generation biofuel crops have also been investigated truax et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 and several studies have addressed the hydrologic impacts of second generation biofuel feedstock production cibin et al 2016 fischer et al 2013 wu and liu 2012 wu et al 2012 ng et al 2010 however none of these previous studies of second generation feedstock have directly addressed the tradeoff between biomass production and hydrologic impact second generation bioenergy is based on the cellulosic fraction of crops or other biomass including woody biomass intensive planting short rotation cultivation of trees is one strategy to increase woody biomass productivity in short rotations dry matter and bark production can be three to five times higher than natural stands producing up to 20 000 kg ha year hansen and baker 1979 poplar in particular can be a very productive genus if planted in high density and short rotation moreover it is a valuable raw material for reconstituted forest products due to its genetic diversity rapid growth vegetative propagation ease and coppice regeneration guo et al 2015 while cellulosic feedstocks can provide environmental benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services their potential impact on streamflow within a watershed should be carefully considered usepa 2018 moreover studies are needed to determine the extent to which observed hydrologic changes associated with changes in land use and land management can be attributed to biofuel feedstock production usepa 2018 this emphasizes the need for more research on various second generation biofuels crops because the local effects of biofuel crop production are dependent on the selected feedstock soil climate and watershed management practices engel et al 2010 promotion of sustainable biofuel production projects that have minimal hydrologic and water quality impacts calls for the scientific assessment of regional feedstock production impacts on watershed scales gopalakrishnan et al 2009 engel et al 2010 watkins et

any cropping system understanding the interactions between the time scales of crop cultivation and hydroclimatology is critical for assessing the impacts of biofuel feedstocks on the hydrologic cycle the important time scales include those of crop planting rate of growth and harvesting and seasonality of precipitation runoff solar radiation and temperature furthermore variations in crop cultivation practices such as planting intensity harvest time irrigation and fertilizer application can be considerable and may have substantial impacts on water quantity and quality however little attention has been paid to temporal interactions and variations in cultivation practices in the literature on the hydrologic impacts of bioenergy feedstock development watershed models are essential tools for investigating the complex nature of processes that affect the hydrologic cycle in response to land use changes agricultural activities and best management practices singh et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 argued that proper parametrization of crops to improve growth simulation cycles is a crucial step for assessing the sustainability of bioenergy feedstock production and several studies have focused on improving plant growth parameters for more accurate production estimates e g guo et al 2018 guo et al 2015 ng et al 2010 accordingly the goals of this study are to use watershed and plant growth modeling tools to determine how biofuel feedstock cultivation will impact hydrological systems and to assess the tradeoffs between hydrologic impacts and biomass production specific objectives are to calibrate and validate a soil and water assessment tool swat model for a case study of poplar cultivation in a watershed in northern wisconsin usa including calibration of both hydrologic and poplar growth sub models the calibrated model is used to assess impacts of planting intensities and harvest cycles additional objectives are to improve understanding of relationships between leaf area index lai biomass growth and hydrologic impacts as well as evaluate the interannual variability of the impacts model results are presented as tradeoffs between biomass yield water use and fertilizer application 2 model setup calibration and validation 2 1 study area the upper mississippi river basin umrb which includes wisconsin plays a central role in the u s production of biofuel wu et al 2012 and a significant portion of the feedstock required for the u s biofuel industry to meet renewable energy targets could be grown in the umrb therefore this case study focuses on cellulosic ethanol from poplar plantations in northern wisconsin usa the spirit river watershed in lincoln county wisconsin fig 1 was selected based on data availability and a proposed cellulosic ethanol plant in the western upper peninsula of michigan within an economically viable harvest radius the watershed is representative of the area that is heavily forested and includes wetlands and forested wetlands with a mix of state federal and private forests in the state of wisconsin forests make up 6 9 million hectares kurtz 2017 in the northern part of the state 70 of the forests stands are aspen populus spp dnr 2016 field measurements in vilas and oneida counties found the aspen ages to range from 11 to 45 years these aspen dominated sites were originally clear cut and left to regenerate without additional management phifer 2017 2 2 model input and setup swat was chosen as the hydrologic modeling platform for this study swat is a physically based complex continuous simulation model with spatially explicit parameterization arnold et al 2000 it allows simultaneous simulation of hydrology plant growth and nutrient balances furthermore the model simulates a variety of agricultural practices fertilizer and manure application tillage irrigation wetlands ponds as well as buffer strips and it has been used to simulate biofuel development around the world for different crops including poplar hillard 2017 love and nejadhashemi 2011 powers et al 2011 cibin et al 2016 the spirit river at spirit falls wisconsin usgs hydrologic station usgs 05393500 was selected as the watershed outlet and long term daily flow data 1978 2010 were assembled the contributing area to the gage was found to be 222 km2 using the 10 m digital elevation model from the national elevation dataset and arcgis 10 4 land use land cover data from the national land cover database nlcd 1992 2001 2006 and 2011 and soil survey geographic database ssurgo were downloaded from the us department of agriculture geospatial data gateway soil survey staff the four land cover maps were analyzed to determine the changes in the land cover of the area and to produce the business as usual trend based on the observed changes maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation data were compiled from the noaa national center for environmental information from five nearby weather stations the area receives an average of 810 mm of precipitation annually with the majority of rainfall occurring during the period of june through september the average annual temperature is 4 5 c the area receives a significant amount of snowfall annually 170 mm water equivalent based on swat snowmelt simulations with the majority of snowfall occurring from november to april snow accumulation and snowmelt are dominant hydrological processes in the watershed fig 2 shows the intra annual variation of streamflow temperature and precipitation the highest monthly average streamflow is in april as a result of snowmelt runoff efficiency was calculated as the ratio of annual stream flow to annual precipitation in the watershed lo 1992 the average runoff efficiency is around 0 4 with a range from 0 25 to 0 58 depending on the amount and distribution of precipitation each year although the months of june to september receive a considerable amount of precipitation the average stream flow is low because of high et rates during that period a rainfall runoff analysis shows that most rain events during these months do not result in high stream flows because much of the rainfall is intercepted by the canopy or infiltrates into dry soils however rainfall events during october and november typically contribute significantly to the streamflow arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 winchell et al 2013 was used to set up the model the watershed was divided into 9 sub watersheds in order to represent spatial variability the sub basins are further subdivided into non contiguous hydrologic response units hrus which represent homogeneous areas within the sub basin with unique combinations of land use soil type and slope class during the hru definition thresholds for retaining classes of land surface properties of 0 10 and 15 were selected for land use land cover lulc soils and slope classes respectively resulting in 286 hrus forested wetlands and open water comprise 19 of the watershed land cover and thus wetlands were introduced into the model wetland functionality is described in detail in swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 and the details on wetlands parametrization are presented in the supplementary materials 2 3 model calibration and validation calibration and validation focused on both the hydrologic and plant growth components of the model analysis was performed for 32 years from 1980 to 2011 in order to include a combination of dry and wet years in both the calibration period 1980 1999 and validation period 2000 2011 the model was calibrated on a daily time step for higher accuracy however the poplar growth simulations were conducted on a monthly time step the hydrologic calibration proceeded through a multiple step process using a combination of manual adjustments and an automatic calibration method performance metrics included the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias gupta et al 1999 in order to improve model reliability the ratio of baseflow to total flow was also required to be in a reasonable range the first step in the calibration process was to analyze long term daily flow data to separate baseflow from surface runoff using arnold s method arnold and allen 1999 a sensitivity analysis resulted in ratios of baseflow to total flow ranging from 0 42 to 0 59 on an annual basis the next step was to conduct sensitivity analysis to identify critical model parameters based on literature arnold et al 2012 and prior experience 23 parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis which was conducted using the p value and t statistic sensitivity tests in swatcup sufi2 abbaspour 2013 a total of 500 iterations were performed with each parameter varying within a feasible range results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in table s1 of the supplementary materials the final calibration step involved adjusting the sensitive parameters to values available in literature which ensures that each parameter stays in a range that is physically feasible in this step parameters were grouped according to hydrologic process including runoff snowmelt baseflow and routing detailed calibration steps and the final adjusted parameter values are presented in table s1 in supplementary materials calibration of the plant growth model in swat was based on measured poplar growth data in wisconsin including lai total biomass and leaves biomass zavitkovski 1983 table s2 the poplar plantations were short rotation intensive plantations at the united states department of agriculture usda forest service harshaw experimental farm near rhinelander with measurements occurring over the period of 1970 to 1976 hansen and baker 1979 ek and dawson 1976 since swat does not have a parameter for planting density three parameters were adjusted to represent that management variable maximum potential leaf area index blai years to maximum lai and light extinction coefficient the leaf area index lai is typically higher for higher planting intensities while the years to maximum lai can be expected to be shorter for higher planting densities because they reach a high lai in only a few years matching the lai is important because it is a key driver of the actual transpiration therefore lai was first calibrated by changing blai and years to maximum lai and then the biomass production parameters were adjusted to match observed biomass the light extinction coefficient is related to the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and is expected to be higher for short rotation high intensities jiang et al 2017 several of the plant parameters suggested by guo et al 2015 were also used to improve the simulation of hybrid poplar growth table s3 in the supplementary materials lists the adjusted plant parameters full descriptions of each parameter are presented in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 to calibrate the poplar growth parameters a second swat model hereafter referred to as usda watershed was set up to represent the experimental plots at the usda facility a small watershed 13 5 km2 encompassing the facility was delineated see fig 1 maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation data were compiled from the noaa national center for environmental information for the rhinelander wi station ghcnd usc00477113 for the period of 1968 to 1980 representing climatic conditions similar to those of the nearby spirit falls watershed all planting density and rotation treatments were simulated assuming optimal irrigation and fertilization and results were compared to the measured biomass at the usda facility and the simulated biomass in the spirit falls watershed 2 4 modeling scenarios the calibrated and validated model was used to simulate 70 biofuel development scenarios to investigate the impacts of planting density harvest timing fertilizer application and irrigation on biomass generation nutrient accumulation in the soil and water demand as summarized in table s4 in these scenarios the base case refers to the 2011 land cover conditions fig 1c before any biofuel development scenario is imposed for the biofuel development scenarios five planting density harvesting rotations reported by hansen and baker 1979 and zavitkovski 1983 were used in this study table s2 including a density of 1111 trees 100 m2 and a 5 year rotation 278 trees 100 m2 and 5 year rotation 83 trees 100 m2 and 6 year rotation 25 trees 100 m2 and 6 year rotation and 17 trees 100 m2 and 10 year rotation the fertilization rate of 164 kg n ha year reported by guo et al 2015 was used for the highest fertilization treatment scenario along with five lower fertilizer application rates 5 1 10 2 20 5 41 82 kg n ha year and a no fertilization scenario in order to study fertilizer impacts on biomass production lastly no irrigation and supplemental irrigation scenarios were simulated the supplemental irrigation rates were based on plant water demand simulated by swat and it was assumed that the water comes from a source outside of the watershed treatments are identified according to the number of trees per 100 m2 and the harvest cycle length followed by ir if they were irrigated e g 83 6ir means a fully fertilized treatment with 83 trees 100 m2 in a 6 year rotation with irrigation land cover analysis showed little change in the land cover from 1992 to 2011 with the dominant land cover 66 5 being forest fig 1 assumptions for determining areas for biofuel development were that plantations would not compete with food crops paine et al 1996 and no urban or wetland areas would be converted leaving forest hay and rangelands as available area following a spin up period to obtain initial conditions each simulation occurs over the 30 year period 1981 to 2010 using the corresponding hydroclimate time series this period allows for a range of climate conditions to be represented as well as several rotations for each harvesting interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation as shown in fig 3 the simulated versus the measured discharges at the outlet of the watershed demonstrate that the calibration and verification performance of the hydrologic model was good the nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 8 r2 of 0 8 and pbias of 1 also indicate good hydrologic model performance moriasi et al 2007 table 1 results of the lai and biomass calibration for the usda watershed are shown in fig 4 the simulated lai also matches the observed lai reasonably well as shown in fig 4b except for two years before harvest although the biomass growth model overpredicts the biomass in the years leading up to harvest fig 4a it is the biomass at the time of harvest that accounts for total biomass production and the final biomass is matched closely by the biomass growth model accurately simulating the entire growth cycle and variation of lai and biomass has been reported as beyond the abilities of swat and even plant growth models such as almanac guo et al 2015 the agreement between the simulated and observed lai is important because the lai controls et fluxes and canopy interception in the swat model the results of the lai and biomass growth simulations in the spirit falls watershed are very similar to the simulated values in the nearby usda watershed although lai and growth are modeled over several rotations these results are shown in table 2 and fig 5 with fig 5 clearly showing the cyclic nature of the rotations table s4 in the supplementary materials provides a comparison of the simulated aboveground biomass in the spirit falls watershed with the measured biomass in the nearby usda watershed 3 2 impacts of planting density rotation lengths and fertilizer application the results from 50 of the 70 simulations are summarized in table s5 including planting intensity harvest cycle biomass production nitrogen applied and remaining nitrogen in the soil irrigation water applied et at the watershed scale and over the converted area and streamflow the watershed outlet treatments with more than 41 kg n ha yr are omitted as more fertilizer did not produce additional biomass fig 6 shows the relationship between fertilizer application rate and biomass production for all the irrigated treatments these results indicate that the biomass production is heavily dependent on nitrogen availability and for most treatments there is a maximum fertilizer application rate at which minimal improvement in biomass growth is achieved the strong dependency of the poplar growth on nitrogen availability and the occurrence of maximum fertilizer application rates has been reported in many hybrid poplar growth studies truax et al 2012 brown and driessche 2002 stanruf et al 2001 coleman et al 2006 chemical input during the feedstock production stage has the highest water quality impact across biofuel production processes usepa 2011 accordingly avoiding over fertilization is crucial to mitigate this impact for all applied fertilizer amounts the 1111 5 treatment produces the highest biomass followed by the 278 5 treatment the higher biomass from more intensive planting is a result of higher light interception the 25 6 treatment has significantly poorer performance in terms of biomass production mainly as a result of lower light interception and lower lai early in the harvest cycle a longer rotation might improve production under the 25 6 treatment scenario considering interannual variability the 1987 1992 rotation produces less biomass than other rotations 2 5 ton ha harvest cycle lower than average the limiting factor preventing optimal growth was temperature stress resulting from cold weather during the 1992 season a similar trend for the 1111 5 and 278 5 treatments during the 1991 1995 rotation was observed resulting in approximately 3 ton ha harvest cycle lower production it should be noted that during calibration the base temperature and optimum temperature parameters were reduced to simulate this particular hybrid poplar species 3 3 impacts on water use for hydrologic impact analysis additional water use associated with the conversion from existing land cover to poplar cultivation is defined as the water used for irrigation and the difference in et between the existing land uses and the land converted to poplar fig 7 shows the average inter and intra annual et rates in the converted portion of the watershed for the 83 6 irrigated treatment demonstrating a substantial increase in et due to poplar cultivation averaged across all simulated treatments the et rates for the converted area are 555 mm year and 534 mm year for irrigated and non irrigated conditions respectively which are 29 and 24 higher than for the existing land covers these et rates for poplar are in the middle of ranges reported values from europe asia us and canada fischer et al 2013 the et cycles in fig 7a are a result of annual climate variations for the base case existing land uses the cycles for the 83 6 irrigated treatment on the other hand are influenced by both climate variations and the timing of the poplar harvest the et rate is continuously increasing as the tree biomass and lai increase each year until the trees are harvested fig 7b shows that the et rates for the converted portion of the watershed are significantly higher during the growing season with the peak difference during the month of june the effect of irrigation on watershed wide streamflow is demonstrated in fig 8 where the reduction in streamflow due to a given treatment is plotted against the increase in watershed wide et for the treatment as expected for the no irrigation treatments the decrease in streamflow roughly correlates with the increase in et for the no irrigation treatments increases in watershed wide et range between 8 and 23 and decreases in watershed wide streamflow range from 10 to 25 the irrigated treatments have higher et because there is more available water greater biomass production and lai but the impact of higher et on streamflow is offset directly by return flows from irrigation and indirectly due to higher soil moisture that reduces the soil infiltration capacity and increases runoff from subsequent rainfall events on average across the treatments the annual irrigation of 38 mm year results in an increase of et by 20 mm year and the remainder contributes to the streamflow as return flow scenario a in fig 8 corresponding to the 1111 5ir fertilized treatment 5 1 kg n ha year has a high biomass production as well as high nitrogen and water use efficiency the 1111 5 treatments in general have the highest biomass production and highest nutrient and water use efficiency in contrast scenario b which represents the 17 10ir fertilized treatment 20 5 kg n ha year has significantly higher et due to irrigation this can be explained by the fact that in longer rotations the trees maintain high lai over longer periods several years leading to higher et and water demand while in shorter rotations the trees are harvested as they reach a high lai in swat et is directly influenced by the lai and the effect of lai on et rate is reported in other studies e g fischer et al 2013 in comparing point b with point c which represents the 25 6ir fertilized 20 5 kg n ha year treatment the reason for the smaller decrease in streamflow for the 17 10 ir point b treatment is that this treatment receives much more irrigation water which contributes to the streamflow 3 4 tradeoffs fig 9 summarizes the tradeoffs between annual biomass production water use and fertilizer application for irrigated and non irrigated cases the x and y axes show biomass production vs water use respectively and the size of the symbol relates to the magnitude of fertilizer use the no irrigation and irrigation treatments with the largest cumulative biomass production and lowest increased water use are labelled as points d e f and g all of these are 1111 5 treatments suggesting that high planting densities and short rotations offer the best tradeoff between biomass production and water use fertilizer application rates for points d and f are 41 kg n ha year and the rates for points e and g are 20 5 kg n ha year indicating that the higher fertilization rate produces only 1 2 more biomass the remaining points in fig 9 have substantially lower biomass production lower fertilizer application rates and either lower planting densities or longer rotations resulting in substantially lower biomass production comparison of points d and e with points f and g indicates that biomass is increased by 3 and 6 with irrigation but at the cost of increases in water use of 13 although the simulations show that irrigation does not produce substantially more biomass on average irrigation can be critical for mitigating the impacts of dry years especially when a dry year coincides with later years in the rotation cycle when the trees have higher water demand the average irrigation rates over the rotation cycles range from as low as 13 8 mm year in the 1981 86 cycle when wet years average 1037 mm year occur in the last two years of rotation the highest average irrigation requirement over a rotation 64 2 mm year occurred in the 2001 05 cycle as a result of two dry years average 681 mm year precipitation at the end of the rotation fig 10 shows that intra and interannual variations in climate can produce severe decreases in streamflow due to conversion to poplar fig 10a shows that july is the most critical month with an average decrease of 48 in average monthly flows in fig 10b the cumulative probability density of july streamflows over the simulation period indicates a significant shift downward in high flows q90 q95 and q99 decreases by 45 high flows are reduced due to lower soil moisture and higher canopy interception for the poplar converted land compared to the existing forest cover especially in the last years of each rotation when lai and water demand are high low flows indicated by q1 q5 and q10 decreased on average by 32 on average for all the planting intensities to produce 1 ton of poplar biomass on 1 ha of land there is a need for around 128 mm of water and 9 4 kg n to be applied with 5 1 kg n uptake by the trees table 3 shows that the 1111 5 treatment requires the least amount of total and extra water followed by the 278 5 treatment however it should be noted that hybrid poplar plantations with lower planting densities have longer rotations and more flexible harvest scheduling as well as lower costs strong and hansen 1993 which are not considered in this analysis it remains to be seen whether high density short rotation treatments will be adopted by poplar plantation managers to evaluate the potential for large scale biofuel feedstock development in the region the four surrounding counties oneida lincoln price and taylor were analyzed and found to have 50 forested land similar to the case study watershed hay rangelands and herbaceous cover accounted for 4 of the area therefore the scenario implemented in the model can be considered representative for the four county region where up to 6200 km2 could be available for biofuel development water quality measurements were not available for this study and thus simulated n transport and water quality were not reported however the n uptake in swat is based on measured n content of the tree in three life stages based on these results the quantities of n added n uptake and n available for potential pollution impacts are provided see table s5 for detailed results a study of water quality impacts of poplar development in this region remain as important future work 4 conclusions a swat model was calibrated and validated to simulate the daily streamflow of a relatively humid watershed in northern wisconsin the plant growth component of the model was also calibrated to match the lai growth and biomass production of poplar trees using measured data from a nearby research plot the plant growth improvements enabled the model to simulate different planting densities as there is no direct parameter in swat to account for different planting densities seventy different scenarios of poplar plantation with different management treatments densities harvest period irrigation and fertilization over a 30 year period were simulated results show that poplar development increases the total et of the watershed substantially during the growing season june to december this causes lower streamflow during the growing season and makes the already low flow months of july and august more critical furthermore the decline in streamflow becomes more severe in the final years of each rotation when trees have higher lai and more water demand analysis of the stream flow shows that the poplar trees take up the moisture from the soil and cause the baseflow to be more affected than the surface flow inspection of the interannual impacts led to two important discoveries first temperature stress can reduce biomass production even if the trees are fertilized and irrigated second in a relatively humid watershed the average impact of irrigation on biomass production may be minimal but there may be a significant benefit from irrigation if the last year in a harvest cycle is a dry year in contrast to the effects of irrigation tree growth and biomass production are significantly dependent on n availability making fertilization a necessary management treatment model results indicate that adding fertilizer leads to remarkably higher biomass production up to a level of about 41 kgn ha year but additional fertilizer beyond this level does not enhance biomass production but only increases the amount of n remaining in the soil with the potential to contribute to non point source pollution the highest density 1111 trees 100 m2 and shortest rotation 5 year treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass the next highest density 278 trees 100 m2 treatments follow closely in terms of production and efficiency high density plantings and short rotations are found to be efficient in terms of water and fertilizer inputs because the trees are harvested as soon as they reach maximum lai values while in longer rotations the trees are kept at higher lai for longer periods leading to higher water use moreover the higher planting densities capture more solar radiation represented by a higher light extinction coefficient which results in higher biomass production declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
