their outstanding hydrodynamic performance in terms of resistance propulsion and seakeeping in this regard catamaran hulls are nowadays used for both civil transportation and naval purposes at this point the prediction of seakeeping characteristics of catamarans is of great importance vertical motion responses including velocity and acceleration at desired locations which are the most important parameters in seakeeping analyses can be obtained by theoretical numerical and experimental methods in addition added resistance of the catamaran hull should be calculated precisely in waves due to the increase in needed power or a possible speed loss at constant power from this point of view several types of research are made concerning calm water resistance prediction and prediction of seakeeping performance in regular and irregular wave conditions most of the studies are relied on the well known benchmark delft catamaran 372 van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b while some of them used other catamaran designs the studies can be categorized as the numerical ones based on the potential flow theory or viscous solvers and the experimental ones the theoretical approaches based on the potential flow theory are numerically the most economic and fastest among all the approaches while they have some limitations that originated from the flow conditions for instance the viscosity is neglected so the motions dominantly affected by viscosity cannot be estimated tarafder and suzuki shahjada tarafder and suzuki 2007 employed a panel method based on potential flow theory in their study to solve the free surface flow around the wigley catamaran form the wave interference was analyzed and the results were compared with other numerical studies danisman 2014 focused on the effect of center bulb design on the catamaran wave interference the numerical approach was based on the potential flow theory using dawson s free surface method the numerical results were compared with the model experiments for with and without center bulb geometries an optimized center bulb form was achieved in which the wave interference resistance was reduced the study of fang and chan 2004 involves the prediction of the seakeeping performance of a wave piercing catamaran two different techniques were used based on potential flow theory using pulsating type source elements the motion responses heave pitch and roll were predicted in regular and irregular waves for different heading angles the results were mostly in good agreement with the experimental ones obtained in sspa bruzzone et al 2008 investigated two catamarans with hard chine and central bulb in terms of nonlinear seakeeping characteristics a potential flow based method was employed using rankine type source elements the nonlinear vertical motions were predicted and compared with the available experimental data in a recent study vernengo et al 2020 focused on the estimation of added resistance of a catamaran by boundary element method bem using rankine type source elements after a simple verification and validation study the added resistance values were obtained for different velocities and heading angles for defined wave conditions the results were then discussed for catamaran forms with different geometric parameters because of the limitations of the potential flow based methods model experiments are the most reliable ones while it is not a cost effective method the benchmark geometry delft catamaran 372 is widely used in the researches on the calm water and seakeeping performance prediction of catamarans as explained before the experimental studies of van t veer van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b covers the experimental results of this catamaran in regular head and oblique wave conditions with respect to the vertical motion responses wave and structural loads an experimental study about the interference effects was made by broglia et al 2014 for a high speed catamaran in calm water the experiments were conducted in a wide range of froude numbers 0 1 0 8 and the relation between the interference and froude number was explained in terms of total resistance mcfarlane and daire macfarlane and daire 2011 made a study involving the experimental investigation of four different catamaran hulls the model experiments were carried out to obtain the added resistance values of the catamaran hulls in the regular head wave the non dimensional added resistance coefficients for four catamaran hulls at different froude numbers were obtained for various wave frequencies bouscasse et al 2013 investigated the fast catamaran form developed in tu delft van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b experimentally and they observed the seakeeping performance of the hull in regular waves the experiments were repeated and compared with the previous ones van t veer 1998a using the experimental results the effect of froude number and nonlinear effects on the added resistance were discussed a comprehensive investigation was conducted in the recent study of durante et al 2020 for the seakeeping of a catamaran in regular and irregular head waves experimentally an uncertainty quantification uq study was made instead of uncertainty analysis ua the results were obtained in terms of wave elevation axial force heave and pitch motions vertical acceleration and vertical velocity different quantification methods were compared with these parameters since lack of the experimental capabilities and or within the development of computational capabilities many studies were made using cfd approaches covering calm water resistance prediction and estimation of seakeeping performance in waves the studies in calm water conditions mostly focus on the interference effects on the demihull with respect to the total resistance while the seakeeping studies cover the prediction of vertical motions and added resistance zaghi et al 2010 focused on the interference effects on a catamaran hull for five different separation lengths model experiments and numerical analyses were conducted for a wide range of froude numbers 0 2 0 8 and the interference factor of total resistance was calculated he et al 2011 investigated delft catamaran 372 in calm water the authors focused on the interference analysis the study of chen et al 2013 deals with the design optimization of delft catamaran with a waterjet propulsion system urans method and multiple metamodels were used in the optimization of the original bare hull and different waterjet modifications were also compared using the metamodels an optimal bare hull design with a waterjet was obtained castiglione et al 2014 investigated the interference effects on delft catamaran in shallow water the numerical analyses were carried out for different demi hull distances and depths at various froude numbers wave patterns and wave profiles were also observed the numerical results were compared with the experimental ones and the interference factor was calculated with respect to the total resistance the study of he et al 2015 aimed to investigate the interference effects of a fast catamaran in terms of resistance sinkage and trim numerically the free surface flow around delft catamaran was simulated at different froude numbers the numerical results were validated with the experimental study conducted in insean also the wave pattern and the longitudinal wave cuts were taken and discussed by comparing them with the experiments zha et al 2015 investigated the resistance of a high speed catamaran with a bulbous bow in calm water numerically the simulations were carried out at different advance velocities the free surface elevations the pressure distributions on the hull and the vortices near the hull were discussed in detail in the study of haase et al 2016 a large medium speed catamaran was analyzed numerically at two different model scales an extrapolation method for full scale including the roughness effects was presented the extrapolated results were compared with the full scale measurements zhou et al 2016 discussed the reliability of the form factor calculated by the prohaska method for high speed catamarans they conducted numerical analyses for a catamaran with asymmetrical hulls at high speeds and proposed new form factors at each froude number instead of using the prohaska method in the study of castiglione et al 2011 the authors investigated the free surface flow around delft catamaran in regular waves using a numerical method the numerical results were first verified to ensure numerical uncertainty then the vertical motions and added resistance results were compared with the model experiments and potential flow results the results were in good agreement even in high froude numbers and high wave amplitudes he et al 2013 conducted numerical analyses to simulate the free surface flow around delft catamaran in calm water and head waves in this comprehensive study an extensive verification and validation study was conducted for both calm water and head wave conditions the total resistance added resistance and the vertical motions were obtained in particular slamming loads on the desired locations of the hull were calculated the results were finally discussed for different geometries the recent study of wang et al 2020 involves the effect of the stern flap on the hydrodynamics of a catamaran in regular head waves the numerical method was first verified in both spatial and temporal manners the results are in good agreement with the experimental ones in terms of resistance heave and pitch motions in different wavelengths and amplitudes the effect of two different stern flap geometries on these parameters was then discussed some other studies are focusing on the maneuvering performance of delft catamaran by using viscous solvers in particular these studies deal with the flow around delft catamaran in static drift conditions dogan 2013 used two numerical methods to predict the hydrodynamic performance of delft catamaran in static drift conditions the vortex structures and the interaction between the hull wake and vortices were observed at a wide range of froude numbers and drift angles the results were compared to the experimental data available in the literature falchi et al 2014 focused on the experimental investigation of delft catamaran in static drift conditions using the spiv technique the authors aimed to observe the vortices around the catamaran hull for different froude numbers and drift angles the interaction between the wave pattern and the vorticity was also discussed broglia et al brogliaet al 2019 investigated the flow around delft 372 catamaran in static drift conditions numerically various numerical codes were employed with different turbulence models the numerical results were validated with the available experimental data and it is found that the numerical simulation shows a little deviation in terms of resistance lateral force and yaw moment duman and bal 2019 aimed to calculate the maneuvering coefficients of delft catamaran using a numerical method the simulations were conducted regarding pmm planar motion mechanism approach the authors validated their method following the verification process to the best of authors knowledge besides the studies given above there exists no specific study about the interference effects on added wave resistance of the multihull forms such as catamaran and trimaran in this study urans analyses of delft catamaran 372 were carried out at fr 0 3 in regular head waves the commercial cfd code siemens plm star ccm is used to discretize the urans equations by applying the finite volume method the numerical approach was verified and validated with an appropriate uncertainty analysis methods the vertical motion transfer functions tfs and added resistance were calculated for both the catamaran and demihull following this the interference factor of added resistance was calculated in each regular wave frequency the results were discussed in detail the paper is organized as follows section 2 depicts the geometric definition of the hull forms and numerical background covering the solution procedure and the mesh algorithm section 3 gives information about the verification and validation processes section 4 gives the obtained numerical results with respect to motion and added resistance tfs also interference factors were given and discussed finally the concluding remarks were given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 delft catamaran 372 in this study the widely used benchmark delft catamaran 372 was chosen for the investigation of the seakeeping performance and the interference effects the catamaran model was designed and a comprehensive experimental work was conducted by van t veer van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b total resistance data is available in calm water while the vertical motion results were presented for regular head wave conditions fig 1 shows the body plan of the catamaran the main particulars of the model and full scale catamarans were given in table 1 2 2 numerical setup the numerical method including the flow properties and the boundary conditions are explained briefly the computational domain dimensions and the mesh generation procedure are also given in detail in this section 2 2 1 physics modelling in the present study a commercial viscous solver was used to solve unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the governing equations which are the continuity and momentum equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm the continuity equation can be given as 1 u i x i 0 velocity can be derived as the mean velocity and the fluctuating velocity components respectively 2 u i u i u i the momentum equations can be written in tensor notation and cartesian coordinates 3 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i u i u j x j here ρ depicts the fluid density u i is the velocity vector and p represents the pressure the last two terms belong to the viscous stress tensor while υ is the kinematic viscosity the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations which is also called simple algorithm was used for the solution procedure the closure problem of the governing equations was overcome using the k ε turbulence model that is widely used in numerical ship hydrodynamics detailed information about this model can be found in wilcox 2006 to represent the experimental conditions identically the catamaran model was fixed except heave and pitch motions while advancing both in calm water and regular head wave to represent the 2dof motion accurately the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi method was used two different coordinate systems were defined earth fixed and ship fixed the flow direction is considered to be in the negative x direction to take into account the free surface effect volume of fluid vof approach was used hirt and nichols 1981 with high resolution interface capturing hric the main features of the physical model are listed in table 2 in the present work the time step size was correlated with the encounter period and defined by considering ittc ittc 2014 recommendations the time step sizes were calculated as follow 4 δt t e 2 9 2 2 2 mesh generation in the present study the benchmark delft catamaran 372 was investigated numerically to predict the calm water and regular head wave performance of the delft catamaran 372 the computational domain was created taking the ittc recommendations ittc 2014 and recent numerical studies dogrul et al 2020 cakici et al 2018 into account the same computational domain was used for all numerical analyses including calm water and regular head wave analyses of demi hull and catamaran the computational domain used in this study is shown in fig 2 it should be noted that since the physical phenomena are symmetrical following the centerline of the model only half of the computational model was used to reduce the computational cost the boundary conditions are also shown in fig 2 the left side of the domain was selected as velocity inlet while the right side of it was selected as pressure outlet since the catamaran model has a rigid body the model is defined as no slip wall to dictate the normal component of the velocity on the model is zero it should be also kept in mind that the boundary on the centerline was defined as symmetry plane while the other boundaries top bottom and side were selected as velocity inlet no damping zone was applied on the boundary surfaces besides no reflections were observed in the numerical simulations the computational domain was discretized with finite hexahedral elements the computational domain was separated into two different mesh zones overset mesh and rigid mesh the overset mesh which proved its adequacy was used around the model where the translation and orientation are huge while the rigid mesh was used on the far field trimmer mesh algorithm was applied in both overset and rigid mesh zones with local mesh refinements near the free surface and kelvin wave pattern the prism layer mesh was applied near the hull geometry to model the flow in the near wall region precisely while keeping the wall y values between 30 and 300 the computational domain was created large enough and no wave reflections from the boundaries were observed it should be kept in mind that the mesh size is enlarged from the overset region to the static region to decrease the number of elements the mesh structure and the local refinements are shown in fig 3 a and fig 3 b and the features of the prism layer were listed in table 3 3 verification assessment in the present study gci grid convergence index cf correction factor and gci lsr least square methods were used for the verification purpose all of these methods are based on richardson extrapolation richardson 1911 the first verification method was firstly proposed by roache 1998 and the methodology followed in this study is summarized properly by celik et al 2008 the second one was also proposed and abstracted properly by stern et al 2001 and wilson et al 2001 the last one was offered by eça and hoekstra 2006 for the first two verification assessments three different solutions were created in terms of grid and time step size with a systematic refinement although four different solutions were created for the last one while the refinement is applied in terms of time step the grid size was kept constant or vice versa firstly the differences between each solution has to be calculated to ensure reaching a convergence regime 5 ε 21 x 2 x 1 ε 32 x 3 x 2 6 r ε 21 ε 32 here x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent the value of the fine medium and coarse solution of grid or time step size the convergence factor r can be calculated by using equation 6 after obtaining the convergence factor there are four possibilities i r 1 monotonic divergence ii r 1 oscillatory divergence iii 0 r 1 oscillatory convergence iv 0 r 1 monotonic convergence if the monotonic convergence regime is reached the first two verification assessments can be used otherwise different calculations can be needed for the determination of the uncertainties after reaching the last possibility the methodology summarized by celik et al 2008 can be used for the gci method and the methodology presented by stern et al 2001 and wilson et al 2001 can be followed for the cf method however for the gci lsr method the convergence regime can be determined in terms of apparent convergence condition plsr this value has to be greater than 1 to reach a convergence regime eça and hoekstra 2006 the detailed information can be found in related references it should be noted that the refinement factor was kept constant and 2 for the grid refinement and for the time step refinement similar to recent studies in the literature tezdogan et al 2015 romanowski et al 2019 the obtained element numbers after refinements and the time step sizes are listed in table 4 the uncertainty values were evaluated by using three methods gci cf and gci lsr since the main aim of the study is directly related to the seakeeping performance a seakeeping case was selected for the verification purpose the vessel advances with fr 0 3 and encountered a regular head wave which has 3 303 m length and 0 03747 m height the details of the selected case case 6 can be found in table 7 in table 5 and table 6 the uncertainty values of the heave pitch motions and the total resistance for the selected case are listed the spatial uncertainty of the heave pitch motions and the total resistance of the first data set 1 2 3 is very low for the gci and cf methods although the uncertainty value for the gci lsr is higher the maximum uncertainty values were obtained from the gci lsr method for all hydrodynamic parameters while the maximum grid uncertainty value was obtained from the heave amplitude the similar interpretations can be made for the temporal one the monotonic convergence regime was observed in all simulation sets except for 1 2 3 data set for the temporal uncertainty of the total resistance it should be noted that the apparent convergence condition for the gci lsr method plsr was fixed to the theoretical order when it exceeds the theoretical order de luca et al 2016 fig 4 a and fig 4 b show that the change in the scalar such as the vertical motion amplitudes and the total resistance becomes very little concerning the increase in the precision in terms of grid number and time step size 4 numerical results as explained before the numerical cases were selected identical to the experiments to make a meaningful comparison the numerical analyses were conducted to predict the total resistance in calm water afterwards the seakeeping performance was estimated in head wave conditions the particulars of the selected cases are listed in table 7 it should be reported that all numerical analyses in head wave condition took approximately 10 12 h of wall clock time with a 30 core processor with 128 gb ram for five periods of simulation for each case it should be also noted that efd experimental fluid dynamics represents the experimental results in the figures presented in this section 4 1 calm water results since the main aim of this study is to calculate the numerical added resistance if the calm water resistance characteristics of the catamaran and demi hull should be predicted accurately before calculating the seakeeping performance of the catamaran the total resistance in the calm water condition was calculated with the same boundary conditions and computational domain the numerical results of the catamaran in calm water were compared with the available experimental data and the cfd results of the paper published by castiglione et al which is based on cfdship iowa castiglione et al 2011 the relative differences between numerical studies and experimental data are listed in table 8 it can be easily concluded from fig 5 and table 8 that the numerical method has similar trend with the experimental data in a wide range of froude numbers also it can be deduced from this figure that although the resistance values of the present study and the other numerical study are in the same order of accuracy the trim and sinkage values of the present study were closer to the experimental ones especially in relatively higher froude numbers 4 2 motion results before starting to analyze the vertical motion in regular head waves the generated wave should be investigated and compared with the actual wave to show that there is an acceptable difference between the two of them to achieve this goal a numerical wave probe is placed on the virtual towing tank and the free surface elevation between the vessel and the inlet is recorded the wave probe was located at 1 5 m in front of and 1 7 m side of the vessel in fig 6 the recorded wave elevation is shown for case 8 the comparison with the theoretical stokes wave was also given in fig 6 for comparison the theoretical wave profile was obtained in accordance with the paper of fenton 1985 the fourier series approximation explained in details below was applied to the time history and the first harmonic of the signal was found 0 0183 m while the actual wave amplitude is equal to 0 0179 m this small reduction 2 2 was found acceptable similar to tezdogan et al 2015 as explained before the seakeeping analyses were conducted for fr 0 3 and a wide range of wave frequencies listed in table 7 after reaching the steady state heave and pitch motions in head seas the transfer functions tfs associate with heave and pitch are calculated by the following methodology i firstly the heave and pitch motions in the time domain are represented using the trigonometric fourier series expansion 7 η i t η i 0 n 1 n η i n cos ω t β i n n 1 2 3 i 3 5 8 a i 1 2 t 0 t η i t sin ω t d t 9 b i 1 2 t 0 t η i t cos ω t d t 10 η i 1 a i 1 2 b i 1 2 11 β i 1 arctan a i 1 b i 1 here η i 0 represents the zeroth harmonic of the selected signal heave or pitch a i 1 and b i 1 represent the euler coefficients η i 1 represents the first harmonic of the selected motion and finally β i 1 represents the phase angle since the motion can be represented by a single frequency which is the encounter frequency the first harmonic of the motion signal is symbolized as η i instead of η i 1 for simplicity ii after obtaining the first harmonic of these motions the tfs of the heave and pitch motions can be calculated as follows 12 tf 3 η 3 a 13 tf 5 η 5 ak where η 3 η 5 a and k depict the first harmonic of the heave and pitch motions wave amplitude and wavenumber 2 π λ respectively here λ is the wavelength it should be kept in mind that the wave amplitude a and wavenumber k are related to regular wave properties and those were selected as listed in table 7 before starting to implement the procedure given above the vertical motion of the vessel is visualized to ensure the representation of the 2dof motion accurately case 8 is selected to reach this aim and the vertical motion of the vessel in this case is shown in fig 7 it should be noted that since the similar figures are obtained from the other cases only one case is given the heave and pitch tfs are compared with the available experimental data and the numerical results of the paper by castiglione et al 2011 in fig 8 although the tfs of heave and pitch motions are in very good agreement with the experimental data the employed viscous solver underestimates these two motions in almost all wave frequencies when the other numerical study is taken into consideration one may see that the present study has better results except for the heave motion near resonance cases to discover the interference effects the same regular wave cases are imposed on catamaran and demihull models fig 9 shows heave and pitch tfs aimed at the catamaran and demihull it can be noted that near the resonance region the heave tfs show remarkable difference while the pitch tfs show slight difference for catamaran and demi hull to explain tf plots physically the wave elevation contours were recorded near the resonance case for heave motion in this case the pitch motion of the catamaran is almost the same as the demi hull this case is selected in purpose to eliminate the effect of coupled motions fig 10 shows the wave elevation of the demi hull and catamaran for case 5 for a fair comparison the wave elevation figures were captured at the moment when the ships go down around z 0 level as understood from fig 10 wave crests and wave troughs are more pronounced for the catamaran compared to the demi hull this explains how the amplitude of the heave motion of the catamaran is greater than that of the demihull at the resonance case it should be noted that the similar comparisons could be made for the other cases as well 4 3 added resistance results in waves and interference effect the hull design process in terms of the required power shall include the accurate estimation of the added resistance in waves therefore the added resistance component of a ship due to the waves should be obtained even in the conceptual design phase as clearly known the resistance component in the opposite direction of ship advance is used for obtaining the added resistance in waves the added resistance data is obtained for a wide range of wave frequency and fr 0 3 for both catamaran and demihull as following 14 r a w t r t t r c w t please note that r a w t r c w t and r t t are the signals showing the added resistance calm water and total resistance components respectively after obtaining r a w t signal using the zeroth harmonic the mean value of r a w t which is r a w is calculated after calculating the added resistance due to the waves it was non dimensionalized as follows 15 σ a w r a w ρ g ζ 2 b w l 2 l b p here σ a w is called as the added resistance coefficient here ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity and ζ is the first harmonic of the incident wave signal fig 11 shows the total and the added resistance values for the catamaran and demi hull and fig 12 gives the numerical results of the added resistance coefficient for different wavelengths as understood from fig 11 the calm water resistance value of one demihull is obtained and multiplied by two in order to compare with the calm water resistance of catamaran as expected the total resistance of the catamaran is larger than the demihull due to the interference effects between the hulls the difference is caused by calm water resistance as explained in the next section on the other hand the behavior of the added resistance value changes with the wave frequency the added resistance value of the catamaran at inertia region is greater than the added resistance of demihull however there is no specific inference at the damping and the hydrostatic regions as explained previous subsection wave crests and wave troughs are more pronounced for the catamaran compared to the demihull for case 5 this also explains why the added resistance value of the catamaran is greater than the demihull in that case the if can be calculated for total resistance and resistance components and it reflects the interaction of side hulls when they are collocated in the present study the if was also calculated in regular head waves in addition to the calm water condition the if for calm water total resistance can be calculated as follows 16 i f c a l m r t c a t a m a r a n 2 x r t d e m i h u l l r t c a t a m a r a n in equation 16 r t c a t a m a r a n r t d e m i h u l l and i f c a l m depict the total resistance of catamaran in calm water demihull total resistance and the if in calm water condition respectively table 9 gives the if of the total resistance in calm water the collocation of the side hulls causes an increase of 6 40 in total resistance the if for total resistance in regular head wave was also calculated with the same approach as given in equation 16 the total resistance values in different wavelengths were obtained for both catamaran and demihull for fr 0 3 fig 13 shows the interference effect of the total resistance in head wave while table 10 gives the numerical results in detail having an average value of 6 35 if the average of the if of total resistance in head waves has approximately the same with calm water condition as a highlight of the present study the if of added resistance was calculated at different wavelengths the if at the peak case for added resistance tf see table 11 is 9 88 while the maximum if values occur in the shortest wavelengths following these short waves the if becomes negative until λ l 1 107 that is near the resonance case of motions there is no correlation observed between the wave frequencies and if of added resistance the average value for the if of added resistance in head waves is about 7 5 it is found that the average value of the if of added resistance due to waves is close to that of the total resistance in head waves fig 14 shows the if in a graph for each wave length it is obvious that the added resistance if becomes negative in some cases in contrast to if of the total resistance these cases are generally correspond to the cases in which the pitch motion of the demi hull is higher compare to catamaran in the same way the positive if occurs generally when the pitch motion of the demi hull is less than the catamaran within these arguments it can be said that the pitch motion is more dominant compared to heave motion on the added resistance and if 5 concluding remarks within this study the added resistance which can be directly used for the accurate estimation of the increase in power demand was calculated in waves for this purpose delft catamaran 372 benchmark hull was investigated in terms of hydrodynamic performance in calm water and regular head wave conditions the numerical analyses were carried out at fr 0 3 using a commercial rans solver the numerical method was verified using appropriate methods and the validation was made with the available experimental data the numerical analyses in calm water and regular head wave were conducted for both catamaran and demihull to determine the interference factor results of the calm water and regular head wave conditions were compared with the experimental data it is found that the present study shows a better agreement with the experimental ones in terms of total resistance trim and sinkage when compared to another relevant numerical study heave and pitch tfs also show a better agreement with the experimental results total resistance values in the regular head wave were obtained for both catamaran and demihull it is found that the peak value frequency for the total resistance of catamaran in waves is lower than the one of demihull the interference factor changes with respect to the wave frequency for both total resistance and added resistance however the change in the interference factor of added resistance is more prominent with higher positive and negative peaks while these peak values occur at the same frequencies one of the main deductions of this study is that the interference factor of total resistance in head waves oscillates around the calm water interference factor it is also understood that the pitch motion affects more the added resistance interference factor compared to heave motion as a future work the demihull distance in catamaran configuration will be investigated in terms of vertical motions and interference factor of added resistance to compare different configurations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the second author is supported by the scientific

their outstanding hydrodynamic performance in terms of resistance propulsion and seakeeping in this regard catamaran hulls are nowadays used for both civil transportation and naval purposes at this point the prediction of seakeeping characteristics of catamarans is of great importance vertical motion responses including velocity and acceleration at desired locations which are the most important parameters in seakeeping analyses can be obtained by theoretical numerical and experimental methods in addition added resistance of the catamaran hull should be calculated precisely in waves due to the increase in needed power or a possible speed loss at constant power from this point of view several types of research are made concerning calm water resistance prediction and prediction of seakeeping performance in regular and irregular wave conditions most of the studies are relied on the well known benchmark delft catamaran 372 van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b while some of them used other catamaran designs the studies can be categorized as the numerical ones based on the potential flow theory or viscous solvers and the experimental ones the theoretical approaches based on the potential flow theory are numerically the most economic and fastest among all the approaches while they have some limitations that originated from the flow conditions for instance the viscosity is neglected so the motions dominantly affected by viscosity cannot be estimated tarafder and suzuki shahjada tarafder and suzuki 2007 employed a panel method based on potential flow theory in their study to solve the free surface flow around the wigley catamaran form the wave interference was analyzed and the results were compared with other numerical studies danisman 2014 focused on the effect of center bulb design on the catamaran wave interference the numerical approach was based on the potential flow theory using dawson s free surface method the numerical results were compared with the model experiments for with and without center bulb geometries an optimized center bulb form was achieved in which the wave interference resistance was reduced the study of fang and chan 2004 involves the prediction of the seakeeping performance of a wave piercing catamaran two different techniques were used based on potential flow theory using pulsating type source elements the motion responses heave pitch and roll were predicted in regular and irregular waves for different heading angles the results were mostly in good agreement with the experimental ones obtained in sspa bruzzone et al 2008 investigated two catamarans with hard chine and central bulb in terms of nonlinear seakeeping characteristics a potential flow based method was employed using rankine type source elements the nonlinear vertical motions were predicted and compared with the available experimental data in a recent study vernengo et al 2020 focused on the estimation of added resistance of a catamaran by boundary element method bem using rankine type source elements after a simple verification and validation study the added resistance values were obtained for different velocities and heading angles for defined wave conditions the results were then discussed for catamaran forms with different geometric parameters because of the limitations of the potential flow based methods model experiments are the most reliable ones while it is not a cost effective method the benchmark geometry delft catamaran 372 is widely used in the researches on the calm water and seakeeping performance prediction of catamarans as explained before the experimental studies of van t veer van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b covers the experimental results of this catamaran in regular head and oblique wave conditions with respect to the vertical motion responses wave and structural loads an experimental study about the interference effects was made by broglia et al 2014 for a high speed catamaran in calm water the experiments were conducted in a wide range of froude numbers 0 1 0 8 and the relation between the interference and froude number was explained in terms of total resistance mcfarlane and daire macfarlane and daire 2011 made a study involving the experimental investigation of four different catamaran hulls the model experiments were carried out to obtain the added resistance values of the catamaran hulls in the regular head wave the non dimensional added resistance coefficients for four catamaran hulls at different froude numbers were obtained for various wave frequencies bouscasse et al 2013 investigated the fast catamaran form developed in tu delft van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b experimentally and they observed the seakeeping performance of the hull in regular waves the experiments were repeated and compared with the previous ones van t veer 1998a using the experimental results the effect of froude number and nonlinear effects on the added resistance were discussed a comprehensive investigation was conducted in the recent study of durante et al 2020 for the seakeeping of a catamaran in regular and irregular head waves experimentally an uncertainty quantification uq study was made instead of uncertainty analysis ua the results were obtained in terms of wave elevation axial force heave and pitch motions vertical acceleration and vertical velocity different quantification methods were compared with these parameters since lack of the experimental capabilities and or within the development of computational capabilities many studies were made using cfd approaches covering calm water resistance prediction and estimation of seakeeping performance in waves the studies in calm water conditions mostly focus on the interference effects on the demihull with respect to the total resistance while the seakeeping studies cover the prediction of vertical motions and added resistance zaghi et al 2010 focused on the interference effects on a catamaran hull for five different separation lengths model experiments and numerical analyses were conducted for a wide range of froude numbers 0 2 0 8 and the interference factor of total resistance was calculated he et al 2011 investigated delft catamaran 372 in calm water the authors focused on the interference analysis the study of chen et al 2013 deals with the design optimization of delft catamaran with a waterjet propulsion system urans method and multiple metamodels were used in the optimization of the original bare hull and different waterjet modifications were also compared using the metamodels an optimal bare hull design with a waterjet was obtained castiglione et al 2014 investigated the interference effects on delft catamaran in shallow water the numerical analyses were carried out for different demi hull distances and depths at various froude numbers wave patterns and wave profiles were also observed the numerical results were compared with the experimental ones and the interference factor was calculated with respect to the total resistance the study of he et al 2015 aimed to investigate the interference effects of a fast catamaran in terms of resistance sinkage and trim numerically the free surface flow around delft catamaran was simulated at different froude numbers the numerical results were validated with the experimental study conducted in insean also the wave pattern and the longitudinal wave cuts were taken and discussed by comparing them with the experiments zha et al 2015 investigated the resistance of a high speed catamaran with a bulbous bow in calm water numerically the simulations were carried out at different advance velocities the free surface elevations the pressure distributions on the hull and the vortices near the hull were discussed in detail in the study of haase et al 2016 a large medium speed catamaran was analyzed numerically at two different model scales an extrapolation method for full scale including the roughness effects was presented the extrapolated results were compared with the full scale measurements zhou et al 2016 discussed the reliability of the form factor calculated by the prohaska method for high speed catamarans they conducted numerical analyses for a catamaran with asymmetrical hulls at high speeds and proposed new form factors at each froude number instead of using the prohaska method in the study of castiglione et al 2011 the authors investigated the free surface flow around delft catamaran in regular waves using a numerical method the numerical results were first verified to ensure numerical uncertainty then the vertical motions and added resistance results were compared with the model experiments and potential flow results the results were in good agreement even in high froude numbers and high wave amplitudes he et al 2013 conducted numerical analyses to simulate the free surface flow around delft catamaran in calm water and head waves in this comprehensive study an extensive verification and validation study was conducted for both calm water and head wave conditions the total resistance added resistance and the vertical motions were obtained in particular slamming loads on the desired locations of the hull were calculated the results were finally discussed for different geometries the recent study of wang et al 2020 involves the effect of the stern flap on the hydrodynamics of a catamaran in regular head waves the numerical method was first verified in both spatial and temporal manners the results are in good agreement with the experimental ones in terms of resistance heave and pitch motions in different wavelengths and amplitudes the effect of two different stern flap geometries on these parameters was then discussed some other studies are focusing on the maneuvering performance of delft catamaran by using viscous solvers in particular these studies deal with the flow around delft catamaran in static drift conditions dogan 2013 used two numerical methods to predict the hydrodynamic performance of delft catamaran in static drift conditions the vortex structures and the interaction between the hull wake and vortices were observed at a wide range of froude numbers and drift angles the results were compared to the experimental data available in the literature falchi et al 2014 focused on the experimental investigation of delft catamaran in static drift conditions using the spiv technique the authors aimed to observe the vortices around the catamaran hull for different froude numbers and drift angles the interaction between the wave pattern and the vorticity was also discussed broglia et al brogliaet al 2019 investigated the flow around delft 372 catamaran in static drift conditions numerically various numerical codes were employed with different turbulence models the numerical results were validated with the available experimental data and it is found that the numerical simulation shows a little deviation in terms of resistance lateral force and yaw moment duman and bal 2019 aimed to calculate the maneuvering coefficients of delft catamaran using a numerical method the simulations were conducted regarding pmm planar motion mechanism approach the authors validated their method following the verification process to the best of authors knowledge besides the studies given above there exists no specific study about the interference effects on added wave resistance of the multihull forms such as catamaran and trimaran in this study urans analyses of delft catamaran 372 were carried out at fr 0 3 in regular head waves the commercial cfd code siemens plm star ccm is used to discretize the urans equations by applying the finite volume method the numerical approach was verified and validated with an appropriate uncertainty analysis methods the vertical motion transfer functions tfs and added resistance were calculated for both the catamaran and demihull following this the interference factor of added resistance was calculated in each regular wave frequency the results were discussed in detail the paper is organized as follows section 2 depicts the geometric definition of the hull forms and numerical background covering the solution procedure and the mesh algorithm section 3 gives information about the verification and validation processes section 4 gives the obtained numerical results with respect to motion and added resistance tfs also interference factors were given and discussed finally the concluding remarks were given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 delft catamaran 372 in this study the widely used benchmark delft catamaran 372 was chosen for the investigation of the seakeeping performance and the interference effects the catamaran model was designed and a comprehensive experimental work was conducted by van t veer van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b total resistance data is available in calm water while the vertical motion results were presented for regular head wave conditions fig 1 shows the body plan of the catamaran the main particulars of the model and full scale catamarans were given in table 1 2 2 numerical setup the numerical method including the flow properties and the boundary conditions are explained briefly the computational domain dimensions and the mesh generation procedure are also given in detail in this section 2 2 1 physics modelling in the present study a commercial viscous solver was used to solve unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the governing equations which are the continuity and momentum equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm the continuity equation can be given as 1 u i x i 0 velocity can be derived as the mean velocity and the fluctuating velocity components respectively 2 u i u i u i the momentum equations can be written in tensor notation and cartesian coordinates 3 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i u i u j x j here ρ depicts the fluid density u i is the velocity vector and p represents the pressure the last two terms belong to the viscous stress tensor while υ is the kinematic viscosity the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations which is also called simple algorithm was used for the solution procedure the closure problem of the governing equations was overcome using the k ε turbulence model that is widely used in numerical ship hydrodynamics detailed information about this model can be found in wilcox 2006 to represent the experimental conditions identically the catamaran model was fixed except heave and pitch motions while advancing both in calm water and regular head wave to represent the 2dof motion accurately the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi method was used two different coordinate systems were defined earth fixed and ship fixed the flow direction is considered to be in the negative x direction to take into account the free surface effect volume of fluid vof approach was used hirt and nichols 1981 with high resolution interface capturing hric the main features of the physical model are listed in table 2 in the present work the time step size was correlated with the encounter period and defined by considering ittc ittc 2014 recommendations the time step sizes were calculated as follow 4 δt t e 2 9 2 2 2 mesh generation in the present study the benchmark delft catamaran 372 was investigated numerically to predict the calm water and regular head wave performance of the delft catamaran 372 the computational domain was created taking the ittc recommendations ittc 2014 and recent numerical studies dogrul et al 2020 cakici et al 2018 into account the same computational domain was used for all numerical analyses including calm water and regular head wave analyses of demi hull and catamaran the computational domain used in this study is shown in fig 2 it should be noted that since the physical phenomena are symmetrical following the centerline of the model only half of the computational model was used to reduce the computational cost the boundary conditions are also shown in fig 2 the left side of the domain was selected as velocity inlet while the right side of it was selected as pressure outlet since the catamaran model has a rigid body the model is defined as no slip wall to dictate the normal component of the velocity on the model is zero it should be also kept in mind that the boundary on the centerline was defined as symmetry plane while the other boundaries top bottom and side were selected as velocity inlet no damping zone was applied on the boundary surfaces besides no reflections were observed in the numerical simulations the computational domain was discretized with finite hexahedral elements the computational domain was separated into two different mesh zones overset mesh and rigid mesh the overset mesh which proved its adequacy was used around the model where the translation and orientation are huge while the rigid mesh was used on the far field trimmer mesh algorithm was applied in both overset and rigid mesh zones with local mesh refinements near the free surface and kelvin wave pattern the prism layer mesh was applied near the hull geometry to model the flow in the near wall region precisely while keeping the wall y values between 30 and 300 the computational domain was created large enough and no wave reflections from the boundaries were observed it should be kept in mind that the mesh size is enlarged from the overset region to the static region to decrease the number of elements the mesh structure and the local refinements are shown in fig 3 a and fig 3 b and the features of the prism layer were listed in table 3 3 verification assessment in the present study gci grid convergence index cf correction factor and gci lsr least square methods were used for the verification purpose all of these methods are based on richardson extrapolation richardson 1911 the first verification method was firstly proposed by roache 1998 and the methodology followed in this study is summarized properly by celik et al 2008 the second one was also proposed and abstracted properly by stern et al 2001 and wilson et al 2001 the last one was offered by eça and hoekstra 2006 for the first two verification assessments three different solutions were created in terms of grid and time step size with a systematic refinement although four different solutions were created for the last one while the refinement is applied in terms of time step the grid size was kept constant or vice versa firstly the differences between each solution has to be calculated to ensure reaching a convergence regime 5 ε 21 x 2 x 1 ε 32 x 3 x 2 6 r ε 21 ε 32 here x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent the value of the fine medium and coarse solution of grid or time step size the convergence factor r can be calculated by using equation 6 after obtaining the convergence factor there are four possibilities i r 1 monotonic divergence ii r 1 oscillatory divergence iii 0 r 1 oscillatory convergence iv 0 r 1 monotonic convergence if the monotonic convergence regime is reached the first two verification assessments can be used otherwise different calculations can be needed for the determination of the uncertainties after reaching the last possibility the methodology summarized by celik et al 2008 can be used for the gci method and the methodology presented by stern et al 2001 and wilson et al 2001 can be followed for the cf method however for the gci lsr method the convergence regime can be determined in terms of apparent convergence condition plsr this value has to be greater than 1 to reach a convergence regime eça and hoekstra 2006 the detailed information can be found in related references it should be noted that the refinement factor was kept constant and 2 for the grid refinement and for the time step refinement similar to recent studies in the literature tezdogan et al 2015 romanowski et al 2019 the obtained element numbers after refinements and the time step sizes are listed in table 4 the uncertainty values were evaluated by using three methods gci cf and gci lsr since the main aim of the study is directly related to the seakeeping performance a seakeeping case was selected for the verification purpose the vessel advances with fr 0 3 and encountered a regular head wave which has 3 303 m length and 0 03747 m height the details of the selected case case 6 can be found in table 7 in table 5 and table 6 the uncertainty values of the heave pitch motions and the total resistance for the selected case are listed the spatial uncertainty of the heave pitch motions and the total resistance of the first data set 1 2 3 is very low for the gci and cf methods although the uncertainty value for the gci lsr is higher the maximum uncertainty values were obtained from the gci lsr method for all hydrodynamic parameters while the maximum grid uncertainty value was obtained from the heave amplitude the similar interpretations can be made for the temporal one the monotonic convergence regime was observed in all simulation sets except for 1 2 3 data set for the temporal uncertainty of the total resistance it should be noted that the apparent convergence condition for the gci lsr method plsr was fixed to the theoretical order when it exceeds the theoretical order de luca et al 2016 fig 4 a and fig 4 b show that the change in the scalar such as the vertical motion amplitudes and the total resistance becomes very little concerning the increase in the precision in terms of grid number and time step size 4 numerical results as explained before the numerical cases were selected identical to the experiments to make a meaningful comparison the numerical analyses were conducted to predict the total resistance in calm water afterwards the seakeeping performance was estimated in head wave conditions the particulars of the selected cases are listed in table 7 it should be reported that all numerical analyses in head wave condition took approximately 10 12 h of wall clock time with a 30 core processor with 128 gb ram for five periods of simulation for each case it should be also noted that efd experimental fluid dynamics represents the experimental results in the figures presented in this section 4 1 calm water results since the main aim of this study is to calculate the numerical added resistance if the calm water resistance characteristics of the catamaran and demi hull should be predicted accurately before calculating the seakeeping performance of the catamaran the total resistance in the calm water condition was calculated with the same boundary conditions and computational domain the numerical results of the catamaran in calm water were compared with the available experimental data and the cfd results of the paper published by castiglione et al which is based on cfdship iowa castiglione et al 2011 the relative differences between numerical studies and experimental data are listed in table 8 it can be easily concluded from fig 5 and table 8 that the numerical method has similar trend with the experimental data in a wide range of froude numbers also it can be deduced from this figure that although the resistance values of the present study and the other numerical study are in the same order of accuracy the trim and sinkage values of the present study were closer to the experimental ones especially in relatively higher froude numbers 4 2 motion results before starting to analyze the vertical motion in regular head waves the generated wave should be investigated and compared with the actual wave to show that there is an acceptable difference between the two of them to achieve this goal a numerical wave probe is placed on the virtual towing tank and the free surface elevation between the vessel and the inlet is recorded the wave probe was located at 1 5 m in front of and 1 7 m side of the vessel in fig 6 the recorded wave elevation is shown for case 8 the comparison with the theoretical stokes wave was also given in fig 6 for comparison the theoretical wave profile was obtained in accordance with the paper of fenton 1985 the fourier series approximation explained in details below was applied to the time history and the first harmonic of the signal was found 0 0183 m while the actual wave amplitude is equal to 0 0179 m this small reduction 2 2 was found acceptable similar to tezdogan et al 2015 as explained before the seakeeping analyses were conducted for fr 0 3 and a wide range of wave frequencies listed in table 7 after reaching the steady state heave and pitch motions in head seas the transfer functions tfs associate with heave and pitch are calculated by the following methodology i firstly the heave and pitch motions in the time domain are represented using the trigonometric fourier series expansion 7 η i t η i 0 n 1 n η i n cos ω t β i n n 1 2 3 i 3 5 8 a i 1 2 t 0 t η i t sin ω t d t 9 b i 1 2 t 0 t η i t cos ω t d t 10 η i 1 a i 1 2 b i 1 2 11 β i 1 arctan a i 1 b i 1 here η i 0 represents the zeroth harmonic of the selected signal heave or pitch a i 1 and b i 1 represent the euler coefficients η i 1 represents the first harmonic of the selected motion and finally β i 1 represents the phase angle since the motion can be represented by a single frequency which is the encounter frequency the first harmonic of the motion signal is symbolized as η i instead of η i 1 for simplicity ii after obtaining the first harmonic of these motions the tfs of the heave and pitch motions can be calculated as follows 12 tf 3 η 3 a 13 tf 5 η 5 ak where η 3 η 5 a and k depict the first harmonic of the heave and pitch motions wave amplitude and wavenumber 2 π λ respectively here λ is the wavelength it should be kept in mind that the wave amplitude a and wavenumber k are related to regular wave properties and those were selected as listed in table 7 before starting to implement the procedure given above the vertical motion of the vessel is visualized to ensure the representation of the 2dof motion accurately case 8 is selected to reach this aim and the vertical motion of the vessel in this case is shown in fig 7 it should be noted that since the similar figures are obtained from the other cases only one case is given the heave and pitch tfs are compared with the available experimental data and the numerical results of the paper by castiglione et al 2011 in fig 8 although the tfs of heave and pitch motions are in very good agreement with the experimental data the employed viscous solver underestimates these two motions in almost all wave frequencies when the other numerical study is taken into consideration one may see that the present study has better results except for the heave motion near resonance cases to discover the interference effects the same regular wave cases are imposed on catamaran and demihull models fig 9 shows heave and pitch tfs aimed at the catamaran and demihull it can be noted that near the resonance region the heave tfs show remarkable difference while the pitch tfs show slight difference for catamaran and demi hull to explain tf plots physically the wave elevation contours were recorded near the resonance case for heave motion in this case the pitch motion of the catamaran is almost the same as the demi hull this case is selected in purpose to eliminate the effect of coupled motions fig 10 shows the wave elevation of the demi hull and catamaran for case 5 for a fair comparison the wave elevation figures were captured at the moment when the ships go down around z 0 level as understood from fig 10 wave crests and wave troughs are more pronounced for the catamaran compared to the demi hull this explains how the amplitude of the heave motion of the catamaran is greater than that of the demihull at the resonance case it should be noted that the similar comparisons could be made for the other cases as well 4 3 added resistance results in waves and interference effect the hull design process in terms of the required power shall include the accurate estimation of the added resistance in waves therefore the added resistance component of a ship due to the waves should be obtained even in the conceptual design phase as clearly known the resistance component in the opposite direction of ship advance is used for obtaining the added resistance in waves the added resistance data is obtained for a wide range of wave frequency and fr 0 3 for both catamaran and demihull as following 14 r a w t r t t r c w t please note that r a w t r c w t and r t t are the signals showing the added resistance calm water and total resistance components respectively after obtaining r a w t signal using the zeroth harmonic the mean value of r a w t which is r a w is calculated after calculating the added resistance due to the waves it was non dimensionalized as follows 15 σ a w r a w ρ g ζ 2 b w l 2 l b p here σ a w is called as the added resistance coefficient here ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity and ζ is the first harmonic of the incident wave signal fig 11 shows the total and the added resistance values for the catamaran and demi hull and fig 12 gives the numerical results of the added resistance coefficient for different wavelengths as understood from fig 11 the calm water resistance value of one demihull is obtained and multiplied by two in order to compare with the calm water resistance of catamaran as expected the total resistance of the catamaran is larger than the demihull due to the interference effects between the hulls the difference is caused by calm water resistance as explained in the next section on the other hand the behavior of the added resistance value changes with the wave frequency the added resistance value of the catamaran at inertia region is greater than the added resistance of demihull however there is no specific inference at the damping and the hydrostatic regions as explained previous subsection wave crests and wave troughs are more pronounced for the catamaran compared to the demihull for case 5 this also explains why the added resistance value of the catamaran is greater than the demihull in that case the if can be calculated for total resistance and resistance components and it reflects the interaction of side hulls when they are collocated in the present study the if was also calculated in regular head waves in addition to the calm water condition the if for calm water total resistance can be calculated as follows 16 i f c a l m r t c a t a m a r a n 2 x r t d e m i h u l l r t c a t a m a r a n in equation 16 r t c a t a m a r a n r t d e m i h u l l and i f c a l m depict the total resistance of catamaran in calm water demihull total resistance and the if in calm water condition respectively table 9 gives the if of the total resistance in calm water the collocation of the side hulls causes an increase of 6 40 in total resistance the if for total resistance in regular head wave was also calculated with the same approach as given in equation 16 the total resistance values in different wavelengths were obtained for both catamaran and demihull for fr 0 3 fig 13 shows the interference effect of the total resistance in head wave while table 10 gives the numerical results in detail having an average value of 6 35 if the average of the if of total resistance in head waves has approximately the same with calm water condition as a highlight of the present study the if of added resistance was calculated at different wavelengths the if at the peak case for added resistance tf see table 11 is 9 88 while the maximum if values occur in the shortest wavelengths following these short waves the if becomes negative until λ l 1 107 that is near the resonance case of motions there is no correlation observed between the wave frequencies and if of added resistance the average value for the if of added resistance in head waves is about 7 5 it is found that the average value of the if of added resistance due to waves is close to that of the total resistance in head waves fig 14 shows the if in a graph for each wave length it is obvious that the added resistance if becomes negative in some cases in contrast to if of the total resistance these cases are generally correspond to the cases in which the pitch motion of the demi hull is higher compare to catamaran in the same way the positive if occurs generally when the pitch motion of the demi hull is less than the catamaran within these arguments it can be said that the pitch motion is more dominant compared to heave motion on the added resistance and if 5 concluding remarks within this study the added resistance which can be directly used for the accurate estimation of the increase in power demand was calculated in waves for this purpose delft catamaran 372 benchmark hull was investigated in terms of hydrodynamic performance in calm water and regular head wave conditions the numerical analyses were carried out at fr 0 3 using a commercial rans solver the numerical method was verified using appropriate methods and the validation was made with the available experimental data the numerical analyses in calm water and regular head wave were conducted for both catamaran and demihull to determine the interference factor results of the calm water and regular head wave conditions were compared with the experimental data it is found that the present study shows a better agreement with the experimental ones in terms of total resistance trim and sinkage when compared to another relevant numerical study heave and pitch tfs also show a better agreement with the experimental results total resistance values in the regular head wave were obtained for both catamaran and demihull it is found that the peak value frequency for the total resistance of catamaran in waves is lower than the one of demihull the interference factor changes with respect to the wave frequency for both total resistance and added resistance however the change in the interference factor of added resistance is more prominent with higher positive and negative peaks while these peak values occur at the same frequencies one of the main deductions of this study is that the interference factor of total resistance in head waves oscillates around the calm water interference factor it is also understood that the pitch motion affects more the added resistance interference factor compared to heave motion as a future work the demihull distance in catamaran configuration will be investigated in terms of vertical motions and interference factor of added resistance to compare different configurations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

21026,the inevitably produced vibrations during navigation will reduce the reliability of ships the propulsion shaft system and the hull are connected by bearings to form complex longitudinal coupled vibrations the study of longitudinal coupled vibration mechanism and its transmission characteristics during the navigation is of great significance for the reduction of vibration and noise in this study the longitudinal vibration model of the conical cylindrical shell and homogeneous shaft is established by the analytical method while the accuracy of the analytical solution is verified by finite element method fem both the propeller excitation on the shaft and the external excitation on the shell are under consideration and in view of the uneven flow field around the hull the excitation applied to the shell is set to be asymmetrical based on this model the effects of coupling effect fluid loading excitations bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of the system are analyzed respectively the results show that the coupling effect between the longitudinal vibration of the shaft and shell is evident and is greatest under the excitation on the shell in a lower frequency range moreover besides of damping and mass effects the fluid loading on the hull also influence the vibration response of the shaft due to the coupling effect the increase of the bearing stiffness strengthens the coupling effect of shaft shell these findings are helpful for analyzing the vibration mechanism of the stern and provide control direction for ship structural vibration in

will not only deteriorate the working environment onboard but also cause certain safety hazards therefore it is of great significance to study the vibration mechanism main structures of the ship consist of the hull and propulsion shaft which are coupled by bearings the vibration of the propulsion shaft will be transmitted to the hull through the bearing dylejko and kessissoglou 2004 vice versa zhang et al 2016 thus it is a complex two way vibration transmission between the propulsion shaft and the hull the coupling effect cannot be ignored as the most important structure of the ship vibration characteristics of the hull and shaft have been studied thoroughly by many scholars cylindrical shell is an important foundation of various engineering structures and many scholars have analyzed its vibration based on the sanders koiter theory pellicano 2007 analyzed the influence of different boundary conditions on the vibration of the cylindrical shell cao and wang 2007 founded the variational equations of cylindrical shells mode shape solutions and natural frequencies was given by characteristic value analysis and functional variation due to the existence of the cone apex angle

model the thrust bearing is simplified into a spring and set on the joint of the shaft and the shell in longitudinal direction thus the thrust bearing force acting on the shell is 42 f t k u s k u c

the shaft and the shell bearing force can be regarded as external excitation the boundary conditions of the shaft can be expressed as 53 e a u s x f t 3 numerical verification the model for numerical calculation is shown in fig 4 model parameters are shown in table 1 the asymmetric excitation f 1 loaded at the small end of the conical shell and the symmetric excitation f 2 loaded on the propeller end are considered as shown in fig 4 both these two excitations are in longitudinal direction the response points are chosen at the joint point s between the thrust bearing and the shaft and the joint point c between thrust bearing and the shell as marked in fig 4 a numerical model is established by fem bem to verify the accuracy of analytical method the case of the coupled model under axial excitation f 1 with the amplitude 1 n is chosen as the example the results of vibration response at point c obtained by analytical method and fem bem method are compared in fig 5 it can be seen that the basic trend of the response curves obtained by the two methods is consistent and most of the positions and the amplitudes of resonance frequency peaks are similar the location and size of some wave crests are slightly different especially at higher frequency range the main reason is the approximate treatment of cone shells in the analytical method however the verification results of the two methods are within an acceptable range in general the analytical method for the longitudinal vibration responses of the coupled shaft shell system is reliable 4 results and discussion in this part the effects of coupling effect fluid excitation and bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of the shaft shell coupled system are discussed respectively the calculation model is same as that in chapter 3 4 1 analysis of coupling effect of longitudinal vibration between shaft and shell it mainly discusses the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell through the thrust bearing and its influence on the longitudinal vibration the results of coupling and uncoupling of the shaft and the shell are gained respectively the excitations are applied to the small end of the conical shell f 1 and to the shaft end f 2 at the same time the displacement of the point c on the shell and the point s on the shaft are taken as shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that when the shaft and the shell are not coupled the shaft has no resonance frequency in the frequency range of 0 100 hz which is mainly due to the higher axial tensile stiffness of the shaft when the shaft and shell are coupled the shell has an evident peak at 20 hz also the shaft has more resonant peaks the amplitude of the displacement of the two substructures are closer to each other it reflects that the shaft and the shell transmit vibration to each other through the thrust bearing the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell is important 4 2 effect of fluid on the longitudinal vibration of shaft shell coupled model the effect of fluid on the shell is discussed in this part by comparing the results of longitudinal vibration of the shaft shell coupled system in fluid and in vacuo the excitations f 1 and f 2 are applied simultaneously with the amplitudes 1 n the vibration responses of shell point c and shaft point s on the model in fluid and in vacuo are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from the figure that the damping effect of the fluid reduces the vibration amplitude of the shell and the additional mass effect of the fluid decreases the resonance frequencies meanwhile although the fluid is loading on the shell the vibration response of the shaft is also influenced by the fluid loading to be specific in vacuo there are obvious peaks in the displacement response of the shaft and the shell around 30 hz however the shaft does not have a peak for the submerged model at this frequency also the amplitude of the peak at 12 hz in the shaft curve is lower for the submerged model 4 3 effect of excitations on the longitudinal vibration of shaft shell coupled model excitation f 1 is applied at the small end of the conical shell with the amplitude 1 n and excitation f 2 with the same amplitude is applied at the propeller end of the shaft the longitudinal vibration responses of various response points are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that when excitation is applied to the end of the shell the longitudinal vibration responses of shell and shaft are similar at lower frequency range however at higher frequency range the resonance peak amplitudes of the shell are greater than the shaft response and the difference are larger as the frequency increase when the excitation is applied to the end of the shafting system the shafting displacement response is always greater than the shell response and the displacement responses of the two only have obvious peaks in the lower frequency range regardless of whether the excitation is applied to the end of the shell or the end of the shaft the displacement response trends of the shell and shaft are basically same thus it can be concluded that the coupling effect between shaft and shell is greatest under longitudinal excitation on the shell in the lower frequency range moreover the vibration of the structure subjected to external excitation occupies the main component of the system vibration which affects the vibration of the structure transmitted from the bearing force 4 4 effect of bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of shaft shell coupled model the influence of the bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration characteristics of the shaft shell coupling system are discussed in this section the stiffness of all bearings in the model are set as k 1 10 7 n m k 2 10 8 n m k 3 10 9 n m k 4 10 10 n m respectively the vibration responses of response points c s are taken to examine the effect of bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of the coupled system of submerged conical cylindrical shell and shaft the results of the responses are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that when the bearing stiffness is small the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell is weak and the displacement response trend of the shaft and the shell is basically unchanged as the stiffness of the bearing increases the displacement responses of the shaft and the shell are gradually approaching in terms of resonance frequency and amplitude the displacement responses of the shaft and the shell would be consistent when a certain value is reached for the stiffness the shaft shell coupling occurs first in the lower frequency range the frequency range of the coupling gradually enlarges as the stiffness of the bearing increases 5 conclusions in this paper an analytical method is presented to study the longitudinal vibration characteristics of the coupling system of the shaft and conical cylindrical shell the thrust bearing is simplified to a spring and seen as the connection between the shaft and the conical cylindrical shell the symmetrical excitation from the shaft and asymmetrical excitation from the shell are considered the main conclusions drawn from this study are 1 the shaft and the shell transmit longitudinal vibration to each other through the thrust bearing the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell is important 2 the damping effect of fluid reduces the vibration amplitude of the shell while the additional mass effect of fluid reduces resonance frequency the longitudinal vibration response of the shaft is also influenced by the fluid loading on the shell 3 the longitudinal vibration subjected to external excitation occupies the main component and affects the vibration transmitted from the bearing force the coupling effect between shaft and shell is greatest under longitudinal excitation on the shell in the lower frequency range 4 with the increase of bearing stiffness the coupling effect of shaft shell is strengthened shaft shell coupling first occurs in the lower frequency range as the stiffness of the bearing increases the frequency range of coupling effect gradually increases this paper analyzes the mechanism of longitudinal vibration of the shaft shell coupling structure and provides the theoretical basis and control direction for ship vibration in the design stage credit authorship contribution statement

21026,the inevitably produced vibrations during navigation will reduce the reliability of ships the propulsion shaft system and the hull are connected by bearings to form complex longitudinal coupled vibrations the study of longitudinal coupled vibration mechanism and its transmission characteristics during the navigation is of great significance for the reduction of vibration and noise in this study the longitudinal vibration model of the conical cylindrical shell and homogeneous shaft is established by the analytical method while the accuracy of the analytical solution is verified by finite element method fem both the propeller excitation on the shaft and the external excitation on the shell are under consideration and in view of the uneven flow field around the hull the excitation applied to the shell is set to be asymmetrical based on this model the effects of coupling effect fluid loading excitations bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of the system are analyzed respectively the results show that the coupling effect between the longitudinal vibration of the shaft and shell is evident and is greatest under the excitation on the shell in a lower frequency range moreover besides of damping and mass effects the fluid loading on the hull also influence the vibration response of the shaft due to the coupling effect the increase of the bearing stiffness strengthens the coupling effect of shaft shell these findings are helpful for analyzing the vibration mechanism of the stern and provide control direction for ship structural vibration in

will not only deteriorate the working environment onboard but also cause certain safety hazards therefore it is of great significance to study the vibration mechanism main structures of the ship consist of the hull and propulsion shaft which are coupled by bearings the vibration of the propulsion shaft will be transmitted to the hull through the bearing dylejko and kessissoglou 2004 vice versa zhang et al 2016 thus it is a complex two way vibration transmission between the propulsion shaft and the hull the coupling effect cannot be ignored as the most important structure of the ship vibration characteristics of the hull and shaft have been studied thoroughly by many scholars cylindrical shell is an important foundation of various engineering structures and many scholars have

model of shaft and shell was established by analytical method and verified the importance of the bearing to the shaft shell coupled vibration xie et al 2017 used flügge shell theory and timoshenko beam theory to describe the motion of shell and beam and established the beam shell coupled motion equation the connections of shell and beam are seen as beams at the foundations chen et al 2018 established the shaft and shell models separately connected shaft and shell by frequency response function method the vibration characteristics of the sub structure and the overall structure were compared and analyzed as mentioned above in the existing researches the vibration characteristics of propulsion shaft and hull were widely studied by numerical experimental and analytical methods in the analytical researches some references analyzed the results for only shaft or shell some others only studied the vibration characteristics under axisymmetric excitation or ignored two way effects

model the thrust bearing is simplified into a spring and set on the joint of the shaft and the shell in longitudinal direction thus the thrust bearing force acting on the shell is 42 f t k u s k u c

the shaft and the shell bearing force can be regarded as external excitation the boundary conditions of the shaft can be expressed as 53 e a u s x f t 3 numerical verification the model for numerical calculation is shown in fig 4 model parameters are shown in table 1 the asymmetric excitation f 1 loaded at the small end of the conical shell and the symmetric excitation f 2 loaded on the propeller end are considered as shown in fig 4 both these two excitations are in longitudinal direction the response points are chosen at the joint point s between the thrust bearing and the shaft and the joint point c between thrust bearing and the shell as marked in fig 4 a numerical model is established by fem bem to verify the accuracy of analytical method the case of the coupled model under axial excitation f 1 with the amplitude 1 n is chosen as the example the results of vibration response at point c obtained by analytical method and fem bem method are compared in fig 5 it can be seen that the basic trend of the response curves obtained by the two methods is consistent and most of the positions and the amplitudes of resonance frequency peaks are similar the location and size of some wave crests are slightly different especially at higher frequency range the main reason is the approximate treatment of cone shells in the analytical method however the verification results of the two methods are within an acceptable range in general the analytical method for the longitudinal vibration responses of the coupled shaft shell system is reliable 4 results and discussion in this part the effects of coupling effect fluid excitation and bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of the shaft shell coupled system are discussed respectively the calculation model is same as that in chapter 3 4 1 analysis of coupling effect of longitudinal vibration between shaft and shell it mainly discusses the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell through the thrust bearing and its influence on the longitudinal vibration the results of coupling and uncoupling of the shaft and the shell are gained respectively the excitations are applied to the small end of the conical shell f 1 and to the shaft end f 2 at the same time the displacement of the point c on the shell and the point s on the shaft are taken as shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that when the shaft and the shell are not coupled the shaft has no resonance frequency in the frequency range of 0 100 hz which is mainly due to the higher axial tensile stiffness of the shaft when the shaft and shell are coupled the shell has an evident peak at 20 hz also the shaft has more resonant peaks the amplitude of the displacement of the two substructures are closer to each other it reflects that the shaft and the shell transmit vibration to each other through the thrust bearing the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell is important 4 2 effect of fluid on the longitudinal vibration of shaft shell coupled model the effect of fluid on the shell is discussed in this part by comparing the results of longitudinal vibration of the shaft shell coupled system in fluid and in vacuo the excitations f 1 and f 2 are applied simultaneously with the amplitudes 1 n the vibration responses of shell point c and shaft point s on the model in fluid and in vacuo are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from the figure that the damping effect of the fluid reduces the vibration amplitude of the shell and the additional mass effect of the fluid decreases the resonance frequencies meanwhile although the fluid is loading on the shell the vibration response of the shaft is also influenced by the fluid loading to be specific in vacuo there are obvious peaks in the displacement response of the shaft and the shell around 30 hz however the shaft does not have a peak for the submerged model at this frequency also the amplitude of the peak at 12 hz in the shaft curve is lower for the submerged model 4 3 effect of excitations on the longitudinal vibration of shaft shell coupled model excitation f 1 is applied at the small end of the conical shell with the amplitude 1 n and excitation f 2 with the same amplitude is applied at the propeller end of the shaft the longitudinal vibration responses of various response points are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that when excitation is applied to the end of the shell the longitudinal vibration responses of shell and shaft are similar at lower frequency range however at higher frequency range the resonance peak amplitudes of the shell are greater than the shaft response and the difference are larger as the frequency increase when the excitation is applied to the end of the shafting system the shafting displacement response is always greater than the shell response and the displacement responses of the two only have obvious peaks in the lower frequency range regardless of whether the excitation is applied to the end of the shell or the end of the shaft the displacement response trends of the shell and shaft are basically same thus it can be concluded that the coupling effect between shaft and shell is greatest under longitudinal excitation on the shell in the lower frequency range moreover the vibration of the structure subjected to external excitation occupies the main component of the system vibration which affects the vibration of the structure transmitted from the bearing force 4 4 effect of bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of shaft shell coupled model the influence of the bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration characteristics of the shaft shell coupling system are discussed in this section the stiffness of all bearings in the model are set as k 1 10 7 n m k 2 10 8 n m k 3 10 9 n m k 4 10 10 n m respectively the vibration responses of response points c s are taken to examine the effect of bearing stiffness on the longitudinal vibration of the coupled system of submerged conical cylindrical shell and shaft the results of the responses are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that when the bearing stiffness is small the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell is weak and the displacement response trend of the shaft and the shell is basically unchanged as the stiffness of the bearing increases the displacement responses of the shaft and the shell are gradually approaching in terms of resonance frequency and amplitude the displacement responses of the shaft and the shell would be consistent when a certain value is reached for the stiffness the shaft shell coupling occurs first in the lower frequency range the frequency range of the coupling gradually enlarges as the stiffness of the bearing increases 5 conclusions in this paper an analytical method is presented to study the longitudinal vibration characteristics of the coupling system of the shaft and conical cylindrical shell the thrust bearing is simplified to a spring and seen as the connection between the shaft and the conical cylindrical shell the symmetrical excitation from the shaft and asymmetrical excitation from the shell are considered the main conclusions drawn from this study are 1 the shaft and the shell transmit longitudinal vibration to each other through the thrust bearing the coupling effect between the shaft and the shell is important 2 the damping effect of fluid reduces the vibration amplitude of the shell while the additional mass effect of fluid reduces resonance frequency the longitudinal vibration response of the shaft is also influenced by the fluid loading on the shell 3 the longitudinal vibration subjected to external excitation occupies the main component and affects the vibration transmitted from the bearing force the coupling effect between shaft and shell is greatest under longitudinal excitation on the shell in the lower frequency range 4 with the increase of bearing stiffness the coupling effect of shaft shell is strengthened shaft shell coupling first occurs in the lower frequency range as the stiffness of the bearing increases the frequency range of coupling effect gradually increases this paper analyzes the mechanism of longitudinal vibration of the shaft shell coupling structure and provides the theoretical basis and control direction for ship vibration in the design stage credit authorship contribution statement

21027,in response to the increasing renewable energy demand harvesting the energy from kuroshio become an important task in taiwan in this study the ansys fluent and ansys aqwa were used to design a spar platform for carrying multiple current energy harvesters the platform follows the design code of abs rules abs 2014 the designed spar model was established in orcaflex and so as the mooring line system including the anchor chain and duct chain was built the simulated results show the spar is stable under normal and storm wave conditions the pre designed nozzle diffuser duct ndd can capture 15 kw of current energy however as a megawatt power plant 60 ducts are needed to be deployed the proposed spar platform could be used as a carrier to overcome the difficulties of deploying 60 ndds to seabed and it may also reduce the construction costs the simulated results show the spar and associated ndds are stable under normal and storm wave conditions this study suggests the platform may be expected to carry more than 60 ndds and the megawatt kuroshio energy harvester is feasible to be deployed at the east coast of taiwan in the future keywords kuroshio energy platform energy harvester fluent aqwa orcaflex 1 introduction to reduce the impact of energy shortages and maintain the development of human society exploring various renewable energy sources has become a top priority taiwan has begun to develop offshore renewable energy to replace fossil fuels and hopes to meet most of its energy consumption in the next two decades renewable energy resources include wind energy wave energy tidal energy and ocean current energy jacobson and delucchi 2011 yang et al 2016 zou et al 2019 tidal currents are ubiquitous worldwide and together with major ocean currents represent an important source of renewable energy in terms of ocean kinetic energy moreover ocean currents are highly predictable and major ocean currents such as the gulf stream and kuroshio flow quite continuously in many parts of the world as parts of the ocean circulation system taiwan is a small island without plenty of natural resources and most of its fuel and energy resources are imported therefore developing renewable energy has become one of the most concerned issues for taiwan although wind power is the most popular renewable energy source in the world taiwan wind speeds that can be used for power generation usually occur in winter yet winter requires less energy the peak season for electricity consumption in taiwan occurs in summer but the wind speed is relatively slow according to overview epri ocean energy plan the possibility of california bedard 2006 wind power can generate 70 of the capacitance in winter in taiwan and only 6 of the capacitance in summer this shows that wind energy is not a stable alternative energy source for taiwan another popular renewable energy is solar energy which may seem like a very feasible alternative energy in summertime however taiwan is an island lack of adequate lands to install enough solar panels to support the total power capacity nevertheless taiwan is surrounded by the ocean as a result taiwan has an advantage in developing ocean energy capture technology there are already many ways to generate energy from the ocean including waves tides and currents yang et al 2016 tidal energy in taiwan is limited because the maximum tidal range of taichung is about 5 m which is not enough for commercial operations wave energy density in taiwan is less than 15 kw m which is far below commercial value researchers chen 2010 chen et al 2016 uihlein and magagna 2016 nedo 2017 b f chen et al 2018 jo and hwang 2020 reported the attraction challenge and current status of marine current energy clearly describes the latest challenge and development of marine current energy technology chen 2010 studied the main supporting structures of ocean current energy harvesters and found that they mainly depend on depth in addition to tidal current energy the global ocean current such as gulf stream and kuroshio have constant flow and carries huge amount of water and energy across the ocean yan et al 2007 made an observation of kuroshio by using lowered adcp ladcp and they concluded that ladcp has become an important instrument for observing the profile of currents last decade the ladcp can measure the profiles of current up to 6000 m in depth they set two transects and eight stations which located southeast of lanyu island the extreme value appears at a depth of 100 m approximately 80 cm s hsu et al 2015 also reported the assessment of kuroshio current power test site of green island taiwan and introduced more detailed kuroshio current power density and pointed out more reliable energy sources many tidal energy extraction devices have been reported such as seagen the blue concept thg tidel smd hydrovision and blue energy etc vikas et al 2016 the kuroshio fig 1 crosses in the east coast of taiwan the water depth in this area is about 500 1000 m in those deep water environments it is nearly impossible to fix the generator on the seabed like the tidal energy devices the purpose of this research is to propose a platform to carry the kuroshio energy harvester a single point anchored reservoir spar platform was proposed which is a floating platform often used in the offshore drilling industry chen and huang 2016 reported a submerged energy capture system nozzle diffuser duct ndd which can increase the pressure gradient between inflow and outflow and the flow velocity inside the shroud could be increased thereby increasing the efficiency of the turbine the average kuroshio speed is 1 0 m s and the estimated pto of chen s ndd is 15 kw to implement a megawatt pto system 60 ndds are required and a suitable platform is required to carry as many ndds as possible therefore it is necessary to establish a viable mooring support structure to carry the proposed ndds in a deep water environment in this study ansys fluent was used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients including drag and added mass of the ndd by incorporating these data to orcaflex 2012 the simulation of the spar anchored on the seabed was established the software ansys aqwa was used to design the spar platform to carry multiple ndds the platform design followed the design code of abs rules abs 2014 the design of the spar platform was established in orcaflex and so as the mooring system including anchor chain and duct chain 1 1 global development of the offshore floating platform most offshore structures are used for building oil rigs and there are three major types used in the industry the first one is the jackup drilling rig which is a floating barge with drilling equipment on its deck and long supporting legs the barge is used in shallow waters up to 100 m the second one is a semi submersible oil rig which is the most common type of offshore drilling rig and used for drilling in waters more than 100 m deep semi submersible oil rigs are floating vessels supported on large pontoon like structures submerged below the sea surface and the specially designed rigs mounted on ships can drill a well in waters over 3000 m deep the third one is an offshore floating platform as floating production systems fps tension leg platform tlp and single point anchor reservoir sapr platform fig 2 the spar is mostly used in deep water depth and less affected by wind loads a spar platform is a single vertical cylinder with a large diameter and long length the hull cylinder is weighted at the bottom by a chamber filled with ballast to stabilize the whole system spars are anchored to the seabed by the mooring system which is composed of either a chain wire chain or chain polyester chain configuration 1 2 spar and force analysis methods the classic spars from truss spar to cell spar are depicted in fig 3 the wave force was found to be the most significant force against the dynamic responses of the structure and it contributes about 70 of the total environmental force that the spar might be experienced ketabdari and mirzaei 2011 yang et al 2012 kurian et al 2013 there are three theories used to calculate the wave force applied on the offshore structures and they are the morison equation froude krylov theory and diffraction theory li et al 2010 yang et al 2012 kurian et al 2013 the morison equation is applicable for small structures compared to the wavelength and calculates the wave forces as a linear summation of inertia and drag forces the froude krylov theory is also applicable for small structures and the wave force is predominant by the inertia force rather than the drag force while the diffraction theory is applicable to the structure that is relatively larger than the wavelength chakrabarti 1987 and mekha et al 1995 studied the behavior of a spar in deep water by time domain method and the morison equation was used to compute the wave force by considering the second order effects and wave kinematics mansouri and hadidi 2009 investigated the linear hydrodynamic analysis of truss spar in the frequency domain zhang et al 2013 establish the model of sevan 650 and gva 750 platform into ansys workbench and use the hydrodynamic diffraction model to compute the response amplitude operator rao of each platform in storm environment of south china sea zhang et al 2008 proposed a design process and method of offshore floating platform based on the cell truss spar in this study a spar like platform was designed we also used the morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force acting on the platform and the detailed procedure is described in the later section the objective of this study is to design a spar like platform which is used to moor multiple ndds designed by chen and huang 2016 section 2 describes the methods used in spar platform design and it includes three software packages the cfd software ansys fluent for calculating hydrodynamic coefficients ansys aqwa for spar platform design and orcaflex for mooring line design the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is crucial to prepare input parameters for orcaflex and the detail procedures are listed in section 2 besides the assumptions for spar platform design and the ansys aqwa simulation are also described in the same section the investigated results include the design of the spar platform mooring multiple duct type generators and anchoring at deep water 500 m and they are detailed discussed in section 3 the final section gives the concluding remarks found in this study 2 methodology 2 1 wave forces on the platform the sea waves apply significant dynamic forces to the offshore structures thus accurate estimations of wave forces are critical for designing such structures for small and slender structures the wave parameters remain nearly constant before and after impact to the structure however when the size of the structure becomes larger variations of waves cannot be ignored and the wave will be affected after passing through the structure and induce turbulence therefore the diffraction of the wave is expected to influence the structure and the diffraction force should take into account for this situation that morrison s equation is not enough to describe the forces on the structure and diffraction theory should be used for analyzing the hydrodynamic response of the structures for huge platforms it s frequently assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible the motion is irrational and periodic and hence the flow field can be depicted by a velocity potential φ x y z for such conditions the laplace governing equation can be written as follows chakrabarti 1987 1 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 where x y z are the cartesian system coordinates and φ is the potential function of velocity in the diffraction theory the potential function of a linear wave can be divided to three parts namely i incident wave φ i ii diffraction wave φ d and iii radiation wave φ r as 2 φ φ i φ d φ r 2 2 dynamic analysis of the floating platform for dynamic analysis of offshore structures it is necessary first to obtain the added mass damping and stiffness coefficients and the forces acting on the body of all six degrees of freedom these coefficients should be replaced into eq 3 to study the dynamic response of the body 3 m m x c c k k x f w where m c and k are the added mass damping and stiffness coefficients respectively m is the body mass c and k are the damping and stiffness coefficients f w is the external force the applied loads are often determined by the amount of pressure applied to the body which can be obtained from bernoulli s equation as shown in eq 4 4 φ t 1 2 φ 2 p t ρ g z c t where p is the pressure ρ and g are the density of the fluid and gravity acceleration c t is an arbitrary value which can be assumed equal to zero by assuming the waves as linear waves the pressure should also be considered as linear this can be done by neglecting the hydrostatic term and the second order dynamic effects of waves the forces acting on the body can be determined by eq 5 5 f t s p t n d s s ρ φ t n d s in eq 5 n is the normal vector of the surface and if the potential function is written as incident diffraction and radiation waves one gets eq 6 6 f t re s i ρ ω e i ω t n a φ ˆ i a φ d x ˆ n φ r d s eq 6 also can be written as 7 f t re f ˆ e i ω t re a f i f d e i ω t x n f r e i ω t f h y d r o s t a t i c in eq 7 f ˆ is the amplitude of total force also a f i and a f d are the amplitudes of froude krylov and diffraction loads and thus a f i f d is the amplitude of the total force acting on the structure the load amplitudes of incident diffraction and radiation waves can be obtained from eq 8 8 f i i ω ρ s φ ˆ i d s f d i ω ρ s φ ˆ d d s f r i ω ρ s φ ˆ r d s hydrodynamic diffraction model is a model of aqwa in ansys workbench which provides an integrated environment to develop the primary hydrodynamic parameters required for undertaking complex motions and response analyses three dimensional linear radiation and diffraction analysis may be undertaken with multiple bodies taking full account of hydrodynamic interaction effects that occur between bodies computation of the second order wave forces via the full quadratic transfer function qtf matrices can be used over a wide range of water depths moreover the model can generate pressure and inertial loads for structural analysis as part of the hull design process 2 3 software used three different software programs were used in this study and they are ansys fluent ansys aqwa and orcaflex respectively ansys fluent is a cfd computational fluid dynamics software developed by anasys inc fluent has two types of solver which are pressure base type and density type the pressure type is based on momentum and pressure difference it is going through the calculation of pressure and velocity in the continuity equation it is usually fit to normal multiple phases flow the density based solver is usually fit to the high speed compressible flow to simulate kuroshio current the liquid density is assumed to be a constant and the pressure base type solver is much more appropriate miettinen and siikonen 2015 in the pressure based solver we chose the simple or simplec method for steady state cases and use piso and coupled method for simulating transient cases besides the central difference method and the second order upwind are used in all the simulation cases of this study ansys aqwa is an engineering software package used to investigate the effects of the wave wind and current on floating and fixed offshore and marine structure including spars semi submersibles etc to our knowledge only two software aqwa and wamit are certified to import the hydrodynamic data of vessels and floating structures into orcaflex orcaflex software is developed by the british company orcina it is a simulation software widely used in developing offshore oil drilling projects and dynamic analysis for the offshore platforms including risers and mooring line systems orcaflex users can use a simple object including vessel line 6d buoy 3d buoy winch link and shapes to make a model to mimic the complicated structure in the program by setting different kinds of environmental conditions including water depth wave current density profile and winds orcaflex can simulate the dynamic motions of primary structure response including catenary systems like risers and umbilical cables furthermore it can simulate the process for installing a pipe line or offshore platform and output the solution model in visualizing interface the dynamic motions in orcaflex are using the finite element method fem in the 3d nonlinear time domain also it set a lumped mass element approach to simplify the mathematical calculation make the program run more efficiently orcaflex performs static and dynamic analysis to investigate the response of the object the static analysis is to determine the equilibrium configurations of the system under weight buoyancy hydrodynamic drag etc it also provides an initial status of the object for the dynamic simulations in most cases the static equilibrium configurations are optimum for dynamic simulations the mass damping stiffness and loading are evaluated at each time step considering the instantaneous time varying geometry the procedures for calculating added mass drag coefficients were detailed described in tsai et al 2020 and they are omitted here 3 results and discussion the most likely location for taiwan to build a current power farm is along the east coast of taiwan chen et al 2020 proposed an optimal designed ndd with a pto 15 kw in a current speed 1 m s ocean environment to set up a megawatt power plant more than 60 ndds are needed however deep water depth larger than 500 m in this region is a big challenge to anchor the ndds to the seabed as a result using a spar platform as a carrier to moor multiple generators might be a possible solution in this section the design process for the spar platform was introduced the most concerning parameter is the 6dof response amplitude operator rao of the platform these parameters can illustrate the relationship between the platform responses toward the wave frequency to calculate these parameters we use ansys aqwa 3 1 model validation the validation of the simulation results made by the aqwa was performed before further simulations we used aqwa to calculate the rao of a wind turbine platform designed by ship and ocean industries r d center soic and compare the simulated results with those reported in chuang 2016 the property and geometry of the model were shown in table 1 and fig 4 the simulated results were compared to the experimental measurements of chuang and simulated results of soic using wamit lin 2015 fig 5 illustrate the raos in the surge heave and pitch motions obtained by wamit and aqwa and experimental measurements it shows a good agreement for wamit and aqwa in surge rao when the wave period is less than 20 s although the surge raos of aqwa and wamit do not agree well with the experiment results but they do have a similar trend the heave rao of wamit aqwa and experimental measurements agree very well with each other a unique peak at a period of about 16 5 s can be seen in fig 5 which should be the resonance period of the platform the heave rao peak of the experiment was much smaller than those obtained by aqwa and wamit the reason might be that the platform was held by the chain which induces additional damping to the whole system and decreases the amplitude of the rao the pitch raos of aqwa and wamit also have a similar trend and both amplitudes are less than 1 as the results obtained from aqwa basically agreed with those obtained from wamit meanwhile it had a similar moving trend with experimental data the results evaluated by aqwa were suitable for the later spar platform design 3 2 design procedure of platform fig 6 lists the interactive flow chart of a spar platform design grove et al 2003 the spar platform design is similar to the naval architect and the most important issue is the stability of the platform under various wave conditions however vessels do not need to consider the weight of the mooring line but the mooring line weight should take into consideration in the spar design also the water depth may control the required length of the mooring lines to support all the loads live and dead loads the total volume of the platform must be large enough and the volume of the platform is related to the geometry of the platform the geometry of the platform will influence the stability of the platform the considerations among loads volume geometry and stability reveal the complexity for designing a floating platform 3 2 1 design loads and the spar prototype the spar platform in this study is much simplified and only the dead load total weight of the platform and environmental loads were considered and the other types of live loads are omitted the classic type of the spar was chosen in this study which can be a simple cylinder to carry multiple ducts the branches were added and spread out from the main cylinder as mentioned earlier one needs more than 60 ndds anchored on the seabed to generate megawatt power however it is not feasible to deploy them in a deep ocean environment and a suitable platform is therefore needed moreover the platform might increase total material cost for the demonstration purpose of this study the designed dead load of the spar with branches was assumed to be the total weight of ten ndds which is 3390 tons furthermore followed by the design code from the american bureau of shipping abs 2014 the safety factor sf 2 was used and the final design dead load was m spar 6780 tons which is 1 33 times the weight of 60 ndds anchored on the seabed and total material cost does not increase too much since the strong current speed of kuroshio is near the free surface 0 to 100 m the draft length l spar of the spar does not need to be longer than 100 m that the cylinder diameter can be selected according to the weight of the spar fig 7 depicts the geometries of the spar and they were l spar 80 m cylinder diameter d spar 10 m and ten branches 25 m long and branch diameter d branch 2 m 3 2 2 structure design the spar platform structure is highly related to the response against the wave li et al 2010 and li and ou 2010 suggested a heave natural period of the floating platform should be larger than 20 s and that was the key criterion in spar design 9 t 33 2 π m a 33 ρ g a w 1 2 at the equation above m is the platform mass which represents the design weight a 33 is the added mass in heave motion ρ is the seawater density and a w is the cut area of the spar at the surface the heave added mass a 33 is related to a w meanwhile a w is related to d spar and the total volume of spar v spar moreover the above variables all affect the dominant criteria t 33 the relationship between t 33 and d spar was illustrated in fig 8 since the heave natural period t 33 must be larger than 20 s according to the floating platform design and d spar 9 7 m was the max required diameter of the spar under the design weight condition we also checked the effect of the draft lengths on heave added mass and found the a 33 is invariant with various draft lengths l spar however the required volume is determined by the combination of l spar and d spar and they can be determined by the following simple formula 10 25 d s p a r 2 10 π 4 d b r a n c h 2 π 4 d s p a r 2 l s p a r m s p a r 1025 fig 9 shows the relationship between l spar and d spar and the volume of l spar 100 m and d spar 9 m is beyond the required volume and the corresponding draft length and cylinder diameter are appropriate and they were used in later aqwa calculations 3 3 response to waves eq 9 reveals that the heave natural period is not related to the cg position of the spar however the cg position may still influence the rao of the rotational motions to keep the stability of the platform the cg position is always lower than cb 0 0 50 m and the cg position is therefore set at a proper location of 0 0 z with z below 50 m several cases of different z cg 60 m to 85 m were simulated and the corresponding raos are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a depicts the heave rao of different z cg versus various exciting periods and the resonant period is 21 s and it is fit to the result calculated by eq 9 the corresponding raos of pitch motion is shown in fig 10 b and the resonant peak period of pitch motion decreases so does the center of gravity position but the smallest resonant peak period is still larger than 30 s it reveals that when z cg 60 m the platform is capable of sustaining the extreme wave loads fig 10 c depicts the surge rao and the phenomenon is similar to those of the pitch motion the resonant peaks are all larger than 30 s and they are all capable of taking the extreme wave loads although all the cases are acceptable we still need to determine a convincible cg position jonkman 2010 studied different kinds of 5 mw floating wind turbine and one of the model called oc3 hywind which was a kind of spar platform in his study the cg position of oc3 hywind is about 75 of the total draft length we then assumed z cg 75 m to be the final position of the designed platform in this study 3 4 multiple ducts attached to the spar as the needed parameters of the platform and duct were calculated we can import those data in orcaflex to build the mooring line model in this section the process to build the complete system of spar carrying multiple ndds was introduced the mooring line material was pe rope which was a lighter material compared to the studless chain by reducing the length and the weight of the line the declination angle of the line was expected to be parallel to the current direction since the lighter line was assumed the duct mass also needs to be verified the environmental condition in this study was assumed to be 500 m water depth and 1 m s current speed uniformly distributed from the ocean surface to 100 m below the sea surface fig 11 shows the conceptual sketch of the system the storm waves were used to verify the stability of the platform and the carried ndds 3 4 1 system configurations the needed data were combined into a lis file which was automatically created after aqwa calculation therefore the spar can be built by importing the lis file and using the vessel function in orcaflex the shape function was used to build up the geometry of the spar as shown in fig 12 the initial spar position was at x y 0 0 with 100 m draft the multiple mooring lines must be established to keep the spar at the same location there is no strict code defining the number of mooring lines to control the location of the spar however the response of the offshore platform in the surge heave and pitch has a strict limitation li et al 2010 li and ou 2010 the biggest heave response for the oil drilling platform should be less than 2 m the limitation for surge displacement is 7 of the water depth meanwhile the maximum pitching angle should be less than 10 although the platform in this research was not designed for oil drilling those criteria were also followed to verify the stability of the spar the platform drag was given as c d 2 that was followed the abs rules abs 2014 3 4 2 anchor line the determination of the connection points between platform and the seabed is needed to build up the mooring line the mooring line has two ends end a and end b are the connection point to spar and seabed anchor points respectively meanwhile the azimuth and declination angle which are illustrated in fig 13 also need to be determined fig 14 shows the illustration line m1 with end a end b with a 60 azimuth angle by setting up the azimuth and declination angles the local coordinate of the mooring line was shifted by orcaflex in this study eight mooring lines system was initially assumed as shown in fig 14 every line in the system was numbered to make identification the first line was 30 counterclockwise from positive x direction on the x y plane and a 500 kn pretension force was established to control the declination angle since the water depth was 500 m using a studless chain to build the whole mooring line may be too heavy two materials were then used to establish each mooring line the first one was the studless chain and the second one was pe the material properties were listed in table 2 each mooring line consists of 100 m studless spar chain 500 m pe line and 100 m studless anchor chain the fairlead on the platform represents end a point of the mooring line furthermore the fairlead data are listed in table 3 which are relative to the local coordinate of the spar the initial end b locations are the anchor points as listed in table 4 after both mooring line points were assumed the line setup wizard function was used to find the anchor positions after the pretension force the anchor positions after this process were also listed in table 4 before doing the static simulation of the platform we still need to set up the mooring line to carry ndds 3 4 3 mooring line to carry ndds in this study a nozzle diffusor duct ndd was used as the device to capture ocean current energy in an accompany paper chen et al 2020 the harmony search hs technique was applied to search an optimal duct layout that could obtain maximum power take off pto fig 15 shows the final 3d diagram and plan view of the duct used in the simulations the inlet diameter d was determined as 7 m and the nozzle throat was 2 6 m to accommodate the naca 6409 turbine blades the convergence test of domain size and mesh size validation were made chen et al 2020 tsai et al 2020 that the numerical simulations were able to obtain convergence and provide fair degree of accuracy the drag and added mass coefficients of ndd were rigorously evaluated and the detail procedures were described in the accompany paper tsai et al 2020 and they were omitted in the text the mooring lines to carry ndds were assumed to be parallel to the current direction so the ndd mass was revised as much as possible to let the ndd have nearly zero buoyancy force in a fully submerged condition the ndd property is listed in table 5 the line used to carry the ndd was pe line for demonstration purpose only two ndds was installed at the deepest branch of the spar platform in this study moreover the initial position of two ducts will be x y z duct a 100 20 90 and x y z duct b 100 20 90 each mooring line is associated with a y connection and the length of mooring line and the y connection were set as 100 m and 5 m long respectively end a means to the fairlead on the spar and end b was the line end before the y connection the detail statistics of two mooring lines are listed in table 6 3 4 4 static simulations after all the settings were ready the static simulation can be calculated that is the system is only under ocean currents the profile of the current speed is illustrated in fig 16 fig 17 illustrates the platform shifted by the current and moves about 90 m from the starting point under ocean current a large parts large parts of ml1 ml2 ml7 and ml8 were lain down on the seabed only ml3 ml4 ml5 and ml6 are active as shown in fig 18 those behaviors remain the same when the storm wave action was included since the strong kuroshio current dominates the horizontal translation of the platform as well as the ndds 3 4 5 motion of the mooring system the limits of offshore platform motion in surge and sway direction are 7 of water depth the heave motion limit is 2 m and the rotation limits are below 10 li et al 2010 the storm wave condition was used to study the stability of the spar the jonswap spectrum data lai 2015 analyzed the wave spectrum in taitung buoy was used in this study the jonswap parameters are γ 1 59 α 0 151 and f p 0 094 fig 19 shows the corresponding typhoon wave history fig 20 depicts the time histories of the 6 dof response of the platform facing a 90 wave the rotational responses are shown in fig 20 a c and e and all are less than 5 which are below the limits according to the api rule neither surge nor sway displacement was larger than the 7 limit 35 m meanwhile the heave response was also under 2 m limit and the proposed spar platform was qualified and can be recognized as stable according to the api rule by doing fast fourier transform fft of the response histories the natural frequency of the platform can be obtained fig 21 depicts the fft results of surge heave and pitch motion the natural period of the spar in surge and pitch motion is 35 s and the natural period in heave motion is 20 s compare to the results of fig 10 fft results are fitting well with the initial design these verified the designed platform was stable under storm wave conditions in addition the result of the spar responses under other wave direction were also all under the design limits and they were omitted in the text the tensile strength of the mooring line is another important concern in the floating platform system the mooring line tensions were shown in fig 22 all the tension of the four mooring lines was far below the strength of both materials 16903 kn and the spar was very safe under the strong wave and current condition the tension of the mooring lines under the other wave directions were also far below the strength of the mooring materials and they are also omitted in the text 3 4 6 motions of spar carrying ndds fig 23 depicts the detail configuration of the spar platform with a pair of ndds and mooring lines that were simulated in the orcaflex the rotational and translational motions of duct a and b have similar responses and they were shown in figs 24 and 25 respectively meanwhile the largest motion was the yaw motion but the response was only less than 4 both ndds were shifted by the storm waves with δx 2 m and δz 5 m that the shifted distance was less than the outlet diameter d 9 m of the ndds although the difference between the responses of two ducts was not obvious the small difference may due to that duct b was at the downstream side the translation and rotational responses of the ndds were very small that demonstrates the stability of the ndds under storm wave condition the translational responses of ndds under the other wave directions were also very small and they were omitted in the text in order to build a megawatt power plant the spar platform must carry more than 60 ndds we further simulated the spar platform carrying two pairs of ndds as shown in fig 26 and the roll responses of the two pairs of ndds were illustrated in fig 27 the response of the second pair of ndd was even smaller than that of the first one the current induced tension built in the mooring lines between two pairs of ndds might reduce the responses of the second ndds and the effective pto of the second pair of ndds also can be assured fig 28 depicts the concept of twelve ndds carrying by one branch of spar platform in the similar manner five branches of spar may carry 60 ndds however the size of the proposed spar and mooring lines needed to be re designed whereas the present demonstration study indicates that a megawatt power plant is feasible to harvest kuroshio energy in the future 4 conclusion the ocean current power capture system was designed including a spar platform carrying multiple nozzle duct type ocean current power generators by collaborating the data from ansys fluent and ansys aqwa to orcaflex the whole system including mooring lines and the duct lines was simulated the results of single ducts anchored on the seabed and the spar carrying ducts under storm wave condition and normal wave condition with constant 1 m s current speed was presented the following concluded remarks can be given 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients including c d and c a of the duct in translational and rotational motions were calculated the rotational domain was verified in this study with the domain length and diameter as 40 m and 9d and d is the characteristic length outlet diameter of ndd two methods were compared to verify the accuracy of c d and the results was well matched which means the data for c a from the acceleration method was also confirmed 2 the numerical model of the duct was established in orcaflex also the determination of the duct weight and the relationship between cg and pitch angle of the duct under different weight conditions was tested in this study with the configurations of the mooring line and duct the simulation shows a high stability of the duct under normal wave conditions meanwhile the duct was very safe in the deep position when the storm waves approaching 3 the preliminary test was made by comparing the experimental measurement wamit and ansys aqwa and the results agree well in the study the geometry of the spar was constructed by considering the relationship between the spar diameters d spar added mass a 33 and heave natural period t 33 of the spar the final spar model was 100 m draft d spar 9 m and 5 branches with the total weight equal 6785 5 tons and cg 75 m 4 the system configuration including the spar multiple ducts and mooring lines were presented in orcaflex the designed spar shows a very stable response against different directions of storm waves meanwhile fft results of the spar response agree well to the rao results in aqwa the anchor lines were both under the material limit which shows a high safety for the whole system both two ducts have similar responses in every testing case although only the 90 storm waves case shows high pto results the other cases still reveal that both two ducts may not collide to each other due to both two ducts have similar motion in the simulation period 5 the simulation of spar which carried four ndds was also simulated and the responses of the second pair of ndds were even smaller than those of the first pair the reason might be more tension force is established due to ocean current in the same manner more pair of ndds can be attached assume 6 pairs of ndds were attached to each branch of spar and the spar will have 60 ndds which can generate megawatt power 6 the proposed energy harvesters and platform have simple geometries and they are very easy to be manufactured the current energy harvester chen et al 2018 and spar platform zhang 2008 have been successfully deployed in many places we therefore may expect the proposed simple ocean current harvesters and their simple carrier to be deployed in the east coast of taiwan and the megawatt kuroshio power plant is feasible in the near future credit authorship contribution statement po hung yeh methodology writing review editing all

21027,in response to the increasing renewable energy demand harvesting the energy from kuroshio become an important task in taiwan in this study the ansys fluent and ansys aqwa were used to design a spar platform for carrying multiple current energy harvesters the platform follows the design code of abs rules abs 2014 the designed spar model was established in orcaflex and so as the mooring line system including the anchor chain and duct chain was built the simulated results show the spar is stable under normal and storm wave conditions the pre designed nozzle diffuser duct ndd can capture 15 kw of current energy however as a megawatt power plant 60 ducts are needed to be deployed the proposed spar platform could be used as a carrier to overcome the difficulties of deploying 60 ndds to seabed and it may also reduce the construction costs the simulated results show the spar and associated ndds are stable under normal and storm wave conditions this study suggests the platform may be expected to carry more than 60 ndds and the megawatt kuroshio energy harvester is feasible to be deployed at the east coast of taiwan in the future keywords kuroshio energy platform energy harvester fluent aqwa orcaflex 1 introduction to reduce the impact of energy shortages and maintain the development of human society exploring various renewable energy sources has become a top priority taiwan has begun to develop offshore renewable energy to replace fossil fuels and hopes to meet most of its energy consumption in the next two decades renewable energy resources include wind energy wave energy tidal energy and ocean current energy jacobson and delucchi 2011 yang et al 2016 zou et al 2019 tidal currents are ubiquitous worldwide and together with major ocean currents represent an important source of renewable energy in terms of ocean kinetic energy moreover ocean currents are highly predictable and major ocean currents such as the gulf stream and kuroshio flow quite continuously in many parts of the world as parts of the ocean circulation system taiwan is a small island without plenty of natural resources and most of its fuel and energy resources are imported therefore developing renewable energy has become one of the most concerned issues for taiwan although wind power is the most popular renewable energy source in the world taiwan wind speeds that can be used for power generation usually occur in winter yet winter requires less energy the peak season for electricity consumption in taiwan occurs in summer but the wind speed is relatively slow according to overview epri ocean energy plan the possibility of california bedard 2006 wind power can generate 70 of the capacitance in winter in taiwan and only 6 of the capacitance in summer this shows that wind energy is not a stable alternative energy source for taiwan another popular renewable energy is solar energy which may seem like a very feasible alternative energy in summertime however taiwan is an island lack of adequate lands to install enough solar panels to support the total power capacity nevertheless taiwan is surrounded by the ocean as a result taiwan has an advantage in developing ocean energy capture technology there are already many ways to generate energy from the ocean including waves tides and currents yang et al 2016 tidal energy in taiwan is limited because the maximum tidal range of taichung is about 5 m which is not enough for commercial operations wave energy density in taiwan is less than 15 kw m which is far below commercial value researchers chen 2010 chen et al 2016 uihlein and magagna 2016 nedo 2017 b f chen et al 2018 jo and hwang 2020 reported the attraction challenge and current status of marine current energy clearly describes the latest challenge and development of marine current energy technology chen 2010 studied the main supporting structures of ocean current energy harvesters and found that they mainly depend on depth in addition to tidal current energy the global ocean current such as gulf stream and kuroshio have constant flow and carries huge amount of water and energy across the ocean yan et al 2007 made an observation of kuroshio by using lowered adcp ladcp and they concluded that ladcp has become an important instrument for observing the profile of currents last decade the ladcp can measure the profiles of current up to 6000 m in depth they set two transects and eight stations which located southeast of lanyu island the extreme value appears at a depth of 100 m approximately 80 cm s hsu et al 2015 also reported the assessment of kuroshio current power test site of green island taiwan and introduced more detailed kuroshio current power density and pointed out more reliable energy sources many tidal energy extraction devices have been reported such as seagen the blue concept thg tidel smd hydrovision and blue energy etc vikas et al 2016 the kuroshio fig 1 crosses in the east coast of taiwan the water depth in this area is about 500 1000 m in those deep water environments it is nearly impossible to fix the generator on the seabed like the tidal energy devices the purpose of this research is to propose a platform to carry the kuroshio energy harvester a single point anchored reservoir spar platform was proposed which is a floating platform often used in the offshore drilling industry chen and huang 2016 reported a submerged energy capture system nozzle diffuser duct ndd which can increase the pressure gradient between inflow and outflow and the flow velocity inside the shroud could be increased thereby increasing the efficiency of the turbine the average kuroshio speed is 1 0 m s and the estimated pto of chen s ndd is 15 kw to implement a megawatt pto system 60 ndds are required and a suitable platform is required to carry as many ndds as possible therefore it is necessary to establish a viable mooring support structure to carry the proposed ndds in a deep water environment in this study ansys fluent was used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients including drag and added mass of the ndd by incorporating these data to orcaflex 2012 the simulation of the spar anchored on the seabed was established the software ansys aqwa was used to design the spar platform to carry multiple ndds the platform design followed the design code of abs rules abs 2014 the design of the spar platform was established in orcaflex and so as the mooring system including anchor chain and duct chain 1 1 global development of the offshore floating platform most offshore structures are used for building oil rigs and there are three major types used in the industry the first one is the jackup drilling rig which is a floating barge with drilling equipment on its deck and long supporting legs the barge is used in shallow waters up to 100 m the second one is a semi submersible oil rig which is the most common type of offshore drilling rig and used for drilling in waters more than 100 m deep semi submersible oil rigs are floating vessels supported on large pontoon like structures submerged below the sea surface and the specially designed rigs mounted on ships can drill a well in waters over 3000 m deep the third one is an offshore floating platform as floating production systems fps tension leg platform tlp and single point anchor reservoir sapr platform fig 2 the spar is mostly used in deep water depth and less affected by wind loads a spar platform is a single vertical cylinder with a large diameter and long length the hull cylinder is weighted at the bottom by a chamber filled with ballast to stabilize the whole system spars are anchored to the seabed by the mooring system which is composed of either a chain wire chain or chain polyester chain configuration 1 2 spar and force analysis methods the classic spars from truss spar to cell spar are depicted in fig 3 the wave force was found to be the most significant force against the dynamic responses of the structure and it contributes about 70 of the total environmental force that the spar might be experienced ketabdari and mirzaei 2011 yang et al 2012 kurian et al 2013 there are three theories used to calculate the wave force applied on the offshore structures and they are the morison equation froude krylov theory and diffraction theory li et al 2010 yang et al 2012 kurian et al 2013 the morison equation is applicable for small structures compared to the wavelength and calculates the wave forces as a linear summation of inertia and drag forces the froude krylov theory is also applicable for small structures and the wave force is predominant by the inertia force rather than the drag force while the diffraction theory is applicable to the structure that is relatively larger than the wavelength chakrabarti 1987 and mekha et al 1995 studied the behavior of a spar in deep water by time domain method and the morison equation was used to compute the wave force by considering the second order effects and wave kinematics mansouri and hadidi 2009 investigated the linear hydrodynamic analysis of truss spar in the frequency domain zhang et al 2013 establish the model of sevan 650 and gva 750 platform into ansys workbench and use the hydrodynamic diffraction model to compute the response amplitude operator rao of each platform in storm environment of south china sea zhang et al 2008 proposed a design process and method of offshore floating platform based on the cell truss spar in this study a spar like platform was designed we also used the morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force acting on the platform and the detailed procedure is described in the later section the objective of this study is to design a spar like platform which is used to moor multiple ndds designed by chen and huang 2016 section 2 describes the methods used in spar platform design and it includes three software packages the cfd software ansys fluent for calculating hydrodynamic coefficients ansys aqwa for spar platform design and orcaflex for mooring line design the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is crucial to prepare input parameters for orcaflex and the detail procedures are listed in section 2 besides the assumptions for spar platform design and the ansys aqwa simulation are also described in the same section the investigated results include the design of the spar platform mooring multiple duct type generators and anchoring at deep water 500 m and they are detailed discussed in section 3 the final section gives the concluding remarks found in this study 2 methodology 2 1 wave forces on the platform the sea waves apply significant dynamic forces to the offshore structures thus accurate estimations of wave forces are critical for designing such structures for small and slender structures the wave parameters remain nearly constant before and after impact to the structure however when the size of the structure becomes larger variations of waves cannot be ignored and the wave will be affected after passing through the structure and induce turbulence therefore the diffraction of the wave is expected to influence the structure and the diffraction force should take into account for this situation that morrison s equation is not enough to describe the forces on the structure and diffraction theory should be used for analyzing the hydrodynamic response of the structures for huge platforms it s frequently assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible the motion is irrational and periodic and hence the flow field can be depicted by a velocity potential φ x y z for such conditions the laplace governing equation can be written as follows chakrabarti 1987 1 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 where x y z are the cartesian system coordinates and φ is the potential function of velocity in the diffraction theory the potential function of a linear wave can be divided to three parts namely i incident wave φ i ii diffraction wave φ d and iii radiation wave φ r as 2 φ φ i φ d φ r 2 2 dynamic analysis of the floating platform for dynamic analysis of offshore structures it is necessary first to obtain the added mass damping and stiffness coefficients and the forces acting on the body of all six degrees of freedom these coefficients should be replaced into eq 3 to study the dynamic response of the body 3 m m x c c k k x f w where m c and k are the added mass damping and stiffness coefficients respectively m is the body mass c and k are the damping and stiffness coefficients f w is the external force the applied loads are often determined by the amount of pressure applied to the body which can be obtained from bernoulli s equation as shown in eq 4 4 φ t 1 2 φ 2 p t ρ g z c t where p is the pressure ρ and g are the density of the fluid and gravity acceleration c t is an arbitrary value which can be assumed equal to zero by assuming the waves as linear waves the pressure should also be considered as linear this can be done by neglecting the hydrostatic term and the second order dynamic effects of waves the forces acting on the body can be determined by eq 5 5 f t s p t n d s s ρ φ t n d s in eq 5 n is the normal vector of the surface and if the potential function is written as incident diffraction and radiation waves one gets eq 6 6 f t re s i ρ ω e i ω t n a φ ˆ i a φ d x ˆ n φ r d s eq 6 also can be written as 7 f t re f ˆ e i ω t re a f i f d e i ω t x n f r e i ω t f h y d r o s t a t i c in eq 7 f ˆ is the amplitude of total force also a f i and a f d are the amplitudes of froude krylov and diffraction loads and thus a f i f d is the amplitude of the total force acting on the structure the load amplitudes of incident diffraction and radiation waves can be obtained from eq 8 8 f i i ω ρ s φ ˆ i d s f d i ω ρ s φ ˆ d d s f r i ω ρ s φ ˆ r d s hydrodynamic diffraction model is a model of aqwa in ansys workbench which provides an integrated environment to develop the primary hydrodynamic parameters required for undertaking complex motions and response analyses three dimensional linear radiation and diffraction analysis may be undertaken with multiple bodies taking full account of hydrodynamic interaction effects that occur between bodies computation of the second order wave forces via the full quadratic transfer function qtf matrices can be used over a wide range of water depths moreover the model can generate pressure and inertial loads for structural analysis as part of the hull design process 2 3 software used three different software programs were used in this study and they are ansys fluent ansys aqwa and orcaflex respectively ansys fluent is a cfd computational fluid dynamics software developed by anasys inc fluent has two types of solver which are pressure base type and density type the pressure type is based on momentum and pressure difference it is going through the calculation of pressure and velocity in the continuity equation it is usually fit to normal multiple phases flow the density based solver is usually fit to the high speed compressible flow to simulate kuroshio current the liquid density is assumed to be a constant and the pressure base type solver is much more appropriate miettinen and siikonen 2015 in the pressure based solver we chose the simple or simplec method for steady state cases and use piso and coupled method for simulating transient cases besides the central difference method and the second order upwind are used in all the simulation cases of this study ansys aqwa is an engineering software package used to investigate the effects of the wave wind and current on floating and fixed offshore and marine structure including spars semi submersibles etc to our knowledge only two software aqwa and wamit are certified to import the hydrodynamic data of vessels and floating structures into orcaflex orcaflex software is developed by the british company orcina it is a simulation software widely used in developing offshore oil drilling projects and dynamic analysis for the offshore platforms including risers and mooring line systems orcaflex users can use a simple object including vessel line 6d buoy 3d buoy winch link and shapes to make a model to mimic the complicated structure in the program by setting different kinds of environmental conditions including water depth wave current density profile and winds orcaflex can simulate the dynamic motions of primary structure response including catenary systems like risers and umbilical cables furthermore it can simulate the process for installing a pipe line or offshore platform and output the solution model in visualizing interface the dynamic motions in orcaflex are using the finite element method fem in the 3d nonlinear time domain also it set a lumped mass element approach to simplify the mathematical calculation make the program run more efficiently orcaflex performs static and dynamic analysis to investigate the response of the object the static analysis is to determine the equilibrium configurations of the system under weight buoyancy hydrodynamic drag etc it also provides an initial status of the object for the dynamic simulations in most cases the static equilibrium configurations are optimum for dynamic simulations the mass damping stiffness and loading are evaluated at each time step considering the instantaneous time varying geometry the procedures for calculating added mass drag coefficients were detailed described in tsai et al 2020 and they are omitted here 3 results and discussion the most likely location for taiwan to build a current power farm is along the east coast of taiwan chen et al 2020 proposed an optimal designed ndd with a pto 15 kw in a current speed 1 m s ocean environment to set up a megawatt power plant more than 60 ndds are needed however deep water depth larger than 500 m in this region is a big challenge to anchor the ndds to the seabed as a result using a spar platform as a carrier to moor multiple generators might be a possible solution in this section the design process for the spar platform was introduced the most concerning parameter is the 6dof response amplitude operator rao of the platform these parameters can illustrate the relationship between the platform responses toward the wave frequency to calculate these parameters we use ansys aqwa 3 1 model validation the validation of the simulation results made by the aqwa was performed before further simulations we used aqwa to calculate the rao of a wind turbine platform designed by ship and ocean industries r d center soic and compare the simulated results with those reported in chuang 2016 the property and geometry of the model were shown in table 1 and fig 4 the simulated results were compared to the experimental measurements of chuang and simulated results of soic using wamit lin 2015 fig 5 illustrate the raos in the surge heave and pitch motions obtained by wamit and aqwa and experimental measurements it shows a good agreement for wamit and aqwa in surge rao when the wave period is less than 20 s although the surge raos of aqwa and wamit do not agree well with the experiment results but they do have a similar trend the heave rao of wamit aqwa and experimental measurements agree very well with each other a unique peak at a period of about 16 5 s can be seen in fig 5 which should be the resonance period of the platform the heave rao peak of the experiment was much smaller than those obtained by aqwa and wamit the reason might be that the platform was held by the chain which induces additional damping to the whole system and decreases the amplitude of the rao the pitch raos of aqwa and wamit also have a similar trend and both amplitudes are less than 1 as the results obtained from aqwa basically agreed with those obtained from wamit meanwhile it had a similar moving trend with experimental data the results evaluated by aqwa were suitable for the later spar platform design 3 2 design procedure of platform fig 6 lists the interactive flow chart of a spar platform design grove et al 2003 the spar platform design is similar to the naval architect and the most important issue is the stability of the platform under various wave conditions however vessels do not need to consider the weight of the mooring line but the mooring line weight should take into consideration in the spar design also the water depth may control the required length of the mooring lines to support all the loads live and dead loads the total volume of the platform must be large enough and the volume of the platform is related to the geometry of the platform the geometry of the platform will influence the stability of the platform the considerations among loads volume geometry and stability reveal the complexity for designing a floating platform 3 2 1 design loads and the spar prototype the spar platform in this study is much simplified and only the dead load total weight of the platform and environmental loads were considered and the other types of live loads are omitted the classic type of the spar was chosen in this study which can be a simple cylinder to carry multiple ducts the branches were added and spread out from the main cylinder as mentioned earlier one needs more than 60 ndds anchored on the seabed to generate megawatt power however it is not feasible to deploy them in a deep ocean environment and a suitable platform is therefore needed moreover the platform might increase total material cost for the demonstration purpose of this study the designed dead load of the spar with branches was assumed to be the total weight of ten ndds which is 3390 tons furthermore followed by the design code from the american bureau of shipping abs 2014 the safety factor sf 2 was used and the final design dead load was m spar 6780 tons which is 1 33 times the weight of 60 ndds anchored on the seabed and total material cost does not increase too much since the strong current speed of kuroshio is near the free surface 0 to 100 m the draft length l spar of the spar does not need to be longer than 100 m that the cylinder diameter can be selected according to the weight of the spar fig 7 depicts the geometries of the spar and they were l spar 80 m cylinder diameter d spar 10 m and ten branches 25 m long and branch diameter d branch 2 m 3 2 2 structure design the spar platform structure is highly related to the response against the wave li et al 2010 and li and ou 2010 suggested a heave natural period of the floating platform should be larger than 20 s and that was the key criterion in spar design 9 t 33 2 π m a 33 ρ g a w 1 2 at the equation above m is the platform mass which represents the design weight a 33 is the added mass in heave motion ρ is the seawater density and a w is the cut area of the spar at the surface the heave added mass a 33 is related to a w meanwhile a w is related to d spar and the total volume of spar v spar moreover the above variables all affect the dominant criteria t 33 the relationship between t 33 and d spar was illustrated in fig 8 since the heave natural period t 33 must be larger than 20 s according to the floating platform design and d spar 9 7 m was the max required diameter of the spar under the design weight condition we also checked the effect of the draft lengths on heave added mass and found the a 33 is invariant with various draft lengths l spar however the required volume is determined by the combination of l spar and d spar and they can be determined by the following simple formula 10 25 d s p a r 2 10 π 4 d b r a n c h 2 π 4 d s p a r 2 l s p a r m s p a r 1025 fig 9 shows the relationship between l spar and d spar and the volume of l spar 100 m and d spar 9 m is beyond the required volume and the corresponding draft length and cylinder diameter are appropriate and they were used in later aqwa calculations 3 3 response to waves eq 9 reveals that the heave natural period is not related to the cg position of the spar however the cg position may still influence the rao of the rotational motions to keep the stability of the platform the cg position is always lower than cb 0 0 50 m and the cg position is therefore set at a proper location of 0 0 z with z below 50 m several cases of different z cg 60 m to 85 m were simulated and the corresponding raos are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a depicts the heave rao of different z cg versus various exciting periods and the resonant period is 21 s and it is fit to the result calculated by eq 9 the corresponding raos of pitch motion is shown in fig 10 b and the resonant peak period of pitch motion decreases so does the center of gravity position but the smallest resonant peak period is still larger than 30 s it reveals that when z cg 60 m the platform is capable of sustaining the extreme wave loads fig 10 c depicts the surge rao and the phenomenon is similar to those of the pitch motion the resonant peaks are all larger than 30 s and they are all capable of taking the extreme wave loads although all the cases are acceptable we still need to determine a convincible cg position jonkman 2010 studied different kinds of 5 mw floating wind turbine and one of the model called oc3 hywind which was a kind of spar platform in his study the cg position of oc3 hywind is about 75 of the total draft length we then assumed z cg 75 m to be the final position of the designed platform in this study 3 4 multiple ducts attached to the spar as the needed parameters of the platform and duct were calculated we can import those data in orcaflex to build the mooring line model in this section the process to build the complete system of spar carrying multiple ndds was introduced the mooring line material was pe rope which was a lighter material compared to the studless chain by reducing the length and the weight of the line the declination angle of the line was expected to be parallel to the current direction since the lighter line was assumed the duct mass also needs to be verified the environmental condition in this study was assumed to be 500 m water depth and 1 m s current speed uniformly distributed from the ocean surface to 100 m below the sea surface fig 11 shows the conceptual sketch of the system the storm waves were used to verify the stability of the platform and the carried ndds 3 4 1 system configurations the needed data were combined into a lis file which was automatically created after aqwa calculation therefore the spar can be built by importing the lis file and using the vessel function in orcaflex the shape function was used to build up the geometry of the spar as shown in fig 12 the initial spar position was at x y 0 0 with 100 m draft the multiple mooring lines must be established to keep the spar at the same location there is no strict code defining the number of mooring lines to control the location of the spar however the response of the offshore platform in the surge heave and pitch has a strict limitation li et al 2010 li and ou 2010 the biggest heave response for the oil drilling platform should be less than 2 m the limitation for surge displacement is 7 of the water depth meanwhile the maximum pitching angle should be less than 10 although the platform in this research was not designed for oil drilling those criteria were also followed to verify the stability of the spar the platform drag was given as c d 2 that was followed the abs rules abs 2014 3 4 2 anchor line the determination of the connection points between platform and the seabed is needed to build up the mooring line the mooring line has two ends end a and end b are the connection point to spar and seabed anchor points respectively meanwhile the azimuth and declination angle which are illustrated in fig 13 also need to be determined fig 14 shows the illustration line m1 with end a end b with a 60 azimuth angle by setting up the azimuth and declination angles the local coordinate of the mooring line was shifted by orcaflex in this study eight mooring lines system was initially assumed as shown in fig 14 every line in the system was numbered to make identification the first line was 30 counterclockwise from positive x direction on the x y plane and a 500 kn pretension force was established to control the declination angle since the water depth was 500 m using a studless chain to build the whole mooring line may be too heavy two materials were then used to establish each mooring line the first one was the studless chain and the second one was pe the material properties were listed in table 2 each mooring line consists of 100 m studless spar chain 500 m pe line and 100 m studless anchor chain the fairlead on the platform represents end a point of the mooring line furthermore the fairlead data are listed in table 3 which are relative to the local coordinate of the spar the initial end b locations are the anchor points as listed in table 4 after both mooring line points were assumed the line setup wizard function was used to find the anchor positions after the pretension force the anchor positions after this process were also listed in table 4 before doing the static simulation of the platform we still need to set up the mooring line to carry ndds 3 4 3 mooring line to carry ndds in this study a nozzle diffusor duct ndd was used as the device to capture ocean current energy in an accompany paper chen et al 2020 the harmony search hs technique was applied to search an optimal duct layout that could obtain maximum power take off pto fig 15 shows the final 3d diagram and plan view of the duct used in the simulations the inlet diameter d was determined as 7 m and the nozzle throat was 2 6 m to accommodate the naca 6409 turbine blades the convergence test of domain size and mesh size validation were made chen et al 2020 tsai et al 2020 that the numerical simulations were able to obtain convergence and provide fair degree of accuracy the drag and added mass coefficients of ndd were rigorously evaluated and the detail procedures were described in the accompany paper tsai et al 2020 and they were omitted in the text the mooring lines to carry ndds were assumed to be parallel to the current direction so the ndd mass was revised as much as possible to let the ndd have nearly zero buoyancy force in a fully submerged condition the ndd property is listed in table 5 the line used to carry the ndd was pe line for demonstration purpose only two ndds was installed at the deepest branch of the spar platform in this study moreover the initial position of two ducts will be x y z duct a 100 20 90 and x y z duct b 100 20 90 each mooring line is associated with a y connection and the length of mooring line and the y connection were set as 100 m and 5 m long respectively end a means to the fairlead on the spar and end b was the line end before the y connection the detail statistics of two mooring lines are listed in table 6 3 4 4 static simulations after all the settings were ready the static simulation can be calculated that is the system is only under ocean currents the profile of the current speed is illustrated in fig 16 fig 17 illustrates the platform shifted by the current and moves about 90 m from the starting point under ocean current a large parts large parts of ml1 ml2 ml7 and ml8 were lain down on the seabed only ml3 ml4 ml5 and ml6 are active as shown in fig 18 those behaviors remain the same when the storm wave action was included since the strong kuroshio current dominates the horizontal translation of the platform as well as the ndds 3 4 5 motion of the mooring system the limits of offshore platform motion in surge and sway direction are 7 of water depth the heave motion limit is 2 m and the rotation limits are below 10 li et al 2010 the storm wave condition was used to study the stability of the spar the jonswap spectrum data lai 2015 analyzed the wave spectrum in taitung buoy was used in this study the jonswap parameters are γ 1 59 α 0 151 and f p 0 094 fig 19 shows the corresponding typhoon wave history fig 20 depicts the time histories of the 6 dof response of the platform facing a 90 wave the rotational responses are shown in fig 20 a c and e and all are less than 5 which are below the limits according to the api rule neither surge nor sway displacement was larger than the 7 limit 35 m meanwhile the heave response was also under 2 m limit and the proposed spar platform was qualified and can be recognized as stable according to the api rule by doing fast fourier transform fft of the response histories the natural frequency of the platform can be obtained fig 21 depicts the fft results of surge heave and pitch motion the natural period of the spar in surge and pitch motion is 35 s and the natural period in heave motion is 20 s compare to the results of fig 10 fft results are fitting well with the initial design these verified the designed platform was stable under storm wave conditions in addition the result of the spar responses under other wave direction were also all under the design limits and they were omitted in the text the tensile strength of the mooring line is another important concern in the floating platform system the mooring line tensions were shown in fig 22 all the tension of the four mooring lines was far below the strength of both materials 16903 kn and the spar was very safe under the strong wave and current condition the tension of the mooring lines under the other wave directions were also far below the strength of the mooring materials and they are also omitted in the text 3 4 6 motions of spar carrying ndds fig 23 depicts the detail configuration of the spar platform with a pair of ndds and mooring lines that were simulated in the orcaflex the rotational and translational motions of duct a and b have similar responses and they were shown in figs 24 and 25 respectively meanwhile the largest motion was the yaw motion but the response was only less than 4 both ndds were shifted by the storm waves with δx 2 m and δz 5 m that the shifted distance was less than the outlet diameter d 9 m of the ndds although the difference between the responses of two ducts was not obvious the small difference may due to that duct b was at the downstream side the translation and rotational responses of the ndds were very small that demonstrates the stability of the ndds under storm wave condition the translational responses of ndds under the other wave directions were also very small and they were omitted in the text in order to build a megawatt power plant the spar platform must carry more than 60 ndds we further simulated the spar platform carrying two pairs of ndds as shown in fig 26 and the roll responses of the two pairs of ndds were illustrated in fig 27 the response of the second pair of ndd was even smaller than that of the first one the current induced tension built in the mooring lines between two pairs of ndds might reduce the responses of the second ndds and the effective pto of the second pair of ndds also can be assured fig 28 depicts the concept of twelve ndds carrying by one branch of spar platform in the similar manner five branches of spar may carry 60 ndds however the size of the proposed spar and mooring lines needed to be re designed whereas the present demonstration study indicates that a megawatt power plant is feasible to harvest kuroshio energy in the future 4 conclusion the ocean current power capture system was designed including a spar platform carrying multiple nozzle duct type ocean current power generators by collaborating the data from ansys fluent and ansys aqwa to orcaflex the whole system including mooring lines and the duct lines was simulated the results of single ducts anchored on the seabed and the spar carrying ducts under storm wave condition and normal wave condition with constant 1 m s current speed was presented the following concluded remarks can be given 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients including c d and c a of the duct in translational and rotational motions were calculated the rotational domain was verified in this study with the domain length and diameter as 40 m and 9d and d is the characteristic length outlet diameter of ndd two methods were compared to verify the accuracy of c d and the results was well matched which means the data for c a from the acceleration method was also confirmed 2 the numerical model of the duct was established in orcaflex also the determination of the duct weight and the relationship between cg and pitch angle of the duct under different weight conditions was tested in this study with the configurations of the mooring line and duct the simulation shows a high stability of the duct under normal wave conditions meanwhile the duct was very safe in the deep position when the storm waves approaching 3 the preliminary test was made by comparing the experimental measurement wamit and ansys aqwa and the results agree well in the study the geometry of the spar was constructed by considering the relationship between the spar diameters d spar added mass a 33 and heave natural period t 33 of the spar the final spar model was 100 m draft d spar 9 m and 5 branches with the total weight equal 6785 5 tons and cg 75 m 4 the system configuration including the spar multiple ducts and mooring lines were presented in orcaflex the designed spar shows a very stable response against different directions of storm waves meanwhile fft results of the spar response agree well to the rao results in aqwa the anchor lines were both under the material limit which shows a high safety for the whole system both two ducts have similar responses in every testing case although only the 90 storm waves case shows high pto results the other cases still reveal that both two ducts may not collide to each other due to both two ducts have similar motion in the simulation period 5 the simulation of spar which carried four ndds was also simulated and the responses of the second pair of ndds were even smaller than those of the first pair the reason might be more tension force is established due to ocean current in the same manner more pair of ndds can be attached assume 6 pairs of ndds were attached to each branch of spar and the spar will have 60 ndds which can generate megawatt power 6 the proposed energy harvesters and platform have simple geometries and they are very easy to be manufactured the current energy harvester chen et al 2018 and spar platform zhang 2008 have been successfully deployed in many places we therefore may expect the proposed simple ocean current harvesters and their simple carrier to be deployed in the east coast of taiwan and the megawatt kuroshio power plant is feasible in the near future credit authorship contribution statement po hung yeh methodology writing review editing all

21028,the prediction of the bulk drag coefficient c d for aquatic vegetation is of great significance for evaluating the influence of vegetation on the hydrodynamic processes in wave environments different c d empirical formulas have been mostly proposed as functions of either reynolds re number or keulegan carpenter kc number in the literature and the influences of other wave and vegetation parameters on c d were often ignored the difference in formulas is largely attributable to inconsistent uses of characteristic velocity and length scales in the definitions of re and kc by considering the vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics in this study new re and kc numbers were redefined using the mean pore velocity and vegetation related hydraulic radius besides a genetic programming algorithm was adopted to develop a robust relationship between c d and possible dimensionless variables based on extensive experimental data ultimately a new c d predictor that has a similar form to that of the classical expression was obtained without any prespecified forms before searching it turns out that the new predictor depends on not only the new kc number but also the submergence ratio and ursell number compared with the existing predictors the proposed c d predictor exhibits a considerable improvement in predictive ability for a wider parameter space keywords aquatic vegetation wave flows bulk drag coefficient predictor genetic programming 1 introduction flexible aquatic vegetation such as seagrasses and salt marshes has been recognized as nature based coastal defense solutions e g anderson and smith 2014 augustin et al 2009 jadhav et al 2013 möller et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 and they are increasingly universal in coastal protection schemes as a ubiquitous feature in the aquatic environment flexible vegetation plays an important role in mitigating hazards in coastal areas by dissipating wave energy and it greatly affects the hydrodynamic processes within coastal ecosystems because of the additional resistance also called drag force exerted by vegetation e g henry et al 2015 ozeren et al 2014 the additional resistance induced by vegetation can attenuate waves significantly and produce different influences on the velocity field and turbulence structures of the wavefield van veelen et al 2020 these related processes can lead to different sediment deposition patterns which can influence the coastal morphology e g bouma et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 and provides adaptation to sea level rise through eco geomorphological feedback e g french 1993 wang et al 2019 a comprehensive and proper understanding of vegetation induced drag is of great significance for evaluating the impact of aquatic vegetation in ecological and environmental engineering especially wave dissipation caused by vegetation therefore the study of vegetation induced drag has aroused great interest of many researchers e g chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 jacobsen et al 2019 yao et al 2018 an accurate description of drag forces induced by vegetation is complicated by the fact that it requires knowledge of the dynamics of the vegetation i e the relative motion between the fluid and the vegetation yet there is no universally accepted methodology to predict or account for vegetation motion luhar and nepf 2016 as a result most studies thus far have focused on the parameterization of bulk drag coefficients c d that are calibrated to the wave height observations in the laboratory or field measurement e g dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 sánchez gonzález et al 2011 van veelen et al 2020 note that c d is considered as an empirical parameter for quantifying the mean resistance force exerted against the waves by the entire vegetation field ozeren et al 2014 moreover busari and li 2015 also pointed out that accurate estimation of c d is crucial and essential to the theoretical semi empirical or numerical models of vegetated flows however this c d parameterization is currently one of the major difficulties in describing vegetation flow interactions in freshwater and coastal environments aberle and jarvela 2013 henry et al 2015 and the main reason is that c d depends highly on complex variable hydrodynamic and vegetation characteristics anderson et al 2011 in recent years much attention has been devoted to the c d parameterization of wave flows e g anderson and smith 2014 cavallaro et al 2018 chastel et al 2020 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 and the most classic c d determination approach is briefly summarized below 1 1 existing determination approach for cd due to the dynamic nature of aquatic vegetation and the spatial variation of the individual and bulk characteristics of vegetation the interaction between vegetation and waves is quite complex besides the distributions of natural aquatic vegetation are usually random and the stem morphology varies greatly each stem can be classified as rigid or flexible according to its deformation under load moreover the characteristics of a single stem change along with the stem height and also change with different stages of the life cycle ozeren et al 2014 therefore it may not be a trivial task to obtain c d under such complex hydrodynamic and vegetation conditions but it is assumed to be possible for the case of a simple array of rigid cylinders under controlled wave conditions e g suzuki et al 2019 a classical and pioneering theoretical method for calculating c d proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 was adopted in this study by simplifying the aquatic vegetation to rigid cylinders no motion on a uniform bed assuming the validity of monochromatic wave trains and linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 dalrymple et al 1984 developed a theoretical model for wave attenuation based on the wave energy conservation equation the schematization of wave attenuation over vegetation both emergent and submerged is shown in fig 1 in which the x axis depicts the wave propagation direction the front edge of the vegetation field is set as the origin x 0 and x l v is at the back edge of the vegetation field in addition the z axis represents the vertical position relative to the water column so that z 0 represents the still water surface and z h illustrates the bed bottom level for simplicity of the analysis the vegetation field is considered as an array of vertical cylinders with stem height h v diameter b v and stem density n v defined as the stem number per unit bed area when waves travel through the vegetation field the energy dissipation can be quantified according to the work done by the waves on the vegetation it is assumed that the vegetation resistance is the only source of energy dissipation which is equal to the average energy flux gradient based on the conservation of energy 1 ε d e c g x where ε d is the time averaged energy dissipation per unit horizontal area per wave period caused by vegetation e is the wave energy density c g is the wave group velocity the total wave force acting on vegetation is composed of the drag and inertia forces which can be described by the morison equation morison et al 1950 it should be mentioned that whether the inertia force can be ignored compared with the drag force depends on the keulegan carpenter kc number which represents the ratio of the inertial forces to drag when waves are interacting with small objects kc 1 suggesting that the inertial force can be neglected luhar and nepf 2016 approximating the vegetation area as an array of rigid vertical cylinders based on the linear wave theory and morison equation ignoring the effect of vertical force and inertia force e g dalrymple et al 1984 hu et al 2014 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 ε d can be expressed as 2 ε d 1 t t t t h h α h 1 2 c d ρ b v n v u 2 u d z d t where t is the wave period t is the time h is the still water depth α h v h is the submergence ratio for submerged h v h and unity for emergent h v h vegetation anderson and smith 2014 ozeren et al 2014 u is the time varying velocity components in the x direction according to dalrymple et al 1984 eqs 1 and 2 can be integrated to develop a relationship between the wave and vegetation parameters the wave height attenuation can be expressed as a function of the longitudinal distance x from the front edge of the vegetation field 3 h x h 0 1 1 β x where h x is the local wave height within the vegetation field h 0 is the wave height at the front edge x l v 0 of the vegetation field and β is the wave damping coefficient defined as 4 β 4 9 π h 0 c d b v n v k sinh 3 k α h 3 sinh k α h sinh k h sinh 2 k h 2 k h where k 2π l is the wavenumber for regular waves and l is the wavelength according to eq 4 the magnitude of β is a function of vegetation properties hydrodynamic conditions and c d importantly c d implicitly acts as the only calibration parameter that compensates for the assumptions made such as the simplification of the stem morphology geometry buoyancy and rigidity so it cannot be used to express the actual drag force observed by the individual stem jacobsen et al 2019 instead c d can be reasonable as a macroscopic parameter for quantifying the mean resistance force exerted against the waves by the entire vegetation field ozeren et al 2014 and a larger c d means stronger wave damping induced by vegetation van veelen et al 2020 in addition the above model indicates that c d can be obtained from eqs 3 and 4 when the wave height decay within the vegetation field is measured besides this model accounts for arbitrary water depth and vegetation height allowing for both submerged and emergent vegetation expanding upon dalrymple et al 1984 méndez and losada 2004 derived wave height attenuation for irregular waves using a similar expression as 5 h rms x h rms 0 1 1 β x with 6 β 1 3 π h rms 0 c d b v n v k p sinh 3 k p α h 3 sinh k p α h sinh k p h sinh 2 k p h 2 k p h where k p 2π l p is the wavenumber l p is the wavelength associated with the peak period for irregular waves h rms 0 is the root mean square rms wave height at the front vegetation edge and h rms x is the local rms wave height inside the vegetation field according to augustin et al 2009 the spectral moment wave heights h m0 can be converted to the rms wave height by assuming a rayleigh distribution based on h m0 1 416h rms in the past few decades numerous studies on c d have been conducted mostly in laboratories providing a controlled test condition to investigate wave attenuation concerning specified vegetation species and hydrodynamic conditions the framework proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 has been widely applied in a large number of flume experiments with not only rigid vegetation e g he et al 2019 hu et al 2014 maza et al 2019 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 but also artificial real aquatic vegetation e g anderson and smith 2014 cavallaro et al 2018 chastel et al 2020 losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 to obtain additional empirical formulas for predicting c d it should be mentioned that regarding the c d prediction of flexible vegetation in wave flows in previous studies the influence of fluid dynamics different degrees of bending and motion of stems due to its various flexibility of flexible vegetation on c d were usually not taken into account due to its complex mechanism this limitation will be discussed in section 3 2 3 however sufficient laboratory measurements are often challenging or unavailable for practical engineering therefore the empirical c d formulas obtained from experimental data are often inevitable when dealing with such complex issues therefore a large number of empirical formulas have been proposed to predict appropriate c d values for extensive vegetation and hydrodynamic conditions by defining c d as functions of several dimensionless parameters e g anderson et al 2011 henry et al 2015 as summarized in the next section 1 2 existing predictors of cd for regular or irregular wave flows many empirical formulations have been proposed for c d as functions of the reynolds number re u c l c ν and the keulegan carpenter number kc u c t l c see table 1 for details here u c is the characteristic velocity acting on the stem l c is the characteristic length ν 10 6 m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of fluid and t is the wave period for regular waves and it can be replaced by the spectral peak wave period t p in the case of irregular wave conditions usually re number was used to compare the fluid inertia with viscous forces kc number was used to compare the drag force over inertia forces in an oscillatory flow and it also can be regarded as a ratio between wave excursion and stem diameter from another perspective keulegan and carpenter 1958 van veelen et al 2020 as shown in table 1 the corresponding expressions can take different forms however the most common and classical expressions are mostly written as c d m kc κ n or c d m re κ n where the coefficients m n and κ hold different values for different references significant variations exist in the characteristic velocity u c and characteristic length l c scales for calculations of re and kc numbers henry et al 2015 which may be a related reason for the difference in these c d predictors as reported by liu et al 2020 for instance most studies use u m as the characteristic velocity for re and kc calculations anderson and smith 2014 cavallaro et al 2018 mendez et al 1999 ozeren et al 2014 in which u m is defined as the maximum horizontal velocity at the seaward edge of the vegetation x l v 0 and vegetation top z h αh using linear wave theory as follows 7 u m h i 2 ω cosh k α h sinh k h note that eq 7 is also available for irregular waves to calculate the water particle velocity by replacing h i with h rms and k with k p anderson and smith 2014 in contrast van veelen et al 2020 defined u m as the maximum orbital velocity at the stem center z h 0 5h while kobayashi et al 1993 and möller et al 2014 calculated u m at the flume bottom z h concerning the choice of the characteristic length l c it can be observed that except for the use of deflected stem length l d in losada et al 2016 for vegetation current wave interaction all other researchers preferred the stem width b v consequently the above review shows that there is currently no universal expression for c d available that is valid for different types of wave conditions regular irregular and extensive vegetation types real artificial in other words the best fit coefficients m n κ for each predictor are not universal because they are limited to the test conditions covered by the individual laboratory experiment e g chastel et al 2020 however the characteristic velocity u c in the calculation of re or kc only considers the velocity information at the seaward vegetation edge the characteristic length b v only represents the frontal width of a single stem and t only reflects the influence of the wave period as a result the effects of vegetation density water depth wave height and other hydrodynamic parameters were not considered for predicting c d given the fact that the flow pattern within a multi cylinder array is much more complicated than that around a single isolated cylinder due to the strong wake interaction liu et al 2020 such other factors as vegetation density and vegetation configuration may strongly influence wave turbulence and dissipation characteristics nepf 1999 therefore only re or kc is not sufficient to accurately predict c d indicating that other possible parameters may also be important e g van veelen et al 2020 attempts have been made to investigate the contributions of hydrodynamic parameters other than re and kc to c d for example van veelen et al 2020 pointed out that the fitted c d of flexible vegetation correlates well with the dimensionless hydrodynamic parameters of the relative wave height h h and the froude number fr u m gh 0 5 while it did not perform well with the submergence ratio α and wave steepness h l fr is usually represented as the ratio between horizontal water particle velocity with respect to wave celerity at shallow water conditions to estimate the wave energy dissipated by vegetation with the stem root and canopy he et al 2019 proposed an empirical formula for predicting c d based on the modified kc number qc kc α 0 58 and the modified ursell number wr ur α 2 338 where ur l 2 h h 3 is the ursell number not listed in table 1 an indicator that characterizes wave nonlinearity is used to represent the balance between wave steepness h l and relative water depth h l and longer wave in shallow water depths has a higher ur value similarly more accurate c d predictors were obtained by introducing α to modify kc anderson and smith 2014 mattis et al 2019 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 as a consequence a c d predictor that considers the comprehensive effects of major hydrodynamic and vegetation characteristics is crucial for predicting wave energy dissipation caused by vegetation in practical engineering last but not least although the above mentioned parameters do not take into account the flexibility of vegetation flexibility is shown to be a key mechanical property influencing wave attenuation e g anderson and smith 2011 van veelen et al 2020 an analytical model for the wave forced movement of single stem vegetation derived by mullarney and henderson 2010 predicted dissipation through flexible stems was about 30 of that for rigid ones for the description of flexibility luhar and nepf 2016 proposed that the reconfiguration behavior of individual flexible blades in wave flows tend to vary with a dimensionless parameter cauchy number ca ρb v u c 2 h v 3 ei as the ratio of drag force over restoring forces due to vegetation stiffness here e is the modulus of elasticity i is the second moment of area for the blade cross section unfortunately the influence of blade flexibility on c d of aquatic vegetation remains unclear in the absence of high quality data contains various vegetation flexibility information it is challenging to quantify the flexibility of different types of flexible vegetation according to anderson and smith 2011 non uniformity of the vegetation stem age health water content season and salinity are all naturally occurring factors that could affect flexibility for example considering several different locations along the louisiana coast and varying times of the year chatagnier 2012 estimated the modulus of elasticity for s alterniflora as e 159 8 mpa using the method of freeman et al 2000 however s alterniflora sampled in texas was reported to have e 1410 710 mpa by feagin et al 2011 while both researchers use traditional beam theory to calculate e the methodologies and location of samples were different besides rupprecht et al 2015 described a gradient of stiffness with exposure to hydrodynamic forcing they found an increase in e values from the low marsh species puccinellia maritima 737 1995 mpa to the high marsh species elymus athericus 1952 4082 mpa therefore to better understand the influence mechanism of flexibility on c d it is urgent and important to develop consistent calculation standards of e for a broader range of artificial real vegetation species unfortunately yet this complex issue has not been addressed in this work 1 3 machine learning approach obviously the c d predictors mentioned in table 1 were obtained using conventional data driven methods curve fitting or regression analysis based on prespecified forms mostly the re c d or kc c d type moreover the experimental data used were usually limited in a relatively narrow variable space which restricts the applicability of the c d predictors and they can only perform well in some certain cases in other words a c d predictor that performs well for a certain data group may fail to predict the data in the other data group as discussed in section 3 1 3 generally researchers first analyze the relationships between c d and wave or vegetation parameters and then subjectively propose the possible variables that affect c d even suggesting a prespecified analytical expression of the c d predictor anderson and smith 2014 chastel et al 2020 ozeren et al 2014 this indicates that the predictive capability of the predictor model depends on the rationality of the subjective suggestion from researchers and it is likely to ignore the contribution of other potential factors this is not conducive to a comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanism of wave and vegetation characteristics on drag force induced by vegetation as an advanced data driven method the machine learning ml technique can explore the inherent relationships among possible variables involved in complex issues liu et al 2020 tinoco et al 2015 in this study a genetic programming gp algorithm the ml technique was adopted to search for a robust c d predictor for flexible vegetation wave flows based on published experimental data based on the principle of natural selection the gp algorithm can automatically explore the possible relationships among the given variables and only the solutions with smaller errors can survive the evolution process besides the gp algorithm does not require researchers to subjectively provide possible expressions of c d for wave and vegetation variables goldstein et al 2013 liu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2017 instead it can incorporate all possible variables into the development process of a predictor and leave the identification of relevant variables to the algorithm wang et al 2017 in the present study a widely used gp software package eureqa schmidt and lipson 2013 was used to explore a new c d predictor for aquatic vegetation wave interaction without any prespecified forms eureqa has been proved to be effective in a good deal of research topics in river engineering and hydrological research goldstein et al 2013 shi et al 2019 especially for topics of vegetated channel flows huai et al 2018 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2017 this work is organized as follows section 2 describes the gp methods in detail in which the data preprocessing grouping and gp algorithm are introduced step by step in section 3 using the gp algorithm a new c d predictor for aquatic vegetation was developed based on the collected data besides the rationality stability predictive ability of the proposed c d predictor were provided the physical meaning of the c d predictor is explored by describing its performance also more explanations and discussions about bulk drag coefficient and characteristic velocity and length scales were given and limitations of the c d predictor were explained finally the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methods 2 1 data preprocessing for gp during a single research project the amount and range of related variables can be restricted by the difficulties and costs of laboratory experiments which may cause a single experimental procedure to ignore some inherent subtle dependencies usually a c d predictor using a single dataset does not perform well for other datasets to avoid this problem a large number of experimental flume data from nine pieces of research were used in this study as summarized in table 2 anderson and smith 2014 augustin 2007 cavallaro et al 2018 chastel et al 2020 koftis et al 2013 losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 wu et al 2011 it is found that the database covers a spacious variable parameter space including regular irregular waves real artificial vegetation small scale large scale flume tests and staggered aligned random vegetation configuration it should be emphasized that some of the c d values were directly obtained from the literature without additional processing some were calculated based on the β values by eqs 4 and 6 and some are based on h h 0 using eqs 3 and 5 see table 2 for details it needs to mention that the scenarios with small incident wave height in the range of 0 01 m 0 03 m reported by wu et al 2011 were not considered in the databank due to the exceptional c d values even larger than 100 for s alterniflora and ozeren et al 2014 also neglected these abnormal data to explore the relationship between c d and kc number finally 694 data points were adopted in the present research to feed the gp algorithm including those in table s1 supplementary material the final database can be visualized as a series of histograms to show the parameter space in fig 2 note the variable values were processed by the rounding method which is convenient for counting each variable in a certain range the histograms show that the distributions of three dimensionless variables h i h and t are concentrated in a region while some odd data are located far from the concentrated region moreover the distributions of h v b v and n v are relatively uniform indicating that the available data covers a wide range of vegetation parameter space in particular in the process of data collection and preprocessing more attention should be paid to the determination of b v although losada et al 2016 used the deflected plant length l d as the characteristic length to propose a new re number to describe c d relations other studies have not mentioned l d see table 2 therefore in order to facilitate unified analysis this work uses b v as the specific characteristic length for cylindrical model vegetation b v is the stem diameter and for flat strips b v is taken as the stem width according to cheng and nguyen 2011 in contrast for real vegetation with irregular shapes losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 wu et al 2011 b v is determined as the average diameter provided by the samples statistics of real vegetation species in addition the majority of c d values fall within the range of 0 10 it needs to mention that the merging of different data sources introduces uncertainty into the data and the measurement error of each dataset is different owing to the different instruments and techniques used in each experiment because it is difficult to quantify the measurement error uniformly its possible influences on the c d predictor were ignored in this study goldstein et al 2013 according to previous studies the major parameters in terms of wave and vegetation characteristics that affect the c d for flexible vegetation are 8 f 1 c d h t h i h v b v n v u c φ 0 where f is a function the wave period t can be replaced by t p and incident wave height h i can be replaced by h rms for irregular waves φ πn v b v 2 4 is the vegetation density defined as the average volume fraction occupied by vegetation cheng and nguyen 2011 liu et al 2020 tinoco et al 2015 note that the effect of flexibility e g elastic modulus e on c d is not included in eq 8 the main reason is that the flexibility information of flexible vegetation adopted in the above mentioned literature was inconsistent and insufficient for example several studies koftis et al 2013 losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 chastel et al 2020 employed young s modulus or elastic modulus to characterize flexibility by contrast augustin 2007 and anderson and smith 2014 provided the tensile strength and maximum secant modulus values of artificial s alterniflora to roughly describe the vegetation flexibility respectively in addition the elastic modulus values of real vegetation and artificial p oceanica were not reported explicitly in wu et al 2011 and cavallaro et al 2018 yet the determining approaches for the flexibility parameters were not clearly specified in the literature as a result the effect of flexibility is not considered in exploring c d empirical formulas in this study this limitation will be discussed in section 3 2 3 it should be emphasized that most previous studies listed in table 1 also usually did not take into account the impact of flexibility on c d since the gp algorithm does not consider the physical dimensions the dimensions of the output results may not be consistent goldstein et al 2013 liu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 tinoco et al 2015 to avoid the need for such dimensional coefficients that have no physical meaning the gp algorithm was fed with dimensionless variables the π theory of buckingham seo and cheong 1998 states that the number of dimensionless variables required for a given issue is equal to the difference between the number of dimensional variables and the number of fundamental dimensional variables involved in the issue concerning an issue with a large number of variables it is usually at the discretion of researchers to determine the most suitable dimensionless variables tinoco et al 2015 to enable the gp algorithm to completely ignore the mechanisms involved at the beginning of the search the algorithm was provided with dimensionless variables larger than the minimum number required and the gp algorithm was allowed to distinguish during the evolutionary search process which dimensionless variable is the most relevant consequently the following functional relationship is obtained by subjectively selecting the relevant dimensionless parameters in terms of vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics 9 c d f 2 h i h h i l h l f r u r wave α φ vegetation re b re r kc b kc r wave with vegetation note that these classical parameters are widely used in vegetated flow issues in which the first five parameters represent wave characteristics in which h l is the relative water depth both α and φ account for vegetation characteristics because this research focuses on the bulk vegetation characteristics the influence of vegetation configuration on c d is not taken into account cheng 2013 liu et al 2020 seo and cheong 1998 in particular the last four parameters take the effects of the wave and vegetation into account for more clarity the re and kc calculated by the usual scales u m and b v are represented by reb u m b v ν and kcb u m t b v respectively where u m is calculated based on eq 7 in this study by introducing a new characteristic velocity scale u p and length scale r v the new modified re and kc numbers are redefined as rer u p r v ν and kcr u p t r v respectively where u p u m 1 φ denotes the mean pore velocity which represents the spatially averaged flow velocity in the spaces between vegetation elements cheng and nguyen 2011 kothyari et al 2009 tanino and nepf 2008 here the term 1 φ indicates that the volume fraction of the vegetation is excluded because the wave force only acts on the water volume tinoco et al 2015 note that r v π 4 1 φ φ b v is the vegetation related hydraulic radius originally proposed by cheng and nguyen 2011 for open channel flows with rigid emergent vegetation representing the ratio of the volume occupied by water to the wetted surface area of all vegetation stems however for vegetation induced form drag it is not the total wetted surface area that should be taken into account instead what needs to be considered is the frontal area of the stem which is the area of the stem projected on a plane normal to the wave direction moreover r v is analogous to the concentration length reported in james et al 2008 to the best of the authors knowledge compared with previous studies see table 1 the usage of u p and r v is novel for flexible vegetation interaction with wave flows as shown subsequently both perform much better than other velocity and length scales in re and kc calculations for consolidating c d data from disparate sources across a broad range of vegetation width and density space because they consider the contributions of both vegetation and wave characteristics fig 3 shows the histograms for the dimensionless experimental parameters defined above which cover a wider range of the parameter space than the database in previous studies such a compiled database makes it possible to increase the applicability range of the c d predictor in addition compared with the single fitting c d relationship only based on re or kc numbers in the literature more attention is paid to the additional contributions from other vegetation and wave hydrodynamic characteristics in this study which is an advantage of the gp algorithm when exploring a predictor for a complex issue 2 2 data grouping for gp the 694 experimental data were divided into three independent datasets training validation and testing dataset as reported by tinoco et al 2015 the gp algorithm used the training dataset to develop and optimize candidate solutions the validation dataset was used to evaluate the fitness of gp derived solutions based on the training dataset the testing dataset served as an independent group to test the optimal predictor against other published predictors in other words the training and validation datasets are used to feed the gp algorithm and the testing dataset is used for the final test however a random data grouping has the inherent risk of missing data representing a specific area of the parameter space moreover to the best of the authors knowledge there is no unique grouping standard available for the number of data in each group however in the case of an extremely small training dataset noise leads to lower precision formulas conversely if the training dataset is extremely large it complicates the formula and leads to overfitting therefore an appropriate grouping method is necessary to enable each group to represent the entire parameter space well in this study the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda recommended by camus et al 2011 was adopted to select the training and validation datasets the method aims to obtain a dataset in which the data show the largest dissimilarities and it has been also successfully applied in many studies about open channel vegetated flows liu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the mda selects successively a series of data points called centroids as representatives of portions of the data space the data are first normalized by scaling the values between 0 and 1 based on the relation x n x i x min x max x min where x n is the new normalized data value x i is the original variable value x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values of the variable x i respectively finally x n are denormalized as x i x n x max x min x min at the end of the selection process the sum of squares of dissimilarity is called euclidean distance wang et al 2017 and the mda chooses the centroid farthest from the previous one based on this distance in this study the data point with the maximum reb value was chosen as the first centroid which shows the relatively broad and uniform distributed data in fig 3 the detailed execution process of the mda can be found in camus et al 2011 finally the mda ensures that the selected data subset used to develop the c d predictor can well represent the entire database as they do not concentrate on a certain area as a result the training validation and testing datasets were selected to account for 20 40 and 40 of the entire database respectively as shown in fig 4 the same data grouping strategy was also adopted successfully by tinoco et al 2015 and liu et al 2020 since there are no clear conclusions available concerning the optimal number of training data required tinoco et al 2015 the sensitivity analysis for changing the size of the training dataset is discussed in section 3 1 2 as demonstrated by camus et al 2011 and shown in fig 4 the selected 20 of the data in the training dataset can effectively cover the densest area as well as the peripheral space meanwhile except that c d has no clear correlations with φ and α c d shows different degrees of negative correlation with other variables fr ur reb rer kcb and kcr and only the new parameter kcr enables the c d data to collapse tightly together the following results show that kcr indeed plays a significant role in exploring c d predictors across a wide range of vegetation and wave conditions 2 3 gp algorithm the final optimal solution was obtained by eureqa using the mda selected data during formula searching each candidate solution was evaluated according to the specified error metric i e called fitness functions in eureqa tinoco et al 2015 the fitness functions mean absolute error mae and mean squared error mse were chosen as the main error metrics in eureqa wang et al 2017 huai et al 2018 10 mae 1 n i 1 n c d pre c d obs 11 mse 1 n i 1 n c d pre c d obs 2 where n is the total number of datasets c d obs is the observed c d values directly from the experimental data and c d pre is the predicted c d values based on the predictors note that mae can characterize the actual error between predicted values and observed values while mse performs better at highlighting the outliers in addition to these error metrics eureqa also considers complexity as another criterion for a candidate solution the complexity of a solution will increase with the increasing numbers of parameters coefficients and mathematical operators contained in the solutions e g shi et al 2019 in this study the selected mathematical operators are composed of the constant input variable addition subtraction multiplication division exponent natural logarithm power and square root which has its default complexity value in eureqa the final complexity of a solution is equal to the sum of the complexities of all mathematical operators involved goldstein et al 2013 schmidt and lipson 2009 in the searching process each candidate solution in a given time step can survive completely only if its error mae or mse is smaller than those of all other solutions with the same complexity as a result the output of eureqa is a series of solutions with different complexities and errors usually errors decrease with an increase in complexity however highly complex formulas with large complexity tend to lack physical meanings and have poor practicability whereas oversimplified formulas cannot reflect the intrinsic relationships among variables and their accuracy is relatively low researchers must choose the final solution as the optimal predictor from all surviving candidate solutions by balancing complexity performance and physicality the following factors are considered to select the best solution 1 solution on the cliff of the pareto front as shown in fig 5 where the accuracy increases significantly with a slight change in complexity 2 accuracy of the solution goldstein et al 2013 3 physically sound form 3 results and discussion 3 1 results 3 1 1 selection of optimal solution after evaluating 5 2 1011 generations by eureqa 18 candidate solutions survived by natural selection and the minimum and maximum complexities were 1 and 44 respectively as summarized in table 3 where the mae mse and correlation coefficient r2 of these solutions can also be found it was found from subsequent runs that although more formulas would continue to survive in the iterative process they would all have similar forms with slightly different coefficients table 3 indicates that in terms of mae mse and r2 the most complicated formula the last row is the best predictor in predicting c d however its high complexity with a complexity of 44 is probably the result of symbolic regression without any specific physical meaning a stair like figure frontier called the pareto front goldstein et al 2013 wang et al 2017 is shown in fig 5 to describe the noncontinuous relationship between complexity and accuracy mae it is found that the mae of the solution first decreases rapidly with the increase of complexity and then approaches stable when the complexity is larger than 15 i e after the complexity reaches 15 a large increase of the complexity only results in a small improvement on accuracy that is when the formulas with complexities of larger than 15 are discarded accuracy becomes the primary consideration in the selection of the final predictor therefore we focus our attention on the solution of complexity 15 which is expressed as 12 c d 1 19 kc r 0 00522 1 19 α 1 u r fig 6 shows a comparison of the c d pre based on eq 12 with the c d obs values for 20 training 40 validation and 40 testing datasets respectively the error metrics mae mse and r2 are included in each subplot as expected the r2 values of eq 12 based on the training and validation datasets are higher 0 87 and 0 83 respectively the independent test dataset holds a relatively lower accuracy r2 0 68 the main reason for this is that the test dataset is mainly concentrated in the core of the densest area while the training and validation data datasets are distributed in peripheral space and can better represent the entire data group nevertheless eq 12 can predict c d with relatively high accuracy with a high r2 value of 0 80 based on all available data as discussed in section 3 1 3 3 1 2 rationality and stability of present predictor to test the rationality of eq 12 for the selected training validation and testing datasets the mae mse and r2 were calculated as shown in table 4 as suggested by shi et al 2019 the discrepancy ratio dr log c d obs c d pre suggests the discrepancy between the predicted and observed values aghababaei et al 2017 the percentage of dr between 0 3 and 0 3 is usually used to evaluate the performance of a predictor model aghababaei et al 2017 huai et al 2018 zeng and huai 2014 table 4 shows that there are no obvious discrepancies in the performance of eq 12 for the three data groups demonstrating its satisfactory rationality regarding the stability of the predictor tinoco et al 2015 stated that the gp algorithm tends to be stable when the size of the training data group is changed here such a sensitivity analysis was also performed by changing the sizes of the training dataset from 10 of the available 694 data to the whole dataset 100 while keeping the same 40 of the data for validation fig 7 shows the data distribution using the mda method to assign 10 30 40 and 50 of the available data for training here c d is plotted against kcr as an example for the distribution of the 20 training dataset the reader is referred to fig 4 it can be found that even at 10 the mda algorithm can cover not only the peripheral extreme values but also denser areas within the cluster table 5 provides insight into how solutions are influenced by data selection from 10 to 100 of the available data after evaluating different numbers of formulas by eureqa the solutions with complexity 15 are selected among the candidate solutions note that a larger training dataset needs a higher computational cost before reaching stable results it is found from table 5 that as the number of training data increases the gp algorithm does not show evidence of better predictors resulting from a larger training dataset instead it provides a series of similar solutions with eq 12 and there is no significant discrepancy in the coefficient m n and κ values as shown in table 5 the insensitivity of the training data size to the results also appeared in shi et al 2019 furthermore it was found that all solutions have relatively comparable mae mse and r2 values proving satisfactory stability therefore it can be considered that the data grouping strategy 20 40 and 40 of the data for training validation and testing adopted in this study is reasonable after balancing between computational cost and accuracy 3 1 3 comparison with other predictors to further evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed c d predictor fig 8 shows comparisons between the c d obs values the collected 694 c d data listed in table 2 and the c d pre values that are calculated based on the existing predictors table 1 in the literature and the proposed c d predictor eq 12 in this study in which the re or kc number involved are calculated based on the hydrodynamic parameters of 694 scenarios more attention should be paid to calculate the re and kc numbers for different predictors because of the different characteristic velocity and length scales in different literature for example the characteristic velocity used by möller et al 2014 was calculated at the flume bottom rather than the vegetation top like other literature it needs to mention that if the 40 testing dataset selected in section 2 2 was used here similar results would be obtained therefore that case is not shown in the present study several available empirical formulas are selected for comparison in fig 8 noted that only the c d predictors for regular wave conditions of wu et al 2011 and möller et al 2014 are selected due to the similarity of the predictors under irregular wave conditions as shown in fig 8 the mae and mse values using eq 12 are obviously smaller than those using other predictors and the r2 values using eq 12 are noticeably higher than those using other predictors confirming that the c d predictor proposed in this study performs better than other predictors for instance the r2 values of the other predictors are all on the order of 0 01 such low r2 values indicate that these predictors have very weak predictive performance when the data are extended to such a wide range of parameters in other words these predictors tend to be applicable only to their specific test conditions and are not universal in practical applications in contrast the r2 value of the proposed c d predictor in this study is as high as 0 80 indicating that even in a wide parameter range the predicted c d values agree well with the observed c d values 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 performance of present predictor interestingly eq 12 shares a similar form to that given by most classical expressions c d m kc κ n as shown in table 1 although no prespecified forms were given before the search for solutions although it is generally believed that the physical quantities such as φ reb and kcb play important roles in predicting c d for wave vegetation flows no direct relationship appears in the candidate solutions given by eureqa where the dependence on these physical quantities may appear in intermediate steps during formula searching instead the dimensionless parameters kcr α and ur survived during the natural selection indicating that the newly proposed parameter kcr made a significant contribution in describing the c d relations compared with reb rer and kcb the major advantage for kcr is because it includes the influences of not only vegetation characteristics φ and b v but also wave characteristics u p and t in order to describe the influence of kcb and φ more intuitively eq 12 can be rewritten as 13 c d 1 19 kc b 1 φ 2 π 4 φ 0 00522 1 19 α 1 u r many previous studies have confirmed that kcb provides a better prediction for c d than reb for oscillating flows augustin et al 2009 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 what can support this is that van veelen et al 2020 observed that c d for flexible vegetation tends to be predominantly controlled by the hydrodynamic conditions rather than the vegetation diameter this is mainly because flexible vegetation may bend and sway periodically with waves cavallaro et al 2018 and vegetation swaying of flexible vegetation can reduce the stem frontal area and the relative velocity difference between stem and water both have a significant effect on the drag forces and the above description is closely related to the wave period t while is not included in re number according to the classical c d kc type expressions the coefficients m n and κ in eq 12 can be expressed as m 1 19 n 0 00522 1 19 α 1 u r and κ 1 actually the solutions given by the gp algorithm all share a similar structure of coefficient n when the complexity is larger than 13 see table 3 in detail the coefficient m approaches a constant and is likely to be independent of vegetation and wave characteristics similar to the viscous term of the ergun equation reported by tanino and nepf 2008 who stated that the term m describes the viscous contribution that caused by the viscous shear stress on the vegetation surface the coefficient κ 1 has the same order of magnitude as the coefficient values of the published empirical formulas table 1 last but not least the term n depends on the combined performance of α and ur which involves not only vegetation characteristics but also wave nonlinearity characteristics unfortunately the coefficient n becomes meaningless when α is assigned an irrational number i e 1 1 19 this might be the result of statistical artifacts and the formula is obtained based on such noncontinuous α values from laboratory tests a similar limitation also occurred in the work of tinoco et al 2015 to propose physically sound predictors for depth averaged velocity within submerged rigid vegetation zone in open channel flows even so based on the good predictive performance of the formula as discussed in section 3 1 3 it is considered that the applicability of the c d predictor is acceptable although it is not ideal after all it is almost impossible for a discrete value of α to satisfy this singularity value in either laboratory tests or engineering practice besides ur shows a contrary behavior on c d depending on whether the value of α is larger than 1 1 19 according to augustin et al 2009 the vegetation can be considered as emergent and near emergent when α 1 1 19 if α 1 1 19 the vegetation is submerged to further discuss the physical meaning of the selected solution fig 9 shows the relationship between c d and kcr for various ur where two typical submergence ratio α 0 5 and α 1 0 was taken as examples to illustrate the submerged and emergent vegetation conditions the most noticeable trend is that c d gradually decreased with kcr before leveling off this is consistent with a well known tendency of c d with kcb e g mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 the explanation for the high drag coefficients that were found at lower kcr values may be attributed to the morrison equation morison et al 1950 in the oscillatory flows when kcr is high drag is the dominant hydrodynamic forcing so that the inertia can be neglected when kcr is low the inertia will become the dominant forcing that cannot be neglected resulting in a higher c d due to an overestimation of the conversion rate from the flow force to drag note that when kcr is small the effects of ur and α on c d are very weak and their effects should not be ignored when kcr is large this is because that the magnitude of n is only in the range of о 0 0001 to о 1 based on the collected databank so it can be concluded that kcr plays a dominant role in determining c d as shown in fig 9 when α 1 0 the term n gradually decreases as ur increases from 0 1 to 0 8 о 0 1 resulting in a gradual decrease in c d this trend can be supported by the conclusions reported by wu and cox 2015 and he et al 2019 for wave flows interaction with the emergent vegetation model moreover when ur increases from 20 to 40 о 1 the values of n are very small о 0 01 ur is not sensitive to c d as a result indicating that c d is independent of wave nonlinearity at this situation the reason for this is that the c d in this study is derived based on linear wave theory without considering the effect of wave nonlinearity characteristics by contrast an opposite trend occurs for α 0 5 cases but the reason is unclear in addition for a given ur and kcr the c d vales for α 1 are greater than those for α 0 5 indicating that emergent vegetation has better wave damping capacity than submerged vegetation which is consistent with previous conclusions e g hu et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 in general the new c d predictor eq 12 has a relatively good physical meaning with a similar form to the most classical c d expression 3 2 2 bulk drag coefficient and characteristic scale as mentioned before c d can be assumed as a macroscopic parameter that characterizes the wave damping capability of the entire vegetation therefore to describe the relationship between c d and re or kc numbers both the characteristic length r v and characteristic velocity u p takes the bulk mean vegetation characteristics into account rather than the individual stem characteristics in particular the vegetation related hydraulic radius r v is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by water to the frontal area of the stems which takes effects of vegetation size and density into account u p u m 1 φ denotes the mean pore velocity that represents the actual approaching velocity on stems where u m has always been used as a classic characteristic velocity to calculate re or kc which can be directly calculated according to eq 7 it should be noted that for submerged vegetation with small flexibility a layer with amplified horizontal flow velocity tends to develop directly above the submerged vegetation and reduced velocities within the vegetation van veelen et al 2020 however this amplified layer becomes unobvious for vegetation with greater flexibility and the flexible vegetation can have weaker impacts on the flow field depending on its flexibility since the stems can bend and sway with oscillating waves according to van veelen et al 2020 the reduced wave damping capacity of flexible vegetation has been attributed to vegetation bending and swaying the physical explanation is two fold first vegetation swaying reduces the frontal area of the vegetation this reduces the total work that can be exercised by the drag force and consequently directly reduces the energy lost in a wave traveling over vegetation dalrymple et al 1984 secondly the relative velocity between water and vegetation reduces when vegetation sways with the flow mendez et al 1999 these effects are not accounted for in eqs 4 and 6 and may lead to a lower c d based on this it may be a better choice to consider the relative velocity mendez et al 1999 and effective blade length luhar and nepf 2016 as the characteristic velocity and length to explore c d relationships which will be addressed in a follow on study it is widely recognized that the flow structure within a multi stem array is much more complicated than the flow structure around a single isolated stem because of the strong wake wake interaction and wake stem interaction especially when the vegetation density is not very low ozeren et al 2014 as a result the bulk drag coefficient is related to the complex wake coherence between stems and other processes that may affect wave energy dissipation thus it is not reasonable to use eq 12 to directly estimate the drag coefficient of a single isolated stem generally the drag coefficient of a single stem or a stem in a vegetation canopy can be obtained by the direct force measurement approach e g hu et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 wang et al 2020 which is a newer approach that based on the original morison equation rather than the calibration approach used in this study and it requires synchronized velocity and force data to derive the time varying drag coefficient it can be expected that the time varying drag coefficient varies with velocity and drag force accordingly within a wave period based on a phase averaged technique e g hu et al 2014 which seems to be a more realistic drag coefficient law within a vegetation canopy from a microscopic perspective as a consequence to describe the relationships between time varying drag coefficient and re or kc numbers the phase averaged velocity stratigaki et al 2011 may be a better choice for the characteristic velocity scale and it can be easily obtained from velocity measurement data within the vegetation this is an interesting research topic which will be addressed in future work 3 2 3 limitations of present predictor the c d data used in this study were derived from an analytical theory based on energy flux conservation dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 one important concern is that some non drag related and initially neglected energy dissipative processes such as wave breaking bed friction and inertia force that exist in the natural environment whereas the model does not take these processes into account this can account for a deviant value of the bulk drag coefficient because the contributions of these neglected processes are discounted in the drag coefficient besides due to the lack of available data on the flexibility of aquatic vegetation in the literature the impact of flexibility on the proposed c d predictor was not considered however many studies have reported that vegetation flexibility plays a significant role in affecting wave attenuation velocity structure and drag coefficient houser et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 paul et al 2016 van veelen et al 2020 in particular under identical hydrodynamic conditions the drag coefficient of flexible vegetation was found 30 and 50 reductions for van veelen et al 2020 and maza et al 2013 respectively alternatively riffe et al 2011 find 50 reduction in drag force for flexible vegetation in a field study furthermore numerical modeling exercises have shown that plant swaying reduces the drag forces on flexible vegetation luhar and nepf 2016 mendez et al 1999 mullarney and henderson 2010 however augustin et al 2009 found no difference between rigid and flexible vegetation therefore additional research is needed on how vegetation flexibility affects wave attenuation in addition the relationship between the parameters that characterize flexibility such as ca and c d has not been fully explored and the influence mechanism remains unclear in the absence of high quality comparative data we thus call for a re evaluation of existing c d predictors and urge the scientific community to develop more appropriate methods for a priori quantification of vegetation flexibility for a broader range of plant species and wave conditions and to improve the proposed c d predictor in this work furthermore the new c d predictor has only been tested in the ranges of 0 05 ur 76 37 0 19 α 1 0 and 0 08 kcr 8 65 0 0015 φ 0 0804 2 28 kcb 4504 for eq 13 and special care should be taken outside of these ranges for practical application although a broader parameter space has been included in the dataset in this study future data collection campaigns can be added to this database allowing for modifications to the proposed prediction schemes in this sense the c d prediction scheme demonstrated here is dynamic moreover future research should try to address the parameterization with singularity α despite these limitations this is an attempt to use the gp algorithm to explore the physical sound predictor of the complex problem of vegetation flows which is different from the traditional regression analysis method our main contribution is neither to propose a new gp algorithm nor a perfect c d predictor for aquatic vegetation in wave environments but instead to build a bridge between both research fields by providing a clear and comprehensive example of the application of gp pros and cons as a consequence the data driven technique is encouraged to be used as part of the data analysis process and to avoid misconceptions of machine learning as simple correlation techniques or physically senseless statistical analysis 4 summary and conclusions in this work the bulk drag coefficient c d of aquatic vegetation in wave environments was systematically reviewed and the widely used c d empirical formulas were summarized they were obtained through traditional regression analysis based on their own specific limited experimental conditions therefore the coefficients of the formulas cannot be unified so the applicability of the formulas tends to be rather limited the main reason for this is that the existing empirical formulas are commonly represented by relationships between c d and a single dimensionless parameter re or kc without considering the possible effects of other vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics and the characteristic velocity and length scales for calculating re and kc are often inconsistent to improve the general applicability of the c d predictor within a wide range of parameters the re and kc numbers were redefined using the vegetation related hydraulic radius and average pore velocity following cheng and nguyen 2011 besides by considering the possible relevant vegetation and hydrodynamic factors the gp algorithm was applied to develop a new c d predictor for aquatic vegetation based on published extensive experimental data covering wide ranges of each parameter involved the gp software eureqa was fed with only nondimensional variables that avoided the need for dimensional coefficients in the candidate solutions finally the optimum solution of c d was determined by balancing the complexity accuracy and physical meaning although there were no prespecified forms before searching a satisfactory predictor that agrees with the classical c d formula in form was obtained the contribution of the new kc number kcr was found to be significant and the formula coefficients are related to the vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics i e the submergence ratio α and ursell number ur among them kcr plays a dominant role in predicting c d similar to the well known tendency c d gradually decreased with kcr before leveling off ur shows a different behavior on affecting c d depending on whether the value of α is larger than an irrational number 1 1 19 the c d values for larger α are greater than those for smaller α indicating that emergent vegetation has better wave damping capacity than submerged vegetation in addition the stability of the formula was effectively verified based on a sensitivity analysis by changing the size of the training dataset although the c d predictor has a certain limitation it is still helpful for consolidating various experimental data across a wide range of wave and vegetation parameters moreover it exhibits considerable improvement in prediction performance compared with previous predictors in addition to that the new predictor holds a relatively concise form and can be easily used in practical application which provides a new way to facilitate future investigation of the bulk drag coefficient of aquatic vegetation in wave flows with the proven capabilities of gp further research considering the vegetation flexibility should be incorporated to look for a robust model to obtain predictions more representative of natural conditions finally it is expected that the results in this study could further encourage discussion on the use of the machine learning technique as an effective data analysis tool which can be readily integrated as part of the research process although this technique cannot fully replace physical inference nor is it a substitute for the great efforts of researchers to develop physics based models it is an effective tool for gaining physical insight from available datasets and goes

21028,the prediction of the bulk drag coefficient c d for aquatic vegetation is of great significance for evaluating the influence of vegetation on the hydrodynamic processes in wave environments different c d empirical formulas have been mostly proposed as functions of either reynolds re number or keulegan carpenter kc number in the literature and the influences of other wave and vegetation parameters on c d were often ignored the difference in formulas is largely attributable to inconsistent uses of characteristic velocity and length scales in the definitions of re and kc by considering the vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics in this study new re and kc numbers were redefined using the mean pore velocity and vegetation related hydraulic radius besides a genetic programming algorithm was adopted to develop a robust relationship between c d and possible dimensionless variables based on extensive experimental data ultimately a new c d predictor that has a similar form to that of the classical expression was obtained without any prespecified forms before searching it turns out that the new predictor depends on not only the new kc number but also the submergence ratio and ursell number compared with the existing predictors the proposed c d predictor exhibits a considerable improvement in predictive ability for a wider parameter space keywords aquatic vegetation wave flows bulk drag coefficient predictor genetic programming 1 introduction flexible aquatic vegetation such as seagrasses and salt marshes has been recognized as nature based coastal defense solutions e g anderson and smith 2014 augustin et al 2009 jadhav et al 2013 möller et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 and they are increasingly universal in coastal protection schemes as a ubiquitous feature in the aquatic environment flexible vegetation plays an important role in mitigating hazards in coastal areas by dissipating wave energy and it greatly affects the hydrodynamic processes within coastal ecosystems because of the additional resistance also called drag force exerted by vegetation e g henry et al 2015 ozeren et al 2014 the additional resistance induced by vegetation can attenuate waves significantly and produce different influences on the velocity field and turbulence structures of the wavefield van veelen et al 2020 these related processes can lead to different sediment deposition patterns which can influence the coastal morphology e g bouma et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 and provides adaptation to sea level rise through eco geomorphological feedback e g french 1993 wang et al 2019 a comprehensive and proper understanding of vegetation induced drag is of great significance for evaluating the impact of aquatic vegetation in ecological and environmental engineering especially wave dissipation caused by vegetation therefore the study of vegetation induced drag has aroused great interest of many researchers e g chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 jacobsen et al 2019 yao et al 2018 an accurate description of drag forces induced by vegetation is complicated by the fact that it requires knowledge of the dynamics of the vegetation i e the relative motion between the fluid and the vegetation yet there is no universally accepted methodology to predict or account for vegetation motion luhar and nepf 2016 as a result most studies thus far have focused on the parameterization of bulk drag coefficients c d that are calibrated to the wave height observations in the laboratory or field measurement e g dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 sánchez gonzález et al 2011 van veelen et al 2020 note that c d is considered as an empirical parameter for quantifying the mean resistance force exerted against the waves by the entire vegetation field ozeren et al 2014 moreover busari and li 2015 also pointed out that accurate estimation of c d is crucial and essential to the theoretical semi empirical or numerical models of vegetated flows however this c d parameterization is currently one of the major difficulties in describing vegetation flow interactions in freshwater and coastal environments aberle and jarvela 2013 henry et al 2015 and the main reason is that c d depends highly on complex variable hydrodynamic and vegetation characteristics anderson et al 2011 in recent years much attention has been devoted to the c d parameterization of wave flows e g anderson and smith 2014 cavallaro et al 2018 chastel et al 2020 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 and the most classic c d determination approach is briefly summarized below 1 1 existing determination approach for cd due to the dynamic nature of aquatic vegetation and the spatial variation of the individual and bulk characteristics of vegetation the interaction between vegetation and waves is quite complex besides the distributions of natural aquatic vegetation are usually random and the stem morphology varies greatly each stem can be classified as rigid or flexible according to its deformation under load moreover the characteristics of a single stem change along with the stem height and also change with different stages of the life cycle ozeren et al 2014 therefore it may not be a trivial task to obtain c d under such complex hydrodynamic and vegetation conditions but it is assumed to be possible for the case of a simple array of rigid cylinders under controlled wave conditions e g suzuki et al 2019 a classical and pioneering theoretical method for calculating c d proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 was adopted in this study by simplifying the aquatic vegetation to rigid cylinders no motion on a uniform bed assuming the validity of monochromatic wave trains and linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 dalrymple et al 1984 developed a theoretical model for wave attenuation based on the wave energy conservation equation the schematization of wave attenuation over vegetation both emergent and submerged is shown in fig 1 in which the x axis depicts the wave propagation direction the front edge of the vegetation field is set as the origin x 0 and x l v is at the back edge of the vegetation field in addition the z axis represents the vertical position relative to the water column so that z 0 represents the still water surface and z h illustrates the bed bottom level for simplicity of the analysis the vegetation field is considered as an array of vertical cylinders with stem height h v diameter b v and stem density n v defined as the stem number per unit bed area when waves travel through the vegetation field the energy dissipation can be quantified according to the work done by the waves on the vegetation it is assumed that the vegetation resistance is the only source of energy dissipation which is equal to the average energy flux gradient based on the conservation of energy 1 ε d e c g x where ε d is the time averaged energy dissipation per unit horizontal area per wave period caused by vegetation e is the wave energy density c g is the wave group velocity the total wave force acting on vegetation is composed of the drag and inertia forces which can be described by the morison equation morison et al 1950 it should be mentioned that whether the inertia force can be ignored compared with the drag force depends on the keulegan carpenter kc number which represents the ratio of the inertial forces to drag when waves are interacting with small objects kc 1 suggesting that the inertial force can be neglected luhar and nepf 2016 approximating the vegetation area as an array of rigid vertical cylinders based on the linear wave theory and morison equation ignoring the effect of vertical force and inertia force e g dalrymple et al 1984 hu et al 2014 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 ε d can be expressed as 2 ε d 1 t t t t h h α h 1 2 c d ρ b v n v u 2 u d z d t where t is the wave period t is the time h is the still water depth α h v h is the submergence ratio for submerged h v h and unity for emergent h v h vegetation anderson and smith 2014 ozeren et al 2014 u is the time varying velocity components in the x direction according to dalrymple et al 1984 eqs 1 and 2 can be integrated to develop a relationship between the wave and vegetation parameters the wave height attenuation can be expressed as a function of the longitudinal distance x from the front edge of the vegetation field 3 h x h 0 1 1 β x where h x is the local wave height within the vegetation field h 0 is the wave height at the front edge x l v 0 of the vegetation field and β is the wave damping coefficient defined as 4 β 4 9 π h 0 c d b v n v k sinh 3 k α h 3 sinh k α h sinh k h sinh 2 k h 2 k h where k 2π l is the wavenumber for regular waves and l is the wavelength according to eq 4 the magnitude of β is a function of vegetation properties hydrodynamic conditions and c d importantly c d implicitly acts as the only calibration parameter that compensates for the assumptions made such as the simplification of the stem morphology geometry buoyancy and rigidity so it cannot be used to express the actual drag force observed by the individual stem jacobsen et al 2019 instead c d can be reasonable as a macroscopic parameter for quantifying the mean resistance force exerted against the waves by the entire vegetation field ozeren et al 2014 and a larger c d means stronger wave damping induced by vegetation van veelen et al 2020 in addition the above model indicates that c d can be obtained from eqs 3 and 4 when the wave height decay within the vegetation field is measured besides this model accounts for arbitrary water depth and vegetation height allowing for both submerged and emergent vegetation expanding upon dalrymple et al 1984 méndez and losada 2004 derived wave height attenuation for irregular waves using a similar expression as 5 h rms x h rms 0 1 1 β x with 6 β 1 3 π h rms 0 c d b v n v k p sinh 3 k p α h 3 sinh k p α h sinh k p h sinh 2 k p h 2 k p h where k p 2π l p is the wavenumber l p is the wavelength associated with the peak period for irregular waves h rms 0 is the root mean square rms wave height at the front vegetation edge and h rms x is the local rms wave height inside the vegetation field according to augustin et al 2009 the spectral moment wave heights h m0 can be converted to the rms wave height by assuming a rayleigh distribution based on h m0 1 416h rms in the past few decades numerous studies on c d have been conducted mostly in laboratories providing a controlled test condition to investigate wave attenuation concerning specified vegetation species and hydrodynamic conditions the framework proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 has been widely applied in a large number of flume experiments with not only rigid vegetation e g he et al 2019 hu et al 2014 maza et al 2019 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 but also artificial real aquatic vegetation e g anderson and smith 2014 cavallaro et al 2018 chastel et al 2020 losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 to obtain additional empirical formulas for predicting c d it should be mentioned that regarding the c d prediction of flexible vegetation in wave flows in previous studies the influence of fluid dynamics different degrees of bending and motion of stems due to its various flexibility of flexible vegetation on c d were usually not taken into account due to its complex mechanism this limitation will be discussed in section 3 2 3 however sufficient laboratory measurements are often challenging or unavailable for practical engineering therefore the empirical c d formulas obtained from experimental data are often inevitable when dealing with such complex issues therefore a large number of empirical formulas have been proposed to predict appropriate c d values for extensive vegetation and hydrodynamic conditions by defining c d as functions of several dimensionless parameters e g anderson et al 2011 henry et al 2015 as summarized in the next section 1 2 existing predictors of cd for regular or irregular wave flows many empirical formulations have been proposed for c d as functions of the reynolds number re u c l c ν and the keulegan carpenter number kc u c t l c see table 1 for details here u c is the characteristic velocity acting on the stem l c is the characteristic length ν 10 6 m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of fluid and t is the wave period for regular waves and it can be replaced by the spectral peak wave period t p in the case of irregular wave conditions usually re number was used to compare the fluid inertia with viscous forces kc number was used to compare the drag force over inertia forces in an oscillatory flow and it also can be regarded as a ratio between wave excursion and stem diameter from another perspective keulegan and carpenter 1958 van veelen et al 2020 as shown in table 1 the corresponding expressions can take different forms however the most common and classical expressions are mostly written as c d m kc κ n or c d m re κ n where the coefficients m n and κ hold different values for different references significant variations exist in the characteristic velocity u c and characteristic length l c scales for calculations of re and kc numbers henry et al 2015 which may be a related reason for the difference in these c d predictors as reported by liu et al 2020 for instance most studies use u m as the characteristic velocity for re and kc calculations anderson and smith 2014 cavallaro et al 2018 mendez et al 1999 ozeren et al 2014 in which u m is defined as the maximum horizontal velocity at the seaward edge of the vegetation x l v 0 and vegetation top z h αh using linear wave theory as follows 7 u m h i 2 ω cosh k α h sinh k h note that eq 7 is also available for irregular waves to calculate the water particle velocity by replacing h i with h rms and k with k p anderson and smith 2014 in contrast van veelen et al 2020 defined u m as the maximum orbital velocity at the stem center z h 0 5h while kobayashi et al 1993 and möller et al 2014 calculated u m at the flume bottom z h concerning the choice of the characteristic length l c it can be observed that except for the use of deflected stem length l d in losada et al 2016 for vegetation current wave interaction all other researchers preferred the stem width b v consequently the above review shows that there is currently no universal expression for c d available that is valid for different types of wave conditions regular irregular and extensive vegetation types real artificial in other words the best fit coefficients m n κ for each predictor are not universal because they are limited to the test conditions covered by the individual laboratory experiment e g chastel et al 2020 however the characteristic velocity u c in the calculation of re or kc only considers the velocity information at the seaward vegetation edge the characteristic length b v only represents the frontal width of a single stem and t only reflects the influence of the wave period as a result the effects of vegetation density water depth wave height and other hydrodynamic parameters were not considered for predicting c d given the fact that the flow pattern within a multi cylinder array is much more complicated than that around a single isolated cylinder due to the strong wake interaction liu et al 2020 such other factors as vegetation density and vegetation configuration may strongly influence wave turbulence and dissipation characteristics nepf 1999 therefore only re or kc is not sufficient to accurately predict c d indicating that other possible parameters may also be important e g van veelen et al 2020 attempts have been made to investigate the contributions of hydrodynamic parameters other than re and kc to c d for example van veelen et al 2020 pointed out that the fitted c d of flexible vegetation correlates well with the dimensionless hydrodynamic parameters of the relative wave height h h and the froude number fr u m gh 0 5 while it did not perform well with the submergence ratio α and wave steepness h l fr is usually represented as the ratio between horizontal water particle velocity with respect to wave celerity at shallow water conditions to estimate the wave energy dissipated by vegetation with the stem root and canopy he et al 2019 proposed an empirical formula for predicting c d based on the modified kc number qc kc α 0 58 and the modified ursell number wr ur α 2 338 where ur l 2 h h 3 is the ursell number not listed in table 1 an indicator that characterizes wave nonlinearity is used to represent the balance between wave steepness h l and relative water depth h l and longer wave in shallow water depths has a higher ur value similarly more accurate c d predictors were obtained by introducing α to modify kc anderson and smith 2014 mattis et al 2019 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 as a consequence a c d predictor that considers the comprehensive effects of major hydrodynamic and vegetation characteristics is crucial for predicting wave energy dissipation caused by vegetation in practical engineering last but not least although the above mentioned parameters do not take into account the flexibility of vegetation flexibility is shown to be a key mechanical property influencing wave attenuation e g anderson and smith 2011 van veelen et al 2020 an analytical model for the wave forced movement of single stem vegetation derived by mullarney and henderson 2010 predicted dissipation through flexible stems was about 30 of that for rigid ones for the description of flexibility luhar and nepf 2016 proposed that the reconfiguration behavior of individual flexible blades in wave flows tend to vary with a dimensionless parameter cauchy number ca ρb v u c 2 h v 3 ei as the ratio of drag force over restoring forces due to vegetation stiffness here e is the modulus of elasticity i is the second moment of area for the blade cross section unfortunately the influence of blade flexibility on c d of aquatic vegetation remains unclear in the absence of high quality data contains various vegetation flexibility information it is challenging to quantify the flexibility of different types of flexible vegetation according to anderson and smith 2011 non uniformity of the vegetation stem age health water content season and salinity are all naturally occurring factors that could affect flexibility for example considering several different locations along the louisiana coast and varying times of the year chatagnier 2012 estimated the modulus of elasticity for s alterniflora as e 159 8 mpa using the method of freeman et al 2000 however s alterniflora sampled in texas was reported to have e 1410 710 mpa by feagin et al 2011 while both researchers use traditional beam theory to calculate e the methodologies and location of samples were different besides rupprecht et al 2015 described a gradient of stiffness with exposure to hydrodynamic forcing they found an increase in e values from the low marsh species puccinellia maritima 737 1995 mpa to the high marsh species elymus athericus 1952 4082 mpa therefore to better understand the influence mechanism of flexibility on c d it is urgent and important to develop consistent calculation standards of e for a broader range of artificial real vegetation species unfortunately yet this complex issue has not been addressed in this work 1 3 machine learning approach obviously the c d predictors mentioned in table 1 were obtained using conventional data driven methods curve fitting or regression analysis based on prespecified forms mostly the re c d or kc c d type moreover the experimental data used were usually limited in a relatively narrow variable space which restricts the applicability of the c d predictors and they can only perform well in some certain cases in other words a c d predictor that performs well for a certain data group may fail to predict the data in the other data group as discussed in section 3 1 3 generally researchers first analyze the relationships between c d and wave or vegetation parameters and then subjectively propose the possible variables that affect c d even suggesting a prespecified analytical expression of the c d predictor anderson and smith 2014 chastel et al 2020 ozeren et al 2014 this indicates that the predictive capability of the predictor model depends on the rationality of the subjective suggestion from researchers and it is likely to ignore the contribution of other potential factors this is not conducive to a comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanism of wave and vegetation characteristics on drag force induced by vegetation as an advanced data driven method the machine learning ml technique can explore the inherent relationships among possible variables involved in complex issues liu et al 2020 tinoco et al 2015 in this study a genetic programming gp algorithm the ml technique was adopted to search for a robust c d predictor for flexible vegetation wave flows based on published experimental data based on the principle of natural selection the gp algorithm can automatically explore the possible relationships among the given variables and only the solutions with smaller errors can survive the evolution process besides the gp algorithm does not require researchers to subjectively provide possible expressions of c d for wave and vegetation variables goldstein et al 2013 liu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2017 instead it can incorporate all possible variables into the development process of a predictor and leave the identification of relevant variables to the algorithm wang et al 2017 in the present study a widely used gp software package eureqa schmidt and lipson 2013 was used to explore a new c d predictor for aquatic vegetation wave interaction without any prespecified forms eureqa has been proved to be effective in a good deal of research topics in river engineering and hydrological research goldstein et al 2013 shi et al 2019 especially for topics of vegetated channel flows huai et al 2018 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2017 this work is organized as follows section 2 describes the gp methods in detail in which the data preprocessing grouping and gp algorithm are introduced step by step in section 3 using the gp algorithm a new c d predictor for aquatic vegetation was developed based on the collected data besides the rationality stability predictive ability of the proposed c d predictor were provided the physical meaning of the c d predictor is explored by describing its performance also more explanations and discussions about bulk drag coefficient and characteristic velocity and length scales were given and limitations of the c d predictor were explained finally the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methods 2 1 data preprocessing for gp during a single research project the amount and range of related variables can be restricted by the difficulties and costs of laboratory experiments which may cause a single experimental procedure to ignore some inherent subtle dependencies usually a c d predictor using a single dataset does not perform well for other datasets to avoid this problem a large number of experimental flume data from nine pieces of research were used in this study as summarized in table 2 anderson and smith 2014 augustin 2007 cavallaro et al 2018 chastel et al 2020 koftis et al 2013 losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 wu et al 2011 it is found that the database covers a spacious variable parameter space including regular irregular waves real artificial vegetation small scale large scale flume tests and staggered aligned random vegetation configuration it should be emphasized that some of the c d values were directly obtained from the literature without additional processing some were calculated based on the β values by eqs 4 and 6 and some are based on h h 0 using eqs 3 and 5 see table 2 for details it needs to mention that the scenarios with small incident wave height in the range of 0 01 m 0 03 m reported by wu et al 2011 were not considered in the databank due to the exceptional c d values even larger than 100 for s alterniflora and ozeren et al 2014 also neglected these abnormal data to explore the relationship between c d and kc number finally 694 data points were adopted in the present research to feed the gp algorithm including those in table s1 supplementary material the final database can be visualized as a series of histograms to show the parameter space in fig 2 note the variable values were processed by the rounding method which is convenient for counting each variable in a certain range the histograms show that the distributions of three dimensionless variables h i h and t are concentrated in a region while some odd data are located far from the concentrated region moreover the distributions of h v b v and n v are relatively uniform indicating that the available data covers a wide range of vegetation parameter space in particular in the process of data collection and preprocessing more attention should be paid to the determination of b v although losada et al 2016 used the deflected plant length l d as the characteristic length to propose a new re number to describe c d relations other studies have not mentioned l d see table 2 therefore in order to facilitate unified analysis this work uses b v as the specific characteristic length for cylindrical model vegetation b v is the stem diameter and for flat strips b v is taken as the stem width according to cheng and nguyen 2011 in contrast for real vegetation with irregular shapes losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 wu et al 2011 b v is determined as the average diameter provided by the samples statistics of real vegetation species in addition the majority of c d values fall within the range of 0 10 it needs to mention that the merging of different data sources introduces uncertainty into the data and the measurement error of each dataset is different owing to the different instruments and techniques used in each experiment because it is difficult to quantify the measurement error uniformly its possible influences on the c d predictor were ignored in this study goldstein et al 2013 according to previous studies the major parameters in terms of wave and vegetation characteristics that affect the c d for flexible vegetation are 8 f 1 c d h t h i h v b v n v u c φ 0 where f is a function the wave period t can be replaced by t p and incident wave height h i can be replaced by h rms for irregular waves φ πn v b v 2 4 is the vegetation density defined as the average volume fraction occupied by vegetation cheng and nguyen 2011 liu et al 2020 tinoco et al 2015 note that the effect of flexibility e g elastic modulus e on c d is not included in eq 8 the main reason is that the flexibility information of flexible vegetation adopted in the above mentioned literature was inconsistent and insufficient for example several studies koftis et al 2013 losada et al 2016 möller et al 2014 chastel et al 2020 employed young s modulus or elastic modulus to characterize flexibility by contrast augustin 2007 and anderson and smith 2014 provided the tensile strength and maximum secant modulus values of artificial s alterniflora to roughly describe the vegetation flexibility respectively in addition the elastic modulus values of real vegetation and artificial p oceanica were not reported explicitly in wu et al 2011 and cavallaro et al 2018 yet the determining approaches for the flexibility parameters were not clearly specified in the literature as a result the effect of flexibility is not considered in exploring c d empirical formulas in this study this limitation will be discussed in section 3 2 3 it should be emphasized that most previous studies listed in table 1 also usually did not take into account the impact of flexibility on c d since the gp algorithm does not consider the physical dimensions the dimensions of the output results may not be consistent goldstein et al 2013 liu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 tinoco et al 2015 to avoid the need for such dimensional coefficients that have no physical meaning the gp algorithm was fed with dimensionless variables the π theory of buckingham seo and cheong 1998 states that the number of dimensionless variables required for a given issue is equal to the difference between the number of dimensional variables and the number of fundamental dimensional variables involved in the issue concerning an issue with a large number of variables it is usually at the discretion of researchers to determine the most suitable dimensionless variables tinoco et al 2015 to enable the gp algorithm to completely ignore the mechanisms involved at the beginning of the search the algorithm was provided with dimensionless variables larger than the minimum number required and the gp algorithm was allowed to distinguish during the evolutionary search process which dimensionless variable is the most relevant consequently the following functional relationship is obtained by subjectively selecting the relevant dimensionless parameters in terms of vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics 9 c d f 2 h i h h i l h l f r u r wave α φ vegetation re b re r kc b kc r wave with vegetation note that these classical parameters are widely used in vegetated flow issues in which the first five parameters represent wave characteristics in which h l is the relative water depth both α and φ account for vegetation characteristics because this research focuses on the bulk vegetation characteristics the influence of vegetation configuration on c d is not taken into account cheng 2013 liu et al 2020 seo and cheong 1998 in particular the last four parameters take the effects of the wave and vegetation into account for more clarity the re and kc calculated by the usual scales u m and b v are represented by reb u m b v ν and kcb u m t b v respectively where u m is calculated based on eq 7 in this study by introducing a new characteristic velocity scale u p and length scale r v the new modified re and kc numbers are redefined as rer u p r v ν and kcr u p t r v respectively where u p u m 1 φ denotes the mean pore velocity which represents the spatially averaged flow velocity in the spaces between vegetation elements cheng and nguyen 2011 kothyari et al 2009 tanino and nepf 2008 here the term 1 φ indicates that the volume fraction of the vegetation is excluded because the wave force only acts on the water volume tinoco et al 2015 note that r v π 4 1 φ φ b v is the vegetation related hydraulic radius originally proposed by cheng and nguyen 2011 for open channel flows with rigid emergent vegetation representing the ratio of the volume occupied by water to the wetted surface area of all vegetation stems however for vegetation induced form drag it is not the total wetted surface area that should be taken into account instead what needs to be considered is the frontal area of the stem which is the area of the stem projected on a plane normal to the wave direction moreover r v is analogous to the concentration length reported in james et al 2008 to the best of the authors knowledge compared with previous studies see table 1 the usage of u p and r v is novel for flexible vegetation interaction with wave flows as shown subsequently both perform much better than other velocity and length scales in re and kc calculations for consolidating c d data from disparate sources across a broad range of vegetation width and density space because they consider the contributions of both vegetation and wave characteristics fig 3 shows the histograms for the dimensionless experimental parameters defined above which cover a wider range of the parameter space than the database in previous studies such a compiled database makes it possible to increase the applicability range of the c d predictor in addition compared with the single fitting c d relationship only based on re or kc numbers in the literature more attention is paid to the additional contributions from other vegetation and wave hydrodynamic characteristics in this study which is an advantage of the gp algorithm when exploring a predictor for a complex issue 2 2 data grouping for gp the 694 experimental data were divided into three independent datasets training validation and testing dataset as reported by tinoco et al 2015 the gp algorithm used the training dataset to develop and optimize candidate solutions the validation dataset was used to evaluate the fitness of gp derived solutions based on the training dataset the testing dataset served as an independent group to test the optimal predictor against other published predictors in other words the training and validation datasets are used to feed the gp algorithm and the testing dataset is used for the final test however a random data grouping has the inherent risk of missing data representing a specific area of the parameter space moreover to the best of the authors knowledge there is no unique grouping standard available for the number of data in each group however in the case of an extremely small training dataset noise leads to lower precision formulas conversely if the training dataset is extremely large it complicates the formula and leads to overfitting therefore an appropriate grouping method is necessary to enable each group to represent the entire parameter space well in this study the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda recommended by camus et al 2011 was adopted to select the training and validation datasets the method aims to obtain a dataset in which the data show the largest dissimilarities and it has been also successfully applied in many studies about open channel vegetated flows liu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the mda selects successively a series of data points called centroids as representatives of portions of the data space the data are first normalized by scaling the values between 0 and 1 based on the relation x n x i x min x max x min where x n is the new normalized data value x i is the original variable value x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values of the variable x i respectively finally x n are denormalized as x i x n x max x min x min at the end of the selection process the sum of squares of dissimilarity is called euclidean distance wang et al 2017 and the mda chooses the centroid farthest from the previous one based on this distance in this study the data point with the maximum reb value was chosen as the first centroid which shows the relatively broad and uniform distributed data in fig 3 the detailed execution process of the mda can be found in camus et al 2011 finally the mda ensures that the selected data subset used to develop the c d predictor can well represent the entire database as they do not concentrate on a certain area as a result the training validation and testing datasets were selected to account for 20 40 and 40 of the entire database respectively as shown in fig 4 the same data grouping strategy was also adopted successfully by tinoco et al 2015 and liu et al 2020 since there are no clear conclusions available concerning the optimal number of training data required tinoco et al 2015 the sensitivity analysis for changing the size of the training dataset is discussed in section 3 1 2 as demonstrated by camus et al 2011 and shown in fig 4 the selected 20 of the data in the training dataset can effectively cover the densest area as well as the peripheral space meanwhile except that c d has no clear correlations with φ and α c d shows different degrees of negative correlation with other variables fr ur reb rer kcb and kcr and only the new parameter kcr enables the c d data to collapse tightly together the following results show that kcr indeed plays a significant role in exploring c d predictors across a wide range of vegetation and wave conditions 2 3 gp algorithm the final optimal solution was obtained by eureqa using the mda selected data during formula searching each candidate solution was evaluated according to the specified error metric i e called fitness functions in eureqa tinoco et al 2015 the fitness functions mean absolute error mae and mean squared error mse were chosen as the main error metrics in eureqa wang et al 2017 huai et al 2018 10 mae 1 n i 1 n c d pre c d obs 11 mse 1 n i 1 n c d pre c d obs 2 where n is the total number of datasets c d obs is the observed c d values directly from the experimental data and c d pre is the predicted c d values based on the predictors note that mae can characterize the actual error between predicted values and observed values while mse performs better at highlighting the outliers in addition to these error metrics eureqa also considers complexity as another criterion for a candidate solution the complexity of a solution will increase with the increasing numbers of parameters coefficients and mathematical operators contained in the solutions e g shi et al 2019 in this study the selected mathematical operators are composed of the constant input variable addition subtraction multiplication division exponent natural logarithm power and square root which has its default complexity value in eureqa the final complexity of a solution is equal to the sum of the complexities of all mathematical operators involved goldstein et al 2013 schmidt and lipson 2009 in the searching process each candidate solution in a given time step can survive completely only if its error mae or mse is smaller than those of all other solutions with the same complexity as a result the output of eureqa is a series of solutions with different complexities and errors usually errors decrease with an increase in complexity however highly complex formulas with large complexity tend to lack physical meanings and have poor practicability whereas oversimplified formulas cannot reflect the intrinsic relationships among variables and their accuracy is relatively low researchers must choose the final solution as the optimal predictor from all surviving candidate solutions by balancing complexity performance and physicality the following factors are considered to select the best solution 1 solution on the cliff of the pareto front as shown in fig 5 where the accuracy increases significantly with a slight change in complexity 2 accuracy of the solution goldstein et al 2013 3 physically sound form 3 results and discussion 3 1 results 3 1 1 selection of optimal solution after evaluating 5 2 1011 generations by eureqa 18 candidate solutions survived by natural selection and the minimum and maximum complexities were 1 and 44 respectively as summarized in table 3 where the mae mse and correlation coefficient r2 of these solutions can also be found it was found from subsequent runs that although more formulas would continue to survive in the iterative process they would all have similar forms with slightly different coefficients table 3 indicates that in terms of mae mse and r2 the most complicated formula the last row is the best predictor in predicting c d however its high complexity with a complexity of 44 is probably the result of symbolic regression without any specific physical meaning a stair like figure frontier called the pareto front goldstein et al 2013 wang et al 2017 is shown in fig 5 to describe the noncontinuous relationship between complexity and accuracy mae it is found that the mae of the solution first decreases rapidly with the increase of complexity and then approaches stable when the complexity is larger than 15 i e after the complexity reaches 15 a large increase of the complexity only results in a small improvement on accuracy that is when the formulas with complexities of larger than 15 are discarded accuracy becomes the primary consideration in the selection of the final predictor therefore we focus our attention on the solution of complexity 15 which is expressed as 12 c d 1 19 kc r 0 00522 1 19 α 1 u r fig 6 shows a comparison of the c d pre based on eq 12 with the c d obs values for 20 training 40 validation and 40 testing datasets respectively the error metrics mae mse and r2 are included in each subplot as expected the r2 values of eq 12 based on the training and validation datasets are higher 0 87 and 0 83 respectively the independent test dataset holds a relatively lower accuracy r2 0 68 the main reason for this is that the test dataset is mainly concentrated in the core of the densest area while the training and validation data datasets are distributed in peripheral space and can better represent the entire data group nevertheless eq 12 can predict c d with relatively high accuracy with a high r2 value of 0 80 based on all available data as discussed in section 3 1 3 3 1 2 rationality and stability of present predictor to test the rationality of eq 12 for the selected training validation and testing datasets the mae mse and r2 were calculated as shown in table 4 as suggested by shi et al 2019 the discrepancy ratio dr log c d obs c d pre suggests the discrepancy between the predicted and observed values aghababaei et al 2017 the percentage of dr between 0 3 and 0 3 is usually used to evaluate the performance of a predictor model aghababaei et al 2017 huai et al 2018 zeng and huai 2014 table 4 shows that there are no obvious discrepancies in the performance of eq 12 for the three data groups demonstrating its satisfactory rationality regarding the stability of the predictor tinoco et al 2015 stated that the gp algorithm tends to be stable when the size of the training data group is changed here such a sensitivity analysis was also performed by changing the sizes of the training dataset from 10 of the available 694 data to the whole dataset 100 while keeping the same 40 of the data for validation fig 7 shows the data distribution using the mda method to assign 10 30 40 and 50 of the available data for training here c d is plotted against kcr as an example for the distribution of the 20 training dataset the reader is referred to fig 4 it can be found that even at 10 the mda algorithm can cover not only the peripheral extreme values but also denser areas within the cluster table 5 provides insight into how solutions are influenced by data selection from 10 to 100 of the available data after evaluating different numbers of formulas by eureqa the solutions with complexity 15 are selected among the candidate solutions note that a larger training dataset needs a higher computational cost before reaching stable results it is found from table 5 that as the number of training data increases the gp algorithm does not show evidence of better predictors resulting from a larger training dataset instead it provides a series of similar solutions with eq 12 and there is no significant discrepancy in the coefficient m n and κ values as shown in table 5 the insensitivity of the training data size to the results also appeared in shi et al 2019 furthermore it was found that all solutions have relatively comparable mae mse and r2 values proving satisfactory stability therefore it can be considered that the data grouping strategy 20 40 and 40 of the data for training validation and testing adopted in this study is reasonable after balancing between computational cost and accuracy 3 1 3 comparison with other predictors to further evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed c d predictor fig 8 shows comparisons between the c d obs values the collected 694 c d data listed in table 2 and the c d pre values that are calculated based on the existing predictors table 1 in the literature and the proposed c d predictor eq 12 in this study in which the re or kc number involved are calculated based on the hydrodynamic parameters of 694 scenarios more attention should be paid to calculate the re and kc numbers for different predictors because of the different characteristic velocity and length scales in different literature for example the characteristic velocity used by möller et al 2014 was calculated at the flume bottom rather than the vegetation top like other literature it needs to mention that if the 40 testing dataset selected in section 2 2 was used here similar results would be obtained therefore that case is not shown in the present study several available empirical formulas are selected for comparison in fig 8 noted that only the c d predictors for regular wave conditions of wu et al 2011 and möller et al 2014 are selected due to the similarity of the predictors under irregular wave conditions as shown in fig 8 the mae and mse values using eq 12 are obviously smaller than those using other predictors and the r2 values using eq 12 are noticeably higher than those using other predictors confirming that the c d predictor proposed in this study performs better than other predictors for instance the r2 values of the other predictors are all on the order of 0 01 such low r2 values indicate that these predictors have very weak predictive performance when the data are extended to such a wide range of parameters in other words these predictors tend to be applicable only to their specific test conditions and are not universal in practical applications in contrast the r2 value of the proposed c d predictor in this study is as high as 0 80 indicating that even in a wide parameter range the predicted c d values agree well with the observed c d values 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 performance of present predictor interestingly eq 12 shares a similar form to that given by most classical expressions c d m kc κ n as shown in table 1 although no prespecified forms were given before the search for solutions although it is generally believed that the physical quantities such as φ reb and kcb play important roles in predicting c d for wave vegetation flows no direct relationship appears in the candidate solutions given by eureqa where the dependence on these physical quantities may appear in intermediate steps during formula searching instead the dimensionless parameters kcr α and ur survived during the natural selection indicating that the newly proposed parameter kcr made a significant contribution in describing the c d relations compared with reb rer and kcb the major advantage for kcr is because it includes the influences of not only vegetation characteristics φ and b v but also wave characteristics u p and t in order to describe the influence of kcb and φ more intuitively eq 12 can be rewritten as 13 c d 1 19 kc b 1 φ 2 π 4 φ 0 00522 1 19 α 1 u r many previous studies have confirmed that kcb provides a better prediction for c d than reb for oscillating flows augustin et al 2009 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 what can support this is that van veelen et al 2020 observed that c d for flexible vegetation tends to be predominantly controlled by the hydrodynamic conditions rather than the vegetation diameter this is mainly because flexible vegetation may bend and sway periodically with waves cavallaro et al 2018 and vegetation swaying of flexible vegetation can reduce the stem frontal area and the relative velocity difference between stem and water both have a significant effect on the drag forces and the above description is closely related to the wave period t while is not included in re number according to the classical c d kc type expressions the coefficients m n and κ in eq 12 can be expressed as m 1 19 n 0 00522 1 19 α 1 u r and κ 1 actually the solutions given by the gp algorithm all share a similar structure of coefficient n when the complexity is larger than 13 see table 3 in detail the coefficient m approaches a constant and is likely to be independent of vegetation and wave characteristics similar to the viscous term of the ergun equation reported by tanino and nepf 2008 who stated that the term m describes the viscous contribution that caused by the viscous shear stress on the vegetation surface the coefficient κ 1 has the same order of magnitude as the coefficient values of the published empirical formulas table 1 last but not least the term n depends on the combined performance of α and ur which involves not only vegetation characteristics but also wave nonlinearity characteristics unfortunately the coefficient n becomes meaningless when α is assigned an irrational number i e 1 1 19 this might be the result of statistical artifacts and the formula is obtained based on such noncontinuous α values from laboratory tests a similar limitation also occurred in the work of tinoco et al 2015 to propose physically sound predictors for depth averaged velocity within submerged rigid vegetation zone in open channel flows even so based on the good predictive performance of the formula as discussed in section 3 1 3 it is considered that the applicability of the c d predictor is acceptable although it is not ideal after all it is almost impossible for a discrete value of α to satisfy this singularity value in either laboratory tests or engineering practice besides ur shows a contrary behavior on c d depending on whether the value of α is larger than 1 1 19 according to augustin et al 2009 the vegetation can be considered as emergent and near emergent when α 1 1 19 if α 1 1 19 the vegetation is submerged to further discuss the physical meaning of the selected solution fig 9 shows the relationship between c d and kcr for various ur where two typical submergence ratio α 0 5 and α 1 0 was taken as examples to illustrate the submerged and emergent vegetation conditions the most noticeable trend is that c d gradually decreased with kcr before leveling off this is consistent with a well known tendency of c d with kcb e g mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 van veelen et al 2020 the explanation for the high drag coefficients that were found at lower kcr values may be attributed to the morrison equation morison et al 1950 in the oscillatory flows when kcr is high drag is the dominant hydrodynamic forcing so that the inertia can be neglected when kcr is low the inertia will become the dominant forcing that cannot be neglected resulting in a higher c d due to an overestimation of the conversion rate from the flow force to drag note that when kcr is small the effects of ur and α on c d are very weak and their effects should not be ignored when kcr is large this is because that the magnitude of n is only in the range of о 0 0001 to о 1 based on the collected databank so it can be concluded that kcr plays a dominant role in determining c d as shown in fig 9 when α 1 0 the term n gradually decreases as ur increases from 0 1 to 0 8 о 0 1 resulting in a gradual decrease in c d this trend can be supported by the conclusions reported by wu and cox 2015 and he et al 2019 for wave flows interaction with the emergent vegetation model moreover when ur increases from 20 to 40 о 1 the values of n are very small о 0 01 ur is not sensitive to c d as a result indicating that c d is independent of wave nonlinearity at this situation the reason for this is that the c d in this study is derived based on linear wave theory without considering the effect of wave nonlinearity characteristics by contrast an opposite trend occurs for α 0 5 cases but the reason is unclear in addition for a given ur and kcr the c d vales for α 1 are greater than those for α 0 5 indicating that emergent vegetation has better wave damping capacity than submerged vegetation which is consistent with previous conclusions e g hu et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 in general the new c d predictor eq 12 has a relatively good physical meaning with a similar form to the most classical c d expression 3 2 2 bulk drag coefficient and characteristic scale as mentioned before c d can be assumed as a macroscopic parameter that characterizes the wave damping capability of the entire vegetation therefore to describe the relationship between c d and re or kc numbers both the characteristic length r v and characteristic velocity u p takes the bulk mean vegetation characteristics into account rather than the individual stem characteristics in particular the vegetation related hydraulic radius r v is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by water to the frontal area of the stems which takes effects of vegetation size and density into account u p u m 1 φ denotes the mean pore velocity that represents the actual approaching velocity on stems where u m has always been used as a classic characteristic velocity to calculate re or kc which can be directly calculated according to eq 7 it should be noted that for submerged vegetation with small flexibility a layer with amplified horizontal flow velocity tends to develop directly above the submerged vegetation and reduced velocities within the vegetation van veelen et al 2020 however this amplified layer becomes unobvious for vegetation with greater flexibility and the flexible vegetation can have weaker impacts on the flow field depending on its flexibility since the stems can bend and sway with oscillating waves according to van veelen et al 2020 the reduced wave damping capacity of flexible vegetation has been attributed to vegetation bending and swaying the physical explanation is two fold first vegetation swaying reduces the frontal area of the vegetation this reduces the total work that can be exercised by the drag force and consequently directly reduces the energy lost in a wave traveling over vegetation dalrymple et al 1984 secondly the relative velocity between water and vegetation reduces when vegetation sways with the flow mendez et al 1999 these effects are not accounted for in eqs 4 and 6 and may lead to a lower c d based on this it may be a better choice to consider the relative velocity mendez et al 1999 and effective blade length luhar and nepf 2016 as the characteristic velocity and length to explore c d relationships which will be addressed in a follow on study it is widely recognized that the flow structure within a multi stem array is much more complicated than the flow structure around a single isolated stem because of the strong wake wake interaction and wake stem interaction especially when the vegetation density is not very low ozeren et al 2014 as a result the bulk drag coefficient is related to the complex wake coherence between stems and other processes that may affect wave energy dissipation thus it is not reasonable to use eq 12 to directly estimate the drag coefficient of a single isolated stem generally the drag coefficient of a single stem or a stem in a vegetation canopy can be obtained by the direct force measurement approach e g hu et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 wang et al 2020 which is a newer approach that based on the original morison equation rather than the calibration approach used in this study and it requires synchronized velocity and force data to derive the time varying drag coefficient it can be expected that the time varying drag coefficient varies with velocity and drag force accordingly within a wave period based on a phase averaged technique e g hu et al 2014 which seems to be a more realistic drag coefficient law within a vegetation canopy from a microscopic perspective as a consequence to describe the relationships between time varying drag coefficient and re or kc numbers the phase averaged velocity stratigaki et al 2011 may be a better choice for the characteristic velocity scale and it can be easily obtained from velocity measurement data within the vegetation this is an interesting research topic which will be addressed in future work 3 2 3 limitations of present predictor the c d data used in this study were derived from an analytical theory based on energy flux conservation dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 one important concern is that some non drag related and initially neglected energy dissipative processes such as wave breaking bed friction and inertia force that exist in the natural environment whereas the model does not take these processes into account this can account for a deviant value of the bulk drag coefficient because the contributions of these neglected processes are discounted in the drag coefficient besides due to the lack of available data on the flexibility of aquatic vegetation in the literature the impact of flexibility on the proposed c d predictor was not considered however many studies have reported that vegetation flexibility plays a significant role in affecting wave attenuation velocity structure and drag coefficient houser et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 paul et al 2016 van veelen et al 2020 in particular under identical hydrodynamic conditions the drag coefficient of flexible vegetation was found 30 and 50 reductions for van veelen et al 2020 and maza et al 2013 respectively alternatively riffe et al 2011 find 50 reduction in drag force for flexible vegetation in a field study furthermore numerical modeling exercises have shown that plant swaying reduces the drag forces on flexible vegetation luhar and nepf 2016 mendez et al 1999 mullarney and henderson 2010 however augustin et al 2009 found no difference between rigid and flexible vegetation therefore additional research is needed on how vegetation flexibility affects wave attenuation in addition the relationship between the parameters that characterize flexibility such as ca and c d has not been fully explored and the influence mechanism remains unclear in the absence of high quality comparative data we thus call for a re evaluation of existing c d predictors and urge the scientific community to develop more appropriate methods for a priori quantification of vegetation flexibility for a broader range of plant species and wave conditions and to improve the proposed c d predictor in this work furthermore the new c d predictor has only been tested in the ranges of 0 05 ur 76 37 0 19 α 1 0 and 0 08 kcr 8 65 0 0015 φ 0 0804 2 28 kcb 4504 for eq 13 and special care should be taken outside of these ranges for practical application although a broader parameter space has been included in the dataset in this study future data collection campaigns can be added to this database allowing for modifications to the proposed prediction schemes in this sense the c d prediction scheme demonstrated here is dynamic moreover future research should try to address the parameterization with singularity α despite these limitations this is an attempt to use the gp algorithm to explore the physical sound predictor of the complex problem of vegetation flows which is different from the traditional regression analysis method our main contribution is neither to propose a new gp algorithm nor a perfect c d predictor for aquatic vegetation in wave environments but instead to build a bridge between both research fields by providing a clear and comprehensive example of the application of gp pros and cons as a consequence the data driven technique is encouraged to be used as part of the data analysis process and to avoid misconceptions of machine learning as simple correlation techniques or physically senseless statistical analysis 4 summary and conclusions in this work the bulk drag coefficient c d of aquatic vegetation in wave environments was systematically reviewed and the widely used c d empirical formulas were summarized they were obtained through traditional regression analysis based on their own specific limited experimental conditions therefore the coefficients of the formulas cannot be unified so the applicability of the formulas tends to be rather limited the main reason for this is that the existing empirical formulas are commonly represented by relationships between c d and a single dimensionless parameter re or kc without considering the possible effects of other vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics and the characteristic velocity and length scales for calculating re and kc are often inconsistent to improve the general applicability of the c d predictor within a wide range of parameters the re and kc numbers were redefined using the vegetation related hydraulic radius and average pore velocity following cheng and nguyen 2011 besides by considering the possible relevant vegetation and hydrodynamic factors the gp algorithm was applied to develop a new c d predictor for aquatic vegetation based on published extensive experimental data covering wide ranges of each parameter involved the gp software eureqa was fed with only nondimensional variables that avoided the need for dimensional coefficients in the candidate solutions finally the optimum solution of c d was determined by balancing the complexity accuracy and physical meaning although there were no prespecified forms before searching a satisfactory predictor that agrees with the classical c d formula in form was obtained the contribution of the new kc number kcr was found to be significant and the formula coefficients are related to the vegetation and hydrodynamic characteristics i e the submergence ratio α and ursell number ur among them kcr plays a dominant role in predicting c d similar to the well known tendency c d gradually decreased with kcr before leveling off ur shows a different behavior on affecting c d depending on whether the value of α is larger than an irrational number 1 1 19 the c d values for larger α are greater than those for smaller α indicating that emergent vegetation has better wave damping capacity than submerged vegetation in addition the stability of the formula was effectively verified based on a sensitivity analysis by changing the size of the training dataset although the c d predictor has a certain limitation it is still helpful for consolidating various experimental data across a wide range of wave and vegetation parameters moreover it exhibits considerable improvement in prediction performance compared with previous predictors in addition to that the new predictor holds a relatively concise form and can be easily used in practical application which provides a new way to facilitate future investigation of the bulk drag coefficient of aquatic vegetation in wave flows with the proven capabilities of gp further research considering the vegetation flexibility should be incorporated to look for a robust model to obtain predictions more representative of natural conditions finally it is expected that the results in this study could further encourage discussion on the use of the machine learning technique as an effective data analysis tool which can be readily integrated as part of the research process although this technique cannot fully replace physical inference nor is it a substitute for the great efforts of researchers to develop physics based models it is an effective tool for gaining physical insight from available datasets and goes

21029,in this paper the hydrodynamic forces and vortex distributions of a riser subjected to a non uniform flow generated by an upstream oscillating wing structure are simulated using high precision code incompact3d combined with immersed boundary method the effects of in line and transverse positions oscillating frequency and amplitude on riser performance have also been discussed it is found that with the increase of in line spacing or the decrease of oscillation frequency and transverse positions the time averaged drag coefficient of riser changes from the negative values to positive values the time averaged lift coefficient of riser is generally insensitive to oscillation frequency however it shows a large shift when changing the transverse positions or the amplitude of the wing is larger than π 6 moreover for various in line positions oscillating frequency and amplitude the vortex shedding of the rigid riser indicated by the main frequency of lift force is always locked by the oscillating wing however when the transverse position is changing the ratio of main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency does not still remain 1 1 more concretely the maximum time averaged drag coefficient and lift coefficient root mean square value of 0 559 and 1 629 is obtained in the simulation respectively keywords marine riser periodic disturbance direct numerical simulation immersed boundary method hydrodynamic characteristics 1 introduction in recent years with continuous exploitation and consumption of human beings terrestrial oil resources are gradually exhausted so human beings have to turn their attention to the development of offshore oil and gas development as an important link between offshore platforms and subsea production systems marine riser has been one of the hot research area for scholars from all over the world hong and shah 2018 the main problem involves marine riser that submitted to sea current is the fluid structure interaction fsi for nonlinear characteristics at present such nonlinear interaction phenomenon is mainly manifested on flow induced vibration fiv that can be divided into two types vortex induced vibration viv and wake induced vibration wiv viv phenomenon is defined as the solid moving motion of marine riser that caused by a variation of lift and drag forces induced by the periodic vortex shedding when current flow through the riser williamson and govardhan 2004 meanwhile wiv phenomenon is associated closely with the oscillation of a body that immersed in the wake interference region behind a bluff body assi et al 2010 viv and wiv can both be derived from the oscillation of marine riser array submitted to sea current which will eventually reach high amplitude the presence of fluid forces could lead to self excited oscillations of risers and even structure failures when restitute forces and damping forces of structures absolutely can t control them especially under certain extreme conditions it is noteworthy that such fluid elastic instabilities phenomenon of marine riser arrays that submitted to sea currents cross flow results in financial losses worldwide is estimated at 1000 m over one decade païdoussis 2006 the vortex induced vibration characteristic of marine riser is a classical fluid structure interaction fsi problem and its early research focuses on the response of a single riser in completely uniform flow in recent years the influence of interaction flow field on vortex induced vibration of two adjacent cylinders has caused some concerns for tandem configuration arrangement of two cylinders in flow direction assi et al 2010 find that unstable wake of the upstream cylinder can provide energy for the self excited vibration of the downstream cylinder thus increasing its transverse amplitude griffith et al 2017 evidence that when the natural frequency of two cylinders is the same as the vortex shedding frequency of a single cylinder two cylinders will produce quasi periodic and chaotic oscillations for side by side configuration arrangement of two cylinder in vertical flow direction liu and jaiman 2018 study the three dimensional effect of vortex induced vibration in a parallel double cylinder system the results show that the saddle point with high local strain rate is formed outside the frequency locking stage and a large number of three dimensional vortex structures are observed in the flow field for the staggered configuration the center line of two cylinders is at a certain angle of attack with the flow direction hu and zhou 2008 study the wake flow of a staggered double cylinder at reynolds number of 300 and divides the flow patterns into three single vortex street patterns and two double vortex street patterns however studies above are concentrated on the viv of one or more structures in ideal uniform flow but fail to consider the interference of non uniform periodic pulsating fluid such as periodic wave load in complex marine environment if the platform encounters severe waves and currents the riser will produce large amplitude and high frequency vibration which will disturb the flow field distribution around the riser structure and affect the vortex induced vibration response of the structure to a certain extent the completely uniform flow is very rare in nature and the fluids in ocean engineering mostly appear in the form of complex non uniform flows such as shear flow and oscillation flow lin and wang 2013 present the three dimensional governing equations on vortex induced vibration of marine riser at sheared flow the in line force is solved by morison equation while cross flow force is solved by wake oscillator model the governing equations are solved by newmark β method in time domain and the multi mode excitation of riser pipeline in linearly sheared flow is obtained chaplin et al 2005 use physical measurements at the vortex induced vibrations of a model vertical tension riser in a stepped current and find that drag coefficients are up to 120 greater than those for a stationary cylinder at the same reynolds numbers trim et al 2005 experimentally investigate the vortex induced vibration of long marine risers under uniform and linearly sheared currents and find that in line fatigue damage due to viv is as severe as cross flow fatigue damage huang et al 2007 conduct a numerical simulation of an elastically supported cylinder in 2 d planar shear flow they simulate the vortex induced vibrations of a cylinder with reynolds numbers ranging from 2000 to 5000 and shear rates ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 it is found that the shear rate lock in range soars rapidly as the reynolds number increases and the vibrating trace resembles a raindrop within the shear rate lock in range based on the in line forced oscillation test data of a rigid cylinder wang et al 2013 study the effect of velocity distribution under shear flow on fatigue damage of riser luo and zhu 2015 carry out a 3 d viv simulation for a 9 63m marine riser in linearly sheared flow the riser shows unsymmetrical bending deformation phenomenon its viv dominant mode number changes between 1 and 2 finally the riser viv dominant mode number keeps in 2 tu et al 2015 study the vortex induced vibration of tandem cylinders under shear flow the results show that as shear ratio increases the lock in region of both cylinders in the in line and cross flow direction broadens while the influence of the shear ratio on the in line oscillation amplitude is insignificant in the actual oil and gas exploitation the combined actions of wind waves and currents may cause the offshore platform to pulsation periodically and then the relative pulsation flow is generated between risers connected to the platform and the seawater deng et al 2018 zhao 2013 numerically simulated the vortex induced vibration of a 2 d cylinder in the oscillatory flow and found that the vibration frequency of the cylinder is closely related to the keulegan carpenter kc numbers and the reduced velocity zhao et al 2013 study the vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder with oscillatory and steady flow at different flow ratio it is found that the combination of oscillatory flow and steady flow broadens the vibration lock in regime of the cylinder and the maximum value is twice as much as that under single oscillatory flow or steady flow an et al 2015 study the rigid cylinder in oscillating flow with the same re and kc numbers and investigate the feasibility of a 2 d model for simulating a 3 d flow in terms of fundamental flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces yuan et al 2018 propose an alternative time domain force decomposition model for flexible risers to predict viv response under both steady and oscillatory flows ren et al 2019 carry out an experimental study on a flexible pipe with helical strakes in oscillatory flow compared with the bare tube it is found that the helical strakes can significantly improve the dominant frequency of the vortex induced vibration of the cylinder fan et al 2020 experimentally investigate the flow induced vibration of flexible multi cylinders in atmospheric boundary layer and further explain the mechanism of severe vibration by analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics for hydrodynamic forces firstly many achievements have been made in the identification of hydrodynamic coefficients of rigid cylindrical structures most of them pay attention to the fluid forces of vortex induced vibration in cross flow and the relationship between hydrodynamic coefficient and structural response bishop and hassan 1964 carry out the forced oscillation experiment of rigid cylinders in cross flow they measure lift time varying drag and average drag and further study the variation of lift and average drag with reynolds number gopalkrishnan 1993 measures the fluid forces of a rigid cylinder in cross flow forced oscillation and decomposes the fluid forces into lift force and added mass force it is found that when the lift coefficient is positive the cylinder absorbs energy from the fluid on the contrary the structure dissipates energy through the fluid moreover the lift coefficient is closely related to the response frequency and displacement while the added mass coefficient has a strong correlation with the response frequency and a weak correlation with the response displacement sun et al 2010 carry out a 2 d numerical simulation of viv of riser based on the dynamic mesh method and higher harmonics is found at the lower branch of lift force which is the main cause of the conversion of cylinder response from the upper branch to the lower branch secondly the influence of added mass coefficient on vortex induced vibration of cylindrical structure has also been focused by some scholars vikestad et al 2000 experimentally study the relationship between the added mass coefficient and the response frequency it is found that the added mass for the freely vibrating cylinder agreed well with the results found by others in driven cylinder tests the added mass coefficient varies between different cycles in free vortex induced vibration while it changes a little in the lock in zone and the variation trend of added mass coefficient versus time is the same as that of response frequency branković and bearman 2006 measure the fluid forces of a rigid cylinder in transverse free vibration by experiment and find that the added mass coefficient decreases with the increase of reduced velocity in the lock in zone lately some scholars have studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of two degree of freedom rigid cylindrical vortex excited vibration by numerical method focusing on the relationship between hydrodynamic coefficient and structural response displacement dong et al 2012 investigate the relationship between lift coefficient and vortex induced vibration displacement using discrete vortex method dvm it is found that in the initial and upper branches the lift coefficient and the vibration displacement have the same period and phase in the lower branch the lift coefficient and the vibration displacement have the same period with 180 phase delay tang et al 2013 study the characteristics of lift and drag coefficients of two degree of freedom viv for a rigid circular cylinder under high reynolds number re 2 5 104 2 5 105 with dynamic mesh method the results show that the variation of lift and drag coefficients with reduction speed is the same as that of single degree of freedom rigid cylinder both of which increase first and then decrease deng 2014 numerically simulate the vortex excited vibration of a two degree of freedom rigid cylindrical and studies the relationship between the lift and the vibration displacement with different mass ratio by combining the wake model of the trailing edge of the cylinder chen and ji 2016 calculate lift and drag coefficients of vortex induced vibration it is found that the phase difference between the lift and the displacement shows a 180 jump in the middle of the lower branch before the phase jump the base component dominates in the lift while after that the third harmonic component dominates in the present study we artificially generate a periodic pulsating inflow and analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics and influencing factors of the rigid riser submerged in the periodic pulsating wake area under different conditions over the last decade the arrangement of tandem in line cylinders is the most investigated form of wake interaction to be found in past literature huera huarte and gharib 2011 huera huarte and bearman 2010 assi 2014 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 carmo 2009 even in early times zdravkovich 1977 has explored the effect of spacing settings between tandem cylinders on flow modes subsequently bearman 1984 discusses the vortex shedding from oscillating bluff bodies the main object is circle rockwell 1998 has given a comprehensive review of the vortex body interactions of downstream recently derakhshandeh and alam 2019 conduct a comprehensive review for the wakes of different cross sectional bluff bodies mainly focused on the dependence of the wake on reynolds number and bluff body shapes according to previous research most researches have been focused on the viv characteristics of the riser itself under uniform or shear flow and there are few studies on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the riser under non uniform periodic interference hence in this paper a periodic swinging bluff body is used to generate a non uniform periodic pulsating inflow in the upstream and then the influence of its wake on the downstream riser is further analyzed more concretely in this article the upstream periodic pulsating fluid is generated by periodic sinusoidal oscillation of a wing structure we will investigate the changes of wake field as well as vortex shedding distribution by changing the pulsating frequency and amplitude of the wing structure for the riser at different positions downstream we will analyze the change of transverse and longitudinal forces in different wake fields it is well known that the immersed boundary ib method has advantages when dealing with geometry with complex boundaries moving boundary and fsi wang et al 2017 2018 the computation of the entire flow field is performed in the cartesian grid instead of generating body fitted grid and it does not require dynamic mesh technology which greatly saved computing resources peskin 2002 hence in this paper direct numerical simulation is carried out using the high precision code incompact3d laizet and lamballais 2009 which is combined with ib method proposed by parnaudeau parnaudeau et al 2004 and high precision compact difference scheme deville et al 2002 2 governing equation and computational method 2 1 governing equations when the fluid is incompressible the fluid mass balance equation can be expressed as follows 1 u 0 the fluid momentum balance equation can be expressed as follows 2 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u f where u and p are the velocity and pressure field respectively f is the momentum forcing term imposed by the solid via ibm in order to ensure the no slip condition on the fluid solid interface gronskis and artana 2016 the non linear convection term first on right side of eq 2 is calculated in skewed symmetric form during numerical processing to reduce aliasing errors as much as possible and to improve the efficiency of spatially dispersed kinetic energy conservation used in the code kravchenko and moin 1997 the solution of the eq 1 and eq 2 will be discretized in a uniform cartesian grid due to the use of a high order compact finite difference scheme if the collocated grid is used the midpoint difference value will be used a lot and then the calculation cost will increase incompact3d uses two sets of grids in the physical space the speed grid and the pressure grid moves half a grid in each spatial direction to form a staggered grid almgren et al 1996 fortin et al 1971 george et al 2000 the initial condition is adopted as an unitary velocity field u x 1 u y 0 u z 0 and the inflow condition is u x 0 y z t 1 0 0 0 t the outflow condition x l x y z is analyzed by a simplified convection equation as follows 3 u t u conv u x 0 where u conv is the average convection velocity of the bulk flow in the outflow area calculated at each time step 2 2 numerical solution to solve eq 2 and eq 3 numerically we use the incompact3d code this code is based on the sixth order compact finite difference scheme for spatial discretization and the second order adams bashforth scheme is used in time advancement lele 1992 for the incompressibility of the navier stokes equation poisson s equation is an inevitable solution mercier and deville 1981 in order to save resources and achieve computer precision we use fast fourier transform fft to solve the equation completely in spectral space the governing equation after second order adams bashforth time discretization scheme can be written as follows 4 u m 1 u m δ t 3 2 f m 1 2 f m 1 p ˆ m f ˆ m 1 where δt is the time step f m is the convection and diffusion terms at time t m which is expressed as 5 f m u m u m 1 r e 2 u m the time advancement method requires to define intermediary velocities denoted as u and u these intermediary velocities are computed by the splitting method as follows chang et al 2002 kim and moin 1985 perot 1993 6 u u m δ t 3 2 f m 1 2 f m 1 p ˆ m f ˆ 7 u u δ t p ˆ m 8 u m 1 u δ t

field u 0 the target area is a cylinder riser applied to the target area solved by the forced ib method is using the following formula 10 u 0 r θ z t g r u d r θ z t where d is the diameter of the cylinder riser the g r function is an auxiliary function added here to prevent singularity at r 0 in a cylinder its form is composed of a sine function as follows 11 g r sin 2 π r 2 d 2 where r and θ are in the range of 0 r d 2 and 0 θ 2 π the target velocities at t m 1 can be written as follows 12 u 0 m 1 r θ z t g r u d r θ z t it should be noted that the target velocity field is artificially applied by us so we cannot determine whether the target velocity is divergence free but provides a new method to solve specific pressure equations parnaudeau et al 2008 kim et al 2001 namely 13 p ˆ m 1 1 ε u δ t 2 3 forces computation for forces computation the below process is used as same as gronskis and artana s research gronskis and artana 2016 a control volume method is used to calculate the lift and drag as shown in fig 1 a rectangular control volume cv is applied around the model and the momentum integration formula is applied to the composed system to solve the force coefficient the process is as follows the dimensionless form of the integral momentum equation can be written as follows 14 f s u m f 1 f 2 t c v u d v s 1 s 2 u u n d s where f 1 and f 2 represent the surface force of the target area surface s 1 on the fluid in the control volume area and the force of the external fluid on the fluid in the control area that is artificially applied n represents the outward unit vector perpendicular to the surface of the control volume the force f 2 applied to the control volume can be solved by integrating the pressure and viscous stress on its surface 15 f 2 s 2 p i 1 r e u u t n d s hence we can get the expression of f 1 through eq 14 and eq 15 16 f 1 t c v u d v s 1 s 2 u u n d s s 2 p i 1 r e u u t n d s where i is the identity matrix what we ultimately want is the force of the fluid on the target area f 1 then the final drag and lift force coefficient can be calculated by the following eq 17 and eq 18 17 c d f 1 n x 18 c l f 1 n y where n x and n y represents the unit vector of the force f 1 2 4 evaluation of the algorithm 2 4 1 single fixed cylinder re 100 300 1000 and 3900 in this section the computation of the flow around a single cylinder under the conditions of four different reynolds numbers is selected the results at re 300 are compared with previous studies to validate the numerical algorithm the computation region of the flow around a single cylinder is shown in fig 2 the size of the computational domain is controlled by lx ly lz x s and y s are x y coordinates of the center of the cylinder the diameter of the cylinder is d and the division of the mesh size is determined by n x n y n z the uniform velocity is set in the inlet convection equation is set in the outlet free slip condition is set in y direction and periodic condition is set in z direction table 1 lists the simulation parameters under different reynolds numbers fig 3 shows the vortices fields of numerical simulation of the flow around a single cylinder with re 100 300 1000 and 3900 for re 100 and 300 we can clearly observe the periodic vortex shedding and forming a more regularly arranged vortex in the flow field behind the cylinder and this is the classic vortex street it also can be seen that as the reynolds number increases the clear vortex structure gradually disappears and replaced by more irregular small vortex structures the comparison of lift and drag coefficient at re 300 between previous and present studies is listed in table 2 it can be concluded that present results are nearly consistent with that of previous studies 2 4 2 convergence analysis re 300 in order to define the mesh resolution a convergence analysis with a single fixed cylinder is performed with three different spatial resolutions table 3 reynolds numbers based on cylinder diameter are selected as re 300 the time step δt 2 5 10 3 and the setting of other boundary conditions is same as that of sec 2 4 1 the deviation of the forces coefficients between a simulation and its corresponding more refined simulation is around 1 thereby it was selected the intermediate resolution n x n y n z 361 217 48 in the following calculation 3 marine riser submitted to periodic pulsation disturbance 3 1 a single periodically oscillating wing structure 3 1 1 simulation parameters fig 4 shows the computational domain of a single wing structure in which the size of the calculation domain is set to lx ly lz 20d 12d 6d the wing structure boundary consists of a circular leading edge with a diameter d and a sharp trailing edge with a length of 3d the motion of wing structure boundary is described using the governing equation of α α 0 sin 2 π ω t where swing amplitude α 0 π 6 and oscillation frequency ω 0 1 the pivoting point located at the center line of the wing structure is set as x s 5d y s 6d so the boundary position of wing can be known at every time step then we can deal it using the described ib method in our paper at every time step the division of the mesh size is determined by n x n y n z 361 217 48 time step δt 0 0025 re 300 and the uniform velocity is set as inlet and the other setting of boundary conditions is same as that of sec 2 4 1 3 1 2 results analysis the simulation process for a periodically oscillating wing structure is divided into two parts firstly the wing structure remains fixed when the flow state in the entire computational domain is stabilized the wing structure begins periodically oscillating at a certain frequency and amplitude secondly the numerical simulation is going to continue till the entire computational result reaches a stable state again the variation of vortices fields with time is depicted in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a at the initial moment the separation point occurs at the leading edge of the wing structure and a very clear shear layer is formed at the trailing edge of the wing structure as time goes by as shown in fig 5 b flow field gradually reaches a stable state with periodic vortex shedding at the trailing edge of the wing structure and the vortex shedding frequency of the wing structure is 0 04 under this situation when the wing structure begins periodically oscillating with amplitude α 0 π 6 and flapping frequency ω 0 1 it can be observed from fig 5 c d that vortices distribution that is perpendicular to the flow direction becomes significantly larger and the intensity of the vortex also increases accordingly due to the swinging motion of the wing structure in this case the vortex shedding frequency of the wing structure is 0 1 which is equal to active flapping frequency ω 0 1 this indicates that the vortex shedding frequency of the wing structure will be controlled by the flapping motion although the vortex shedding frequency around the fixed wing structure is 0 04 shown in fig 5 b 3 2 a riser submitted to periodic pulsation disturbance in the previous section we have analyzed the flow field distribution of a periodically oscillating wing structure in this section the periodically oscillating wing structure is used here to generate a non uniform periodic pulsating inflow in the upstream and then the influence of its wake on the downstream riser is further analyzed what s more we will discuss the different impact of the factors on hydrodynamic characteristics of the rigid riser downstream 3 2 1 simulation parameters fig 6 shows the computational domain of the riser submitted to periodic pulsation disturbance the size of the computational domain grid scale boundary conditions and computational parameters is same as that of in sec 3 1 1 3 2 2 effect of in line positions in this section we will first discuss the effect of in line interval between the wing structure and rigid riser s d where transverse position of riser period and amplitude of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 4 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time at different spacing s d is depicted in fig 7 it can be seen that the time averaged results of riser s drag coefficient changes from the negative values to positive values as the in line interval increases when the in line interval is s d 5 the riser is mainly controlled by negative drag because the upstream wing structure will generate a backflow vortex and it will adhere to the leading edge of the downstream riser resulting in a decrease in the pressure as shown in fig 9 a more specifically table 5 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser at different in line positions the main frequency of lift coefficient f c l is obtained via the fast fourier transform as shown in fig 8 it is investigated that as spacing s d increases from 5 to 8 the time averaged drag coefficient c d increases from 0 066 to 0 465 significantly meanwhile as the in line spacing s d grows from 6 to 8 the lift coefficient amplitude a c l will decrease from 2 233 to 1 545 significantly this may due to shedding vortex of the wing structure in the y direction become more obvious with the increase of in line interval thereby weakening its impact on the downstream riser in addition the rms value of lift coefficient rms c l keeps up with the lift coefficient amplitude the maximum rms values of c l 1 379 is achieved at a small in line spacing s d of 6 and this result also reveals that with the decrease of in line interval the effect of pulsating flow generated by wing structure on lift coefficient of riser becomes more significant what s more we also notice that the ratio of main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 basically maintains 1 1 which indicates the downstream riser is obviously affected by the upstream periodically oscillating wing structure fig 9 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser it can be observed that there is an obvious interaction between the wing structure and the downstream riser when the horizontal spacing changes the shedding vortex of the wing structure directly acting on the rigid riser is also in different positions which is regarded as an important reason for the difference in hydrodynamic force of riser 3 2 3 effect of transverse positions in this section the influences of different positions in y direction of the riser on its hydrodynamic force will be investigated where in line spacing s d period and amplitude of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 6 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time at different transverse positions is depicted in fig 10 it can be observed from fig 10 that the drag coefficient of the riser c d at the relative positions of the upper and lower sides is very similar this indicates that the shedding vortex of periodically oscillating wing structure has the symmetrical distribution characteristic on the downstream so the drag of the riser at the corresponding symmetrical position is similar too in addition we also find that when the position of one side riser gradually moves away from the axis of symmetry such as 7d to 9d or 5d to 3d the drag force of the riser also decreases accordingly showing that the influence of pulsation disturbance on the riser becomes gradually weaker unlike the change of the drag coefficient it can be observed from fig 10 that the lift coefficient c l is symmetrically distributed with similar magnitudes and opposite directions furthermore as the riser gradually distances away from the central axis such as 7d to 9d or 5d to 3d the lift coefficient of the riser also decreases too more specifically table 7 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser at different transverse positions it is investigated that the maximum time averaged drag coefficient c d m a x of 0 559 is achieved at y s of 7d the maximum rms values of c l 0 803 is achieved at y s of 7d or 5d the main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 does not remain 1 1 which indicates the vortex shedding from the rigid riser indicated by the frequency of lift force is not locked by the oscillating wing under this situation especially the shedding period of rigid riser is extended at y s of 8d or 4d which vortex shedding frequency is smaller than 0 20 fig 11 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser the vortex shedding of wing structure and riser as well as the influence of upstream pulsating flow on the riser can be observed from it clearly this may be the main reason for the difference of hydrodynamic forces at different transverse positions of risers 3 2 4 effect of oscillation frequency in this section the influences of oscillation frequency on the downstream riser s hydrodynamic force will be investigated where in line spacing s d transverse positions of riser and amplitude of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 8 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time with different oscillation frequency is depicted in fig 12 it can be observed that the amplitude of the drag coefficient curve gradually decreases with the increase of swing frequency we also notice that the lift coefficient curve of the riser shows a clear local peak when the oscillating frequency of the upstream wing structure increases to a certain value such as period of oscillation 5 more specifically table 9 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser with different oscillation frequency it is investigated that when the oscillating period decreases from 12 5 to 5 time averaged drag coefficient c d becomes positive to negative and lift coefficient amplitude a c l shows a trend of increasing firstly and then decreasing the time averaged lift coefficient c l is near to zero for all cases in this situation moreover the maximum lift amplitude a c l m a x of 2 658 and the maximum rms value of lift coefficient of 1 629 occur at a fast oscillating frequency of 0 13 period of oscillation 7 5 fig 13 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser in the vortices fields can be identified that the rear cylinder is always inside the upstream wake moreover the downstream combined wake is not a regular von karman street since vortexes shed from the front oscillating wing structure disrupts and consequently modifies the vortex detachment from the rear cylinder 3 2 5 effect of swing amplitude in this section the influences of swing amplitude on the downstream riser s hydrodynamic force will be investigated where in line spacing s d transverse position of riser and period of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 10 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time with different swing amplitude is depicted in fig 14 it can be observed that when amplitude is small such as amplitude of oscillation π 18 or π 12 lift and drag coefficient seems to be a little confused and chaotic and as the swing amplitude of the wing structure increases they gradually develop a stable periodic in addition it can also be observed that lift coefficient amplitude a c l increases with the rising of swing amplitude from π 12 to π 4 more specifically table 11 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser at different swing amplitude it is investigated that as swing amplitude increases from π 12 to π 4 the lift coefficient amplitude a c l increases from 0 430 to 2 998 significantly in the above case we also notice that the maximum time averaged drag coefficient of 0 488 and the maximum rms value of lift coefficient of 2 998 occur at a large swing amplitude of π 4 and the main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 still basically maintains 1 1 for most cases in this situation which indicates the downstream riser is obviously affected by the upstream periodically oscillating wing structure fig 15 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser it can be observed that when the swing amplitude of the wing structure is small the shedding vortex of the riser will be more concentrated near the central axis as the swing amplitude increases the distribution range of the shedding vortex of the riser will increase accordingly furthermore the greater the swing amplitude of the wing structure is the more obvious the shedding vortex behind the riser forms 4 conclusions this paper numerically investigates the hydrodynamic forces and vortex distributions of a cylinder behind an upstream vibrating wing structure more concretely how the fluid forces of rigid riser are affected by the spacing and the pulsating flow in which the latter one is related to oscillating frequency and amplitude are discussed in detail the results show that there is great different behavior on the hydrodynamic performance of downstream riser between under the traditional ideal uniform inflow and pulsation disturbance flow in which the latter one generates vortex of wider diffusion range and larger size the most important results out of the simulations come as follows the time averaged drag coefficient of riser c d changes from the positive values to negative values with the decrease of in line spacing or the increase of oscillation frequency and transverse positions because in these cases more backflow vortex adhering to the leading edge of the downstream riser will be generated resulting in a drop in pressure and the drag force pointing toward upstream the time averaged lift coefficient of riser c l is generally insensitive to oscillation frequency and near to zero for all cases under different oscillation frequency however it shows a large shift when changing the transverse positions or the amplitude of the wing is larger than π 6 the main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 basically maintains 1 1 in almost all cases which indicates that the hydrodynamic characteristics of downstream riser are obviously affected by the upstream pulsating flow however when the transverse position is changing the ratio of main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency does not still remain 1 1 the maximum time averaged drag coefficient of riser c d m a x 0 559 is achieved at the oscillating period of 10 and amplitude of π 6 with x s 6d and y s 7d the maximum root mean square rms value of lift coefficient rms c l m a x 1 629 is achieved at the oscillating period of 7 5 and amplitude of π 6 with x s 6d and y s 6d credit authorship contribution statement wen quan wang supervision zhi feng yu

21029,in this paper the hydrodynamic forces and vortex distributions of a riser subjected to a non uniform flow generated by an upstream oscillating wing structure are simulated using high precision code incompact3d combined with immersed boundary method the effects of in line and transverse positions oscillating frequency and amplitude on riser performance have also been discussed it is found that with the increase of in line spacing or the decrease of oscillation frequency and transverse positions the time averaged drag coefficient of riser changes from the negative values to positive values the time averaged lift coefficient of riser is generally insensitive to oscillation frequency however it shows a large shift when changing the transverse positions or the amplitude of the wing is larger than π 6 moreover for various in line positions oscillating frequency and amplitude the vortex shedding of the rigid riser indicated by the main frequency of lift force is always locked by the oscillating wing however when the transverse position is changing the ratio of main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency does not still remain 1 1 more concretely the maximum time averaged drag coefficient and lift coefficient root mean square value of 0 559 and 1 629 is obtained in the simulation respectively keywords marine riser periodic disturbance direct numerical simulation immersed boundary method hydrodynamic characteristics 1 introduction in recent years with continuous exploitation and consumption of human beings terrestrial oil resources are gradually exhausted so human beings have to turn their attention to the development of offshore oil and gas development as an important link between offshore platforms and subsea production systems marine riser has been one of the hot research area for scholars from all over the world hong and shah 2018 the main problem involves marine riser that submitted to sea current is the fluid structure interaction fsi for nonlinear characteristics at present such nonlinear interaction phenomenon is mainly manifested on flow induced vibration fiv that can be divided into two types vortex induced vibration viv and wake induced vibration wiv viv phenomenon is defined as the solid moving motion of marine riser that caused by a variation of lift and drag forces induced by the periodic vortex shedding when current flow through the riser williamson and govardhan 2004 meanwhile wiv phenomenon is associated closely with the oscillation of a body that immersed in the wake interference region behind a bluff body assi et al 2010 viv and wiv can both be derived from the oscillation of marine riser array submitted to sea current which will eventually reach high amplitude the presence of fluid forces could lead to self excited oscillations of risers and even structure failures when restitute forces and damping forces of structures absolutely can t control them especially under certain extreme conditions it is noteworthy that such fluid elastic instabilities phenomenon of marine riser arrays that submitted to sea currents cross flow results in financial losses worldwide is estimated at 1000 m over one decade païdoussis 2006 the vortex induced vibration characteristic of marine riser is a classical fluid structure interaction fsi problem and its early research focuses on the response of a single riser in completely uniform flow in recent years the influence of interaction flow field on vortex induced vibration of two adjacent cylinders has caused some concerns for tandem configuration arrangement of two cylinders in flow direction assi et al 2010 find that unstable wake of the upstream cylinder can provide energy for the self excited vibration of the downstream cylinder thus increasing its transverse amplitude griffith et al 2017 evidence that when the natural frequency of two cylinders is the same as the vortex shedding frequency of a single cylinder two cylinders will produce quasi periodic and chaotic oscillations for side by side configuration arrangement of two cylinder in vertical flow direction liu and jaiman 2018 study the three dimensional effect of vortex induced vibration in a parallel double cylinder system the results show that the saddle point with high local strain rate is formed outside the frequency locking stage and a large number of three dimensional vortex structures are observed in the flow field for the staggered configuration the center line of two cylinders is at a certain angle of attack with the flow direction hu and zhou 2008 study the wake flow of a staggered double cylinder at reynolds number of 300 and divides the flow patterns into three single vortex street patterns and two double vortex street patterns however studies above are concentrated on the viv of one or more structures in ideal uniform flow but fail to consider the interference of non uniform periodic pulsating fluid such as periodic wave load in complex marine environment if the platform encounters severe waves and currents the riser will produce large amplitude and high frequency vibration which will disturb the flow field distribution around the riser structure and affect the vortex induced vibration response of the structure to a certain extent the completely uniform flow is very rare in nature and the fluids in ocean engineering mostly appear in the form of complex non uniform flows such as shear flow and oscillation flow lin and wang 2013 present the three dimensional governing equations on vortex induced vibration of marine riser at sheared flow the in line force is solved by morison equation while cross flow force is solved by wake oscillator model the governing equations are solved by newmark β method in time domain and the multi mode excitation of riser pipeline in linearly sheared flow is obtained chaplin et al 2005 use physical measurements at the vortex induced vibrations of a model vertical tension riser in a stepped current and find that drag coefficients are up to 120 greater than those for a stationary cylinder at the same reynolds numbers trim et al 2005 experimentally investigate the vortex induced vibration of long marine risers under uniform and linearly sheared currents and find that in line fatigue damage due to viv is as severe as cross flow fatigue damage huang et al 2007 conduct a numerical simulation of an elastically supported cylinder in 2 d planar shear flow they simulate the vortex induced vibrations of a cylinder with reynolds numbers ranging from 2000 to 5000 and shear rates ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 it is found that the shear rate lock in range soars rapidly as the reynolds number increases and the vibrating trace resembles a raindrop within the shear rate lock in range based on the in line forced oscillation test data of a rigid cylinder wang et al 2013 study the effect of velocity distribution under shear flow on fatigue damage of riser luo and zhu 2015 carry out a 3 d viv simulation for a 9 63m marine riser in linearly sheared flow the riser shows unsymmetrical bending deformation phenomenon its viv dominant mode number changes between 1 and 2 finally the riser viv dominant mode number keeps in 2 tu et al 2015 study the vortex induced vibration of tandem cylinders under shear flow the results show that as shear ratio increases the lock in region of both cylinders in the in line and cross flow direction broadens while the influence of the shear ratio on the in line oscillation amplitude is insignificant in the actual oil and gas exploitation the combined actions of wind waves and currents may cause the offshore platform to pulsation periodically and then the relative pulsation flow is generated between risers connected to the platform and the seawater deng et al 2018 zhao 2013 numerically simulated the vortex induced vibration of a 2 d cylinder in the oscillatory flow and found that the vibration frequency of the cylinder is closely related to the keulegan carpenter kc numbers and the reduced velocity zhao et al 2013 study the vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder with oscillatory and steady flow at different flow ratio it is found that the combination of oscillatory flow and steady flow broadens the vibration lock in regime of the cylinder and the maximum value is twice as much as that under single oscillatory flow or steady flow an et al 2015 study the rigid cylinder in oscillating flow with the same re and kc numbers and investigate the feasibility of a 2 d model for simulating a 3 d flow in terms of fundamental flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces yuan et al 2018 propose an alternative time domain force decomposition model for flexible risers to predict viv response under both steady and oscillatory flows ren et al 2019 carry out an experimental study on a flexible pipe with helical strakes in oscillatory flow compared with the bare tube it is found that the helical strakes can significantly improve the dominant frequency of the vortex induced vibration of the cylinder fan et al 2020 experimentally investigate the flow induced vibration of flexible multi cylinders in atmospheric boundary layer and further explain the mechanism of severe vibration by analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics for hydrodynamic forces firstly many achievements have been made in the identification of hydrodynamic coefficients of rigid cylindrical structures most of them pay attention to the fluid forces of vortex induced vibration in cross flow and the relationship between hydrodynamic coefficient and structural response bishop and hassan 1964 carry out the forced oscillation experiment of rigid cylinders in cross flow they measure lift time varying drag and average drag and further study the variation of lift and average drag with reynolds number gopalkrishnan 1993 measures the fluid forces of a rigid cylinder in cross flow forced oscillation and decomposes the fluid forces into lift force and added mass force it is found that when the lift coefficient is positive the cylinder absorbs energy from the fluid on the contrary the structure dissipates energy through the fluid moreover the lift coefficient is closely related to the response frequency and displacement while the added mass coefficient has a strong correlation with the response frequency and a weak correlation with the response displacement sun et al 2010 carry out a 2 d numerical simulation of viv of riser based on the dynamic mesh method and higher harmonics is found at the lower branch of lift force which is the main cause of the conversion of cylinder response from the upper branch to the lower branch secondly the influence of added mass coefficient on vortex induced vibration of cylindrical structure has also been focused by some scholars vikestad et al 2000 experimentally study the relationship between the added mass coefficient and the response frequency it is found that the added mass for the freely vibrating cylinder agreed well with the results found by others in driven cylinder tests the added mass coefficient varies between different cycles in free vortex induced vibration while it changes a little in the lock in zone and the variation trend of added mass coefficient versus time is the same as that of response frequency branković and bearman 2006 measure the fluid forces of a rigid cylinder in transverse free vibration by experiment and find that the added mass coefficient decreases with the increase of reduced velocity in the lock in zone lately some scholars have studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of two degree of freedom rigid cylindrical vortex excited vibration by numerical method focusing on the relationship between hydrodynamic coefficient and structural response displacement dong et al 2012 investigate the relationship between lift coefficient and vortex induced vibration displacement using discrete vortex method dvm it is found that in the initial and upper branches the lift coefficient and the vibration displacement have the same period and phase in the lower branch the lift coefficient and the vibration displacement have the same period with 180 phase delay tang et al 2013 study the characteristics of lift and drag coefficients of two degree of freedom viv for a rigid circular cylinder under high reynolds number re 2 5 104 2 5 105 with dynamic mesh method the results show that the variation of lift and drag coefficients with reduction speed is the same as that of single degree of freedom rigid cylinder both of which increase first and then decrease deng 2014 numerically simulate the vortex excited vibration of a two degree of freedom rigid cylindrical and studies the relationship between the lift and the vibration displacement with different mass ratio by combining the wake model of the trailing edge of the cylinder chen and ji 2016 calculate lift and drag coefficients of vortex induced vibration it is found that the phase difference between the lift and the displacement shows a 180 jump in the middle of the lower branch before the phase jump the base component dominates in the lift while after that the third harmonic component dominates in the present study we artificially generate a periodic pulsating inflow and analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics and influencing factors of the rigid riser submerged in the periodic pulsating wake area under different conditions over the last decade the arrangement of tandem in line cylinders is the most investigated form of wake interaction to be found in past literature huera huarte and gharib 2011 huera huarte and bearman 2010 assi 2014 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 carmo 2009 even in early times zdravkovich 1977 has explored the effect of spacing settings between tandem cylinders on flow modes subsequently bearman 1984 discusses the vortex shedding from oscillating bluff bodies the main object is circle rockwell 1998 has given a comprehensive review of the vortex body interactions of downstream recently derakhshandeh and alam 2019 conduct a comprehensive review for the wakes of different cross sectional bluff bodies mainly focused on the dependence of the wake on reynolds number and bluff body shapes according to previous research most researches have been focused on the viv characteristics of the riser itself under uniform or shear flow and there are few studies on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the riser under non uniform periodic interference hence in this paper a periodic swinging bluff body is used to generate a non uniform periodic pulsating inflow in the upstream and then the influence of its wake on the downstream riser is further analyzed more concretely in this article the upstream periodic pulsating fluid is generated by periodic sinusoidal oscillation of a wing structure we will investigate the changes of wake field as well as vortex shedding distribution by changing the pulsating frequency and amplitude of the wing structure for the riser at different positions downstream we will analyze the change of transverse and longitudinal forces in different wake fields it is well known that the immersed boundary ib method has advantages when dealing with geometry with complex boundaries moving boundary and fsi wang et al 2017 2018 the computation of the entire flow field is performed in the cartesian grid instead of generating body fitted grid and it does not require dynamic mesh technology which greatly saved computing resources peskin 2002 hence in this paper direct numerical simulation is carried out using the high precision code incompact3d laizet and lamballais 2009 which is combined with ib method proposed by parnaudeau parnaudeau et al 2004 and high precision compact difference scheme deville et al 2002 2 governing equation and computational method 2 1 governing equations when the fluid is incompressible the fluid mass balance equation can be expressed as follows 1 u 0 the fluid momentum balance equation can be expressed as follows 2 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u f where u and p are the velocity and pressure field respectively f is the momentum forcing term imposed by the solid via ibm in order to ensure the no slip condition on the fluid solid interface gronskis and artana 2016 the non linear convection term first on right side of eq 2 is calculated in skewed symmetric form during numerical processing to reduce aliasing errors as much as possible and to improve the efficiency of spatially dispersed kinetic energy conservation used in the code kravchenko and moin 1997 the solution of the eq 1 and eq 2 will be discretized in a uniform cartesian grid due to the use of a high order compact finite difference scheme if the collocated grid is used the midpoint difference value will be used a lot and then the calculation cost will increase incompact3d uses two sets of grids in the physical space the speed grid and the pressure grid moves half a grid in each spatial direction to form a staggered grid almgren et al 1996 fortin et al 1971 george et al 2000 the initial condition is adopted as an unitary velocity field u x 1 u y 0 u z 0 and the inflow condition is u x 0 y z t 1 0 0 0 t the outflow condition x l x y z is analyzed by a simplified convection equation as follows 3 u t u conv u x 0 where u conv is the average convection velocity of the bulk flow in the outflow area calculated at each time step 2 2 numerical solution to solve eq 2 and eq 3 numerically we use the incompact3d code this code is based on the sixth order compact finite difference scheme for spatial discretization and the second order adams bashforth scheme is used in time advancement lele 1992 for the incompressibility of the navier stokes equation poisson s equation is an inevitable solution mercier and deville 1981 in order to save resources and achieve computer precision we use fast fourier transform fft to solve the equation completely in spectral space the governing equation after second order adams bashforth time discretization scheme can be written as follows 4 u m 1 u m δ t 3 2 f m 1 2 f m 1 p ˆ m f ˆ m 1 where δt is the time step f m is the convection and diffusion terms at time t m which is expressed as 5 f m u m u m 1 r e 2 u m the time advancement method requires to define intermediary velocities denoted as u and u these intermediary velocities are computed by the splitting method as follows chang et al 2002 kim and moin 1985 perot 1993 6 u u m δ t 3 2 f m 1 2 f m 1 p ˆ m f ˆ 7 u u δ t p ˆ m 8 u m 1 u δ t

field u 0 the target area is a cylinder riser applied to the target area solved by the forced ib method is using the following formula 10 u 0 r θ z t g r u d r θ z t where d is the diameter of the cylinder riser the g r function is an auxiliary function added here to prevent singularity at r 0 in a cylinder its form is composed of a sine function as follows 11 g r sin 2 π r 2 d 2 where r and θ are in the range of 0 r d 2 and 0 θ 2 π the target velocities at t m 1 can be written as follows 12 u 0 m 1 r θ z t g r u d r θ z t it should be noted that the target velocity field is artificially applied by us so we cannot determine whether the target velocity is divergence free but provides a new method to solve specific pressure equations parnaudeau et al 2008 kim et al 2001 namely 13 p ˆ m 1 1 ε u δ t 2 3 forces computation for forces computation the below process is used as same as gronskis and artana s research gronskis and artana 2016 a control volume method is used to calculate the lift and drag as shown in fig 1 a rectangular control volume cv is applied around the model and the momentum integration formula is applied to the composed system to solve the force coefficient the process is as follows the dimensionless form of the integral momentum equation can be written as follows 14 f s u m f 1 f 2 t c v u d v s 1 s 2 u u n d s where f 1 and f 2 represent the surface force of the target area surface s 1 on the fluid in the control volume area and the force of the external fluid on the fluid in the control area that is artificially applied n represents the outward unit vector perpendicular to the surface of the control volume the force f 2 applied to the control volume can be solved by integrating the pressure and viscous stress on its surface 15 f 2 s 2 p i 1 r e u

force of the fluid on the target area f 1 then the final drag and lift force coefficient can be calculated by the following eq 17 and eq 18 17 c d f 1 n x 18 c l f 1 n y where n x and n y represents the unit vector of the force f 1 2 4 evaluation of the algorithm 2 4 1 single fixed cylinder re 100 300 1000 and 3900 in this section the computation of the flow around a single cylinder under the conditions of four different reynolds numbers is selected the results at re 300 are compared with previous studies to validate the numerical algorithm the computation region of the flow around a single cylinder is shown in fig 2 the size of the computational domain is controlled by lx ly lz x s and y s are x y coordinates of the center of the cylinder the diameter of the cylinder is d and the division of the mesh size is determined by n x n y n z the uniform velocity is set in the inlet convection equation is set in the outlet free slip condition is set in y direction and periodic condition is set in z direction table 1 lists the simulation parameters under different reynolds numbers fig 3 shows the vortices fields of numerical simulation of the flow around a single cylinder with re 100 300 1000 and 3900 for re 100 and 300 we can clearly observe the periodic vortex shedding and forming a more regularly arranged vortex in the flow field behind the cylinder and this is the classic vortex street it also can be seen that as the reynolds number increases the clear vortex structure gradually disappears and replaced by more irregular small vortex structures the comparison of lift and drag coefficient at re 300 between previous and present studies is listed in table 2 it can be concluded that present results are nearly consistent with that of previous studies 2 4 2 convergence analysis re 300 in order to define the mesh resolution a convergence analysis with a single fixed cylinder is performed with three different spatial resolutions table 3 reynolds numbers based on cylinder diameter are selected as re 300 the time step δt 2 5 10 3 and the setting of other boundary conditions is same as that of sec 2 4 1 the deviation of the forces coefficients between a simulation and its corresponding more refined simulation is around 1 thereby it was selected the intermediate resolution n x n y n z 361 217 48 in the following calculation 3 marine riser submitted to periodic pulsation disturbance 3 1 a single periodically oscillating wing structure 3 1 1 simulation parameters fig 4 shows the computational domain of a single wing structure in which the size of the calculation domain is set to lx ly lz 20d 12d 6d the wing structure boundary consists of a circular leading edge with a diameter d and a sharp trailing edge with a length of 3d the motion of wing structure boundary is described using the governing equation of α α 0 sin 2 π ω t where swing amplitude α 0 π 6 and oscillation frequency ω 0 1 the pivoting point located at the center line of the wing structure is set as x s 5d y s 6d so the boundary position of wing can be known at every time step then we can deal it using the described ib method in our paper at every time step the division of the mesh size is determined by n x n y n z 361 217 48 time step δt 0 0025 re 300 and the uniform velocity is set as inlet and the other setting of boundary conditions is same as that of sec 2 4 1 3 1 2 results analysis the simulation process for a periodically oscillating wing structure is divided into two parts firstly the wing structure remains fixed when the flow state in the entire computational domain is stabilized the wing structure begins periodically oscillating at a certain frequency and amplitude secondly the numerical simulation is going to continue till the entire computational result reaches a stable state again the variation of vortices fields with time is depicted in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a at the initial moment the separation point occurs at the leading edge of the wing structure and a very clear shear layer is formed at the trailing edge of the wing structure as time goes by as shown in fig 5 b flow field gradually reaches a stable state with periodic vortex shedding at the trailing edge of the wing structure and the vortex shedding frequency of the wing structure is 0 04 under this situation when the wing structure begins periodically oscillating with amplitude α 0 π 6 and flapping frequency ω 0 1 it can be observed from fig 5 c d that vortices distribution that is perpendicular to the flow direction becomes significantly larger and the intensity of the vortex also increases accordingly due to the swinging motion of the wing structure in this case the vortex shedding frequency of the wing structure is 0 1 which is equal to active flapping frequency ω 0 1 this indicates that the vortex shedding frequency of the wing structure will be controlled by the flapping motion although the vortex shedding frequency around the fixed wing structure is 0 04 shown in fig 5 b 3 2 a riser submitted to periodic pulsation disturbance in the previous section we have analyzed the flow field distribution of a periodically oscillating wing structure in this section the periodically oscillating wing structure is used here to generate a non uniform periodic pulsating inflow in the upstream and then the influence of its wake on the downstream riser is further analyzed what s more we will discuss the different impact of the factors on hydrodynamic characteristics of the rigid riser downstream 3 2 1 simulation parameters fig 6 shows the computational domain of the riser submitted to periodic pulsation disturbance the size of the computational domain grid scale boundary conditions and computational parameters is same as that of in sec 3 1 1 3 2 2 effect of in line positions in this section we will first discuss the effect of in line interval between the wing structure and rigid riser s d where transverse position of riser period and amplitude of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 4 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time at different spacing s d is depicted in fig 7 it can be seen that the time averaged results of riser s drag coefficient changes from the negative values to positive values as the in line interval increases when the in line interval is s d 5 the riser is mainly controlled by negative drag because the upstream wing structure will generate a backflow vortex and it will adhere to the leading edge of the downstream riser resulting in a decrease in the pressure as shown in fig 9 a more specifically table 5 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser at different in line positions the main frequency of lift coefficient f c l is obtained via the fast fourier transform as shown in fig 8 it is investigated that as spacing s d increases from 5 to 8 the time averaged drag coefficient c d increases from 0 066 to 0 465 significantly meanwhile as the in line spacing s d grows from 6 to 8 the lift coefficient amplitude a c l will decrease from 2 233 to 1 545 significantly this may due to shedding vortex of the wing structure in the y direction become more obvious with the increase of in line interval thereby weakening its impact on the downstream riser in addition the rms value of lift coefficient rms c l keeps up with the lift coefficient amplitude the maximum rms values of c l 1 379 is achieved at a small in line spacing s d of 6 and this result also reveals that with the decrease of in line interval the effect of pulsating flow generated by wing structure on lift coefficient of riser becomes more significant what s more we also notice that the ratio of main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 basically maintains 1 1 which indicates the downstream riser is obviously affected by the upstream periodically oscillating wing structure fig 9 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser it can be observed that there is an obvious interaction between the wing structure and the downstream riser when the horizontal spacing changes the shedding vortex of the wing structure directly acting on the rigid riser is also in different positions which is regarded as an important reason for the difference in hydrodynamic force of riser 3 2 3 effect of transverse positions in this section the influences of different positions in y direction of the riser on its hydrodynamic force will be investigated where in line spacing s d period and amplitude of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 6 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time at different transverse positions is depicted in fig 10 it can be observed from fig 10 that the drag coefficient of the riser c d at the relative positions of the upper and lower sides is very similar this indicates that the shedding vortex of periodically oscillating wing structure has the symmetrical distribution characteristic on the downstream so the drag of the riser at the corresponding symmetrical position is similar too in addition we also find that when the position of one side riser gradually moves away from the axis of symmetry such as 7d to 9d or 5d to 3d the drag force of the riser also decreases accordingly showing that the influence of pulsation disturbance on the riser becomes gradually weaker unlike the change of the drag coefficient it can be observed from fig 10 that the lift coefficient c l is symmetrically distributed with similar magnitudes and opposite directions furthermore as the riser gradually distances away from the central axis such as 7d to 9d or 5d to 3d the lift coefficient of the riser also decreases too more specifically table 7 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser at different transverse positions it is investigated that the maximum time averaged drag coefficient c d m a x of 0 559 is achieved at y s of 7d the maximum rms values of c l 0 803 is achieved at y s of 7d or 5d the main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 does not remain 1 1 which indicates the vortex shedding from the rigid riser indicated by the frequency of lift force is not locked by the oscillating wing under this situation especially the shedding period of rigid riser is extended at y s of 8d or 4d which vortex shedding frequency is smaller than 0 20 fig 11 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser the vortex shedding of wing structure and riser as well as the influence of upstream pulsating flow on the riser can be observed from it clearly this may be the main reason for the difference of hydrodynamic forces at different transverse positions of risers 3 2 4 effect of oscillation frequency in this section the influences of oscillation frequency on the downstream riser s hydrodynamic force will be investigated where in line spacing s d transverse positions of riser and amplitude of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 8 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time with different oscillation frequency is depicted in fig 12 it can be observed that the amplitude of the drag coefficient curve gradually decreases with the increase of swing frequency we also notice that the lift coefficient curve of the riser shows a clear local peak when the oscillating frequency of the upstream wing structure increases to a certain value such as period of oscillation 5 more specifically table 9 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser with different oscillation frequency it is investigated that when the oscillating period decreases from 12 5 to 5 time averaged drag coefficient c d becomes positive to negative and lift coefficient amplitude a c l shows a trend of increasing firstly and then decreasing the time averaged lift coefficient c l is near to zero for all cases in this situation moreover the maximum lift amplitude a c l m a x of 2 658 and the maximum rms value of lift coefficient of 1 629 occur at a fast oscillating frequency of 0 13 period of oscillation 7 5 fig 13 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser in the vortices fields can be identified that the rear cylinder is always inside the upstream wake moreover the downstream combined wake is not a regular von karman street since vortexes shed from the front oscillating wing structure disrupts and consequently modifies the vortex detachment from the rear cylinder 3 2 5 effect of swing amplitude in this section the influences of swing amplitude on the downstream riser s hydrodynamic force will be investigated where in line spacing s d transverse position of riser and period of wing oscillation keeps constant the detail of parameter setting for numerical simulation is listed in table 10 the lift and drag coefficient of the riser versus time with different swing amplitude is depicted in fig 14 it can be observed that when amplitude is small such as amplitude of oscillation π 18 or π 12 lift and drag coefficient seems to be a little confused and chaotic and as the swing amplitude of the wing structure increases they gradually develop a stable periodic in addition it can also be observed that lift coefficient amplitude a c l increases with the rising of swing amplitude from π 12 to π 4 more specifically table 11 displays the time averaged drag coefficient c d the time averaged lift coefficient c l lift coefficient amplitude a c l the rms values of lift coefficient rms c l and the relation between main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 of the riser at different swing amplitude it is investigated that as swing amplitude increases from π 12 to π 4 the lift coefficient amplitude a c l increases from 0 430 to 2 998 significantly in the above case we also notice that the maximum time averaged drag coefficient of 0 488 and the maximum rms value of lift coefficient of 2 998 occur at a large swing amplitude of π 4 and the main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 still basically maintains 1 1 for most cases in this situation which indicates the downstream riser is obviously affected by the upstream periodically oscillating wing structure fig 15 shows the vortex distribution between the wing structure and riser it can be observed that when the swing amplitude of the wing structure is small the shedding vortex of the riser will be more concentrated near the central axis as the swing amplitude increases the distribution range of the shedding vortex of the riser will increase accordingly furthermore the greater the swing amplitude of the wing structure is the more obvious the shedding vortex behind the riser forms 4 conclusions this paper numerically investigates the hydrodynamic forces and vortex distributions of a cylinder behind an upstream vibrating wing structure more concretely how the fluid forces of rigid riser are affected by the spacing and the pulsating flow in which the latter one is related to oscillating frequency and amplitude are discussed in detail the results show that there is great different behavior on the hydrodynamic performance of downstream riser between under the traditional ideal uniform inflow and pulsation disturbance flow in which the latter one generates vortex of wider diffusion range and larger size the most important results out of the simulations come as follows the time averaged drag coefficient of riser c d changes from the positive values to negative values with the decrease of in line spacing or the increase of oscillation frequency and transverse positions because in these cases more backflow vortex adhering to the leading edge of the downstream riser will be generated resulting in a drop in pressure and the drag force pointing toward upstream the time averaged lift coefficient of riser c l is generally insensitive to oscillation frequency and near to zero for all cases under different oscillation frequency however it shows a large shift when changing the transverse positions or the amplitude of the wing is larger than π 6 the main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency f c l f 0 basically maintains 1 1 in almost all cases which indicates that the hydrodynamic characteristics of downstream riser are obviously affected by the upstream pulsating flow however when the transverse position is changing the ratio of main frequency of lift coefficient to the swing frequency does not still remain 1 1 the maximum time averaged drag coefficient of riser c d m a x 0 559 is achieved at the oscillating period of 10 and amplitude of π 6 with x s 6d and y s 7d the maximum root mean square rms value of lift coefficient rms c l m a x 1 629 is achieved at the oscillating period of 7 5 and amplitude of π 6 with x s 6d and y s 6d credit authorship contribution statement wen quan wang supervision zhi feng yu
