16155,small water resource recovery facilities wrrfs serving communities with populations of less than 10 000 people account for 70 of centralized wastewater treatment systems in the united states with growing interest globally in improving the sustainability of these systems this study evaluated the environmental life cycle impact and land use tradeoffs of different lagoon and mechanical wrrfs across the diverse climate of nebraska life cycle inventory including construction and operations was collected for 35 existing systems representing a range of commonly used mechanical wrrfs oxidation ditch extended aeration and sequencing batch reactors and lagoon treatment systems complete retention irrigation and controlled discharge lagoons lagoons exhibit a significantly smaller environmental impact relative to mechanical wrrfs in all impact categories with exception of the smog category based on a 20 year design lifespan provided land is available for use in contrast on site land use of lagoons was significantly higher than mechanical wrrfs 73 7 35 9 m2 capita and 2 4 1 9 m2 capita respectively lagoons on average exhibited significantly more impact associated with the construction phase in most impact categories up to 80 in case of smog impacts relative to mechanical wrrfs 25 the differences in contribution of the construction leads to the environmental impacts and comparisons between the technologies being sensitive to system lifespan and type of electric grid mix irrigation lagoon per capita excavation and cast iron resource use was observed to decrease with increasing differences between evaporation and precipitation rates uncertainty of the environmental impacts within sites is primarily driven by variations in energy intensity within mechanical wrrfs and volumes of treated water within lagoons variability between facilities of similar technology groups is largely driven by a combination of site specific factors including climate design and operations graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction wastewater treatment has served as a safeguard in protecting public health and local ecosystems for well over century treatment technologies have evolved to meet the objectives of new water quality standards lofrano and brown 2010 and have adopted operations to screen materials and grit preliminary treatment remove heavier solids primary treatment biologically convert organic waste materials secondary treatment disinfect and filter water tertiary treatment and process biosolids metcalf and eddy 2014 these systems can carry a significant environmental burden associated with their material and energy inputs as well as output soil water and air emissions corominas et al 2013 small water resource recovery facilities wrrfs are defined as serving communities with populations of less than 10 000 people or treating less than 3785 m3 day and account for approximately 70 of centralized wastewater treatment systems in the united states epa 2008 many small community water resource recovery facilities are facing increased regulatory water quality standards and aging infrastructure requiring replacement or renovation in the coming decades moussavi et al 2020 environmental impact considerations are of growing relevance globally in the water wastewater sector as also observed in the energy agriculture and manufacturing sectors bardouille and koubsky 2000 labuschagne et al 2005 ngarava et al 2019 the 2021 infrastructure funding bill recently passed by the u s congress allocated 55 billion dollars for upgrading water infrastructure and included funding specifically for sustainability and resilience improvements in small communities congress 2021 to help community leaders make more informed decisions regarding the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment technology they are adopting information on the environmental life cycle impact tradeoffs of different technologies for small communities is needed with fewer human and financial resources relative to larger communities there is a need for information on these environmental tradeoffs that design engineers can use in communicating with community leaders in decision making to ensure that future systems are more sustainable landis 2015 environmental life cycle assessment lca is a widely used tool for quantifying the environmental impact of products and services the field has developed to integrate the spatial dimension as reviewed by patouillard et al 2018 coupling the analysis with economic studies frança et al 2021 and improvements in handling uncertainties igos et al 2018 application of lca for assessment of wastewater treatment systems has developed significantly since the 1990s and refinement in defining goals and scope collection of life cycle inventory application of different impact assessment methods and interpretation of results corominas et al 2013 beyond exploration of different functional units and system boundaries studies have further refined the context of its application collection of more detailed inventory data included sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and methods in which lca can be integrated with life cycle cost analysis lcca and or techno economic assessment tea corominas et al 2020 assessing small systems is often constrained due to limited data availability e g water quality energy use construction data and is further compounded by the often limited human resources available in small communities to collect and retain such information moussavi et al 2021 thompson et al 2020 1 1 small community wastewater treatment technologies various wastewater treatment technologies are employed within small communities however two widely adopted technology groups for small communities include a mechanical wrrfs also known as activated sludge systems and b lagoons also known as pond treatment systems matamoros et al 2016 1 1 1 mechanical wrrfs activated sludge as processes are the most widely used means of biological wastewater treatment in the world gernaey and sin 2013 the process acts as a biological reactor by initially providing aeration to wastewater in a tank allowing bacteria to convert organic waste to additional biomass biomass or activated sludge is separated from the effluent water in a clarifier and returned to the aeration basin to maintain effective biomass concentration some of the most common systems being employed by these communities include extended aeration ea oxidation ditch od and sequencing batch reactor sbr however other types that may be encountered include membrane biological reactors mbr rotating biological contactor rbc trickling filters tfs and upflow anaerobic blanket reactor uasb molinos senante et al 2014 liu et al 2003 each of the technologies comes with tradeoffs regarding operability maintenance space energy requirements capacity for handling shock loads capacity for future expansion and other performance characteristics metcalf and eddy 2014 these systems are all characteristic of having large typically concrete basins by which some form of energy intensive aeration i e diffused or mechanical aeration is supplied and relatively short hydraulic retention times 8 24 h are observed furthermore many of the systems will utilize similar preliminary treatment and disinfection operations there is often auxiliary infrastructure required to support these operations as in the case of a building that houses aeration blowers pumps and controls thompson et al 2020 1 1 2 lagoons waste stabilization pond treatment systems also known as lagoons are another common type of biological wastewater treatment systems for small communities as they account for more than 50 of the wastewater treatment facilities in the u s us epa 2016 many different types of lagoons exist and may carry variations in terminology common types include controlled discharge cd lagoons anaerobic lagoons aerobic stabilization ponds irrigation lagoons irrig complete retention cr lagoons and mechanically aerated oxidation ponds gloyna 1971 the mechanisms for treatment of wastewater are similar to that of as process where bacteria are used for metabolizing organic waste however lagoons typically occupy a large land footprint area have long detention times 5 180 days and utilize the natural convention of wind to provide oxygen to the water abdul et al 2011 furthermore many lagoons facilitate the growth of algae that help assimilate nitrogen and phosphorous that in turn oxygenate the lagoon while lagoons have been used for centuries for storage and treatment of wastewater specific design criteria related to volumetric requirements organic loading rates and detention periods have developed only within the last 70 years fitzgerald and rohlich 1958 complete retention lagoons and irrigation lagoons that use treated water for land application of cropland are two technologies that are being adopted more regularly to avoid water emissions and limitations these systems can face in maintaining high water quality the energy use of lagoons can be relatively minimal as they have primarily influent pumping and screening for operating equipment 1 2 environmental lca comparison of technologies literature assessing the environmental lca of small lagoon treatment systems for treatment of municipal wastewater and comparison to mechanical wrrfs is limited to a handful of case studies in a study by garfí et al 2017 mechanical wrrfs constructed wetlands and high rate algal ponds were compared and it was found that mechanical wrrfs exhibited between 2 and 5 times the environmental impact of more natural based systems another study comparing constructed wetlands and extended aeration highlighted the high upfront construction impact of the nature based system and the high energy use associated with the mechanical wrrfs lopsik 2013 in agreement with these studies a study that compared vegetated land treatment constructed wetlands and mechanical wrrfs found that these natural systems are more environmentally friendly yildirium and topkaya 2012 a study by muga and mihelcic 2008 highlighted variability in operational cost and energy tradeoffs between mechanical wrrfs lagoons and land treatment systems but lacked consideration of built infrastructure and direct emissions despite past lca comparisons of natural based systems and mechanical wrrfs comparisons of different types of lagoons are lacking from the literature godin et al 2012 furthermore case studies of the life cycle impact of agricultural water reuse lagoons will be referred to as irrigation lagoons are absent meriting further investigation lastly small systems can often exhibit a range of energy intensities variations in population changes and whose design can be influenced by climate factors that merit an investigation with a larger sample of systems while also considering uncertainty in the data given the lack of literature assessing different small community wastewater treatment systems the goal of this research is to evaluate the environmental life cycle impact and land use tradeoffs of lagoons and mechanical wrrfs the findings of the study can help provide key stakeholders information that could aid in treatment process selection further the methodology could be used as a tool for engineers to aid in technology selection and improved sustainable design of wastewater treatment systems 2 methodology 2 1 case study selection selection of the 35 small wastewater treatment systems for both mechanical wrrf and lagoon case studies aimed for inclusion of different technology sub groups various design flowrates different percent design capacities pdc i e ratio of average flowrate to design flowrate and representative energy intensities ei i e energy use per unit flow treated furthermore lagoons selection was made to include systems in diverse evaporation and precipitation rates exhibited across the state of nebraska while the sample size was not large enough to measure the statistical effect of each variable the sampling was done to ensure that a representative sample was taken across these variables a map of the site locations in addition the evaporation and precipitation rate isotherms are provided in fig si 1 and fig si 2 respectively nebraska provides a useful case study representation for comparison to systems throughout the developed world energy benchmarks of the mechanical wrrfs was shown by hanna et al 2018 to be similar to other states and countries nebraska exhibits a diverse climatic environment in precipitation and evaporation which both have implications on the design of lagoons but also the water reuse demands of crops when considering irrigation lagoons irmak et al 2010 figs si 3 shows the design equation used for sizing the systems based on the state regulatory agency which is based on a water balance with these variables the middle and eastern portions of the state exhibit a humid continental climate based on the köppen climate classification being representative of many central and northeastern portions of north america europe and asia beck et al 2018 in contrast the north western panhandle and west edge of nebraska exhibits a semi arid climate being prevalent in many parts of the world where precipitation is less than potential crop evapotranspiration the southwestern edge of the state exhibits a humid subtropical climate representative of the southeastern side of many continents 2 1 1 mechanical wrrfs a process flow diagram fig 1 a shows the key elements of the activated sludge system some systems have slightly different configurations e g inclusion of primary treatment however the configurations shown were typical of most sites in the study use of biosolid dewatering varied across sites with some utilizing belt filter presses some others utilizing drying beds and several not utilizing any form at all the main difference among technologies is the secondary treatment where od and ea use different reactor configurations in conjunction with a clarifier for treatment and sbrs use multiple basins for aeration and settling it should be noted that none of the sites used primary clarifier in most cases decanted water from biosolids was also recycled back to the front of facility auxiliary infrastructure includes buildings for housing equipment vehicles lab and related components 2 1 2 lagoons lagoons examined in the study exhibited several different configurations which are summarized in fig 1 the configuration for complete retention lagoons is shown in fig 1b and only has water exiting the system via evaporation and seepage irrigation lagoons shown in fig 1c periodically pump treated water to local cropland for irrigation of crops controlled discharge facultative lagoons shown in fig 1d include periodic discharge of treated water to local water ways and may also include a uv disinfection system if discharging during the recreational session i e may 1st october 1st for all lagoons influent water is pumped to the site before proceeding through preliminary treatment and entering the lagoon cells where it is retained for extended periods of time water exits via evaporation or seepage through the liner is completely retained i e cr lagoon intermittently discharged to a local water way i e controlled discharge facultative lagoon or pumped for land application to nearby agriculture land i e irrigation lagoon evaporation and precipitation rates are highly influential variables in the design of lagoon systems accordingly sites were selected across the state to exhibit significant spatial variability in these factors abdul et al 2011 average annual precipitation rates in nebraska can be observed ranging from 41 cm year in the northwest to 86 cm year in the southeast whereas lake evaporation rates exhibit values ranging from 102 cm year in the northeast up to 137 cm year in the southwest noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2020 in the case of irrigation lagoons the same climatic variables driving evaporation i e temperature humidity solar radiation wind also directly impact the crop water evapotranspiration demands impacting the application rate for which water can be reused subedi and chávez 2015 2 2 life cycle assessment the environmental life cycle assessment was performed in accordance with iso 14 040 and 14 044 standards iso 2006 these standards define four key stages in analysis 1 goal and scope definition 2 inventory analysis 3 environmental impact assessment and 4 interpretation each stage is described in more detail in the following sections 2 2 1 goal and scope definition the goal of the study was to evaluate and compare the environmental lca impact of different mechanical wrrfs and lagoons the overall lifespan of the systems was defined as 20 years as is commonly done in other studies corominas et al 2020 and is consistent with u s design standards glumrb 2014 while lifespan is a defined variable it should be acknowledged that lifespan of the actual systems can vary drastically system age within the study area was observed to vary from 10 to 60 years thus a sensitivity analysis on this variable was completed the average volume of treated water was selected as the functional unit for the study and thus results are presented as average resource e g kg cast iron use or average environmental impact kg co2 eq per 1 m3 of treated wastewater the system boundary of this study shown in fig 2 details the foreground processes for which data was collected and background processes that were used from the ecoinvent v3 6 database the built infrastructure associated with the systems electricity use water quality biosolids and air emissions were included in the study only built infrastructure within the facility fence line was included with exception of the main lift stations that in some cases can be present outside this boundary end of life impacts were not included in this study due to being identified as a relatively marginal impact moussavi et al 2021 in assessment of agriculture water reuse systems the required infrastructure and energy to pump wastewater from the lagoon was included in the system boundary 2 2 2 life cycle inventory life cycle inventory lci was compiled for a total set of 35 small wastewater treatment systems table 1 summarizes the type of system sample size and flowrate range except for one od system that receives occasional industrial loads the systems treated exclusively residential and commercial wastewater an overview of the life cycle inventory data sources used for the study is in table 2 construction inventory was collected from engineering design documents provided by the design firms materials were catalogued by specification e g pipe material diameter and then converted to an equivalent inventory mass based on data collected from product specification sheets construction material transport was assumed to be 40 km on average as done in previous studies morera et al 2017 moussavi et al 2021 the collected and aggregate lci for the mechanical wrrfs and lagoons are provided in table si 1 and table si 2 respectively the precipitation and evaporation rate data used for sizing the lagoons is also provided in table si 2 electricity use was collected from utility bills or provided directly from the power supplier water flowrate water quality and biosolid characteristics were collected from the facility s discharge monitoring reports this included carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod total nitrogen total phosphorous for water emissions water quality data and ammonia discharge limit data for the case studies is provided in table si 3 it should be noted that all sites were regulated and in compliance to meet monthly cbod and total suspended solids tss emissions of less than 30 mg l and 80 mg l respectively whereas minimum ammonia emissions varied 0 22 13 7 mg l depending on the receiving water body characteristics these systems were designed based on regional design standards in the u s glumrb 2014 and are expected to be representative of most systems performing secondary treatment with similar water quality objectives biosolids were land applied to local agriculture land in all the case studies and included emissions of tested chemicals and heavy metals for most sites the quantity of biosolids being land applied was not available and thus was estimated based on average rates observed at other sites and scaled for the respective flowrate the data used for this analysis is provided in table si 4 air emissions including carbon dioxide methane dinitrogen oxide and ammonia from the biological processes were estimated based on a combination of literature sources direct air emissions from the secondary treatment indirect effluent discharge to estuary and indirect emissions offset in fertilizer from mechanical wrrfs were estimated based on methods detailed by foley et al 2010 while the current systems are not configured specifically for denitrification it is expected that some level of denitrification is likely still occurring and leading to increased air emissions dinitrogen oxide emissions associated with potential denitrification occurring were estimated based on the methods of epa 2010 and using process specific emission factors reported by van dijk et al 2021 estimates of carbon dioxide and methane emissions from the 3 pond lagoon system estimated by cornejo et al 2013 were used for the lagoons and n2o emissions were estimated as done with mechanical wrrfs using a 1 emission factor epa 2010 implications of air emission uncertainties from the lagoon systems are included in discussion of the results background data was utilized from ecoinvent database v3 6 the specific processes referenced are summarized in table si 5 in the case of excavation for lagoon systems three case studies had project fuel use collected from the contractors to compare to fuel use associated with ecoinvent database this data is included in table si 6 2 2 3 life cycle impact assessment life cycle impact assessment was conducted using tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts traci v2 1 method due to the north american context of the study bare 2011 to investigate all impact categories on a national comparative basis us 2008 normalization factors from traci v2 1 were used ryberg et al 2014 the non carcinogen impact category was omitted from the study due to heavy metals in biosolid emissions being the dominant contributor but not being included in the national total normalization factors lcia computation was completed using openlca software v1 7 in addition to further analysis in a spreadsheet statistical analysis comparing the environmental impact of the systems was conducted in r r core team 2017 provided the relatively small sample size and non normally distributed data the wilcoxon mann whitney test was used for comparing the environmental impact of the two technologies mann and whitney 1947 2 2 4 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainty in the environmental impacts of the technologies was assessed by considering variations in resource use e g electricity use and emissions e g water emissions monte carlo uncertainty analysis was used to evaluate the impact of select foreground data on the resulting environmental impact of select technologies guo and murphy 2012 variations in annual energy use water quality air emissions and water flowrate was included in the study as observed in other studies of wastewater treatment systems niero et al 2014 sub sampling of the total dataset for the analysis was done for facilities only having a minimum of at least three years of available data provided the limited data a triangle distribution using the minimum mean and maximum values for establishing the parameters input data used for this analysis are provided in tables si 7 this included 15 of the mechanical wrrfs and 11 of the lagoons and total of 10 000 iterations were performed the sensitivity of system lifespan between mechanical wrrfs and lagoons was investigated due to the high variability of lifespans observed within the state a large majority of small communities locally and nationally experience population changes which correspondingly leads to changes in water flowrate and pdc usda 2020 this can directly impact the system lifespan as systems not reaching full capacity but still operate effectively may operate longer than designed for without replacement sensitivity of different electric grid mixes was also investigated by examining the environmental impacts of the systems under different major market groups reported in ecoinvent v3 6 e g europe india etc 3 results and discussion the goal of the study was to evaluate and compare the environmental lca impact of different small mechanical wrrfs and lagoons the environmental life cycle impact profile of each technology and sub group are provided in the following sections to elucidate the source of impacts associated with each technology comparisons between mechanical wrrfs and lagoons are then presented and followed with the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 3 1 mechanical wrrf lca profiles the average environmental profile of the mechanical wrrfs is characterized by process in fig 3 a the profile includes direct air water soil emissions operating electricity use and construction resources these as system results were aggregated due to only the secondary reactor being different among facilities a relatively small difference in lci once examined individual technology profiles are provided in figs si 4 and show similar profile with exception to sbr showing a slightly larger impact of air emissions for the global warming impact category across all impact categories with exception of water emissions driving eutrophication impacts and solid emissions driving non carcinogens impacts electricity use is the dominant contributor small mechanical wrrfs can exhibit energy intensities up to two to five times on average relative to their larger counterparts due to lacking control systems e g aeration controls hanna et al 2018 moussavi et al 2021 as highlighted in prior research of these systems overdesign is common among these facilities further exacerbating a higher energy due to oversized equipment relative to the required treatment flowrate pham et al 2021 specifically aeration associated with aerobic digestion and secondary treatment along with space heating of buildings have been shown to be key drivers of energy use within these facilities thompson et al 2020 it should be noted that most small systems in the developed world are in the process of integrating nutrient removal that would lessen their impacts associated with eutrophication however implementing such changes would result in tradeoffs of potential increases in air emissions and additional infrastructure caniani et al 2019 consideration of alternative operating methods e g intermittent aeration should be considered when implementing nutrient removal technologies however consideration of the intrinsic links between saving energy potentially increasing air emissions and reducing nutrient loadings requires consideration non carcinogen impacts associated with the solids are largely driven by heavy metals such as zinc it should be highlighted that the fate and transport of such contaminants in the environment is not well characterized and is an area of ongoing research mohapatra et al 2016 air emissions contribute a meaningful contribution to the acidification and global warming impact categories the construction phase accounts for a non negligible share 5 in most impact categories and most notably carcinogen and smog impact categories the material resources associated with the construction phase were cast iron primarily associated with water and air piping concrete associated with process and building structures and reinforcing steel pham et al 2021 it should be noted that the construction phase is expected to increase in significance as the electricity grid moves to a more renewable energy supply over time the impact of the built materials could also be reduced given greener energy supply in their production but this is highly process and location specific goldstein and rasmussen 2017 3 2 lagoon lca profiles the environmental impact of the three different lagoons on average is characterized by process in fig 3b controlled discharge facultative lagoon fig 3c irrigation lagoon and fig 3d complete retention lagoon in contrast to mechanical wrrfs lagoons exhibit more impact in the construction phase relative to the operational phase up to 80 in smog category because of their relatively small electricity use and high upfront built infrastructure air emissions contribute significantly to the acidification eutrophication and global warming impact categories within the carcinogen and fossil fuel depletion impact categories cast iron piping was a significant driver most lagoons have a relatively large supply inlet pipe that extends into the center of the lagoon to effectively distribute wastewater excavation of soil for the lagoon s volume was also a driving factor of the construction phase most notably in the smog impact category previous research has shown that excavation energy use can vary significantly due to environmental e g soil types and operational factors e g number of excavators devi et al 2017 data collected from local contractors showed significantly higher fuel use than the amounts estimated using ecoinvent database devi and palaniappan 2017 this data was only used for reference in a handful of separate case studies and not used for the main lca analysis of this study but did highlight the high variability in this resource use the required volume of a lagoon system is influenced by differences in evaporation and precipitation rates which vary spatially and year to year with effective operating depths being defined as relatively constant variations in these climatic variables directly impact the excavation use and the cast iron supply line since it is also dependent the lagoon system s horizontal plane space use in the case of complete retention and irrigation lagoons electricity use is a driving factor associated with eutrophication due to a lack of water emissions that are prevalent in controlled discharge facultative lagoons and mechanical wrrfs electricity use in these systems is associated with pumping at the lift station and in some cases preliminary screening processes the electricity use intensity of these systems is dependent on the pumping head which can vary site to site and be dependent on the location and elevation of the facility relative to the collection system and town as noted in previous work assessing energy use of unit operations at these small wrrfs pumping operations use only a marginal amount of electricity relative to aeration processes and building heating as observed in mechanical wrrfs thompson et al 2020 3 3 comparison of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons lagoons and mechanical wrrfs are different in terms of design and exhibit tradeoffs in environmental impacts as well as other factors fig 4 a i summarizes the environmental impact of facilities for their respective technology group across different impact categories the technology groups are ordered from left to right as extended aeration ea oxidation ditch od sequencing batch reactor sbr complete retention cr lagoon irrigation irrig lagoon and controlled discharge cd lagoon mechanical wrrfs exhibit a higher environmental impact in almost all impact categories with exception to the smog impact category in which the construction phase of lagoons contributes a similar magnitude of impact relative to the mechanical wrrfs electricity use sbrs exhibited a higher global warming potential relative to od and ea systems due to higher n2o emissions and higher energy intensities only significant differences were observed when comparing controlled discharge lagoons relative to complete retention and irrigation lagoons in the eutrophication impacts due to the intermittent discharge of treated wastewater to water ways controlled discharge facultative lagoons discharge less water emissions relative to mechanical wrrfs on an annual basis because they allow for evaporation and seepage during the long water storage time however as noted in other studies characterization of water emissions should be assessed on a site to site basis hernández padilla et al 2017 many local controlled discharge lagoons are being converted to either complete retention irrigation or a mechanical wrrf due to challenges in meeting water quality limits specifically ammonia due to ineffective treatment while general differences can be derived between mechanical wrrfs and lagoons assessing differences between different mechanical wrrfs and different lagoons in most impact categories would require an lca to be conducted at the design stage this practice could be implemented by design engineers but would also require improved energy modeling in addition to a working knowledge of lca by the engineer and or require supportive tools to help implement such analysis while lagoons exhibit less environmental burden relative to mechanical wrrfs land use associated with the systems varies significantly between systems on average lagoons and mechanical wrrfs per capita land use in this study was 73 7 35 9 m2 capita and 2 4 1 9 m2 capita respectively the sizing of the lagoons is influenced in part by design choices with most of the systems having long residence times 180 days but also being influenced by relative differences in evaporation and precipitation rates it would be anticipated that in more arid climates lagoons would utilize less land relative to these estimates it should be noted that in some rural areas sufficient land may not be always available for direct use by a community without utilizing the process of eminent domain i e government seizing land for public use with compensation only foreground land use of the systems was assessed in this analysis and traci does not account for land use of background inventory preliminary analysis of a representative mechanical wrrf using recipe impact assessment to assess background land use found only a marginal increase 10 m2 capita in land use associated with background energy and material resources of the mechanical wrrfs and was largely attributed to land use from coal mines and additional roads thus lagoons likely require a significantly larger life cycle land footprint relative to mechanical wrrfs more details related to this result is provided in tables si 8 administrative management and operational burdens of the different systems varies significantly and merits discussion mechanical wrrfs typically involve much higher level operator training and attention thompson et al 2021 specifically operators require training related to regular sampling assessment of the as process and clarifier performance process adjustment maintenance of facility equipment etc in contrast lagoon systems exhibit far less burden with most maintenance primarily focused on ensuring clearing of grasses and other wind obstructing growths around the lagoon cells gloyna 1971 some maintenance and replacement of the lift station pump and preliminary treatment equipment is expected but is significantly minor relative to mechanical wrrfs for mechanical wrrfs controlled discharge facultative lagoons and irrigation lagoons the administrative burden of sampling testing and reporting water quality is a notable tradeoff relative to complete retention lagoons in selecting treatment technologies the most common factors driving decision making reported by community leaders and engineers was cost and capacity for meeting regulatory water quality limits in terms of cost these technologies vary significantly in upfront operating and life cycle cost resende et al 2019 cost tradeoffs in the technologies are often analyzed on a case by case basis due to the highly site specific cost driving factors for each system e g land cost electricity cost etc ilyas et al 2021 the environmental impact of a shifting electricity grid to more renewable energy supply is expected to have large implications on the environmental profiles of these systems since a significant portion of the construction impact of lagoons is carried in the excavation and mined materials reducing these impacts may occur at a slower rate relative to greening of the electricity grid further the lagoon construction phase may lead to shifting environmental burdens since they would involve shifts to increased biofuels and or use of battery storage systems daystar et al 2015 baars et al 2021 3 4 sensitivity analysis of system lifespan and electric grid mix system lifespan can be influential on the environmental lca impact of a process while most studies assume a base lifespan of 20 years based on typical design standards these are not always representative of actual systems in cases where upfront construction impacts are relatively larger than the operational phase the lifespan of a system has a greater effect on the life cycle measured impact when comparing the environmental impact of different lagoon systems and mechanical wrrfs observing significant differences between the technologies was identified to be dependent on system lifespan in the acidification carcinogen fossil fuel depletion ozone depletion and smog impact categories the statistical comparison of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons at different system lifespans is summarized in table si 9 due to the large upfront built infrastructure of the lagoons and lower operating impacts relative to mechanical wrrfs shorter system lifespans lead to larger environmental life cycle impacts in contrast the impact categories of ecotoxicity eutrophication global warming and respiratory effects exhibited significant differences irrespective of the system lifespan due to these categories being more heavily influenced by operations e g electricity use water emissions due to the relatively high energy use and continuous water emissions of mechanical wrrfs lagoons will tend to have less environmental impact in categories dominated by such resource emission streams figure si 5 shows environmental impact comparison of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons utilizing different market group electrical grid mixes from around the world the source of electricity generation was identified to be highly influential on the environmental impact of both systems and influenced comparisons between the technologies when the grid reached a composition with approximately 75 renewables mechanical wrrfs exhibited similar environmental impacts relative to the lagoons while this analysis examines only the impact of electricity use further consideration of the co current integration of biofuels used in construction processes e g excavation equipment may further merit consideration when considering this comparison 3 5 uncertainty analysis and impact of climate on lagoons uncertainty associated with the environmental impact of these systems was conducted to help quantify variability associated with foreground resources emissions within facilities fig 5 summarizes the results of the respective global warming potential impact of a sub sample of mechanical wrrfs and different lagoon types characterized by source energy intensity i e energy use flowrate treated was identified as one key driver of the variation between mechanical wrrfs and can vary significantly case studies exhibited a range of 0 89 3 76 kwh m3 these variations are often attributed to variations in the volumes of treated water while both process and non process related energy use remains relatively constant a conceptual figure highlighting how the measured environmental impact of both operations and built infrastructure vary over variable annual average flowrates of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons is provided in figs si 6 for reference this highlights the importance of needing to properly size equipment and or improve the capacity for small systems to vary their process energy use with respect to changing flowrates through improved process control cast iron used for inter process conveyance piping and resources used in auxiliary building structures are key drivers of the variability in mechanical wrrfs construction phase emphasizing the need for design engineers to focus on improving design of these components pham et al 2021 in contrast the lagoon systems operating energy consisted of a lift station pump whose energy use typically varies proportionally with water volume pumped further the construction phase of lagoons exhibits higher uncertainty due to the relatively high contribution of the construction phase to the overall life cycle variability between lagoon systems is primarily associated with the climate dependent sizing of the plan area due to high variances in evaporation and precipitation rates and the relatively defined operating depth resource use associated with excavation and cast iron can vary significantly the cast iron influent supply piping can increase proportionally with lagoon sizing fig 6 a b shows the per capita excavation and cast iron use of the different treatment technologies relative to the differences in value between annual evaporation and precipitation rates climate dependent differences in the per capita resource use showed weak negative correlations in irrigation systems the trend line provided is just for the irrigation lagoons both lagoon sizing and the demand for water reuse i e crop evapotranspiration would decrease with larger differences in evaporation and precipitation and could allow for smaller sizing of the systems this observation is expected due to the sizing of the lagoons being based in part on these climate variables the design equation used for sizing the lagoons and local evaporation and precipitation rate data are provided in the figs si 3 and figs si 2 respectively for reference of this relation in general it is expected that in more arid climates lagoons will tend to exhibit a more reduced spatial and environmental footprint provided that they can maintain effective operating volumes 3 6 limitations and future work there are several limitations to the findings of this work that require additional discussion first estimates of air emissions for the lagoon systems could be improved through further data collection specifically influent water quality and n2o emission factors for small municipal lagoons over longer time periods in conducting the monte carlo uncertainty analysis foreground data i e energy intensity water quality air emissions were randomly and independently sampled from distributions for the analysis but would not be fully representative of these systems due to these factors being inherently connected uncertainty in the characterization factors associated with background data was not included in this study and could be included in further works the system boundaries of this study did not include inventories associated with the agriculture systems associated with the irrigation lagoons assessing such impacts requires a more in depth analysis including evaluating potential changes associated with resource use e g fertilizer use direct emissions e g air emissions and system outputs e g crop production and is the focus of ongoing work the impact of the irrigation lagoon on these connected systems is highly site specific and influenced by the type of conversion being made such as converting a dryland to irrigated cropland offsetting well water pumping and types of crops being irrigated 4 conclusions the goal of this work was to evaluate the environmental life cycle impact and tradeoffs of different lagoon and mechanical wrrf systems mechanical wrrfs and lagoons exhibit different environmental profiles energy use is the largest driver of environmental impacts in mechanical wrrfs whereas the construction phase air emissions and operating energy of lagoons can be leading sources of impacts site specific factors such as climatic conditions in the case of lagoons and the design type and process layout e g auxiliary building use facility piping layout etc within the mechanical wrrf pham et al 2021 can impact the quantity of resource use and environmental emissions in general assuming a 20 year lifespan lagoons exhibit a smaller environmental impact relative to mechanical wrrfs in all impact categories for systems in similar climate zones observed in nebraska for the population range investigated in this study 150 2200 people and with a similar electric grid mix of the united states sbrs exhibited higher global warming potential impacts relative to od and ea systems due to higher n2o emissions and higher energy intensities comparisons of mechanical wrrf and lagoon environmental impacts were sensitive to system lifespans and the type of electrical grid mix being used if lagoons only operate for a short lifespan of 10 years or less they may exhibit similar environmental impacts to mechanical wrrfs for select impact categories likewise local electrical grid mixes with high percentages of renewable energy 75 lead to mechanical wrrfs having similar impacts

16155,small water resource recovery facilities wrrfs serving communities with populations of less than 10 000 people account for 70 of centralized wastewater treatment systems in the united states with growing interest globally in improving the sustainability of these systems this study evaluated the environmental life cycle impact and land use tradeoffs of different lagoon and mechanical wrrfs across the diverse climate of nebraska life cycle inventory including construction and operations was collected for 35 existing systems representing a range of commonly used mechanical wrrfs oxidation ditch extended aeration and sequencing batch reactors and lagoon treatment systems complete retention irrigation and controlled discharge lagoons lagoons exhibit a significantly smaller environmental impact relative to mechanical wrrfs in all impact categories with exception of the smog category based on a 20 year design lifespan provided land is available for use in contrast on site land use of lagoons was significantly higher than mechanical wrrfs 73 7 35 9 m2 capita and 2 4 1 9 m2 capita respectively lagoons on average exhibited significantly more impact associated with the construction phase in most impact categories up to 80 in case of smog impacts relative to mechanical wrrfs 25 the differences in contribution of the construction leads to the environmental impacts and comparisons between the technologies being sensitive to system lifespan and type of electric grid mix irrigation lagoon per capita excavation and cast iron resource use was observed to decrease with increasing differences between evaporation and precipitation rates uncertainty of the environmental impacts within sites is primarily driven by variations in energy intensity within mechanical wrrfs and volumes of treated water within lagoons variability between facilities of similar technology groups is largely driven by a combination of site specific factors including climate design and operations graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction wastewater treatment has served as a safeguard in protecting public health and local ecosystems for well over century treatment technologies have evolved to meet the objectives of new water quality standards lofrano and brown 2010 and have adopted operations to screen materials and grit preliminary treatment remove heavier solids primary treatment biologically convert organic waste materials secondary treatment disinfect and filter water tertiary treatment and process biosolids metcalf and eddy 2014 these systems can carry a significant environmental burden associated with their material and energy inputs as well as output soil water and air emissions corominas et al 2013 small water resource recovery facilities wrrfs are defined as serving communities with populations of less than 10 000 people or treating less than 3785 m3 day and account for approximately 70 of centralized wastewater treatment systems in the united states epa 2008 many small community water resource recovery facilities are facing increased regulatory water quality standards and aging infrastructure requiring replacement or renovation in the coming decades moussavi et al 2020 environmental impact considerations are of growing relevance globally in the water wastewater sector as also observed in the energy agriculture and manufacturing sectors bardouille and koubsky 2000 labuschagne et al 2005 ngarava et al 2019 the 2021 infrastructure funding bill recently passed by the u s congress allocated 55 billion dollars for upgrading water infrastructure and included funding specifically for sustainability and resilience improvements in small communities congress 2021 to help community leaders make more informed decisions regarding the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment technology they are adopting information on the environmental life cycle impact tradeoffs of different technologies for small communities is needed with fewer human and financial resources relative to larger communities there is a need for information on these environmental tradeoffs that design engineers can use in communicating with community leaders in decision making to ensure that future systems are more sustainable landis 2015 environmental life cycle assessment lca is a widely used tool for quantifying the environmental impact of products and services the field has developed to integrate the spatial dimension as reviewed by patouillard et al 2018 coupling the analysis with economic studies frança et al 2021 and improvements in handling uncertainties igos et al 2018 application of lca for assessment of wastewater treatment systems has developed significantly since the 1990s and refinement in defining goals and scope collection of life cycle inventory application of different impact assessment methods and interpretation of results corominas et al 2013 beyond exploration of different functional units and system boundaries studies have further refined the context of its application collection of more detailed inventory data included sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and methods in which lca can be integrated with life cycle cost analysis lcca and or techno economic assessment tea corominas et al 2020 assessing small systems is often constrained due to limited data availability e g water quality energy use construction data and is further compounded by the often limited human resources available in small communities to collect and retain such information moussavi et al 2021 thompson et al 2020 1 1 small community wastewater treatment technologies various wastewater treatment technologies are employed within small communities however two widely adopted technology groups for small communities include a mechanical wrrfs also known as activated sludge systems and b lagoons also known as pond treatment systems matamoros et al 2016 1 1 1 mechanical wrrfs activated sludge as processes are the most widely used means of biological wastewater treatment in the world gernaey and sin 2013 the process acts as a biological reactor by initially providing aeration to wastewater in a tank allowing bacteria to convert organic waste to additional biomass biomass or activated sludge is separated from the effluent water in a clarifier and returned to the aeration basin to maintain effective biomass concentration some of the most common systems being employed by these communities include extended aeration ea oxidation ditch od and sequencing batch reactor sbr however other types that may be encountered include membrane biological reactors mbr rotating biological contactor rbc trickling filters tfs and upflow anaerobic blanket reactor uasb molinos senante et al 2014 liu et al 2003 each of the technologies comes with tradeoffs regarding operability maintenance space energy requirements capacity for handling shock loads capacity for future expansion and other performance characteristics metcalf and eddy 2014 these systems are all characteristic of having large typically concrete basins by which some form of energy intensive aeration i e diffused or mechanical aeration is supplied and relatively short hydraulic retention times 8 24 h are observed furthermore many of the systems will utilize similar preliminary treatment and disinfection operations there is often auxiliary infrastructure required to support these operations as in the case of a building that houses aeration blowers pumps and controls thompson et al 2020 1 1 2 lagoons waste stabilization pond treatment systems also known as lagoons are another common type of biological wastewater treatment systems for small communities as they account for more than 50 of the wastewater treatment facilities in the u s us epa 2016 many different types of lagoons exist and may carry variations in terminology common types include controlled discharge cd lagoons anaerobic lagoons aerobic stabilization ponds irrigation lagoons irrig complete retention cr lagoons and mechanically aerated oxidation ponds gloyna 1971 the mechanisms for treatment of wastewater are similar to that of as process where bacteria are used for metabolizing organic waste however lagoons typically occupy a large land footprint area have long detention times 5 180 days and utilize the natural convention of wind to provide oxygen to the water abdul et al 2011 furthermore many lagoons facilitate the growth of algae that help assimilate nitrogen and phosphorous that in turn oxygenate the lagoon while lagoons have been used for centuries for storage and treatment of wastewater specific design criteria related to volumetric requirements organic loading rates and detention periods have developed only within the last 70 years fitzgerald and rohlich 1958 complete retention lagoons and irrigation lagoons that use treated water for land application of cropland are two technologies that are being adopted more regularly to avoid water emissions and limitations these systems can face in maintaining high water quality the energy use of lagoons can be relatively minimal as they have primarily influent pumping and screening for operating equipment 1 2 environmental lca comparison of technologies literature assessing the environmental lca of small lagoon treatment systems for treatment of municipal wastewater and comparison to mechanical wrrfs is limited to a handful of case studies in a study by garfí et al 2017 mechanical wrrfs constructed wetlands and high rate algal ponds were compared and it was found that mechanical wrrfs exhibited between 2 and 5 times the environmental impact of more natural based systems another study comparing constructed wetlands and extended aeration highlighted the high upfront construction impact of the nature based system and the high energy use associated with the mechanical wrrfs lopsik 2013 in agreement with these studies a study that compared vegetated land treatment constructed wetlands and mechanical wrrfs found that these natural systems are more environmentally friendly yildirium and topkaya 2012 a study by muga and mihelcic 2008 highlighted variability in operational cost and energy tradeoffs between mechanical wrrfs lagoons and land treatment systems but lacked consideration of built infrastructure and direct emissions despite past lca comparisons of natural based systems and mechanical wrrfs comparisons of different types of lagoons are lacking from the literature godin et al 2012 furthermore case studies of the life cycle impact of agricultural water reuse lagoons will be referred to as irrigation lagoons are absent meriting further investigation lastly small systems can often exhibit a range of energy intensities variations in population changes and whose design can be influenced by climate factors that merit an investigation with a larger sample of systems while also considering uncertainty in the data given the lack of literature assessing different small community wastewater treatment systems the goal of this research is to evaluate the environmental life cycle impact and land use tradeoffs of lagoons and mechanical wrrfs the findings of the study can help provide key stakeholders information that could aid in treatment process selection further the methodology could be used as a tool for engineers to aid in technology selection and improved sustainable design of wastewater treatment systems 2 methodology 2 1 case study selection selection of the 35 small wastewater treatment systems for both mechanical wrrf and lagoon case studies aimed for inclusion of different technology sub groups various design flowrates different percent design capacities pdc i e ratio of average flowrate to design flowrate and representative energy intensities ei i e energy use per unit flow treated furthermore lagoons selection was made to include systems in diverse evaporation and precipitation rates exhibited across the state of nebraska while the sample size was not large enough to measure the statistical effect of each variable the sampling was done to ensure that a representative sample was taken across these variables a map of the site locations in addition the evaporation and precipitation rate isotherms are provided in fig si 1 and fig si 2 respectively nebraska provides a useful case study representation for comparison to systems throughout the developed world energy benchmarks of the mechanical wrrfs was shown by hanna et al 2018 to be similar to other states and countries nebraska exhibits a diverse climatic environment in precipitation and evaporation which both have implications on the design of lagoons but also the water reuse demands of crops when considering irrigation lagoons irmak et al 2010 figs si 3 shows the design equation used for sizing the systems based on the state regulatory agency which is based on a water balance with these variables the middle and eastern portions of the state exhibit a humid continental climate based on the köppen climate classification being representative of many central and northeastern portions of north america europe and asia beck et al 2018 in contrast the north western panhandle and west edge of nebraska exhibits a semi arid climate being prevalent in many parts of the world where precipitation is less than potential crop evapotranspiration the southwestern edge of the state exhibits a humid subtropical climate representative of the southeastern side of many continents 2 1 1 mechanical wrrfs a process flow diagram fig 1 a shows the key elements of the activated sludge system some systems have slightly different configurations e g inclusion of primary treatment however the configurations shown were typical of most sites in the study use of biosolid dewatering varied across sites with some utilizing belt filter presses some others utilizing drying beds and several not utilizing any form at all the main difference among technologies is the secondary treatment where od and ea use different reactor configurations in conjunction with a clarifier for treatment and sbrs use multiple basins for aeration and settling it should be noted that none of the sites used primary clarifier in most cases decanted water from biosolids was also recycled back to the front of facility auxiliary infrastructure includes buildings for housing equipment vehicles lab and related components 2 1 2 lagoons lagoons examined in the study exhibited several different configurations which are summarized in fig 1 the configuration for complete retention lagoons is shown in fig 1b and only has water exiting the system via evaporation and seepage irrigation lagoons shown in fig 1c periodically pump treated water to local cropland for irrigation of crops controlled discharge facultative lagoons shown in fig 1d include periodic discharge of treated water to local water ways and may also include a uv disinfection system if discharging during the recreational session i e may 1st october 1st for all lagoons influent water is pumped to the site before proceeding through preliminary treatment and entering the lagoon cells where it is retained for extended periods of time water exits via evaporation or seepage through the liner is completely retained i e cr lagoon intermittently discharged to a local water way i e controlled discharge facultative lagoon or pumped for land application to nearby agriculture land i e irrigation lagoon evaporation and precipitation rates are highly influential variables in the design of lagoon systems accordingly sites were selected across the state to exhibit significant spatial variability in these factors abdul et al 2011 average annual precipitation rates in nebraska can be observed ranging from 41 cm year in the northwest to 86 cm year in the southeast whereas lake evaporation rates exhibit values ranging from 102 cm year in the northeast up to 137 cm year in the southwest noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2020 in the case of irrigation lagoons the same climatic variables driving evaporation i e temperature humidity solar radiation wind also directly impact the crop water evapotranspiration demands impacting the application rate for which water can be reused subedi and chávez 2015 2 2 life cycle assessment the environmental life cycle assessment was performed in accordance with iso 14 040 and 14 044 standards iso 2006 these standards define four key stages in analysis 1 goal and scope definition 2 inventory analysis 3 environmental impact assessment and 4 interpretation each stage is described in more detail in the following sections 2 2 1 goal and scope definition the goal of the study was to evaluate and compare the environmental lca impact of different mechanical wrrfs and lagoons the overall lifespan of the systems was defined as 20 years as is commonly done in other studies corominas et al 2020 and is consistent with u s design standards glumrb 2014 while lifespan is a defined variable it should be acknowledged that lifespan of the actual systems can vary drastically system age within the study area was observed to vary from 10 to 60 years thus a sensitivity analysis on this variable was completed the average volume of treated water was selected as the functional unit for the study and thus results are presented as average resource e g kg cast iron use or average environmental impact kg co2 eq per 1 m3 of treated wastewater the system boundary of this study shown in fig 2 details the foreground processes for which data was collected and background processes that were used from the ecoinvent v3 6 database the built infrastructure associated with the systems electricity use water quality biosolids and air emissions were included in the study only built infrastructure within the facility fence line was included with exception of the main lift stations that in some cases can be present outside this boundary end of life impacts were not included in this study due to being identified as a relatively marginal impact moussavi et al 2021 in assessment of agriculture water reuse systems the required infrastructure and energy to pump wastewater from the lagoon was included in the system boundary 2 2 2 life cycle inventory life cycle inventory lci was compiled for a total set of 35 small wastewater treatment systems table 1 summarizes the type of system sample size and flowrate range except for one od system that receives occasional industrial loads the systems treated exclusively residential and commercial wastewater an overview of the life cycle inventory data sources used for the study is in table 2 construction inventory was collected from engineering design documents provided by the design firms materials were catalogued by specification e g pipe material diameter and then converted to an equivalent inventory mass based on data collected from product specification sheets construction material transport was assumed to be 40 km on average as done in previous studies morera et al 2017 moussavi et al 2021 the collected and aggregate lci for the mechanical wrrfs and lagoons are provided in table si 1 and table si 2 respectively the precipitation and evaporation rate data used for sizing the lagoons is also provided in table si 2 electricity use was collected from utility bills or provided directly from the power supplier water flowrate water quality and biosolid characteristics were collected from the facility s discharge monitoring reports this included carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod total nitrogen total phosphorous for water emissions water quality data and ammonia discharge limit data for the case studies is provided in table si 3 it should be noted that all sites were regulated and in compliance to meet monthly cbod and total suspended solids tss emissions of less than 30 mg l and 80 mg l respectively whereas minimum ammonia emissions varied 0 22 13 7 mg l depending on the receiving water body characteristics these systems were designed based on regional design standards in the u s glumrb 2014 and are expected to be representative of most systems performing secondary treatment with similar water quality objectives biosolids were land applied to local agriculture land in all the case studies and included emissions of tested chemicals and heavy metals for most sites the quantity of biosolids being land applied was not available and thus was estimated based on average rates observed at other sites and scaled for the respective flowrate the data used for this analysis is provided in table si 4 air emissions including carbon dioxide methane dinitrogen oxide and ammonia from the biological processes were estimated based on a combination of literature sources direct air emissions from the secondary treatment indirect effluent discharge to estuary and indirect emissions offset in fertilizer from mechanical wrrfs were estimated based on methods detailed by foley et al 2010 while the current systems are not configured specifically for denitrification it is expected that some level of denitrification is likely still occurring and leading to increased air emissions dinitrogen oxide emissions associated with potential denitrification occurring were estimated based on the methods of epa 2010 and using process specific emission factors reported by van dijk et al 2021 estimates of carbon dioxide and methane emissions from the 3 pond lagoon system estimated by cornejo et al 2013 were used for the lagoons and n2o emissions were estimated as done with mechanical wrrfs using a 1 emission factor epa 2010 implications of air emission uncertainties from the lagoon systems are included in discussion of the results background data was utilized from ecoinvent database v3 6 the specific processes referenced are summarized in table si 5 in the case of excavation for lagoon systems three case studies had project fuel use collected from the contractors to compare to fuel use associated with ecoinvent database this data is included in table si 6 2 2 3 life cycle impact assessment life cycle impact assessment was conducted using tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts traci v2 1 method due to the north american context of the study bare 2011 to investigate all impact categories on a national comparative basis us 2008 normalization factors from traci v2 1 were used ryberg et al 2014 the non carcinogen impact category was omitted from the study due to heavy metals in biosolid emissions being the dominant contributor but not being included in the national total normalization factors lcia computation was completed using openlca software v1 7 in addition to further analysis in a spreadsheet statistical analysis comparing the environmental impact of the systems was conducted in r r core team 2017 provided the relatively small sample size and non normally distributed data the wilcoxon mann whitney test was used for comparing the environmental impact of the two technologies mann and whitney 1947 2 2 4 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainty in the environmental impacts of the technologies was assessed by considering variations in resource use e g electricity use and emissions e g water emissions monte carlo uncertainty analysis was used to evaluate the impact of select foreground data on the resulting environmental impact of select technologies guo and murphy 2012 variations in annual energy use water quality air emissions and water flowrate was included in the study as observed in other studies of wastewater treatment systems niero et al 2014 sub sampling of the total dataset for the analysis was done for facilities only having a minimum of at least three years of available data provided the limited data a triangle distribution using the minimum mean and maximum values for establishing the parameters input data used for this analysis are provided in tables si 7 this included 15 of the mechanical wrrfs and 11 of the lagoons and total of 10 000 iterations were performed the sensitivity of system lifespan between mechanical wrrfs and lagoons was investigated due to the high variability of lifespans observed within the state a large majority of small communities locally and nationally experience population changes which correspondingly leads to changes in water flowrate and pdc usda 2020 this can directly impact the system lifespan as systems not reaching full capacity but still operate effectively may operate longer than designed for without replacement sensitivity of different electric grid mixes was also investigated by examining the environmental impacts of the systems under different major market groups reported in ecoinvent v3 6 e g europe india etc 3 results and discussion the goal of the study was to evaluate and compare the environmental lca impact of different small mechanical wrrfs and lagoons the environmental life cycle impact profile of each technology and sub group are provided in the following sections to elucidate the source of impacts associated with each technology comparisons between mechanical wrrfs and lagoons are then presented and followed with the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 3 1 mechanical wrrf lca profiles the average environmental profile of the mechanical wrrfs is characterized by process in fig 3 a the profile includes direct air water soil emissions operating electricity use and construction resources these as system results were aggregated due to only the secondary reactor being different among facilities a relatively small difference in lci once examined individual technology profiles are provided in figs si 4 and show similar profile with exception to sbr showing a slightly larger impact of air emissions for the global warming impact category across all impact categories with exception of water emissions driving eutrophication impacts and solid emissions driving non carcinogens impacts electricity use is the dominant contributor small mechanical wrrfs can exhibit energy intensities up to two to five times on average relative to their larger counterparts due to lacking control systems e g aeration controls hanna et al 2018 moussavi et al 2021 as highlighted in prior research of these systems overdesign is common among these facilities further exacerbating a higher energy due to oversized equipment relative to the required treatment flowrate pham et al 2021 specifically aeration associated with aerobic digestion and secondary treatment along with space heating of buildings have been shown to be key drivers of energy use within these facilities thompson et al 2020 it should be noted that most small systems in the developed world are in the process of integrating nutrient removal that would lessen their impacts associated with eutrophication however implementing such changes would result in tradeoffs of potential increases in air emissions and additional infrastructure caniani et al 2019 consideration of alternative operating methods e g intermittent aeration should be considered when implementing nutrient removal technologies however consideration of the intrinsic links between saving energy potentially increasing air emissions and reducing nutrient loadings requires consideration non carcinogen impacts associated with the solids are largely driven by heavy metals such as zinc it should be highlighted that the fate and transport of such contaminants in the environment is not well characterized and is an area of ongoing research mohapatra et al 2016 air emissions contribute a meaningful contribution to the acidification and global warming impact categories the construction phase accounts for a non negligible share 5 in most impact categories and most notably carcinogen and smog impact categories the material resources associated with the construction phase were cast iron primarily associated with water and air piping concrete associated with process and building structures and reinforcing steel pham et al 2021 it should be noted that the construction phase is expected to increase in significance as the electricity grid moves to a more renewable energy supply over time the impact of the built materials could also be reduced given greener energy supply in their production but this is highly process and location specific goldstein and rasmussen 2017 3 2 lagoon lca profiles the environmental impact of the three different lagoons on average is characterized by process in fig 3b controlled discharge facultative lagoon fig 3c irrigation lagoon and fig 3d complete retention lagoon in contrast to mechanical wrrfs lagoons exhibit more impact in the construction phase relative to the operational phase up to 80 in smog category because of their relatively small electricity use and high upfront built infrastructure air emissions contribute significantly to the acidification eutrophication and global warming impact categories within the carcinogen and fossil fuel depletion impact categories cast iron piping was a significant driver most lagoons have a relatively large supply inlet pipe that extends into the center of the lagoon to effectively distribute wastewater excavation of soil for the lagoon s volume was also a driving factor of the construction phase most notably in the smog impact category previous research has shown that excavation energy use can vary significantly due to environmental e g soil types and operational factors e g number of excavators devi et al 2017 data collected from local contractors showed significantly higher fuel use than the amounts estimated using ecoinvent database devi and palaniappan 2017 this data was only used for reference in a handful of separate case studies and not used for the main lca analysis of this study but did highlight the high variability in this resource use the required volume of a lagoon system is influenced by differences in evaporation and precipitation rates which vary spatially and year to year with effective operating depths being defined as relatively constant variations in these climatic variables directly impact the excavation use and the cast iron supply line since it is also dependent the lagoon system s horizontal plane space use in the case of complete retention and irrigation lagoons electricity use is a driving factor associated with eutrophication due to a lack of water emissions that are prevalent in controlled discharge facultative lagoons and mechanical wrrfs electricity use in these systems is associated with pumping at the lift station and in some cases preliminary screening processes the electricity use intensity of these systems is dependent on the pumping head which can vary site to site and be dependent on the location and elevation of the facility relative to the collection system and town as noted in previous work assessing energy use of unit operations at these small wrrfs pumping operations use only a marginal amount of electricity relative to aeration processes and building heating as observed in mechanical wrrfs thompson et al 2020 3 3 comparison of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons lagoons and mechanical wrrfs are different in terms of design and exhibit tradeoffs in environmental impacts as well as other factors fig 4 a i summarizes the environmental impact of facilities for their respective technology group across different impact categories the technology groups are ordered from left to right as extended aeration ea oxidation ditch od sequencing batch reactor sbr complete retention cr lagoon irrigation irrig lagoon and controlled discharge cd lagoon mechanical wrrfs exhibit a higher environmental impact in almost all impact categories with exception to the smog impact category in which the construction phase of lagoons contributes a similar magnitude of impact relative to the mechanical wrrfs electricity use sbrs exhibited a higher global warming potential relative to od and ea systems due to higher n2o emissions and higher energy intensities only significant differences were observed when comparing controlled discharge lagoons relative to complete retention and irrigation lagoons in the eutrophication impacts due to the intermittent discharge of treated wastewater to water ways controlled discharge facultative lagoons discharge less water emissions relative to mechanical wrrfs on an annual basis because they allow for evaporation and seepage during the long water storage time however as noted in other studies characterization of water emissions should be assessed on a site to site basis hernández padilla et al 2017 many local controlled discharge lagoons are being converted to either complete retention irrigation or a mechanical wrrf due to challenges in meeting water quality limits specifically ammonia due to ineffective treatment while general differences can be derived between mechanical wrrfs and lagoons assessing differences between different mechanical wrrfs and different lagoons in most impact categories would require an lca to be conducted at the design stage this practice could be implemented by design engineers but would also require improved energy modeling in addition to a working knowledge of lca by the engineer and or require supportive tools to help implement such analysis while lagoons exhibit less environmental burden relative to mechanical wrrfs land use associated with the systems varies significantly between systems on average lagoons and mechanical wrrfs per capita land use in this study was 73 7 35 9 m2 capita and 2 4 1 9 m2 capita respectively the sizing of the lagoons is influenced in part by design choices with most of the systems having long residence times 180 days but also being influenced by relative differences in evaporation and precipitation rates it would be anticipated that in more arid climates lagoons would utilize less land relative to these estimates it should be noted that in some rural areas sufficient land may not be always available for direct use by a community without utilizing the process of eminent domain i e government seizing land for public use with compensation only foreground land use of the systems was assessed in this analysis and traci does not account for land use of background inventory preliminary analysis of a representative mechanical wrrf using recipe impact assessment to assess background land use found only a marginal increase 10 m2 capita in land use associated with background energy and material resources of the mechanical wrrfs and was largely attributed to land use from coal mines and additional roads thus lagoons likely require a significantly larger life cycle land footprint relative to mechanical wrrfs more details related to this result is provided in tables si 8 administrative management and operational burdens of the different systems varies significantly and merits discussion mechanical wrrfs typically involve much higher level operator training and attention thompson et al 2021 specifically operators require training related to regular sampling assessment of the as process and clarifier performance process adjustment maintenance of facility equipment etc in contrast lagoon systems exhibit far less burden with most maintenance primarily focused on ensuring clearing of grasses and other wind obstructing growths around the lagoon cells gloyna 1971 some maintenance and replacement of the lift station pump and preliminary treatment equipment is expected but is significantly minor relative to mechanical wrrfs for mechanical wrrfs controlled discharge facultative lagoons and irrigation lagoons the administrative burden of sampling testing and reporting water quality is a notable tradeoff relative to complete retention lagoons in selecting treatment technologies the most common factors driving decision making reported by community leaders and engineers was cost and capacity for meeting regulatory water quality limits in terms of cost these technologies vary significantly in upfront operating and life cycle cost resende et al 2019 cost tradeoffs in the technologies are often analyzed on a case by case basis due to the highly site specific cost driving factors for each system e g land cost electricity cost etc ilyas et al 2021 the environmental impact of a shifting electricity grid to more renewable energy supply is expected to have large implications on the environmental profiles of these systems since a significant portion of the construction impact of lagoons is carried in the excavation and mined materials reducing these impacts may occur at a slower rate relative to greening of the electricity grid further the lagoon construction phase may lead to shifting environmental burdens since they would involve shifts to increased biofuels and or use of battery storage systems daystar et al 2015 baars et al 2021 3 4 sensitivity analysis of system lifespan and electric grid mix system lifespan can be influential on the environmental lca impact of a process while most studies assume a base lifespan of 20 years based on typical design standards these are not always representative of actual systems in cases where upfront construction impacts are relatively larger than the operational phase the lifespan of a system has a greater effect on the life cycle measured impact when comparing the environmental impact of different lagoon systems and mechanical wrrfs observing significant differences between the technologies was identified to be dependent on system lifespan in the acidification carcinogen fossil fuel depletion ozone depletion and smog impact categories the statistical comparison of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons at different system lifespans is summarized in table si 9 due to the large upfront built infrastructure of the lagoons and lower operating impacts relative to mechanical wrrfs shorter system lifespans lead to larger environmental life cycle impacts in contrast the impact categories of ecotoxicity eutrophication global warming and respiratory effects exhibited significant differences irrespective of the system lifespan due to these categories being more heavily influenced by operations e g electricity use water emissions due to the relatively high energy use and continuous water emissions of mechanical wrrfs lagoons will tend to have less environmental impact in categories dominated by such resource emission streams figure si 5 shows environmental impact comparison of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons utilizing different market group electrical grid mixes from around the world the source of electricity generation was identified to be highly influential on the environmental impact of both systems and influenced comparisons between the technologies when the grid reached a composition with approximately 75 renewables mechanical wrrfs exhibited similar environmental impacts relative to the lagoons while this analysis examines only the impact of electricity use further consideration of the co current integration of biofuels used in construction processes e g excavation equipment may further merit consideration when considering this comparison 3 5 uncertainty analysis and impact of climate on lagoons uncertainty associated with the environmental impact of these systems was conducted to help quantify variability associated with foreground resources emissions within facilities fig 5 summarizes the results of the respective global warming potential impact of a sub sample of mechanical wrrfs and different lagoon types characterized by source energy intensity i e energy use flowrate treated was identified as one key driver of the variation between mechanical wrrfs and can vary significantly case studies exhibited a range of 0 89 3 76 kwh m3 these variations are often attributed to variations in the volumes of treated water while both process and non process related energy use remains relatively constant a conceptual figure highlighting how the measured environmental impact of both operations and built infrastructure vary over variable annual average flowrates of mechanical wrrfs and lagoons is provided in figs si 6 for reference this highlights the importance of needing to properly size equipment and or improve the capacity for small systems to vary their process energy use with respect to changing flowrates through improved process control cast iron used for inter process conveyance piping and resources used in auxiliary building structures are key drivers of the variability in mechanical wrrfs construction phase emphasizing the need for design engineers to focus on improving design of these components pham et al 2021 in contrast the lagoon systems operating energy consisted of a lift station pump whose energy use typically varies proportionally with water volume pumped further the construction phase of lagoons exhibits higher uncertainty due to the relatively high contribution of the construction phase to the overall life cycle variability between lagoon systems is primarily associated with the climate dependent sizing of the plan area due to high variances in evaporation and precipitation rates and the relatively defined operating depth resource use associated with excavation and cast iron can vary significantly the cast iron influent supply piping can increase proportionally with lagoon sizing fig 6 a b shows the per capita excavation and cast iron use of the different treatment technologies relative to the differences in value between annual evaporation and precipitation rates climate dependent differences in the per capita resource use showed weak negative correlations in irrigation systems the trend line provided is just for the irrigation lagoons both lagoon sizing and the demand for water reuse i e crop evapotranspiration would decrease with larger differences in evaporation and precipitation and could allow for smaller sizing of the systems this observation is expected due to the sizing of the lagoons being based in part on these climate variables the design equation used for sizing the lagoons and local evaporation and precipitation rate data are provided in the figs si 3 and figs si 2 respectively for reference of this relation in general it is expected that in more arid climates lagoons will tend to exhibit a more reduced spatial and environmental footprint provided that they can maintain effective operating volumes 3 6 limitations and future work there are several limitations to the findings of this work that require additional discussion first estimates of air emissions for the lagoon systems could be improved through further data collection specifically influent water quality and n2o emission factors for small municipal lagoons over longer time periods in conducting the monte carlo uncertainty analysis foreground data i e energy intensity water quality air emissions were randomly and independently sampled from distributions for the analysis but would not be fully representative of these systems due to these factors being inherently connected uncertainty in the characterization factors associated with background data was not included in this study and could be included in further works the system boundaries of this study did not include inventories associated with the agriculture systems associated with the irrigation lagoons assessing such impacts requires a more in depth analysis including evaluating potential changes associated with resource use e g fertilizer use direct emissions e g air emissions and system outputs e g crop production and is the focus of ongoing work the impact of the irrigation lagoon on these connected systems is highly site specific and influenced by the type of conversion being made such as converting a dryland to irrigated cropland offsetting well water pumping and types of crops being irrigated 4 conclusions the goal of this work was to evaluate the environmental life cycle impact and tradeoffs of different lagoon and mechanical wrrf systems mechanical wrrfs and lagoons exhibit different environmental profiles energy use is the largest driver of environmental impacts in mechanical wrrfs whereas the construction phase air emissions and operating energy of lagoons can be leading sources of impacts site specific factors such as climatic conditions in the case of lagoons and the design type and process layout e g auxiliary building use facility piping layout etc within the mechanical wrrf pham et al 2021 can impact the quantity of resource use and environmental emissions in general assuming a 20 year lifespan lagoons exhibit a smaller environmental impact relative to mechanical wrrfs in all impact categories for systems in similar climate zones observed in nebraska for the population range investigated in this study 150 2200 people and with a similar electric grid mix of the united states sbrs exhibited higher global warming potential impacts relative to od and ea systems due to higher n2o emissions and higher energy intensities comparisons of mechanical wrrf and lagoon environmental impacts were sensitive to system lifespans and the type of electrical grid mix being used if lagoons only operate for a short lifespan of 10 years or less they may exhibit similar environmental impacts to mechanical wrrfs for select impact categories likewise local electrical grid mixes with high percentages of renewable energy 75 lead to mechanical wrrfs having similar impacts

16156,harmful cyanobacterial blooms hcbs mainly caused by eutrophication have deleterious impacts on water resources and pose a great threat to human health and natural ecosystems thus an environmentally friendly method to inhibit hcbs is urgently needed learning from nature herein natural product cercosporin produced by the fungi cercospora to damage plant cells under natural sunlight was developed as a powerful photosensitive algicidal reagent to inhibit hcbs microcystis aeruginosa could be severely inactivated by 20 μm cercosporin in 36 h with 95 inhibition ratio under 23 w compact fluorescent light irradiation further mechanism investigation showed that algal cell walls and membranes along with the antioxidant and photosynthetic systems were damaged via two mechanisms those being reactive oxygen species generation and cell adsorption more importantly the practical applicability of cercosporin was demonstrated by its effectiveness in a 2 l scale photoinactivation experiment using cyanobacterial blooms from taihu lake china under natural sunlight with a lower dosage of cercosporin 7 5 μm this study established the bifunctional mechanisms by which cercosporin inactivates hcbs opening design possibilities for the development of novel photosensitive algicidal reagents to control hcbs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cercosporin photosensitive inactivation harmful cyanobacterial blooms reactive oxygen species cell adsorption 1 introduction harmful cyanobacterial blooms hcbs have become a global environmental problem due to their deleterious impacts on freshwater ecosystems heisler et al 2008 huisman et al 2018 paerl and otten 2013 treuer et al 2021 which are often associated with eutrophication caused by the discharge of domestic sewage industrial sewage and livestock and poultry wastewater what is more serious is that persistent eutrophication and global warming further exacerbates cyanobacterial blooms for example lake erie in the united states bullerjahn et al 2016 taihu lake in china an et al 2021 and lake zürich in switzerland walsby et al 2006 have been seriously affected by regular hcbs over recent decades among the toxic species responsible for hcbs including microcystis bullerjahn et al 2016 qin et al 2010 aphanizomenon makarewicz 1993 dolichospermum huisman et al 2018 cylindrospermopsis antunes et al 2015 nodularia kahru and elmgren 2014 planktothrix walsby et al 2006 and trichodesmium bergman et al 2013 microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa is one of the most dominant and harmful cyanobacteria that produce cyanotoxins leading to several digestive skin and neurological diseases harke et al 2016 therefore the effective and timely control of m aeruginosa which is one of the most common and harmful algae is a top priority for the management of freshwater bodies worldwide various methods divided into physical chemical and biological methods have been adopted to address hcbs although physical barros et al 2015 matter et al 2019 biological sun et al 2018 and traditional chemical oxidation methods matthijs et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a have been developed and implemented to control the growth of algae each has disadvantages that cannot be ignored such as high costs lack of stability and generation of secondary pollutions recently photooxidation methods that use sunlight to drive strong oxidation capacities have been recognized as prospects for hcbsinactivation applications metal based photosensitizers including semiconductors and homogeneous heavy metal salts such as cuo alho et al 2020 and tio2 wang et al 2018 have commonly been used in hcbs inactivation these photosensitizers have strong photophysical properties to inactivate hcbs however they tend to be expensive and can cause toxic heavy metal pollution thus the development of small molecular organic photosensitizers that have low costs and low toxicity as well as outstanding capabilities as sustainable alternatives to photoinactivate hcbs has attracted great interest there are naturally occurring eco friendly solutions for the development of organic photosensitizers to inactivate hcbs cercosporin cp is a representative example of perylenequinonoid derivatives pqds with outstanding photocatalytic activities and has been well studied in photodynamic therapy diwu and lown 1993 and chemical transformations li et al 2019 2021 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b c cp is synthesized and secreted by the fungi cercospora and has the ability to infect and destroy plant cells to obtain nutrients for cercospora propagation under natural sunlight daub and ehrenshaft 2000 daub et al 2005 cp is believed to infect and destroy plant cells by generating reactive oxygen species ros including singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh under natural sunlight and inserting ros directly into plant cells to damage the cells daub and ehrenshaft 2000 daub et al 2005 because the harmful algae responsible for hcbs share many similarities with plant cells particularly their photosystems we envisaged that the cell degrading properties of cp might be used to photoinactivate algae with great efficacy specifically we expected it to be effective against the most dominant and harmful cyanobacteria m aeruginosa fig 1 which had never been investigated before herein we developed cercosporin as a powerful algicidal reagent to effectively photoinactivate m aeruginosa by destroying cell walls and membranes the antioxidant system and the photosystem the effects of the algicide on actual cyanobacterial blooms from taihu lake were investigated showing that cp was an effective algicide even at low doses finally systematic experiments determined that cp destroyed cyanobacteria via two mechanisms ros generation and cell adsorption this study will open new possibilities for the development of eco friendly reagents for the control of hcbs 2 materials

sp8 leica microsystems inc wetzlar germany the detailed descriptions of analytical methods are provided in the electronic supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 photoinactivation activity of cercosporin firstly to test our hypothesis that cercosporin possesses the ability to photoinactivate harmful algae its algicidal activities against m aeruginosa using 20 μm cp was compared to other commonly reported and readily available perylenequinonoids fig 2 a including ha diwu and lown 1992 qi et al 2019 hb diwu and lown 1992 jiang et al 2014 and ec weiss et al 1965 under an irradiation of 23 w from a compact fluorescent light cfl via cell counts all tested algicidal compounds had inhibitory effects on m aeruginosa but cp produced the strongest inhibition with a cell survival rate of 4 99 2 34 after 36 h fig 2b s1 and s2 then different concentrations 1 25 2 5 5 10 and 20 μm of cp were evaluated under 23 w cfl irradiation it showed that the survival rates of m aeruginosa decreased marginally with the incremental cp concentrations from 1 25 to 5 μm and concentrations of cp ranging between 10 and 20 μm resulted in significant inhibition of algal growth after 36 h fig 2c therefore 20 μm cp was selected for the subsequent light source investigation the growth of m aeruginosa was examined under 5 15 23 and 32 w cfl irradiation as well as in the dark to test the effects of light source on cp algicidal activity it was found that algicidal activity was dependent on light power fig 2d and the survival rate decreased to 4 99 2 34 and 4 73 1 13 under 23 and 32 w cfl irradiation respectively thus 23 w cfl was chosen as the optimal light source considering its similar inhibitory effect and better energy efficiency compared with 32 w cfl surprisingly the algal cells were also partially inhibited in the dark treatment where the survival rate was 60 73 3 13 in the 20 μm cp treatment compared to the control based on the above results we concluded that cp had strong algicidal potential and it was able to effectively damage the harmful m aeruginosa cells at 20 μm cp under 23 w cfl illumination conditions which were selected for further experiments 3 2 effects of cp on morphology of algae in order to better understand the mechanisms by which cp inactivated m aeruginosa morphological changes of m aeruginosa were successively observed by optical microscopy 1000 sem and tem in the 6 well experimental plates the color of the culture suspension clearly changed from green to transparent from 0 h to 36 h in the cp treatment fig 3 a while the color of the control group remained green similar trends were observed using optical microscopy fig 3b consistent with the survival rate under the dark conditions fig 2d the growth of m aeruginosa was partially inactivated fig 3c and 3d and some m aeruginosa cells were observed using optical microscopy fig 3d to better demonstrate the algicidal process of m aeruginosa the ultrastructural changes in the algal samples were determined using sem and tem based on sem images of m aeruginosa cells as shown in fig 4 a the cells had healthy ellipsoidal shapes with smooth cell surfaces in the control group while in the cp treatment there were a few deformed algal cells and inactivated cells without intact walls and membranes after 12 h more inactivated cells became apparent at 24 h and most of algal cells were completely ruptured after 36 h in the cp treatment which was consistent with the inactivation results from cell counting and observations via optical microscopy surprisingly the number of bacillus increased over time probably because they were able to use the leaked cell contents of damaged m aeruginosa as nutrients for propagation which has also been observed in previous reports lee et al 2020 next tem was carried out to provide more direct evidence for the effect of cp on destroying the cell walls membranes and thylakoids of algal cells fig 4b the control group contained healthy cells with complete cell characteristics including intact cell membranes and walls homogenous cytoplasm and clearly visible thylakoids however after 12 h in the cp treatment the algal cells exhibited an obvious plasmolysis like phenomenon and had slightly indistinct thylakoids at 24 h the cells had partially fractured walls and membranes indicated by arrows in the figure and intracellular content was indistinct finally after 36 h of cp treatment complete collapse of cell walls and membranes along with the cytoplasmic leakage was found under continuous dark conditions sem and tem showed that algal inactivation was a fraction of that seen in the experimental groups under irradiation by visible light fig s3 these results showed that cp had excellent algicidal performance and acted through damaging cell walls membranes and thylakoids resulting in cytoplasmic leakage which was similar to a necrosis like cell death mode yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 3 3 effects of cp treatment on algal cell walls and membranes flow cytometry was first employed to determine the integrity of cell walls and membranes fig s4 the m1 and m2 regions represent living algal cells with intact membranes and inactivated algal cells with damaged membranes respectively with the passage of time the fluorescence intensity of the m1 region remained high in the control group in the experimental group the fluorescence intensity of the m1 region decreased dramatically from 96 1 to 0 3 implying that cp had greatly altered the algal cell membranes under visible light irradiation moreover the fluorescence intensity of the m1 region was partially reduced from 98 2 to 53 3 by cp under the dark conditions fig s5 the above flow cytometry results are summarized in fig 5 a and s6a and the inactivation trends were similar to those counted using the hemocytometer fig 2d since the ultrastructure change of m aeruginosa indicated the damage of cell walls and membranes the main components of algal walls and membranes i e lipids fatty acids and peptidoglycan were identified as candidate targets to study the effects of cp mda an indicator of lipid peroxidation levels was measured fig 5b the mda level of m aeruginosa in the cp treatment was markedly higher than that of the control group after 24 h however from 24 h to 36 h the mda level of the experimental group decreased probably due to the low cell density under the continuous dark conditions the mda levels increased gradually fig s6b the change of mda level indicated that cp alone could also induce the inactivation of m aeruginosa via damaging the algal cell walls and membranes to further study the effects of cp on fatty acids gc ms technology was used to measure them in different treatments over time as shown in fig 5c the fatty acid composition of algal cells after cp treatment was very different from that of the control group in the control group 9 kinds of fatty acids were detected including saturated fractions c12 0 c14 0 c15 0 c16 0 c17 0 and c18 0 as well as unsaturated fatty acid fractions c16 1 c18 3 and c18 1 among these fatty acids the amounts of unsaturated fatty acids c16 1 c18 3 and c18 1 decreased dramatically and c16 1 became undetectable after photosensitive algae removal in contrast the saturated fatty acids c14 0 c17 0 and c18 0 showed no obvious change and the amounts of the other saturated fatty acids c12 0 c15 0 and c16 0 decreased slightly under the dark conditions only fatty acids c15 0 and c16 0 were observed to decrease while the other fatty acids remained constant fig s6c these results further indicated that cp s destructive effect on cell membranes with the light irradiation mainly operated through the photooxidation of unsaturated fatty acids lc ms was also employed to directly analyze the lipid compositions before and after cp treatment as shown in fig s7 and table s2 several lipids including digalactosyl diacylglycerol dgdg sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol sqdg and phosphatidylglycerol pg could be detected in the lipid extracts of the control group based on a comparison of the lipid compositions of the control and experimental groups using the lc ms results eight peaks disappeared completely with cp treatment at retention times of 1 05 11 11 11 33 11 49 11 91 12 55 12 85 and 13 11 min which were speculated to be two dgdgs ohc36 4 and ohc36 6 five sqdgs c34 1 c34 2 c34 3 c34 4 and c34 5 and one pg c34 7 according to the results under the dark conditions one dgdg ohc36 6 and two sqdgs c34 2 and c34 3 were also degraded fig s8 and table s3 these results indicated that cp inactivated algal cells by degrading lipids in the cell membrane next the influence of cp on the structure of peptidoglycan was studied using ftir peptidoglycan is an alternating polymer containing n acetylglucose coramine glcnac and n acetylpicoic acid murnac units linked by β 1 4 glycosidic bonds firczuk and bochtler 2007 and its typical vibration absorption peaks include νoh and ν nh at 3500 3200 cm 1 ν ch at 3000 2800 cm 1 ν co at 1660 1620 cm 1 and ν cc ν co and ν cn at 1400 900 cm 1 indeed the control group had peaks that were consistent with these typical peaks reported in the literature jiang et al 2012 however the peak at 3350 cm 1 was lower in the treatment group than in the control group suggesting that the saccharides in the peptidoglycan had been degraded meanwhile new peaks appeared at 1204 1148 699 636 and 551 cm 1 indicating the introduction of new functional groups derived from the phenol groups of the initially added cp fig s9a also similar results were obtained under the dark conditions fig s9b thus the changes in the ftir spectra showed that peptidoglycan was degraded and cp was embedded in the algal cell walls subsequently iom and eom were measured to investigate the permeability of the cell walls and membranes by comparing these two measurements the leakage of organic matter caused by damage to cell walls and membranes can be obtained the fluorescence spectra of iom and eom in m aeruginosa are depicted in fig s10 peak a λex λem 220 330 nm peak b λex λem 280 330 nm peak c λex λem 270 470 nm and peak d λex λem 360 470 nm were observed in the iom of the control group in the cp treatment groups peaks a b c and d gradually decreased as time went on disappearing entirely by 36 h meanwhile peaks b c and d could be observed in the eom of the control group while in the experimental group these peaks exhibited increasing and then decreasing tendencies fluorescence regional integration fri was further employed to quantitatively analyze the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence of the iom and eom the eem was divided into five fluorescent component regions including the tyrosine like region i tryptophan like region ii fulvic acid like region iii microbial protein like region iv and humic acid like region v regions fig 5d and e the total fluorescence intensities of iom decreased dramatically in the cp treatment while those of the eom in the cp treatment initially increased and then declined during the photoinactivation of m aeruginosa this provided a visual representation of iom and eom throughout the process the fluorescence spectra and fri of iom and eom indicated that organic matter would leak through the damaged cell walls and membranes after the addition of cp when combined with light irradiation moreover the iom and eom results indicated that organic matter also leaked from the cell under continuous dark conditions fig s6d s6e and s11 in general these results indicated that cp inhibited the growth of m aeruginosa through the destruction of lipids fatty acids and peptidoglycan of algal cell walls and membranes no matter in the presence or absence of light irradiation 3 4 effects of cp on the antioxidant system of algal cells sod and cat are considered to be indicators of changes in the antioxidant system of algal cells because they are important environmental stress response enzymes fig 6 showed that sod and cat activities increased significantly during the first 12 h of the 20 μm cp treatment and then decreased gradually during the latter 24 h the increasing trend indicated a response to the ros generated by cp and the declining trend in the later period might have resulted from the ros exceeding the antioxidant capacity and damaging the antioxidant system as the algal cells were inactivated therefore these results suggested that the photosensitive algicidal activity of cp worked through the continuous ros generation as illustrated by the response and eventual collapse of the antioxidant system 3 5 effects of cp on photosystem of algal cells to study the effects of cp on the photosystem of m aeruginosa we first measured the change in chlorophyll a and carotenoids in algal cells these are important pigments that are closely related to algal growth and light harvesting capacity due to their roles in the energy transfer and light energy conversion processes in photosynthesis xiong et al 2017 the contents of both chlorophyll a and carotenoids in algal cells were significantly lower in the 20 μm cp treatment compared to the control group fig 7 a and 7b this indicated that as m aeruginosa was inactivated chlorophyll a and carotenoids were degraded leading to photosynthetic dysfunction additionally the group of water soluble light harvesting pbps in the photosystem that capture light energy mainly including pc apc and pe watanabe and ikeuchi 2013 were analyzed to investigate the effects of cp on the photosystem during the photosensitive treatment it was found that the contents of pc apc and pe decreased rapidly within 12 h and then continued to gradually decrease further dropping to 0 10 0 02 0 08 0 008 and 0 09 0 04 from 12 h to 36 h fig 7c 7d and 7e this indicated that all the pbps in the algae were degraded by cp fig 7f therefore these results add to the evidence that cp greatly influences algal photosystems and in addition to damaging chlorophyll a and carotenoids pigments it also degrades the pbps of m aeruginosa resulting in the severe inhibition of algal growth under the visible light irradiation 3 6 practical application in order to investigate the practical feasibility of applying this photosensitive algicidal process we carried out a 2 l scale up experiment under natural sunlight 14 25 mw cm2 using fresh algae collected from taihu lake to replicate an actual cyanobacterial bloom note that both 20 μm and 7 5 μm cp treatments were investigated in the practical application experiments to assess the effectiveness of high and low cp concentrations fig s12a the number of fluorescent spots fig s12b and the fluorescent integrated densities fig s13a were significantly lower in the 7 5 and 20 μm cp experimental groups compared to the control group moreover the chlorophyll a content showed similar decreasing trends due to cp treatment fig s13b surprisingly 7 5 μm cp had excellent inhibition effects in the practical application to algae from taihu lake next we measured the residual amount of cp in the culture medium to determine whether this method would be a source of secondary pollution to our delight cp was not detectable in the culture medium after 36 h of the 20 μm cp treatment group and not detectable after 18 h in the 7 5 μm cp group fig s13c and fig s15 indicating that cp might not cause secondary pollution after its application as a photosensitive algicidal in natural ecosystems 3 7 mechanism investigation of algicidal effects of cp to algal cells to determine the inactivation mechanism we first conducted ros quenching experiments using pbq ipa and dabco to capture the superoxide radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively the algicidal effects of cp were significantly inhibited by pbq while ipa and dabco had little impact on the algicidal effect fig 8 a and table s4 meanwhile all these quenching reagents could not inhibit the inactivation of algae in the dark fig s16 and table s4 the distribution of cp in the culture medium and algal cells was then determined with cp treatment under the irradiation of visible light the cp content in the culture medium decreased dramatically during the first 18 h and was completely undetectable after 24 h notably cp could be detected in algal cells and its content exhibited an upward followed by a downward trend reaching its peak at 18 h fig 8b 8c s17 and s18 under the dark conditions the cp content in the culture medium also showed a decrease while that in algal cells showed a continuously increasing trend this suggested that the cp in culture medium was gradually absorbed by the algal cells and then degraded in both the culture medium and cells when in the presence of light confocal microscopy was also employed to further validate the adsorption of cp because both cp and m aeruginosa exhibit absorption under visible light their different excitation and emission wavelengths first had to be established cp and m aeruginosa were scanned with a confocal microscope in lambda mode and their maximal emission and excitation wavelengths were determined with the circular selection tool fig s19 from the excitation and emission spectra we found that the fluorescence of chlorophyll a could be observed alone at an excitation wavelength of 640 nm while the fluorescence of both chlorophyll a and cp could be observed at an excitation wavelength of 570 nm thus using the difference between these fluorescence results we could observe the distribution of cp and chlorophyll a in the algal cells and culture medium according to the cp content in algal cells algae treated with cp for 18 h maximal content and 36 h minimal content were selected for the following experiments fig 8d shows that cell fluorescence was only apparent at 570 nm and not 640 nm in the experimental group after cp treatment for 18 h and 36 h indicating that the chlorophyll a had dissipated and the fluorescence came only from cp at 18 h and 36 h this result clearly demonstrated that cp had been absorbed into the m aeruginosa furthermore the fluorescence intensity gradually decreased which was consistent with the downward trend in cp content in algal cells from 18 h to 36 h fig 8b and 8c moreover both healthy and inactivated algae were simultaneously observed after the cp treatment for 36 h in the dark fig 8d these experiments provide an important basic understanding of the mechanisms by which cp photoinactivates m aeruginosa which will help inform management decisions in real world applications 4 discussion compared with the other types of algal inactivating agents such as the oxidant h2o2 192 h zhou et al 2018 or the herbicides triclopyr 96 h and diclofop 96 h ma et al 2010 the algal inactivation by cp in this study required much less time 36 h table s5 even in the photoinactivation area cp also exhibits better algal inactivation efficiency compared with nq 2 0 96 h lee et al 2018 methylene blue 120 h drábková et al 2007 and tvp a 72 h yue et al 2021 table s5 which probably could be attributed to the higher singlet oxygen quantum yield of cp 0 81 diwu and lown 1992 than those of the other photosensitizers e g 0 57 for mb xu et al 2021 at the same time the unexpected inhibition observed under the dark conditions 39 inactivation rate suggested that cp inhibited the growth of m aeruginosa cells via two distinct mechanisms one being light dependent ros generation while the other was the light independent cell adsorption this supported previous observations on the infection and damage of plant cells by cp daub and ehrenshaft 2000 the light dependent ros generation mechanism was directly verified through ros quenching experiments the strong inhibition result of pbq with visible light indicated that o2 was the primary driver of the photoalgicidal activity fig 8a and table s4 because pbq was a specific scavenger of o2 in contrast the invalid inhibition result of pbq under the dark conditions confirmed this light dependent ros generation mechanism additionally observations of algal cell morphology examining algal cell walls and membranes in different treatments in the presence or absence of visible light indicated that the generated ros played an important role in the photoinactivation process it appeared that this ros generation led to severe damage to cell walls and membranes as well as the antioxidant and photosynthetic systems on the other hand the abnormal inhibition of algal growth under the dark conditions and the corresponding morphological changes of algal cells indicated there was a cp adsorption mechanism this was clearly supported by the distribution of cp in algal cells as well as the confocal microscopy fig 8 the detection of cp in algal cells provided the solid evidence for the cp adsorption mechanism additionally the results from confocal microscopy under the dark conditions again suggested that the cp adsorption could occur without the light irradiation interestingly cp adsorption under the dark conditions exhibited the partial damage to cell walls and membranes relative to that with visible light as shown by flow cytometry mda level lipids fatty acids peptidoglycan iom and eom measurements based on these experimental results the mechanisms of algicidal activity of cp to photoinactivate m aeruginosa were proposed fig 9 by exploring the abilities of the naturally occurring product cp to damage plant cells we found that cp used two naturally evolved mechanisms ros generation and cell adsorption on the one hand cp activates oxygen to the o2 under the irradiation of visible light to attack the algal cells via the ros generation mechanism on the other hand cp could be absorbed into the algae to promote the damage of cell walls and membranes which could also generate the ros in algal cells at the same time to facilitate the photoinactivation the photoinactivation process involving these two mechanisms destroys the cell walls cell membranes antioxidant systems and photosystems of the algae 5 conclusions in conclusion this study has demonstrated that the natural product cercosporin is a bifunctional photosensitizer with excellent photosensitive inhibitory effects on m aeruginosa in the presence of visible light cp inactivated algal cells with 95 inhibition rate in 36 h by damaging cell walls and membranes along with the antioxidant and photosynthetic systems a 2 l scale up experiment of fresh algae from taihu lake under natural sunlight was successfully carried out to prove the feasibility of applying this photosensitizer cp demonstrated excellent algicidal performance

16156,harmful cyanobacterial blooms hcbs mainly caused by eutrophication have deleterious impacts on water resources and pose a great threat to human health and natural ecosystems thus an environmentally friendly method to inhibit hcbs is urgently needed learning from nature herein natural product cercosporin produced by the fungi cercospora to damage plant cells under natural sunlight was developed as a powerful photosensitive algicidal reagent to inhibit hcbs microcystis aeruginosa could be severely inactivated by 20 μm cercosporin in 36 h with 95 inhibition ratio under 23 w compact fluorescent light irradiation further mechanism investigation showed that algal cell walls and membranes along with the antioxidant and photosynthetic systems were damaged via two mechanisms those being reactive oxygen species generation and cell adsorption more importantly the practical applicability of cercosporin was demonstrated by its effectiveness in a 2 l scale photoinactivation experiment using cyanobacterial blooms from taihu lake china under natural sunlight with a lower dosage of cercosporin 7 5 μm this study established the bifunctional mechanisms by which cercosporin inactivates hcbs opening design possibilities for the development of novel photosensitive algicidal reagents to control hcbs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cercosporin photosensitive inactivation harmful cyanobacterial blooms reactive oxygen species cell adsorption 1 introduction harmful cyanobacterial blooms hcbs have become a global environmental problem due to their deleterious impacts on freshwater ecosystems heisler et al 2008 huisman et al 2018 paerl and otten 2013 treuer et al 2021 which are often associated with eutrophication caused by the discharge of domestic sewage industrial sewage and livestock and poultry wastewater what is more serious is that persistent eutrophication and global warming further exacerbates cyanobacterial blooms for example lake erie in the united states bullerjahn et al 2016 taihu lake in china an et al 2021 and lake zürich in switzerland walsby et al 2006 have been seriously affected by regular hcbs over recent decades among the toxic species responsible for hcbs including microcystis bullerjahn et al 2016 qin et al 2010 aphanizomenon makarewicz 1993 dolichospermum huisman et al 2018 cylindrospermopsis antunes et al 2015 nodularia kahru and elmgren 2014 planktothrix walsby et al 2006 and trichodesmium bergman et al 2013 microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa is one of the most dominant and harmful cyanobacteria that produce cyanotoxins leading to several digestive skin and neurological diseases harke et al 2016 therefore the effective and timely control of m aeruginosa which is one of the most common and harmful algae is a top priority for the management of freshwater bodies worldwide various methods divided into physical chemical and biological methods have been adopted to address hcbs although physical barros et al 2015 matter et al 2019 biological sun et al 2018 and traditional chemical oxidation methods matthijs et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a have been developed and implemented to control the growth of algae each has disadvantages that cannot be ignored such as high costs lack of stability and generation of secondary pollutions recently photooxidation methods that use sunlight to drive strong oxidation capacities have been recognized as prospects for hcbsinactivation applications metal based photosensitizers including semiconductors and homogeneous heavy metal salts such as cuo alho et al 2020 and tio2 wang et al 2018 have commonly been used in hcbs inactivation these photosensitizers have strong photophysical properties to inactivate hcbs however they tend to be expensive and can cause toxic heavy metal pollution thus the development of small molecular organic photosensitizers that have low costs and low toxicity as well as outstanding capabilities as sustainable alternatives to photoinactivate hcbs has attracted great interest there are naturally occurring eco friendly solutions for the development of organic photosensitizers to inactivate hcbs cercosporin cp is a representative example of perylenequinonoid derivatives pqds with outstanding photocatalytic activities and has been well studied in photodynamic therapy diwu and lown 1993 and chemical transformations li et al 2019 2021 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b c cp is synthesized and secreted by the fungi cercospora and has the ability to infect and destroy plant cells to obtain nutrients for cercospora propagation under natural sunlight daub and ehrenshaft 2000 daub et al 2005 cp is believed to infect and destroy plant cells by generating reactive oxygen species ros including singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh under natural sunlight and inserting ros directly into plant cells to damage the cells daub and ehrenshaft 2000 daub et al 2005 because the harmful algae responsible for hcbs share many similarities with plant cells particularly their photosystems we envisaged that the cell degrading properties of cp might be used to photoinactivate algae with great efficacy specifically we expected it to be effective against the most dominant and harmful cyanobacteria m aeruginosa fig 1 which had never been investigated before herein we developed cercosporin as a powerful algicidal reagent to effectively photoinactivate m aeruginosa by destroying cell walls and membranes the antioxidant system and the photosystem the effects of the algicide on actual cyanobacterial blooms from taihu lake were investigated showing that cp was an effective algicide even at low doses finally systematic experiments determined that cp destroyed cyanobacteria via two mechanisms ros generation and cell adsorption this study will open new possibilities for the development of eco friendly reagents for the control of hcbs 2 materials

sp8 leica microsystems inc wetzlar germany the detailed descriptions of analytical methods are provided in the electronic supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 photoinactivation activity of cercosporin firstly to test our hypothesis that cercosporin possesses the ability to photoinactivate harmful algae its algicidal activities against m aeruginosa using 20 μm cp was compared to other commonly reported and readily available perylenequinonoids fig 2 a including ha diwu and lown 1992 qi et al 2019 hb diwu and lown 1992 jiang et al 2014 and ec weiss et al 1965 under an irradiation of 23 w from a compact fluorescent light cfl via cell counts all tested algicidal compounds had inhibitory effects on m aeruginosa but cp produced the strongest inhibition with a cell survival rate of 4 99 2 34 after 36 h fig 2b s1 and s2 then different concentrations 1 25 2 5 5 10 and 20 μm of cp were evaluated under 23 w cfl irradiation it showed that the survival rates of m aeruginosa decreased marginally with the incremental cp concentrations from 1 25 to 5 μm and concentrations of cp ranging between 10 and 20 μm resulted in significant inhibition of algal growth after 36 h fig 2c therefore 20 μm cp was selected for the subsequent light source investigation the growth of m aeruginosa was examined under 5 15 23 and 32 w cfl irradiation as well as in the dark to test the effects of light source on cp algicidal activity it was found that algicidal activity was dependent on light power fig 2d and the survival rate decreased to 4 99 2 34 and 4 73 1 13 under 23 and 32 w cfl irradiation respectively thus 23 w cfl was chosen as the optimal light source considering its similar inhibitory effect and better energy efficiency compared with 32 w cfl surprisingly the algal cells were also partially inhibited in the dark treatment where the survival rate was 60 73 3 13 in the 20 μm cp treatment compared to the control based on the above results we concluded that cp had strong algicidal potential and it was able to effectively damage the harmful m aeruginosa cells at 20 μm cp under 23 w cfl illumination conditions which were selected for further experiments 3 2 effects of cp on morphology of algae in order to better understand the mechanisms by which cp inactivated m aeruginosa morphological changes of m aeruginosa were successively observed by optical microscopy 1000 sem and tem in the 6 well experimental plates the color of the culture suspension clearly changed from green to transparent from 0 h to 36 h in the cp treatment fig 3 a while the color of the control group remained green similar trends were observed using optical microscopy fig 3b consistent with the survival rate under the dark conditions fig 2d the growth of m aeruginosa was partially inactivated fig 3c and 3d and some m aeruginosa cells were observed using optical microscopy fig 3d to better demonstrate the algicidal process of m aeruginosa the ultrastructural changes in the algal samples were determined using sem and tem based on sem images of m aeruginosa cells as shown in fig 4 a the cells had healthy ellipsoidal shapes with smooth cell surfaces in the control group while in the cp treatment there were a few deformed algal cells and inactivated cells without intact walls and membranes after 12 h more inactivated cells became apparent at 24 h and most of algal cells were completely ruptured after 36 h in the cp treatment which was consistent with the inactivation results from cell counting and observations via optical microscopy surprisingly the number of bacillus increased over time probably because they were able to use the leaked cell contents of damaged m aeruginosa as nutrients for propagation which has also been observed in previous reports lee et al 2020 next tem was carried out to provide more direct evidence for the effect of cp on destroying the cell walls membranes and thylakoids of algal cells fig 4b the control group contained healthy cells with complete cell characteristics including intact cell membranes and walls homogenous cytoplasm and clearly visible thylakoids however after 12 h in the cp treatment the algal cells exhibited an obvious plasmolysis like phenomenon and had slightly indistinct thylakoids at 24 h the cells had partially fractured walls and membranes indicated by arrows in the figure and intracellular content was indistinct finally after 36 h of cp treatment complete collapse of cell walls and membranes along with the cytoplasmic leakage was found under continuous dark conditions sem and tem showed that algal inactivation was a fraction of that seen in the experimental groups under irradiation by visible light fig s3 these results showed that cp had excellent algicidal performance and acted through damaging cell walls membranes and thylakoids resulting in cytoplasmic leakage which was similar to a necrosis like cell death mode yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 3 3 effects of cp treatment on algal cell walls and membranes flow cytometry was first employed to determine the integrity of cell walls and membranes fig s4 the m1 and m2 regions represent living algal cells with intact membranes and inactivated algal cells with damaged membranes respectively with the passage of time the fluorescence intensity of the m1 region remained high in the control group in the experimental group the fluorescence intensity of the m1 region decreased dramatically from 96 1 to 0 3 implying that cp had greatly altered the algal cell membranes under visible light irradiation moreover the fluorescence intensity of the m1 region was partially reduced from 98 2 to 53 3 by cp under the dark conditions fig s5 the above flow cytometry results are summarized in fig 5 a and s6a and the inactivation trends were similar to those counted using the hemocytometer fig 2d since the ultrastructure change of m aeruginosa indicated the damage of cell walls and membranes the main components of algal walls and membranes i e lipids fatty acids and peptidoglycan were identified as candidate targets to study the effects of cp mda an indicator of lipid peroxidation levels was measured fig 5b the mda level of m aeruginosa in the cp treatment was markedly higher than that of the control group after 24 h however from 24 h to 36 h the mda level of the experimental group decreased probably due to the low cell density under the continuous dark conditions the mda levels increased gradually fig s6b the change of mda level indicated that cp alone could also induce the inactivation of m aeruginosa via damaging the algal cell walls and membranes to further study the effects of cp on fatty acids gc ms technology was used to measure them in different treatments over time as shown in fig 5c the fatty acid composition of algal cells after cp treatment was very different from that of the control group in the control group 9 kinds of fatty acids were detected including saturated fractions c12 0 c14 0 c15 0 c16 0 c17 0 and c18 0 as well as unsaturated fatty acid fractions c16 1 c18 3 and c18 1 among these fatty acids the amounts of unsaturated fatty acids c16 1 c18 3 and c18 1 decreased dramatically and c16 1 became undetectable after photosensitive algae removal in contrast the saturated fatty acids c14 0 c17 0 and c18 0 showed no obvious change and the amounts of the other saturated fatty acids c12 0 c15 0 and c16 0 decreased slightly under the dark conditions only fatty acids c15 0 and c16 0 were observed to decrease while the other fatty acids remained constant fig s6c these results further indicated that cp s destructive effect on cell membranes with the light irradiation mainly operated through the photooxidation of unsaturated fatty acids lc ms was also employed to directly analyze the lipid compositions before and after cp treatment as shown in fig s7 and table s2 several lipids including digalactosyl diacylglycerol dgdg sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol sqdg and phosphatidylglycerol pg could be detected in the lipid extracts of the control group based on a comparison of the lipid compositions of the control and experimental groups using the lc ms results eight peaks disappeared completely with cp treatment at retention times of 1 05 11 11 11 33 11 49 11 91 12 55 12 85 and 13 11 min which were speculated to be two dgdgs ohc36 4 and ohc36 6 five sqdgs c34 1 c34 2 c34 3 c34 4 and c34 5 and one pg c34 7 according to the results under the dark conditions one dgdg ohc36 6 and two sqdgs c34 2 and c34 3 were also degraded fig s8 and table s3 these results indicated that cp inactivated algal cells by degrading lipids in the cell membrane next the influence of cp on the structure of peptidoglycan was studied using ftir peptidoglycan is an alternating polymer containing n acetylglucose coramine glcnac and n acetylpicoic acid murnac units linked by β 1 4 glycosidic bonds firczuk and bochtler 2007 and its typical vibration absorption peaks include νoh and ν nh at 3500 3200 cm 1 ν ch at 3000 2800 cm 1 ν co at 1660 1620 cm 1 and ν cc ν co and ν cn at 1400 900 cm 1 indeed the control group had peaks that were consistent with these typical peaks reported in the literature jiang et al 2012 however the peak at 3350 cm 1 was lower in the treatment group than in the control group suggesting that the saccharides in the peptidoglycan had been degraded meanwhile new peaks appeared at 1204 1148 699 636 and 551 cm 1 indicating the introduction of new functional groups derived from the phenol groups of the initially added cp fig s9a also similar results were obtained under the dark conditions fig s9b thus the changes in the ftir spectra showed that peptidoglycan was degraded and cp was embedded in the algal cell walls subsequently iom and eom were measured to investigate the permeability of the cell walls and membranes by comparing these two measurements the leakage of organic matter caused by damage to cell walls and membranes can be obtained the fluorescence spectra of iom and eom in m aeruginosa are depicted in fig s10 peak a λex λem 220 330 nm peak b λex λem 280 330 nm peak c λex λem 270 470 nm and peak d λex λem 360 470 nm were observed in the iom of the control group in the cp treatment groups peaks a b c and d gradually decreased as time went on disappearing entirely by 36 h meanwhile peaks b c and d could be observed in the eom of the control group while in the experimental group these peaks exhibited increasing and then decreasing tendencies fluorescence regional integration fri was further employed to quantitatively analyze the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence of the iom and eom the eem was divided into five fluorescent component regions including the tyrosine like region i tryptophan like region ii fulvic acid like region iii microbial protein like region iv and humic acid like region v regions fig 5d and e the total fluorescence intensities of iom decreased dramatically in the cp treatment while those of the eom in the cp treatment initially increased and then declined during the photoinactivation of m aeruginosa this provided a visual representation of iom and eom throughout the process the fluorescence spectra and fri of iom and eom indicated that organic matter would leak through the damaged cell walls and membranes after the addition of cp when combined with light irradiation moreover the iom and eom results indicated that organic matter also leaked from the cell under continuous dark conditions fig s6d s6e and s11 in general these results indicated that cp inhibited the growth of m aeruginosa through the destruction of lipids fatty acids and peptidoglycan of algal cell walls and membranes no matter in the presence or absence of light irradiation 3 4 effects of cp on the antioxidant system of algal cells sod and cat are considered to be indicators of changes in the antioxidant system of algal cells because they are important environmental stress response enzymes fig 6 showed that sod and cat activities increased significantly during the first 12 h of the 20 μm cp treatment and then decreased gradually during the latter 24 h the increasing trend indicated a response to the ros generated by cp and the declining trend in the later period might have resulted from the ros exceeding the antioxidant capacity and damaging the antioxidant system as the algal cells were inactivated therefore these results suggested that the photosensitive algicidal activity of cp worked through the continuous ros generation as illustrated by the response and eventual collapse of the antioxidant system 3 5 effects of cp on photosystem of algal cells to study the effects of cp on the photosystem of m aeruginosa we first measured the change in chlorophyll a and carotenoids in algal cells these are important pigments that are closely related to algal growth and light harvesting capacity due to their roles in the energy transfer and light energy conversion processes in photosynthesis xiong et al 2017 the contents of both chlorophyll a and carotenoids in algal cells were significantly lower in the 20 μm cp treatment compared to the control group fig 7 a and 7b this indicated that as m aeruginosa was inactivated chlorophyll a and carotenoids were degraded leading to photosynthetic dysfunction additionally the group of water soluble light harvesting pbps in the photosystem that capture light energy mainly including pc apc and pe watanabe and ikeuchi 2013 were analyzed to investigate the effects of cp on the photosystem during the photosensitive treatment it was found that the contents of pc apc and pe decreased rapidly within 12 h and then continued to gradually decrease further dropping to 0 10 0 02 0 08 0 008 and 0 09 0 04 from 12 h to 36 h fig 7c 7d and 7e this indicated that all the pbps in the algae were degraded by cp fig 7f therefore these results add to the evidence that cp greatly influences algal photosystems and in addition to damaging chlorophyll a and carotenoids pigments it also degrades the pbps of m aeruginosa resulting in the severe inhibition of algal growth under the visible light irradiation 3 6 practical application in order to investigate the practical feasibility of applying this photosensitive algicidal process we carried out a 2 l scale up experiment under natural sunlight 14 25 mw cm2 using fresh algae collected from taihu lake to replicate an actual cyanobacterial bloom note that both 20 μm and 7 5 μm cp treatments were investigated in the practical application experiments to assess the effectiveness of high and low cp concentrations fig s12a the number of fluorescent spots fig s12b and the fluorescent integrated densities fig s13a were significantly lower in the 7 5 and 20 μm cp experimental groups compared to the control group moreover the chlorophyll a content showed similar decreasing trends due to cp treatment fig s13b surprisingly 7 5 μm cp had excellent inhibition effects in the practical application to algae from taihu lake next we measured the residual amount of cp in the culture medium to determine whether this method would be a source of secondary pollution to our delight cp was not detectable in the culture medium after 36 h of the 20 μm cp treatment group and not detectable after 18 h in the 7 5 μm cp group fig s13c and fig s15 indicating that cp might not cause secondary pollution after its application as a photosensitive algicidal in natural ecosystems 3 7 mechanism investigation of algicidal effects of cp to algal cells to determine the inactivation mechanism we first conducted ros quenching experiments using pbq ipa and dabco to capture the superoxide radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively the algicidal effects of cp were significantly inhibited by pbq while ipa and dabco had little impact on the algicidal effect fig 8 a and table s4 meanwhile all these quenching reagents could not inhibit the inactivation of algae in the dark fig s16 and table s4 the distribution of cp in the culture medium and algal cells was then determined with cp treatment under the irradiation of visible light the cp content in the culture medium decreased dramatically during the first 18 h and was completely undetectable after 24 h notably cp could be detected in algal cells and its content exhibited an upward followed by a downward trend reaching its peak at 18 h fig 8b 8c s17 and s18 under the dark conditions the cp content in the culture medium also showed a decrease while that in algal cells showed a continuously increasing trend this suggested that the cp in culture medium was gradually absorbed by the algal cells and then degraded in both the culture medium and cells when in the presence of light confocal microscopy was also employed to further validate the adsorption of cp because both cp and m aeruginosa exhibit absorption under visible light their different excitation and emission wavelengths first had to be established cp and m aeruginosa were scanned with a confocal microscope in lambda mode and their maximal emission and excitation wavelengths were determined with the circular selection tool fig s19 from the excitation and emission spectra we found that the fluorescence of chlorophyll a could be observed alone at an excitation wavelength of 640 nm while the fluorescence of both chlorophyll a and cp could be observed at an excitation wavelength of 570 nm thus using the difference between these fluorescence results we could observe the distribution of cp and chlorophyll a in the algal cells and culture medium according to the cp content in algal cells algae treated with cp for 18 h maximal content and 36 h minimal content were selected for the following experiments fig 8d shows that cell fluorescence was only apparent at 570 nm and not 640 nm in the experimental group after cp treatment for 18 h and 36 h indicating that the chlorophyll a had dissipated and the fluorescence came only from cp at 18 h and 36 h this result clearly demonstrated that cp had been absorbed into the m aeruginosa furthermore the fluorescence intensity gradually decreased which was consistent with the downward trend in cp content in algal cells from 18 h to 36 h fig 8b and 8c moreover both healthy and inactivated algae were simultaneously observed after the cp treatment for 36 h in the dark fig 8d these experiments provide an important basic understanding of the mechanisms by which cp photoinactivates m aeruginosa which will help inform management decisions in real world applications 4 discussion compared with the other types of algal inactivating agents such as the oxidant h2o2 192 h zhou et al 2018 or the herbicides triclopyr 96 h and diclofop 96 h ma et al 2010 the algal inactivation by cp in this study required much less time 36 h table s5 even in the photoinactivation area cp also exhibits better algal inactivation efficiency compared with nq 2 0 96 h lee et al 2018 methylene blue 120 h drábková et al 2007 and tvp a 72 h yue et al 2021 table s5 which probably could be attributed to the higher singlet oxygen quantum yield of cp 0 81 diwu and lown 1992 than those of the other photosensitizers e g 0 57 for mb xu et al 2021 at the same time the unexpected inhibition observed under the dark conditions 39 inactivation rate suggested that cp inhibited the growth of m aeruginosa cells via two distinct mechanisms one being light dependent ros generation while the other was the light independent cell adsorption this supported previous observations on the infection and damage of plant cells by cp daub and ehrenshaft 2000 the light dependent ros generation mechanism was directly verified through ros quenching experiments the strong inhibition result of pbq with visible light indicated that o2 was the primary driver of the photoalgicidal activity fig 8a and table s4 because pbq was a specific scavenger of o2 in contrast the invalid inhibition result of pbq under the dark conditions confirmed this light dependent ros generation mechanism additionally observations of algal cell morphology examining algal cell walls and membranes in different treatments in the presence or absence of visible light indicated that the generated ros played an important role in the photoinactivation process it appeared that this ros generation led to severe damage to cell walls and membranes as well as the antioxidant and photosynthetic systems on the other hand the abnormal inhibition of algal growth under the dark conditions and the corresponding morphological changes of algal cells indicated there was a cp adsorption mechanism this was clearly supported by the distribution of cp in algal cells as well as the confocal microscopy fig 8 the detection of cp in algal cells provided the solid evidence for the cp adsorption mechanism additionally the results from confocal microscopy under the dark conditions again suggested that the cp adsorption could occur without the light irradiation interestingly cp adsorption under the dark conditions exhibited the partial damage to cell walls and membranes relative to that with visible light as shown by flow cytometry mda level lipids fatty acids peptidoglycan iom and eom measurements based on these experimental results the mechanisms of algicidal activity of cp to photoinactivate m aeruginosa were proposed fig 9 by exploring the abilities of the naturally occurring product cp to damage plant cells we found that cp used two naturally evolved mechanisms ros generation and cell adsorption on the one hand cp activates oxygen to the o2 under the irradiation of visible light to attack the algal cells via the ros generation mechanism on the other hand cp could be absorbed into the algae to promote the damage of cell walls and membranes which could also generate the ros in algal cells at the same time to facilitate the photoinactivation the photoinactivation process involving these two mechanisms destroys the cell walls cell membranes antioxidant systems and photosystems of the algae 5 conclusions in conclusion this study has demonstrated that the natural product cercosporin is a bifunctional photosensitizer with excellent photosensitive inhibitory effects on m aeruginosa in the presence of visible light cp inactivated algal cells with 95 inhibition rate in 36 h by damaging cell walls and membranes along with the antioxidant and photosynthetic systems a 2 l scale up experiment of fresh algae from taihu lake under natural sunlight was successfully carried out to prove the feasibility of applying this photosensitizer cp demonstrated excellent algicidal performance

16157,to achieve the goal of treating mariculture wastewater economically and efficiently a novel bacterial algal coupling reactor bacr integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation was firstly investigated for mariculture wastewater treatment volatile fatty acids vfas generated in the dark chamber migrated into the photo chamber for microalgal utilization which alleviated the ph drop and feedback inhibition of the acidogenic fermentation the maximum dry cell weight dcw of microalgae was 1 46 g l and pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 n and total phosphorus tp in the bacr were effectively removed under the mixotrophic culture condition furthermore bacterial community profiles and functional genes in the bacr and single acidogenic fermentation reactor were identified compared with the single acidogenic fermentation reactor most of the fermentative bacteria e g ruminococcus christensenellaceae r 7 group exiguobacterium pseudomonas and levilinea were enriched by the bacr from the genetic perspective the abundances of dominant genes acka acs and atod associated with acetic propionic and butyric acid production were greatly enhanced

consumption and the reduction of wild fishery resources lu et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 many closed and semi closed mariculture systems along coastal areas are used for farming seafood e g fish and shrimp in china li et al 2017 however a large amount of mariculture wastewater from the water exchange of mariculture systems is discharged during the cultivation of marine organisms gao et al 2021 li et al 2017 mariculture wastewater mainly contains suspended solids dissolved organic matter and nitrogen compounds due to the accumulation of feed residue and fish excretions lu et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 the direct discharge of untreated mariculture wastewater results in serious eutrophication and damage of surrounding estuarine ecosystem pang et al 2021 mariculture wastewater treatment facilities usually include several purifying units namely solids removal units e g sand filter and mechanical filter and biological treatment units for nutrient removal li et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 however the individual treatment of solid waste and effluent not only leads to the complexity of the purifying units but also increases the investment scale zhang et al 2021a hence an alternative approach to treat mariculture wastewater is urgently needed integration of acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation could be an attractive technique for mariculture wastewater treatment acidogenic fermentation is a well established process for resource recovery from organic waste and wastewater in which particle and complex molecules are converted into volatile fatty acids vfas ammonium nh4 n and other products lee et al 2014 pandey et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a microalgae are considered as the great fortune with their usage in food biofuel feed and wastewater treatment and thus it has invited much interest to cultivate microalgae kusmayadi et al 2021 markou and nerantzis 2013 ren et al 2015 the fermentative products contained in acidogenic fermentation effluents can be used as the sources of the nutrient and energy for algal culture many studies proved that microalgae can utilize simple organic carbons e g vfas nh4 n and phosphates for cell growth and biochemical composition accumulation under heterotrophic or mixotrophic culture conditions li and ju 2018 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b in our previous studies mariculture wastewaters were treated through a two stage process of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation in which the fermentation effluent of mariculture wastewater served as the substrate for microalgae culture gao et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a as fermentative bacteria and microalgae grow separately in their respective optimal environments high biomass production and pollutant removal efficiency were obtained with the two stage process however before its use for the cultivation of microalgae the fermentation effluent needs to be sterilized and even it should be diluted with sterile water chen et al 2018 turon et al 2016 these complex pretreatments will certainly increase the operation cost and limit its practical application to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks of the two stage process of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation a novel bacterial algal coupling reactor bacr was designed for mariculture wastewater treatment in this study fig 1 key biochemical indicators such as dry cell weight dcw and cellular compositions can help understand the microalgal biological response in wastewater treatment bertin et al 2010 chun et al 2018 while for bacteria 16s rrna microbial sequencing based functional genes analysis is preferred to explore the mechanism of substrate degradation and energy transfer in fermentation processes guo et al 2018 ping et al 2020 furthermore combined with network analysis which is widely used to decipher the associations among entities the co occurrence patterns between microalgae and bacteria or between functional genes and microbial taxa could be identified huang et al 2020 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 applying these approaches will be helpful for comprehensively understanding the mariculture wastewater treatment with the bacr the objectives of this study were i to evaluate the growth characteristic of microalgae in the bacr ii to investigate the performance of pollutant removal from mariculture wastewater with the bacr iii to analyze the profiles of bacterial community and functional genes in the bacr and iv to explore co occurrence correlations between microalgae and bacteria as well as between functional genes and bacteria and reveal coordination between fermentative bacteria and microalgae in the bacr the findings of this study offered a new insight into mariculture wastewater treatment with the technology of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design and inoculation the schematic of the bacr is depicted in fig 1 the perspex reactor consisted of a dark chamber working volume of 1 5 l and a photo chamber working volume of 1 5 l the dark and photo chambers were used to conduct acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation respectively two chambers were separated by polyethersulfone membranes pore size of 0 22 μm which were fitted between the two chambers the membranes permitted dissolved substances e g vfas n and p to pass freely while excluding microorganisms and particles and its permeability could be adjusted by altering the total membrane area thus microalgae in the photo chamber could utilize the nutrients migrated from the dark chamber through the membranes which would relieve the feedback inhibition of the acidogenic fermentation moreover the bacr avoided the operation like the sterilization and dilution of fermentation effluent in the two stage process of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation aquaculture feed was mixed with seawater to simulate mariculture wastewater the salinity of the simulated mariculture wastewater was 3 0 0 2 which was similar to that of the normal mariculture wastewater the reasons for choosing aquaculture feed to simulate mariculture wastewater and other characteristics of the simulated mariculture wastewater were exhibited in the supporting information anaerobic sludge obtained from the anaerobic digestion tank of haibohe wastewater treatment plant qingdao china was used as the inoculum in the dark chamber it was reported that high salinity could lead to plasmolysis and reduction of cell activity wang et al 2017 to reduce the negative effects of high salinity on bacterial growth the anaerobic sludge was domesticated by gradually increasing the salinity from 0 to 3 0 0 2 prior to inoculation chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa a common strain of microalgae was used as the inoculum in the photo chamber it was obtained from the college of marine life sciences ocean university of china qingdao china before experiments c pyrenoidosa was pre cultivated in the f 2 medium the specific components of the f 2 medium are shown in table s1 s3 2 2 experimental conditions and operation to investigate the performance of mariculture wastewater treatment with the bacr three types of batch experiments were simultaneously performed mariculture wastewater treatment with a single acidogenic fermentation process which was set as the control r0 mariculture wastewater treatments with the bacr in which c pyrenoidosa was cultivated under mixotrophy r1 and heterotrophy r2 respectively the dark chambers were inoculated with 10 anaerobic sludge and 90 simulated mariculture wastewater by volume while the photo chambers were loaded with sterilized seawater that was used as the growth medium of c pyrenoidosa the total membrane area of the bacr was adjusted to the maximum 28 27 cm2 before start up the dark chambers were purged with n2 for 10 min to create anaerobic conditions the initial dcw in the photo chambers was about 0 35 g l for the mixotrophic algal cultivation the light intensity on the outside surface of the photo chamber was 6000 lux and the light dark cycle was 12 h 12 h the liquids in the dark and photo chambers were homogeneously stirred at 60 rpm to provide better contact between the substrate and microorganisms the whole experiments were operated at room temperature 25 2 c 2 3 analytical methods cod was measured according to the standard dichromate oxidation method hou et al 2020 tp was determined using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method sukacova et al 2015 nh4 n was measured according to the nessler method hach method 8038 yang et al 2018 dissolved inorganic carbon dic was determined with a dic analysis meter as c3 apollo scitech usa the ph value was measured by using a digital ph meter phb 5 aolilong hangzhou the vfa contents were analyzed with a gas chromatograph gc2010 shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a capillary column db ffap 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the analytical approaches of dcw carbohydrate protein lipid and chlorophyll were provided in the supporting information 2 4 bacterial community analysis at the end of the exponential phase day 10 and the stationary phase day 20 of c pyrenoidosa the sludge samples in the dark chamber and single acidogenic fermentation reactor were taken to determine microbial communities 16s rrna gene was extracted using ctab sds method ren et al 2020 for the pcr of v4 v5 hypervariable regions the extracted gene was amplified by using 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3 primer set the pcr procedures followed those previously described guo et al 2018 the pcr amplicons were quantified and purified for paired end 250 bp sequencing on illumina novaseq platform in novogene tianjin china the paired end reads were pretreated by mothur v 1 39 5 zhang et al 2020 and clustered into the same operational taxonomic units otus with 97 identity finally representative sequences of otus were annotated according to silva database http www arb silva de 2 5 metagenome prediction and annotations the dna in sludge samples for 16s rrna sequences was simultaneously used to predict functional metagenomic composition with picrust2 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states version 2 the functional annotation of metagenomes was carried out by using blastp search against the kegg database http www genome jp kegg with an e value cutoff 10 5 kegg pathways linked to fatty acid production were specifically extracted and analyzed relative abundance of microbial taxa functional genes was defined as the proportion of matching reads assigned to a category in total effective reads huang et al 2020 to investigate the co occurrence patterns between functional genes and bacteria as well as between microalgae and bacteria the correlation networks were generated by calculating pairwise spearman s correlations among the entities huang et al 2020 the network was visualized on the interactive platform of gephi 0 9 2 2 6 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate and the average data was reported the experimental results were also assessed with one way anova and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal growth and mariculture wastewater treatment in the bacr 3 1 1 accumulation of microalgal biomass and cellular compositions the growth characteristics of c pyrenoidosa in the photo chambers of the bacr under mixotrophy r1 and heterotrophy r2 are shown in fig 2 the microalgal biomass dcw was accumulated with the operation of the bacr fig 2a suggesting that the fermentative products generated from the dark chambers could be utilized by c pyrenoidosa in the photo chambers the dcw of c pyrenoidosa in r1 was 1 46 g l by the end of the experiment in comparison the final dcw in r2 was 0 54 g l lower than that in r2 fig 2a microalgae can uptake organic matters under both heterotrophic and mixotrophic culture conditions li and ju 2018 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b but under mixotrophic culture conditions light and organic carbon are simultaneously exploited within a single cell which helps to obtain a faster microalgae growth rate and accumulate more biomass in a given growth spell zhang et al 2021b consistent with the dcw of c pyrenoidosa the maximum productivities of carbohydrates proteins lipids and chlorophylls occurred under the mixotrophic culture condition the values of which were 2 70 mg l d 15 27 mg l d 12 89 mg l d and 1 20 mg l d respectively fig 2b 3 1 2 production and consumption of vfas vfas were the important products of acidogenic fermentation and could be easily assimilated by microalgae ayre et al 2021 bertin et al 2010 the variation of vfas during mariculture wastewater treatment in three reactors is presented in fig 3 a as shown there were no vfas contained in original mariculture wastewater and on day 2 the vfas in the reactors increased rapidly to about 210 330 mg l afterward the vfas in r0 increased to 755 0 mg l at the end of the experiment in comparison the vfas in r1 and r2 began to decrease owing to their utilization by c pyrenoidosa acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids were the major fermented vfas in the reactors and c pyrenoidosa mainly utilized acetic propionic and butyric acids produced in the dark chambers fig 3a as shown in r1 the acetic acid concentrations reached the maximum 144 1 mg l and 131 0 mg l in the dark and photo chambers respectively on day 8 and then decreased to about 2 4 mg l on day 20 due to the consumption of acetic acid by c pyrenoidosa similarly after reaching the peak values the ultimate concentrations of propionic acid and butyric acid in r1 were 0 5 1 5 mg l and 0 8 2 5 mg l respectively in contrast these fermented vfas in r2 maintained relatively high levels throughout the experiment due to their weak consumption by c pyrenoidosa the accumulation of vfas leads to a detrimental acidic condition causing the ph decrease and feedback inhibition on the single fermentation bundhoo and mohee 2016 however in the bacr the migration of vfas from the dark chamber into the photo chamber through the membranes would avoid this situation as illustrated in fig 3b the ph in the photo chamber was above 6 3 especially the ph was maintained at 8 3 8 8 under the mixotrophic culture condition r1 on one hand the dark chamber migrated vfas were consumed by c pyrenoidosa in the photo chamber on the other hand microalgae growth is a process with alkalinity generation gao et al 2021 which can buffer the low ph caused by the vfa migration thus it could be concluded that the bacr aided the ph recovery from the acidogenic fermentation process and avoided the vfa accumulation which further improved the stabilization of the system 3 1 3 recovery of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon the performance of n p and carbon removal from mariculture wastewater in r0 r1 and r2 is demonstrated in fig 4 during the single acidogenic fermentation nh4 n increased with the final concentration of 154 6 mg l owing to the hydrolysis of proteins in wastewater fig 4a high nh4 n concentrations could inhibit fermentation processes by changing intracellular ph causing proton imbalance in cells and inhibiting a specific enzyme reaction hou et al 2020 however this inhibition to the fermentation process could be alleviated in the bacr as displayed in fig 4a the nh4 n concentrations in the dark and photo chambers of the bacr increased to 42 7 80 0 mg l in the first 2 4 days which implied that nh4 n migrated from the dark chambers to the photo chambers then the nh4 n contents dropped in the following days with the end values of between 13 mg l r1 and 33 mg l r2 this was because microalgae are capable of assimilating nh4 n gao et al 2021 which could reduce the nh4 n concentration in the bacr meanwhile p and inorganic carbon could be released during fermentation which was confirmed by the increase of tp and dic concentrations throughout the single acidogenic fermentation fig 4b c in r1 the tp in the dark chamber of increased to 6 1 mg l on the 4th day and then maintained at 5 1 7 2 mg l in comparison the tp in the photo chamber was at a low level 0 1 0 5 mg l during the experiment fig 4b this observation could be explained by that p as a key element in cells mainly stored in lipids nucleic acid and atp cai et al 2013 migrated from the dark chamber into the photo chamber and was utilized by c pyrenoidosa at a relatively fast rate which caused and boosted the tp concentration difference between the two chambers in contrast in r2 the tp in the dark and photo chambers increased throughout the experiment fig 4b it indicated a higher p release rate than its consumption rate which was associated to the low dcw in r2 fig 2 the dic in water includes co2 bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and carbonic acid h2co3 and their equilibrium relationship in water is affected by ph kong et al 2021 in this study c pyrenoidosa grew in culture mediums with a ph of 6 4 8 8 fig 3b which meant that hco3 and co2 or h2co3 were the major dic in the bacr c pyrenoidosa is capable of utilizing dic for cytoskeleton construction by engaging light energy under both photoautotrophic and mixotrophic culture conditions kong et al 2021 mujtaba and lee 2017 as shown in fig 4c in r1 dic could migrate from the dark chamber into the photo chamber and was utilized by c pyrenoidosa with the end concentrations of 84 7 mg l and 29 7 mg l in the dark and photo chambers respectively moreover it is possible that the dic produced through the respiration in algal cells can be reused by c pyrenoidosa in the photo chamber heterotrophic cultivation is a light independent process in which dic cannot be assimilated by microalgae perez garcia et al 2011 therefore increased dic contents were observed in r2 fig 4c microalgae can utilize organic matters generated from acidogenic fermentation under both heterotrophic and mixotrophic culture conditions perez garcia et al 2011 ren et al 2018 as presented in fig 4d the ultimate concentration of cod in r0 reached 1351 3 mg l in comparison the cod was removed effectively in r1 due to the consumption of organic matters by c pyrenoidosa with a final concentration of 67 6 mg l overall the contents of n p and carbon could maintain at a relatively stable level after running a period of time 12 16 days of the bacr r1 fig 4 it suggested that a balance between the acidogenic fermentation and microalgae growth with respect to fermentative product generation and consumption rates was established in the bacr these results demonstrated that the bacr offered a great potential to recover n p and carbon from mariculture wastewater 3 2 microbial community overview 3 2 1 microbial diversity microbial communities in samples of r0day10 taken in r0 on day 10 r0day20 taken in r0 on day 20 r1day10 taken in the dark chamber in r1 on day 10 and r1day20 taken in the dark chamber in r1 on day 20 were analyzed rarefaction curves of the samples drawn from each of the units reached a plateau fig s2 suggesting that all bacterial communities were characterized in this study alpha diversity analysis was employed in four samples and exhibited in table 1 good s coverage was close to 1 table 1 suggesting that the sequence libraries constructed covered the diversity of the whole microbial community a larger shannon or simpson index shows higher diversity of the microbial community as displayed the microbial diversity in r1 decreased during the experiment while a contrast result was found in r0 table 1 chao 1 and ace index in r0day10 and r1day10 were higher than that in r0day20 and r1day20 respectively p 0 05 table 1 which indicated a decreasing species richness with the operation of the reactors similar to chao 1 and ace pd whole tree index exhibited a decreasing trend from day 10 to day 20 table 1 indicating that microorganisms were selectively eliminated and specific functional bacteria were retained with increasing reaction time 3 2 2 microbial composition anaerobic microorganisms are key players involved in the whole acidogenic fermentation processes for vfas production as well as nh4 n and tp release the accumulation of these products was highly correlated with the compositions and abundances of responsible fermentative bacteria huang et al 2018 luo et al 2018 hence the relative abundances of bacteria in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor and bacr were analyzed and compared fig 5 twelve main phyla were selected and listed in fig 5a it was reported that firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidota often detected in conventional anaerobic systems are the major microorganisms in degrading various organic matters e g polysaccharides and proteins and producing vfas liu et al 2014 luo et al 2018 as shown firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidota and campilobacterota were the dominant phyla in the four samples with a total proportion of 85 90 fig 5a this result preliminarily confirmed that fermentative bacteria were enriched both in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor and bacr taxonomic analysis and comparison down to genus level fig 5b exhibited more detailed differences in microbial composition between the single acidogenic fermentation reactor r0day10 r0day20 and bacr r1day10 r1day20 the two genera belonging to phylum firmicutes named ruminococcus and christensenellaceae r 7 group were greatly promoted in the bacr which showed a total abundance increase of 11 8 times in r1day10 compared with that in r0day10 fig 5b this change could be one of the reasons for the promoted vfas production capacity of the bacr since ruminococcus and christensenellaceae r 7 group degrade complex organics leaving vfas e g acetic and butyric acids as the final metabolite chen et al 2020 luo et al 2018 as another member of phylum firmicutes exiguobacterium plays an important role in the solubilization of organic wastes and increase of cod yield lee et al 2009 noticeably the abundances of exiguobacterium increased by 2 2 3 5 times in the bacr compare to those in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor fig 5b this variation suggested that the performance of dissolved organic matter production was enhanced in the bacr it was reported that numerous bacteria responsible for organic matter removal are affiliated with the phylum proteobacteria such as marinobacterium denitratisoma and thauera ping et al 2020 qu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the bacr the total sequence abundance of marinobacterium denitratisoma and thauera declined by 49 8 73 9 fig 5b which was attributable to the relatively low organic matter load in the bacr on sampling day in contrast pseudomonas the member of phylum proteobacteria could produce extracellular lipases and translate larger molecular organics into short chain fatty acids huang et al 2018 the increase in abundance of pseudomonas was observed in the bacr r1day10 2 73 r1day20 0 65 r0day10 0 85 r0day20 0 60 fig 5b which also indicated an enhanced vfas production performance of the bacr in bacteroidetes phylum saccharicrinis is commonly associated with the complex organic substance decomposition and vfas production luo et al 2018 the abundance of saccharicrinis increased from 0 11 in r0day10 to 0 18 in r1day10 while it decreased from 0 14 in r0day20 to 0 08 in r1day20 p 0 05 fig 5b similarly as the fermentative bacteria capable of producing acetic acid zhu et al 2021 sphaerochaeta affiliated to phylum spirochaetota was enriched from 0 09 in r0day10 to 0 15 in r1day10 and dropped from 0 15 in r0day20 to 0 11 in r1day20 p 0 05 fig 5b this microbial shift could be explained by that the feedback inhibition of the acidogenic fermentation was alleviated due to the utilization of vfas by c pyrenoidosa and thus these bacteria in the bacr were enriched on day 10 but the living environment of microorganisms declined as the depletion of fermentation substrates which lead to the reduced abundance of these bacteria in the bacr on day 20 moreover anaerolineaceae members in chloroflexi phylum could be responsible for the improvement of the hydrolysis during fermentation such as levilinea durán et al 2018 the abundance of levilinea was significantly higher in the bacr 0 94 1 19 than that in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor 0 07 0 11 p 0 05 fig 5b which was also beneficial for enhancing dissolved organics production capacity of the bacr overall it was concluded that c pyrenoidosa in the photo chamber timely utilized the fermentative products generated in the dark chamber which relieved the inhibitory effect of these products on the acidogenic fermentation and thereby promoted the growth of fermentative bacteria in the bacr 3 3 functional genes analysis to better understand the enhancement of hydrolysis and fatty acid production in the bacr functional genes were identified and classified according to the kegg database amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism were important paths for hydrolysis and vfas biosynthesis huang et al 2018 ping et al 2020 they were highly abundant functional categories in the samples fig s3 to be specific the relative abundance of genes involved in glycolysis protease coding and ammonia production showed upward trends in r1day10 or r1day20 as compared to reference samples r0day10 and r0day20 fig 6 a notably the hydrolysis of carbohydrates lipids and proteins are directly associated with glycolysis β oxidation proteolysis and ammonia production yuan et al 2019 these outcomes seemed to be a response to the enrichment of fermentative bacteria in the bacr the relative abundances of the genes associated with acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid production are shown in fig 6b among the genes of acetic and propionic acid production acs acka and aldh were predominant functional traits fig 6b and they were capable of encoding acetyl coa synthetase acetate kinase and aldehyde dehydrogenase respectively table s4 in could be seen that the relative abundances of acs acka and aldh were higher in r1day10 than in r0day10 fig 6b p 0 05 correspondingly the total abundance of acetic and propionic acid production related genes in r1day10 increased by 2 35 of that detected in r0day10 p 0 05 table s4 additionally atod encoding acetate coa transferase alpha subunit was the dominant gene of butyric acid production similarly the relative abundance of atod was up regulated by 1 67 in r1day10 compared to that in r0day10 fig 6b these variations in genes could be one of the reasonable explanations for intensified vfas production capacity of the bacr furthermore the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis ko00061 in the samples was analyzed fig 7 20 kinds of functional genes were annotated in the ko00061 pathway fig s5 acetyl coa carboxylase ec 6 4 1 2 is a key node in the ko00061 pathway fig 7 and it is encoded by six homologous genes named acca accb accc accd bcca and accd in this study acca accb accc accd and bcca were retrieved fig 6c among them the relative abundances of accb accc and accd were higher in r1day10 than in r0day10 fig 6c p 0 05 suggesting that these acetyl coa carboxylase genes were up regulated in the bacr while for acca and bcca their relative abundances were significantly decreased in r1day10 fig 6c p 0 05 however the total abundance of acca and bcca was at a relatively low level and thus their contributions were lower than other acetyl coa carboxylase genes it was reported that acca accb accc and accd participated in the degradation of carbohydrates proteins and lipids through a metabolic pathway by acetyl coa which is a direct precursor for fatty acid production krivoruchko et al 2015 ping et al 2020 and acca accc and accd can regulate the generation of c c and c h bonds in connection modules ping et al 2020 these results suggest that the expression of acetyl coa carboxylase was enhanced in the bacr which was beneficial for the downstream vfas production focusing on the ko00061 pathway fig 7 it was found that the ratio of enhanced genes compared to the control r0day10 was 53 3 in r1day10 to be specific the relative abundances of 8 genes fabh fabb fabf fabz fabi fabk acsl and fab2 in r1day10 were promoted compared with those in r0day10 p 0 05 this result was accordant with the prevalent enriched fermentative bacteria aforementioned in summary a great majority of fatty acid synthase related genes were up regulated in the bacr which further explained the superiority of vfas production in the bacr at the genetic level 3 4 co occurrence networks revealing the coordination between fermentative bacteria and microalgae in the bacr to directly explore the response of changes in bacterial abundances to variations of key biochemical factors in the bacr the correlations among nh4 n cod ph c pyrenoidosa and bacterial communities top 35 genera were determined table s6 s9 and visualized by network analysis fig 8 a for nh4 n and cod the influential ranks of these factors for fermentative bacteria were highly similar for example most of the fermentative bacteria were negatively correlated with the concentrations of nh4 n and cod according to their growth conditions such as longilinea leptolinea saccharicrinis syntrophus mesotoga and christensenellaceae r 7 group fig 8a it indicated that microalgal consumption of nh4 n and cod in the bacr was beneficial for the growth of these bacteria moreover a strong correlation was observed between ph and fermentative bacteria with spearman s ρ of in the range of 0 6 0 9 especially the spearman s ρ between ph and bacteria ruminococcus longilinea leptolinea syntrophus mesotoga and christensenellaceae r 7 group were higher than 0 8 fig 8a the increase of ph value is directly related to the vfas consumption liu et al 2015 thus it reasonably confirmed that the end product e g vfas inhibition on fermentation could be alleviated in the bacr due to the utilization of vfas by c pyrenoidosa furthermore it was found that the biomass of c pyrenoidosa presented negative correlations with most of the vfas consumers such as smithella denitratisoma thauera thermovirga desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium and desulfosporosinus fig 8a it revealed that c pyrenoidosa maintained a competitive advantage over heterotrophic bacteria for organic carbon utilization in the bacr fig 8b depicts the co occurring patterns between fatty acid production related genes and bacterial communities the specific spearman s ρ ρ 0 6 p 0 05 between functional genes and microbial taxa were summarized in table s10 s14 although a statistically significant positive correlation between functional genes and microorganisms cannot be regarded as evidence that microorganisms carry the specific genes it can suggest that microorganisms are potential host bacteria for the genes shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 as shown the network was comprised of 46 nodes 33 top genera and 13 genes and 150 edges fig 8b among the identified fermentative bacterial genera leptolinea longilinea and pseudomonas were associated with more diverse functional genes 7 7 and 4 respectively than other genera for example as dominant fermentative genus in the samples leptolinea showed positive connections spearman s ρ 0 607 0 857 p 0 05 with atoa atod buk desa2 fab2 fabl and fas fig 8b it suggested that leptolinea was a potential host of these fatty acid production related genes as the top two genera in samples ruminococcus and christensenellaceae r 7 group were likely to carry atoa with the coefficients of 0 714 fig 8b it should be noted that exiguobacterium might be one of the key hosts of atod and fab2 as it maintained strong relations spearman s ρ of 0 964 and 0 929 respectively with these two genes fig 8b furthermore sphaerochaeta and saccharicrinis showed high correlations to fab2 with spearman s ρ of 0 857 and 0 847 respectively fig 8b inferring that these two genera were also potential hosts of fab2 based on the above analysis a new coordination between fermentative bacteria and microalgae in the bacr could be highlighted i the end products e g vfas dic nh4 n and tp generated in the dark chamber freely migrated into the photo chamber and were further utilized by the microalgae which promoted the microalgal biomass accumulation and facilitated the ultimate pollutant removal from mariculture wastewater ii the substances like vfas and nh4 n were gradually removed from mariculture wastewater and their feedback inhibition to the acidogenic fermentation was relieved which provided an improved living environment for the growth of fermentative bacteria in the dark chamber iii and as the operation of the bacr a stable balance between fermentative product generation and consumption rates could be achieved indicating that a positive bacterial algal co existence relationship was established in the bacr 4 conclusion the bacr was proved to be effective in mariculture wastewater treatment the bacr not only relieved the inhibitory effect on acidogenic fermentation caused by fermentative products e g vfas and nh4 n but also prevented microalgae from being contaminated by fermentative bacteria thus promoting the acidogenic fermentation and microalgae growth in this context nh4 n tp dic and cod originated from mariculture wastewater in the bacr was highly eliminated and converted into microalgal high value products microbial community profiles demonstrated that ruminococcus

16157,to achieve the goal of treating mariculture wastewater economically and efficiently a novel bacterial algal coupling reactor bacr integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation was firstly investigated for mariculture wastewater treatment volatile fatty acids vfas generated in the dark chamber migrated into the photo chamber for microalgal utilization which alleviated the ph drop and feedback inhibition of the acidogenic fermentation the maximum dry cell weight dcw of microalgae was 1 46 g l and pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 n and total phosphorus tp in the bacr were effectively removed under the mixotrophic culture condition furthermore bacterial community profiles and functional genes in the bacr and single acidogenic fermentation reactor were identified compared with the single acidogenic fermentation reactor most of the fermentative bacteria e g ruminococcus christensenellaceae r 7 group exiguobacterium pseudomonas and levilinea were enriched by the bacr from the genetic perspective the abundances of dominant genes acka acs and atod associated with acetic propionic and butyric acid production were greatly enhanced

consumption and the reduction of wild fishery resources lu et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 many closed and semi closed mariculture systems along coastal areas are used for farming seafood e g fish and shrimp in china li et al 2017 however a large amount of mariculture wastewater from the water exchange of mariculture systems is discharged during the cultivation of marine organisms gao et al 2021 li et al 2017 mariculture wastewater mainly contains suspended solids dissolved organic matter and nitrogen compounds due to the accumulation of feed residue and fish excretions lu et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 the direct discharge of untreated mariculture wastewater results in serious eutrophication and damage of surrounding estuarine ecosystem pang et al 2021 mariculture wastewater treatment facilities usually include several purifying units namely solids removal units e g sand filter and mechanical filter and biological treatment units for nutrient removal li et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 however the individual treatment of solid waste and effluent not only leads to the complexity of the purifying units but also increases the investment scale zhang et al 2021a hence an alternative approach to treat mariculture wastewater is urgently needed integration of acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation could be an attractive technique for mariculture wastewater treatment acidogenic fermentation is a well established process for resource recovery from organic waste and wastewater in which particle and complex molecules are converted into volatile fatty acids vfas ammonium nh4 n and other products lee et al 2014 pandey et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a microalgae are considered as the great fortune with their usage in food biofuel feed and wastewater treatment and thus it has invited much interest to cultivate microalgae kusmayadi et al 2021 markou and nerantzis 2013 ren et al 2015 the fermentative products contained in acidogenic fermentation effluents can be used as the sources of the nutrient and energy for algal culture many studies proved that microalgae can utilize simple organic carbons e g vfas nh4 n and phosphates for cell growth and biochemical composition accumulation under heterotrophic or mixotrophic culture conditions li and ju 2018 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b in our previous studies mariculture wastewaters were treated through a two stage process of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation in which the fermentation effluent of mariculture wastewater served as the substrate for microalgae culture gao et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a as fermentative bacteria and microalgae grow separately in their respective optimal environments high biomass production and pollutant removal efficiency were obtained with the two stage process however before its use for the cultivation of microalgae the fermentation effluent needs to be sterilized and even it should be diluted with sterile water chen et al 2018 turon et al 2016 these complex pretreatments will certainly increase the operation cost and limit its practical application to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks of the two stage process of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation a novel bacterial algal coupling reactor bacr was designed for mariculture wastewater treatment in this study fig 1 key biochemical indicators such as dry cell weight dcw and cellular compositions can help understand the microalgal biological response in wastewater treatment bertin et al 2010 chun et al 2018 while for bacteria 16s rrna microbial sequencing based functional genes analysis is preferred to explore the mechanism of substrate degradation and energy transfer in fermentation processes guo et al 2018 ping et al 2020 furthermore combined with network analysis which is widely used to decipher the associations among entities the co occurrence patterns between microalgae and bacteria or between functional genes and microbial taxa could be identified huang et al 2020 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 applying these approaches will be helpful for comprehensively understanding the mariculture wastewater treatment with the bacr the objectives of this study were i to evaluate the growth characteristic of microalgae in the bacr ii to investigate the performance of pollutant removal from mariculture wastewater with the bacr iii to analyze the profiles of bacterial community and functional genes in the bacr and iv to explore co occurrence correlations between microalgae and bacteria as well as between functional genes and bacteria and reveal coordination between fermentative bacteria and microalgae in the bacr the findings of this study offered a new insight into mariculture wastewater treatment with the technology of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design and inoculation the schematic of the bacr is depicted in fig 1 the perspex reactor consisted of a dark chamber working volume of 1 5 l and a photo chamber working volume of 1 5 l the dark and photo chambers were used to conduct acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation respectively two chambers were separated by polyethersulfone membranes pore size of 0 22 μm which were fitted between the two chambers the membranes permitted dissolved substances e g vfas n and p to pass freely while excluding microorganisms and particles and its permeability could be adjusted by altering the total membrane area thus microalgae in the photo chamber could utilize the nutrients migrated from the dark chamber through the membranes which would relieve the feedback inhibition of the acidogenic fermentation moreover the bacr avoided the operation like the sterilization and dilution of fermentation effluent in the two stage process of integrating acidogenic fermentation and microalgae cultivation aquaculture feed was mixed with seawater to simulate mariculture wastewater the salinity of the simulated mariculture wastewater was 3 0 0 2 which was similar to that of the normal mariculture wastewater the reasons for choosing aquaculture feed to simulate mariculture wastewater and other characteristics of the simulated mariculture wastewater were exhibited in the supporting information anaerobic sludge obtained from the anaerobic digestion tank of haibohe wastewater treatment plant qingdao china was used as the inoculum in the dark chamber it was reported that high salinity could lead to plasmolysis and reduction of cell activity wang et al 2017 to reduce the negative effects of high salinity on bacterial growth the anaerobic sludge was domesticated by gradually increasing the salinity from 0 to 3 0 0 2 prior to inoculation chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa a common strain of microalgae was used as the inoculum in the photo chamber it was obtained from the college of marine life sciences ocean university of china qingdao china before experiments c pyrenoidosa was pre cultivated in the f 2 medium the specific components of the f 2 medium are shown in table s1 s3 2 2 experimental conditions and operation to investigate the performance of mariculture wastewater treatment with the bacr three types of batch experiments were simultaneously performed mariculture wastewater treatment with a single acidogenic fermentation process which was set as the control r0 mariculture wastewater treatments with the bacr in which c pyrenoidosa was cultivated under mixotrophy r1 and heterotrophy r2 respectively the dark chambers were inoculated with 10 anaerobic sludge and 90 simulated mariculture wastewater by volume while the photo chambers were loaded with sterilized seawater that was used as the growth medium of c pyrenoidosa the total membrane area of the bacr was adjusted to the maximum 28 27 cm2 before start up the dark chambers were purged with n2 for 10 min to create anaerobic conditions the initial dcw in the photo chambers was about 0 35 g l for the mixotrophic algal cultivation the light intensity on the outside surface of the photo chamber was 6000 lux and the light dark cycle was 12 h 12 h the liquids in the dark and photo chambers were homogeneously stirred at 60 rpm to provide better contact between the substrate and microorganisms the whole experiments were operated at room temperature 25 2 c 2 3 analytical methods cod was measured according to the standard dichromate oxidation method hou et al 2020 tp was determined using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method sukacova et al 2015 nh4 n was measured according to the nessler method hach method 8038 yang et al 2018 dissolved inorganic carbon dic was determined with a dic analysis meter as c3 apollo scitech usa the ph value was measured by using a digital ph meter phb 5 aolilong hangzhou the vfa contents were analyzed with a gas chromatograph gc2010 shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a capillary column db ffap 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the analytical approaches of dcw carbohydrate protein lipid and chlorophyll were provided in the supporting information 2 4 bacterial community analysis at the end of the exponential phase day 10 and the stationary phase day 20 of c pyrenoidosa the sludge samples in the dark chamber and single acidogenic fermentation reactor were taken to determine microbial communities 16s rrna gene was extracted using ctab sds method ren et al 2020 for the pcr of v4 v5 hypervariable regions the extracted gene was amplified by using 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3 primer set the pcr procedures followed those previously described guo et al 2018 the pcr amplicons were quantified and purified for paired end 250 bp sequencing on illumina novaseq platform in novogene tianjin china the paired end reads were pretreated by mothur v 1 39 5 zhang et al 2020 and clustered into the same operational taxonomic units otus with 97 identity finally representative sequences of otus were annotated according to silva database http www arb silva de 2 5 metagenome prediction and annotations the dna in sludge samples for 16s rrna sequences was simultaneously used to predict functional metagenomic composition with picrust2 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states version 2 the functional annotation of metagenomes was carried out by using blastp search against the kegg database http www genome jp kegg with an e value cutoff 10 5 kegg pathways linked to fatty acid production were specifically extracted and analyzed relative abundance of microbial taxa functional genes was defined as the proportion of matching reads assigned to a category in total effective reads huang et al 2020 to investigate the co occurrence patterns between functional genes and bacteria as well as between microalgae and bacteria the correlation networks were generated by calculating pairwise spearman s correlations among the entities huang et al 2020 the network was visualized on the interactive platform of gephi 0 9 2 2 6 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate and the average data was reported the experimental results were also assessed with one way anova and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal growth and mariculture wastewater treatment in the bacr 3 1 1 accumulation of microalgal biomass and cellular compositions the growth characteristics of c pyrenoidosa in the photo chambers of the bacr under mixotrophy r1 and heterotrophy r2 are shown in fig 2 the microalgal biomass dcw was accumulated with the operation of the bacr fig 2a suggesting that the fermentative products generated from the dark chambers could be utilized by c pyrenoidosa in the photo chambers the dcw of c pyrenoidosa in r1 was 1 46 g l by the end of the experiment in comparison the final dcw in r2 was 0 54 g l lower than that in r2 fig 2a microalgae can uptake organic matters under both heterotrophic and mixotrophic culture conditions li and ju 2018 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b but under mixotrophic culture conditions light and organic carbon are simultaneously exploited within a single cell which helps to obtain a faster microalgae growth rate and accumulate more biomass in a given growth spell zhang et al 2021b consistent with the dcw of c pyrenoidosa the maximum productivities of carbohydrates proteins lipids and chlorophylls occurred under the mixotrophic culture condition the values of which were 2 70 mg l d 15 27 mg l d 12 89 mg l d and 1 20 mg l d respectively fig 2b 3 1 2 production and consumption of vfas vfas were the important products of acidogenic fermentation and could be easily assimilated by microalgae ayre et al 2021 bertin et al 2010 the variation of vfas during mariculture wastewater treatment in three reactors is presented in fig 3 a as shown there were no vfas contained in original mariculture wastewater and on day 2 the vfas in the reactors increased rapidly to about 210 330 mg l afterward the vfas in r0 increased to 755 0 mg l at the end of the experiment in comparison the vfas in r1 and r2 began to decrease owing to their utilization by c pyrenoidosa acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids were the major fermented vfas in the reactors and c pyrenoidosa mainly utilized acetic propionic and butyric acids produced in the dark chambers fig 3a as shown in r1 the acetic acid concentrations reached the maximum 144 1 mg l and 131 0 mg l in the dark and photo chambers respectively on day 8 and then decreased to about 2 4 mg l on day 20 due to the consumption of acetic acid by c pyrenoidosa similarly after reaching the peak values the ultimate concentrations of propionic acid and butyric acid in r1 were 0 5 1 5 mg l and 0 8 2 5 mg l respectively in contrast these fermented vfas in r2 maintained relatively high levels throughout the experiment due to their weak consumption by c pyrenoidosa the accumulation of vfas leads to a detrimental acidic condition causing the ph decrease and feedback inhibition on the single fermentation bundhoo and mohee 2016 however in the bacr the migration of vfas from the dark chamber into the photo chamber through the membranes would avoid this situation as illustrated in fig 3b the ph in the photo chamber was above 6 3 especially the ph was maintained at 8 3 8 8 under the mixotrophic culture condition r1 on one hand the dark chamber migrated vfas were consumed by c pyrenoidosa in the photo chamber on the other hand microalgae growth is a process with alkalinity generation gao et al 2021 which can buffer the low ph caused by the vfa migration thus it could be concluded that the bacr aided the ph recovery from the acidogenic fermentation process and avoided the vfa accumulation which further improved the stabilization of the system 3 1 3 recovery of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon the performance of n p and carbon removal from mariculture wastewater in r0 r1 and r2 is demonstrated in fig 4 during the single acidogenic fermentation nh4 n increased with the final concentration of 154 6 mg l owing to the hydrolysis of proteins in wastewater fig 4a high nh4 n concentrations could inhibit fermentation processes by changing intracellular ph causing proton imbalance in cells and inhibiting a specific enzyme reaction hou et al 2020 however this inhibition to the fermentation process could be alleviated in the bacr as displayed in fig 4a the nh4 n concentrations in the dark and photo chambers of the bacr increased to 42 7 80 0 mg l in the first 2 4 days which implied that nh4 n migrated from the dark chambers to the photo chambers then the nh4 n contents dropped in the following days with the end values of between 13 mg l r1 and 33 mg l r2 this was because microalgae are capable of assimilating nh4 n gao et al 2021 which could reduce the nh4 n concentration in the bacr meanwhile p and inorganic carbon could be released during fermentation which was confirmed by the increase of tp and dic concentrations throughout the single acidogenic fermentation fig 4b c in r1 the tp in the dark chamber of increased to 6 1 mg l on the 4th day and then maintained at 5 1 7 2 mg l in comparison the tp in the photo chamber was at a low level 0 1 0 5 mg l during the experiment fig 4b this observation could be explained by that p as a key element in cells mainly stored in lipids nucleic acid and atp cai et al 2013 migrated from the dark chamber into the photo chamber and was utilized by c pyrenoidosa at a relatively fast rate which caused and boosted the tp concentration difference between the two chambers in contrast in r2 the tp in the dark and photo chambers increased throughout the experiment fig 4b it indicated a higher p release rate than its consumption rate which was associated to the low dcw in r2 fig 2 the dic in water includes co2 bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and carbonic acid h2co3 and their equilibrium relationship in water is affected by ph kong et al 2021 in this study c pyrenoidosa grew in culture mediums with a ph of 6 4 8 8 fig 3b which meant that hco3 and co2 or h2co3 were the major dic in the bacr c pyrenoidosa is capable of utilizing dic for cytoskeleton construction by engaging light energy under both photoautotrophic and mixotrophic culture conditions kong et al 2021 mujtaba and lee 2017 as shown in fig 4c in r1 dic could migrate from the dark chamber into the photo chamber and was utilized by c pyrenoidosa with the end concentrations of 84 7 mg l and 29 7 mg l in the dark and photo chambers respectively moreover it is possible that the dic produced through the respiration in algal cells can be reused by c pyrenoidosa in the photo chamber heterotrophic cultivation is a light independent process in which dic cannot be assimilated by microalgae perez garcia et al 2011 therefore increased dic contents were observed in r2 fig 4c microalgae can utilize organic matters generated from acidogenic fermentation under both heterotrophic and mixotrophic culture conditions perez garcia et al 2011 ren et al 2018 as presented in fig 4d the ultimate concentration of cod in r0 reached 1351 3 mg l in comparison the cod was removed effectively in r1 due to the consumption of organic matters by c pyrenoidosa with a final concentration of 67 6 mg l overall the contents of n p and carbon could maintain at a relatively stable level after running a period of time 12 16 days of the bacr r1 fig 4 it suggested that a balance between the acidogenic fermentation and microalgae growth with respect to fermentative product generation and consumption rates was established in the bacr these results demonstrated that the bacr offered a great potential to recover n p and carbon from mariculture wastewater 3 2 microbial community overview 3 2 1 microbial diversity microbial communities in samples of r0day10 taken in r0 on day 10 r0day20 taken in r0 on day 20 r1day10 taken in the dark chamber in r1 on day 10 and r1day20 taken in the dark chamber in r1 on day 20 were analyzed rarefaction curves of the samples drawn from each of the units reached a plateau fig s2 suggesting that all bacterial communities were characterized in this study alpha diversity analysis was employed in four samples and exhibited in table 1 good s coverage was close to 1 table 1 suggesting that the sequence libraries constructed covered the diversity of the whole microbial community a larger shannon or simpson index shows higher diversity of the microbial community as displayed the microbial diversity in r1 decreased during the experiment while a contrast result was found in r0 table 1 chao 1 and ace index in r0day10 and r1day10 were higher than that in r0day20 and r1day20 respectively p 0 05 table 1 which indicated a decreasing species richness with the operation of the reactors similar to chao 1 and ace pd whole tree index exhibited a decreasing trend from day 10 to day 20 table 1 indicating that microorganisms were selectively eliminated and specific functional bacteria were retained with increasing reaction time 3 2 2 microbial composition anaerobic microorganisms are key players involved in the whole acidogenic fermentation processes for vfas production as well as nh4 n and tp release the accumulation of these products was highly correlated with the compositions and abundances of responsible fermentative bacteria huang et al 2018 luo et al 2018 hence the relative abundances of bacteria in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor and bacr were analyzed and compared fig 5 twelve main phyla were selected and listed in fig 5a it was reported that firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidota often detected in conventional anaerobic systems are the major microorganisms in degrading various organic matters e g polysaccharides and proteins and producing vfas liu et al 2014 luo et al 2018 as shown firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidota and campilobacterota were the dominant phyla in the four samples with a total proportion of 85 90 fig 5a this result preliminarily confirmed that fermentative bacteria were enriched both in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor and bacr taxonomic analysis and comparison down to genus level fig 5b exhibited more detailed differences in microbial composition between the single acidogenic fermentation reactor r0day10 r0day20 and bacr r1day10 r1day20 the two genera belonging to phylum firmicutes named ruminococcus and christensenellaceae r 7 group were greatly promoted in the bacr which showed a total abundance increase of 11 8 times in r1day10 compared with that in r0day10 fig 5b this change could be one of the reasons for the promoted vfas production capacity of the bacr since ruminococcus and christensenellaceae r 7 group degrade complex organics leaving vfas e g acetic and butyric acids as the final metabolite chen et al 2020 luo et al 2018 as another member of phylum firmicutes exiguobacterium plays an important role in the solubilization of organic wastes and increase of cod yield lee et al 2009 noticeably the abundances of exiguobacterium increased by 2 2 3 5 times in the bacr compare to those in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor fig 5b this variation suggested that the performance of dissolved organic matter production was enhanced in the bacr it was reported that numerous bacteria responsible for organic matter removal are affiliated with the phylum proteobacteria such as marinobacterium denitratisoma and thauera ping et al 2020 qu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the bacr the total sequence abundance of marinobacterium denitratisoma and thauera declined by 49 8 73 9 fig 5b which was attributable to the relatively low organic matter load in the bacr on sampling day in contrast pseudomonas the member of phylum proteobacteria could produce extracellular lipases and translate larger molecular organics into short chain fatty acids huang et al 2018 the increase in abundance of pseudomonas was observed in the bacr r1day10 2 73 r1day20 0 65 r0day10 0 85 r0day20 0 60 fig 5b which also indicated an enhanced vfas production performance of the bacr in bacteroidetes phylum saccharicrinis is commonly associated with the complex organic substance decomposition and vfas production luo et al 2018 the abundance of saccharicrinis increased from 0 11 in r0day10 to 0 18 in r1day10 while it decreased from 0 14 in r0day20 to 0 08 in r1day20 p 0 05 fig 5b similarly as the fermentative bacteria capable of producing acetic acid zhu et al 2021 sphaerochaeta affiliated to phylum spirochaetota was enriched from 0 09 in r0day10 to 0 15 in r1day10 and dropped from 0 15 in r0day20 to 0 11 in r1day20 p 0 05 fig 5b this microbial shift could be explained by that the feedback inhibition of the acidogenic fermentation was alleviated due to the utilization of vfas by c pyrenoidosa and thus these bacteria in the bacr were enriched on day 10 but the living environment of microorganisms declined as the depletion of fermentation substrates which lead to the reduced abundance of these bacteria in the bacr on day 20 moreover anaerolineaceae members in chloroflexi phylum could be responsible for the improvement of the hydrolysis during fermentation such as levilinea durán et al 2018 the abundance of levilinea was significantly higher in the bacr 0 94 1 19 than that in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor 0 07 0 11 p 0 05 fig 5b which was also beneficial for enhancing dissolved organics production capacity of the bacr overall it was concluded that c pyrenoidosa in the photo chamber timely utilized the fermentative products generated in the dark chamber which relieved the inhibitory effect of these products on the acidogenic fermentation and thereby promoted the growth of fermentative bacteria in the bacr 3 3 functional genes analysis to better understand the enhancement of hydrolysis and fatty acid production in the bacr functional genes were identified and classified according to the kegg database amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism were important paths for hydrolysis and vfas biosynthesis huang et al 2018 ping et al 2020 they were highly abundant functional categories in the samples fig s3 to be specific the relative abundance of genes involved in glycolysis protease coding and ammonia production showed upward trends in r1day10 or r1day20 as compared to reference samples r0day10 and r0day20 fig 6 a notably the hydrolysis of carbohydrates lipids and proteins are directly associated with glycolysis β oxidation proteolysis and ammonia production yuan et al 2019 these outcomes seemed to be a response to the enrichment of fermentative bacteria in the bacr the relative abundances of the genes associated with acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid production are shown in fig 6b among the genes of acetic and propionic acid production acs acka and aldh were predominant functional traits fig 6b and they were capable of encoding acetyl coa synthetase acetate kinase and aldehyde dehydrogenase respectively table s4 in could be seen that the relative abundances of acs acka and aldh were higher in r1day10 than in r0day10 fig 6b p 0 05 correspondingly the total abundance of acetic and propionic acid production related genes in r1day10 increased by 2 35 of that detected in r0day10 p 0 05 table s4 additionally atod encoding acetate coa transferase alpha subunit was the dominant gene of butyric acid production similarly the relative abundance of atod was up regulated by 1 67 in r1day10 compared to that in r0day10 fig 6b these variations in genes could be one of the reasonable explanations for intensified vfas production capacity of the bacr furthermore the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis ko00061 in the samples was analyzed fig 7 20 kinds of functional genes were annotated in the ko00061 pathway fig s5 acetyl coa carboxylase ec 6 4 1 2 is a key node in the ko00061 pathway fig 7 and it is encoded by six homologous genes named acca accb accc accd bcca and accd in this study acca accb accc accd and bcca were retrieved fig 6c among them the relative abundances of accb accc and accd were higher in r1day10 than in r0day10 fig 6c p 0 05 suggesting that these acetyl coa carboxylase genes were up regulated in the bacr while for acca and bcca their relative abundances were significantly decreased in r1day10 fig 6c p 0 05 however the total abundance of acca and bcca was at a relatively low level and thus their contributions were lower than other acetyl coa carboxylase genes it was reported that acca accb accc and accd participated in the degradation of carbohydrates proteins and lipids through a metabolic pathway by acetyl coa which is a direct precursor for fatty acid production krivoruchko et al 2015 ping et al 2020 and acca accc and accd can regulate the generation of c c and c h bonds in connection modules ping et al 2020 these results suggest that the expression of acetyl coa carboxylase was enhanced in the bacr which was beneficial for the downstream vfas production focusing on the ko00061 pathway fig 7 it was found that the ratio of enhanced genes compared to the control r0day10 was 53 3 in r1day10 to be specific the relative abundances of 8 genes fabh fabb fabf fabz fabi fabk acsl and fab2 in r1day10 were promoted compared with those in r0day10 p 0 05 this result was accordant with the prevalent enriched fermentative bacteria aforementioned in summary a great majority of fatty acid synthase related genes were up regulated in the bacr which further explained the superiority of vfas production in the bacr at the genetic level 3 4 co occurrence networks revealing the coordination between fermentative bacteria and microalgae in the bacr to directly explore the response of changes in bacterial abundances to variations of key biochemical factors in the bacr the correlations among nh4 n cod ph c pyrenoidosa and bacterial communities top 35 genera were determined table s6 s9 and visualized by network analysis fig 8 a for nh4 n and cod the influential ranks of these factors for fermentative bacteria were highly similar for example most of the fermentative bacteria were negatively correlated with the concentrations of nh4 n and cod according to their growth conditions such as longilinea leptolinea saccharicrinis syntrophus mesotoga and christensenellaceae r 7 group fig 8a it indicated that microalgal consumption of nh4 n and cod in the bacr was beneficial for the growth of these bacteria moreover a strong correlation was observed between ph and fermentative bacteria with spearman s ρ of in the range of 0 6 0 9 especially the spearman s ρ between ph and bacteria ruminococcus longilinea leptolinea syntrophus mesotoga and christensenellaceae r 7 group were higher than 0 8 fig 8a the increase of ph value is directly related to the vfas consumption liu et al 2015 thus it reasonably confirmed that the end product e g vfas inhibition on fermentation could be alleviated in the bacr due to the utilization of vfas by c pyrenoidosa furthermore it was found that the biomass of c pyrenoidosa presented negative correlations with most of the vfas consumers such as smithella denitratisoma thauera thermovirga desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium and desulfosporosinus fig 8a it revealed that c pyrenoidosa maintained a competitive advantage over heterotrophic bacteria for organic carbon utilization in the bacr fig 8b depicts the co occurring patterns between fatty acid production related genes and bacterial communities the specific spearman s ρ ρ 0 6 p 0 05 between functional genes and microbial taxa were summarized in table s10 s14 although a statistically significant positive correlation between functional genes and microorganisms cannot be regarded as evidence that microorganisms carry the specific genes it can suggest that microorganisms are potential host bacteria for the genes shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 as shown the network was comprised of 46 nodes 33 top genera and 13 genes and 150 edges fig 8b among the identified fermentative bacterial genera leptolinea longilinea and pseudomonas were associated with more diverse functional genes 7 7 and 4 respectively than other genera for example as dominant fermentative genus in the samples leptolinea showed positive connections spearman s ρ 0 607 0 857 p 0 05 with atoa atod buk desa2 fab2 fabl and fas fig 8b it suggested that leptolinea was a potential host of these fatty acid production related genes as the top two genera in samples ruminococcus and christensenellaceae r 7 group were likely to carry atoa with the coefficients of 0 714 fig 8b it should be noted that exiguobacterium might be one of the key hosts of atod and fab2 as it maintained strong relations spearman s ρ of 0 964 and 0 929 respectively with these two genes fig 8b furthermore sphaerochaeta and saccharicrinis showed high correlations to fab2 with spearman s ρ of 0 857 and 0 847 respectively fig 8b inferring that these two genera were also potential hosts of fab2 based on the above analysis a new coordination between fermentative bacteria and microalgae in the bacr could be highlighted i the end products e g vfas dic nh4 n and tp generated in the dark chamber freely migrated into the photo chamber and were further utilized by the microalgae which promoted the microalgal biomass accumulation and facilitated the ultimate pollutant removal from mariculture wastewater ii the substances like vfas and nh4 n were gradually removed from mariculture wastewater and their feedback inhibition to the acidogenic fermentation was relieved which provided an improved living environment for the growth of fermentative bacteria in the dark chamber iii and as the operation of the bacr a stable balance between fermentative product generation and consumption rates could be achieved indicating that a positive bacterial algal co existence relationship was established in the bacr 4 conclusion the bacr was proved to be effective in mariculture wastewater treatment the bacr not only relieved the inhibitory effect on acidogenic fermentation caused by fermentative products e g vfas and nh4 n but also prevented microalgae from being contaminated by fermentative bacteria thus promoting the acidogenic fermentation and microalgae growth in this context nh4 n tp dic and cod originated from mariculture wastewater in the bacr was highly eliminated and converted into microalgal high value products microbial community profiles demonstrated that ruminococcus christensenellaceae r 7 group exiguobacterium and pseudomonas were major fermentative bacteria which were greatly enriched in the bacr compared to those in the single acidogenic fermentation reactor at the genetic level 3 types of high abundance acetyl coa carboxylase genes and 53 of detected downstream genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 were up regulated in the bacr according to network analysis the consumption of nh4 n and cod by microalgae promoted the growth of most fermentative bacteria and a positive bacterial algal co existence relationship in the bacr was

16158,seawater is a virtually unlimited source of minerals and water hence electrodialysis ed is an attractive route for selective seawater desalination due to the selectivity of its ion exchange membrane iem toward the target ion however a solution like iem which is permeable to water and ions other than the target ion results in the leakage of water as well as extraction of unwanted ions this degrades the productivity and purity of the system in this study a novel desalination system was developed by replacing the cation exchange membrane cem with a na super ionic conductor nasicon in ed nasicon exceptionally permits na ion migration and this enhanced the productivity of desalted water by removing 98 of na while retaining water and other cationic minerals therefore the final volume of desalted water in n ed was 1 36 times larger compared to that of ed in addition the specific energy consumption for salt nacl extraction was reduced by 13 furthermore the nasicon in n ed was replaced into a two sided nasicon structured rechargeable seawater battery thereby further conserving 20 energy by simultaneously coupling selective desalination with energy storage our findings have positive implications and further optimizations of the nasicon will enable practical and energy effective applications for seawater utilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nasicon electrodialysis nacl extraction process seawater desalination 1 introduction seawater is a massive natural reservoir of minerals and freshwater petersen 1994 a great demand for na ca mg k and li exists in the agricultural industrial environmental remediation and medical fields and they can be profitably extracted from seawater loganathan et al 2017 shahmansouri et al 2015 a classic example of this is nacl common table salt which is indispensable for human life and is used in the food glass soap detergent textile pulp and paper industries petersen 1994 to successfully segregate seawater into water and desirous salt thermal electrical or physical processes are required chen et al 2021 pistocchi et al 2020 pramanik et al 2020 among the various processes of seawater separation electrodialysis ed is superior to other technologies for ion selective desalination strathmann 2010 this process is driven by a difference in electrical potential over a membrane stack where charged compounds are selectively transferred from a feed solution through a pair of anion and cation exchange membranes fig 1 a xie et al 2016 for example salt manufacturing companies have been economically producing nacl from seawater using ed since the 1970s at a production rate of 360 000 t yr during 1970 1980 kobuchi et al 1983 the ion selectivity of ed is mainly attributed to the polymeric ion exchange membrane iem luo et al 2018 ion transport under the driving forces of concentration or electrical potential gradient through iems can be explained by the solution diffusion model fig 1 d sata 2000 according to this model the membrane structure is divided into two phases the gel and interstitial phase kreuer et al 2004 the gel phase is composed of polymer chains and hydrophilic ion exchange groups bound to the chains the interstitial phase is the void between the elements of the gel phase it is assumed to be a space filled with an electro neutral solution water containing ions which is responsible for ion transport the four possible mechanisms for transport in this phase are diffusion electromigration convection and surface site hopping saito et al 2004 thampan et al 2000 however this solution like ion transfer mechanism may also cause the transport of unwanted ions other than na furthermore water may migrate across the membrane via spontaneous phenomena such as osmosis electro osmosis electro migration and diffusion lakshminarayanaiah 1965 lakshminarayanaiah and subrahmanyan 1968 these can have detrimental effects on freshwater production as well as in salt manufacturing tanaka 2011 for example during salt manufacturing from brine by ed it is important to control water transfer through the membrane to prevent dilution of the final product jiang et al 2014 to cope with this problem previous studies have shown that ion selectivity in polymeric membranes can be improved by modifying the surface of iems khoiruddin et al 2017 introducing novel bulk morphology of membranes balster et al 2005 or blending polymers zhang et al 2013 however no method perfectly prevented the passage of other undesirable ions through a membrane whose transference number was still below unity 0 89 0 99 cwirko and carbonell 1992 długołęcki et al 2010 wu et al 1994 previous studies have pointed out the use of ceramic based membranes with ion exchange properties as a promising alternative to polymeric iems dzyazko et al 2007 linkov and belyakov 2001 among these the sodium na super ionic conductor nasicon structured solid electrolyte has attracted considerable attention due to its high na selectivity this is demonstrated by its integral na transference number of 1 song et al 2016 owing to its high selectivity it is applicable in wastewater remediation balagopal et al 1999 fountain et al 2008 girard et al 1999 as well as in sensors and batteries goodenough et al 1976 hong 1976 ivanov et al 1994 leonhard et al 1994 zhao et al 2018 herein the superior na selective and water impermeable characteristics of nasicon were demonstrated compared to cem subsequently for the first time nasicon was introduced in place of cem in the ed system by constructing the nasicon applied electrodialysis n ed system which compensates for the weakness of the conventional ed system fig 1 this approach enabled the selective extraction of na from seawater in the diluate while minimizing water loss additionally the n ed system was expanded to a seawater battery for desalination swb d system by substituting nasicon with na metal as a battery anode interposed between two nasicons thus the unit cell scale ed n ed and swb d systems were constructed to compare their desalination performances this study collates the above insights and proposes a new nasicon based ceramic conductive membrane for enhancing electrochemical desalination technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents solutions for testing selectivity osmosis and electro osmosis of the membrane were prepared by dissolving nacl 99 alfa aesar na2so4 99 dae jung cacl2 99 junsei mgcl2 98 sigma aldrich and 18 2 mω cm 1 milli q water merck millipore seawater for the electrode solution of ed and n ed and catholyte for swb d was simulated by blending 38 g of sea salt shinan co ltd republic of korea with di deionization water to prepare 1 l of seawater this can reduce inconsistencies such as variation in concentrations of ions or other organic and inorganic substances when using real seawater jeju magma seawater jeju technopark which is underground seawater that is naturally filtered by basaltic rocks on jeju island was adopted as the diluate of ed n ed and swb d table s1 due to its abundant mineral content it is widely exploited after several refinement processes such as electrodialysis for pharmaceutical nutraceutical and cosmetic applications 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 cem and nasicon characterization the detailed assembly sequence of cell components is shown in fig 2 a the homemade cell is mainly composed of two polyvinyl chloride pvc endplates 180 180 mm2 thickness 20 mm and silicon gaskets 150 150 mm2 thickness 3 mm which simultaneously serve as an elastic sealant and water channel polyester pe spacers 100 150 mm2 thickness 1 5 mm mesh size 7 7 mm2 filled the water channel inside the gaskets cem neosepta cxp s astom effective size 100 100 mm2 for ed or nasicon 4toone effective size 100 100 mm2 was placed between the two gaskets two window shaped sealants welcos 150 150 mm2 inner hole 100 100 mm2 thickness 50 μm were heat sealed around the edge 5 mm of the nasicon on both sides to keep the silicon gaskets in contact for sealing the pvc endplate was hollowed out to make a cuboid void 100 100 mm2 thickness 10 mm this surrounded the current collecting components made up of 2 sheets of carbon felt dissol 100 100 mm2 between a sheet of titanium mesh mesh size 1 3 2 0 mm2 thickness 0 48 mm and graphite samjung c g 100 100 mm2 thickness 0 3 mm at both ends they were tightly clamped with titanium nuts and bolts inside the hollow of the endplate for the counter ion selectivity measurements conventional hittorf methods were applied by using a two compartmented cell divided by the membrane sata 2007 accordingly we also followed the two compartment cell structures to compare the perm selectivity of counter ions through different types of membranes in this experiment constant voltage 2 v was applied to induce attraction of na ion towards the cathode compartment containing 0 2 m cacl2 from the anode compartment filled with 0 2 m nacl fig 2 b likewise ca2 and mg2 ions were attracted toward the cathode compartment 0 2 m nacl from the anode compartment filled with 0 2 m cacl2 or 0 2 m mgcl2 respectively during the investigation of osmosis through the membrane one cell was initially filled with 0 6 m of na2so4 solution 500 ml while the other had 0 15 m solution 500 ml as shown in fig 2 c the flow velocity of circulation from a reservoir containing 0 5 l of the solution to the cell was set to 50 ml min fig 2 c this elucidated the osmotic characteristics of the membrane by minimizing other types of pressure meanwhile the flow velocity of circulation was 200 ml min to ensure uniform blending of the solution during the electro osmosis test of the membrane fig 2 d the water electrolysis reaction was utilized during the electro osmosis experiment instead of the conventional ag agcl reaction drioli and giorno 2018 therefore h2so4 and naoh were added to the cathode and anode respectively to offset the ph variation due to water electrolysis the change in volume due to manipulation was considered for volume measurement 2 2 2 system configuration batch mode the detailed assembly sequences of the cell components are shown in fig 3 a basic cell components were used for the investigation of membrane characterization the ed cell was assembled by inserting gaskets between cem aem neosepta ase astom effective size 100 100 mm2 and two pvc endplates at either end fig 3 b the current collecting components in the hollow of the endplate were fastened with titanium bolts likewise n ed adopted the same components and assembly sequence but was equipped with nasicon instead of the cem fig 3 c the nasicon was heat sealed with sealant as prepared in the membrane characterization test similarly the same components of ed and n ed were utilized to fabricate the swb d system as shown in fig 3 a while cem or nasicon was substituted with a rectangular shaped seawater battery anode 4toone as shown in fig 3 d the anode was fabricated by injecting the electrolyte 2 m biphenyl and 0 1 m napf6 in dimethyl ether into the inner space of the airtight rectangular pe frame attached to two nasicons on either side fig s1 the injection process was performed in an argon filled glove box o2 and h2o 1 ppm mg l an sus mesh current collector 50 mesh 100 100 mm2 was dipped inside the electrolyte and electrically extended outside using an sus battery tab the basic flow configurations of ed n ed and swb d are divided into two main streams diluate and brine as shown in fig 3 e and f the brine stream simulated seawater simultaneously serves as an electrode solution which passes through the electrode chambers of the cell system and flows back to a 20 l reservoir in batch mode fig s2 a the seawater in the reservoir was circulated through a column filled with ion exchange resin amberlite ira 67 free base to buffer the ph change due to water electrolysis inside the cell system fig s2 b meanwhile the diluate stream of ed and n ed continuously passed through the chamber between the aem and cem or nasicon and flowed back to a bottle containing 250 ml of jeju magma seawater unlike the ed and n ed the swb d diluate chamber was intermittently emptied and the water was completely preserved in the bottle during the discharge process of the battery fig 3 f subsequently the diluate stream flowed into the chamber during the next charging sequence the internal circulation flow rates of both the brine and diluate streams were fixed at 0 5 l min 2 3 electrochemical tests and analytical method potentiostatic and galvanostatic experiments were conducted using a potentiostat sp 300 bio logic the ionic conductivity of the diluate was recorded in situ using an individual conductivity meter connected to a data acquisition system et902 probe connected to epu452 edaq the theoretical conductivity change was plotted by connecting initial and final spots the initial spot was attained by measuring the conductivity of feed seawater the final conductivity spot was achieved by measuring the synthesized ionic solution assuming all nacl was removed from the seawater without any loss of water the anionic and cationic compositions of seawater were analyzed using an ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 6000 thermo fisher scientific corp equipped with an anion and cation specific ic column dionex ionpactm as14 and cs12a for anions and cations respectively thermo fisher scientific corp the eluents for the anion and cation analyses were 22 mm koh sigma aldrich and 6 mm methanesulfonic acid msa 99 5 sigma aldrich respectively all water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter 25cs045as advantec to remove the non dissolved substances prior to the ic measurements 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 water permeability coefficient osmotic pressure induced water transfer across the membrane and this phenomenon can be expressed as j w a δ π δ p where j w is the water flux across the membrane a is the normalized water permeability nmp coefficient δ π is the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane and δ p is the hydrostatic pressure difference 2 4 2 charge efficiency and specific energy consumption charge efficiency ζ is a measure of how effectively ions are transported across the ion exchange membranes in a given condition it is calculated according to ζ zf v i c i v f c f q where z is the charge of the component ion in seawater f is the faraday constant 96485 a s mol v i and v f are the initial and final volumes respectively and c i and c f are the initial and final concentrations of the corresponding ion respectively the specific energy consumption sec is defined as the ratio of energy consumed to the final water volume or the mass of the extracted salt nacl this is expressed as sec v dq v d or m nacl where v is the charging voltage the discharging voltage of the battery is regarded as a negative value v d is the final volume of the diluate and m n a c l is the mass of the extracted salt nacl in this study the product could be either water or extracted sodium chloride salt 3 results and discussion 3 1 nasicon vs cem the unique properties of nasicon can be explained by its crystal structure fig s3 the representative composition of nasicon na1 xzr2sixp3 xo12 0 x 3 x 2 in this study comprises corner sharing tetrahedra sio4 po4 and octahedra zro6 which form a 3d network of channels for na transport fig 1 e the interstitial na sites present between the gaps of the framework are simultaneously filled with mobile na and available adjacent vacancies which promote na diffusion throughout the membrane although the detailed microscopic mechanism of na transfer remains to be investigated the concerted migration mechanism appears to be quite common in fast ion conductors which is triggered by the coulomb interaction between the migrating and neighboring mobile na zhang et al 2018 when the mobile na travels to the next interstitial site it should pass through the bottleneck formed by three oxygen atoms whose centers make up an isosceles triangle zou et al 2020 accordingly larger ions can hardly pass through the bottleneck although ions are smaller than na they can barely proceed while simultaneously interacting with the embedded na and overcoming the energy barrier for activation khireddine et al 1997 zhang et al 2018 moreover the solid electrolyte is not permeable to water because of its low porosity balagopal et al 1999 therefore unlike the cem nasicon facilitates na ion transfer selectively while blocking other ions or water on the basis of the above mentioned theoretical background the following experiments demonstrated the superior na ion selectivity and water impermeability of nasicon as compared to commercialized cem 3 1 1 ion selectivity target ions were attracted when the constant voltage 2 v was applied across the membrane under investigation different currents according to various target ions represent how well the membrane facilitates the ion migration when cem was inserted between the electrodes the values of total capacity were derived by integrating the current by time and they were 150 100 and 100 mah for na ca2 and mg2 respectively fig 4 a the total electrical capacity induced by the constantly applied potential difference between the electrodes can be inferred as the number of cations crossing the membrane this shows that cem has comparably higher selectivity toward na compared to ca2 or mg2 however cem is still permeable to both ca2 and mg2 which may contribute to the leakage of minerals other than na during the operation of ed furthermore the scale would be formed on the membrane when both ions encounter an alkaline environment beyond the membrane on the other hand the two compartment cell with nasicon was only operable when na was introduced as a mobile cation crossing the membrane fig 4 b when the mobility of mg2 and ca2 throughout the membrane was investigated the current densities in both cases exhibited a dramatic decrease to 0 this resulted in an incomparably small total capacity compared to that when na passed through the nasicon 89 mah this indicates that mg2 and ca2 cannot cross the nasicon unlike na this was attributed to size constraints balagopal et al 1999 and kinetic effects khireddine et al 1997 in other words it was shown that nasicon ensures superior performance in transferring na selectively while blocking mg2 and ca2 nevertheless its areal resistance was 111 ω cm2 and higher than that of the conventional cems 11 ω cm2 because of the 10 times thicker nasicon 1000 µm required for retaining its mechanical strength compared to the flexible and filmy 110 µm cem fig s4 however the total ionic conductivity of the nasicon 0 9 ms cm is similar to that of the conventional cems 1 2 ms cm which is the intrinsic property of the membrane díaz and kamcev 2021 sarapulova et al 2015 in this sense the development of the thinner nasicon will facilitate the fast and selective ion transfer through the membrane to further optimize the nasicon membrane for example it was revealed that the strategy to cut the ceramic into small bricks and put them together with elastic polymer provides flexibility preventing the break of the ceramic kim et al 2021 another strategy is changing the composition with reduced zro2 secondary phase to improve 3 times higher total conductivity than the one with higher zro2 contents go et al 2021 moreover the composition change enhances the bend strength for 30 providing opportunity for the thinner membrane fabrication then such advance would progressively contribute to adapting nasicon for ed use in place of the cem to prevent scales and effectively extract na 3 1 2 osmosis and electro osmosis the water transport through ion exchange membranes is caused by osmosis and by electroosmosis the osmotic water transport is the result of concentration differences between the two solutions separated by the membrane the electroosmosis phenomenon on the other hand accounts for the transportation of water which accompanies ions migrating through the membrane due to an electrical potential gradient while forming the hydration shell surrounding the ions one can observe the variations of water quantities using a two compartment cell containing differently concentrated solutions in each compartment separated by various types of membrane drioli and giorno 2018 fig 5 e demonstrates that the cell equipped with the cem showed variation in water level due to the osmotic pressure when no potential gradient was applied fig 5 a osmotic pressure induced water transfer from b to a through the cem and this phenomenon can be expressed by the nmp herein δ π is 11 atm at room temperature 24 c because of the differentially concentrated solutions 0 6 m vs 0 15 m when δ p was set to 0 accordingly the nmp coefficient of the cem is 0 0112 l h m2 bar and the water flux through the membrane was 0 125 l h m2 meanwhile the water level remained constant when nasicon was introduced fig 5 b this demonstrates the water impermeability of nasicon whose nmp coefficient is derived to be zero as explained nasicon accommodates channels only for na along the interstitial sites of its crystal structures and this fundamentally blocks water penetration the same osmotic pressure was applied in the electro osmotic water transport measurements as shown in fig 5 c and d owing to the same configuration of differently concentrated solutions as shown in fig 5 a and b the galvanostatic process at 100 a m2 was conducted to promote the ion migration through the membrane as a result the water level of a increased by 4 ml ah while b diminished at a similar rate of volume change in section a fig 5 f this demonstrates that the electro osmotic pressure exerted from b toward a due to the na movement accompanying water overwhelmed the osmotic pressure from a toward b on the other hand when nasicon was introduced the water levels of both a and b remained constant the transfer of na through nasicon in fig 5 d implies that na detaches surrounding water for hydration before it enters the nasicon channel hence unlike cem water cannot permeate nasicon by osmotic or electro osmotic effects previous study revealed that the nasicon crystal structure accommodates space of the na pathway 2 2 å which is smaller than the size of h2o 2 75 å so that water molecules cannot pass through it zou et al 2020 this can be explained by the densely packed structure 3 17 g cm3 97 of the theoretical density of the membrane with closed micro pores so that even air was not allowed to pass it fig s5 and s6 in every ed process both osmotic and electro osmotic pressures are always applied from the dilute to the concentrate compartment this is due to the lower concentration of the diluate after the desalination process and the direction of the moving ions which is always heading toward the concentrate compartment in this experiment the situations of a and b correspond to the concentrate and diluate compartments in the ed system respectively therefore the utilization of the nasicon membrane instead of the cem would remarkably minimize the loss of water in the diluate thus preventing water transfer through the membrane by osmosis and electro osmosis 3 2 performance of ed vs n ed system subsequently the unique desalting property of nasicon was investigated by establishing n ed and comparing it with the conventional ed as a reference as shown in fig 1 a and c in conventional ed electrolysis occurs at the electrodes with hydrogen h2 and hydroxyl oh ions being produced at the negative electrode cathode in contrast chlorine cl2 oxygen o2 and hydrogen h ions are produced at the positive electrode anode mulder and mulder 1996 during the galvanostatic charge process 2 a m2 of both ed and n ed fig 6 a the voltage plateaued at 0 8 1 1 v this is expected to be induced by the redox couple of oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode and anode respectively however the ed exhibited a slightly lower voltage 0 2 v than n ed because of the higher resistance of the thicker nasicon 1000 μm compared to the polymeric cem 110 μm as the charge process proceeds the discrepancy in salinity between the diluate and brine across the membranes may lead to the gradual increase in osmosis in addition to the electro osmotic force indeed there was a loss of diluate volume in both systems as shown in fig 6 b consequently the accelerated water transfer from the diluate to the brine chamber may widen the gap between the actual black and red dots and theoretical grey dotted line salinity trend where 100 charge efficiency was assumed without water loss as shown in the salinity trends of ed with n ed in batch mode the charge efficiency of n ed 94 is 1 13 times higher than that of ed 83 this implies that the additional effects of nasicon such as preventing the diffusion of ions into the diluate also contributed to the charge efficiency increase of the n ed system meanwhile the final volume of diluate in case of n ed 180 ml is 1 3 times larger than that of ed 132 ml the smaller loss of diluate volume in n ed is attributed to the impermeable characteristic of the nasicon against water as discussed previously in fig 5 however water leaked to some degree through the anion exchange membrane aem the energy consumption during the whole duration of the experiment of ed was 2 28 wh which is relatively lower than that of n ed 3 17 wh when both the total energy consumption and the final volume of treated water are considered the sec for the product water of n ed 17 6 wh l becomes comparable to that of ed 17 3 wh l in terms of the amount of extracted nacl salt the sec of n ed is 0 48 wh gnacl which outperforms the performance of the ed 0 55 wh gnacl throughout the desalination process na in the diluate was removed almost completely 98 in the n ed while the concentration of na in the ed declined by only 29 fig 6 c furthermore n ed successfully preserved bivalent minerals such as mg2 and ca2 in diluates other than na this demonstrates the high selectivity of nasicon toward na the rate of concentration increases in the bivalent cations 130 is inversely proportional to the reduction ratio of the diluate volume 72 this is ascribed to the complete impermeability of bivalent ions and the water in the diluate leaked only through the aem meanwhile the minerals in the ed failed to remain in the diluate because they were transported into the brine through the cem likewise concentrations of anions such as cl and so4 2 in n ed were reduced considerably compared to those in ed although no3 concentration reductions in both cases were similar this is due to the characteristics of the aem which include non selectivity toward specific ions allowing the transfer of anions randomly voltage and ionic concentration are also correlated the na concentration in the diluate of n ed was reduced continuously whereas the concentration decrease of ed was substantially low accordingly the voltage of n ed increased earlier owing to the higher ohmic drop of the dilute compartment while the voltage of ed remained nearly constant in addition the abrupt increase in the voltage of n ed can be explained by the depletion of na although the conductivity is yet to be 17 7 ms cm due to the remaining ions such as ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 3 3 concept and performance of swb d the unique properties of nasicon facilitated an exceptional pathway for na these characteristics can be utilized to accommodate na as a mobile ion in a rechargeable seawater battery swb go et al 2021 kim et al 2016 swb is a novel energy storage platform that enables the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy by tapping into seawater as an infinite medium hwang et al 2019 senthilkumar et al 2019 it consists of anode and cathode compartments separated by nasicon the seawater battery stores electrical energy in the chemical bonds of na via the electrolysis oxidation of seawater on the cathode side and the reduction of na ions extracted from seawater on the anode side upon discharging the battery reduces the seawater by transferring na ions back into it and converting the stored chemical energy into electricity the open structured cathode configuration which enables a continuous supply of fresh seawater catholyte i e cathode and electrolyte allows for the unlimited utilization of seawater during the charge discharge operation further this battery can be developed into a seawater battery for desalination swb d by replacing nasicon in n ed with a rechargeable seawater battery anode na metal with an organic electrolyte interposed between two nasicon plates as shown in fig 3 d f and fig s1 its concept and charge discharge mechanisms were proven in a previous study kim et al 2020 as follows 1 battery anode n a e na s e o 2 71 v vs she 2 battery cathode 4 o h aq o 2 aq 2 h 2 o l 4 e e o 0 75 v vs she ph 8 4 the forward reaction is favored during the charging process of the battery system with na migrating from the diluate to be reduced at the battery anode negative electrode and oxygen evolving at the battery cathode for charging positive electrode according to eqs 1 and 2 fig 7 a simultaneously cl from the diluate is attracted toward the cathode for charging positive electrode and the salinity of the diluate continuously declines during the charging process of the battery subsequently upon discharging the reduced na metal is oxidized into na and emitted toward the brine which is the battery cathode for discharging negative electrode through the nasicon on the side opposite that for the charge process the electrochemical reaction follows eqs 1 and 2 and the backward reaction is favored the overall reaction provides incomparably high energy density 4010 wh kg than other desalination batteries 78 wh kg to date chen et al 2017 desai et al 2018 nam et al 2019 nam and choi 2017 pasta et al 2012 wang et al 2018 in this experiment the operation of swb d by introducing the two sided nasicon structured rechargeable seawater battery anode was demonstrated for the first time fig 7 b the configuration is shown in fig 3 f the introduction of a two sided nasicon anode is of unique significance to the system in which the concentration of the diluate is unaffected during the discharge process this dispenses with the water exchange between every charge and discharge process which is indispensable for the operation of other desalination batteries chen et al 2017 desai et al 2018 nam et al 2019 nam and choi 2017 pasta et al 2012 wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 b the voltage during the galvanostatic charging and discharging processes 2 a m2 agrees well with the theoretical voltage when the polarization of the battery is considered in addition it was demonstrated that the salinity of the diluate continuously diminished during the charging process but remained constant during the discharging process the sequential galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles were conducted for 240 mah each until the voltage drastically soared during the charging process fig 8 a although energy was consumed during the charging process 12 18 wh 78 of the energy was recovered during the discharge process 9 55 wh hence the net energy consumption was 2 62 wh the salinity reduction throughout each charging process resembles that of n ed furthermore the water loss of the diluate was the same as that of the diluate in the n ed fig 8 b likewise the final ionic concentrations of the principal ions also matched those of n ed fig 8 c these similarities are ascribed to the effect of replacing cem with nasicon in the desalination system as discussed in section 3 2 3 4 comparison as demonstrated nasicon based systems possess outstanding capability of extracting na without loss of water and valuable minerals although it is not as conductive as the cem based system therefore the lower energy consumption of ed did not lead to the lower specific energy consumption compared to the nasicon based systems table 1 this is due to the low productivity of the diluate and salt extraction performance in addition due to severe water leakage from the diluate to the brine in the ed the final concentration of ed was incomparably higher than those of the nasicon ed and swb d systems among the nasicon based systems swb d is more energy efficient than n ed owing to energy recovery during the discharging process although it takes twice as much time to proceed with both the charge and discharge processes 4 conclusions the unique properties of nasicon were investigated which is impenetrable by water and ions other than na by utilizing nasicon instead of cem in the ed system a nasicon ed system n ed was suggested for the first time it outperformed conventional ed in terms of several factors the productivity of the diluate the specific energy consumption for nacl extraction and the na selective ion removal rate in this sense n ed is expected to be effective for various industries such as salt manufacturing chlor alkali or demineralization processes where ed has been actively applied moreover a seawater battery for desalination swb d was demonstrated with a two sided nasicon structured rechargeable seawater battery anode that enables simultaneous selective desalination and energy storage the performance of the swb d exhibited comparable productivity and na selective ion removal rate of the final diluate to that of n ed moreover its energy efficiency was superior to that of n ed due to the energy recovery discharge process subsequent to the desalination charging process swb d can expand battery applications for linking unreliable renewable energy supplies with previously developed desalination technologies e g seawater reverse osmosis ro or brackish water ro for the next generation desalination based on the results of this study the nasicon based desalination system will open up many new possibilities for selective desalination and seawater applications

16158,seawater is a virtually unlimited source of minerals and water hence electrodialysis ed is an attractive route for selective seawater desalination due to the selectivity of its ion exchange membrane iem toward the target ion however a solution like iem which is permeable to water and ions other than the target ion results in the leakage of water as well as extraction of unwanted ions this degrades the productivity and purity of the system in this study a novel desalination system was developed by replacing the cation exchange membrane cem with a na super ionic conductor nasicon in ed nasicon exceptionally permits na ion migration and this enhanced the productivity of desalted water by removing 98 of na while retaining water and other cationic minerals therefore the final volume of desalted water in n ed was 1 36 times larger compared to that of ed in addition the specific energy consumption for salt nacl extraction was reduced by 13 furthermore the nasicon in n ed was replaced into a two sided nasicon structured rechargeable seawater battery thereby further conserving 20 energy by simultaneously coupling selective desalination with energy storage our findings have positive implications and further optimizations of the nasicon will enable practical and energy effective applications for seawater utilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nasicon electrodialysis nacl extraction process seawater desalination 1 introduction seawater is a massive natural reservoir of minerals and freshwater petersen 1994 a great demand for na ca mg k and li exists in the agricultural industrial environmental remediation and medical fields and they can be profitably extracted from seawater loganathan et al 2017 shahmansouri et al 2015 a classic example of this is nacl common table salt which is indispensable for human life and is used in the food glass soap detergent textile pulp and paper industries petersen 1994 to successfully segregate seawater into water and desirous salt thermal electrical or physical processes are required chen et al 2021 pistocchi et al 2020 pramanik et al 2020 among the various processes of seawater separation electrodialysis ed is superior to other technologies for ion selective desalination strathmann 2010 this process is driven by a difference in electrical potential over a membrane stack where charged compounds are selectively transferred from a feed solution through a pair of anion and cation exchange membranes fig 1 a xie et al 2016 for example salt manufacturing companies have been economically producing nacl from seawater using ed since the 1970s at a production rate of 360 000 t yr during 1970 1980 kobuchi et al 1983 the ion selectivity of ed is mainly attributed to the polymeric ion exchange membrane iem luo et al 2018 ion transport under the driving forces of concentration or electrical potential gradient through iems can be explained by the solution diffusion model fig 1 d sata 2000 according to this model the membrane structure is divided into two phases the gel and interstitial phase kreuer et al 2004 the gel phase is composed of polymer chains and hydrophilic ion exchange groups bound to the chains the interstitial phase is the void between the elements of the gel phase it is assumed to be a space filled with an electro neutral solution water containing ions which is responsible for ion transport the four possible mechanisms for transport in this phase are diffusion electromigration convection and surface site hopping saito et al 2004 thampan et al 2000 however this solution like ion transfer mechanism may also cause the transport of unwanted ions other than na furthermore water may migrate across the membrane via spontaneous phenomena such as osmosis electro osmosis electro migration and diffusion lakshminarayanaiah 1965 lakshminarayanaiah and subrahmanyan 1968 these can have detrimental effects on freshwater production as well as in salt manufacturing tanaka 2011 for example during salt manufacturing from brine by ed it is important to control water transfer through the membrane to prevent dilution of the final product jiang et al 2014 to cope with this problem previous studies have shown that ion selectivity in polymeric membranes can be improved by modifying the surface of iems khoiruddin et al 2017 introducing novel bulk morphology of membranes balster et al 2005 or blending polymers zhang et al 2013 however no method perfectly prevented the passage of other undesirable ions through a membrane whose transference number was still below unity 0 89 0 99 cwirko and carbonell 1992 długołęcki et al 2010 wu et al 1994 previous studies have pointed out the use of ceramic based membranes with ion exchange properties as a promising alternative to polymeric iems dzyazko et al 2007 linkov and belyakov 2001 among these the sodium na super ionic conductor nasicon structured solid electrolyte has attracted considerable attention due to its high na selectivity this is demonstrated by its integral na transference number of 1 song et al 2016 owing to its high selectivity it is applicable in wastewater remediation balagopal et al 1999 fountain et al 2008 girard et al 1999 as well as in sensors and batteries goodenough et al 1976 hong 1976 ivanov et al 1994 leonhard et al 1994 zhao et al 2018 herein the superior na selective and water impermeable characteristics of nasicon were demonstrated compared to cem subsequently for the first time nasicon was introduced in place of cem in the ed system by constructing the nasicon applied electrodialysis n ed system which compensates for the weakness of the conventional ed system fig 1 this approach enabled the selective extraction of na from seawater in the diluate while minimizing water loss additionally the n ed system was expanded to a seawater battery for desalination swb d system by substituting nasicon with na metal as a battery anode interposed between two nasicons thus the unit cell scale ed n ed and swb d systems were constructed to compare their desalination performances this study collates the above insights and proposes a new nasicon based ceramic conductive membrane for enhancing electrochemical desalination technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents solutions for testing selectivity osmosis and electro osmosis of the membrane were prepared by dissolving nacl 99 alfa aesar na2so4 99 dae jung cacl2 99 junsei mgcl2 98 sigma aldrich and 18 2 mω cm 1 milli q water merck millipore seawater for the electrode solution of ed and n ed and catholyte for swb d was simulated by blending 38 g of sea salt shinan co ltd republic of korea with di deionization water to prepare 1 l of seawater this can reduce inconsistencies such as variation in concentrations of ions or other organic and inorganic substances when using real seawater jeju magma seawater jeju technopark which is underground seawater that is naturally filtered by basaltic rocks on jeju island was adopted as the diluate of ed n ed and swb d table s1 due to its abundant mineral content it is widely exploited after several refinement processes such as electrodialysis for pharmaceutical nutraceutical and cosmetic applications 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 cem and nasicon characterization the detailed assembly sequence of cell components is shown in fig 2 a the homemade cell is mainly composed of two polyvinyl chloride pvc endplates 180 180 mm2 thickness 20 mm and silicon gaskets 150 150 mm2 thickness 3 mm which simultaneously serve as an elastic sealant and water channel polyester pe spacers 100 150 mm2 thickness 1 5 mm mesh size 7 7 mm2 filled the water channel inside the gaskets cem neosepta cxp s astom effective size 100 100 mm2 for ed or nasicon 4toone effective size 100 100 mm2 was placed between the two gaskets two window shaped sealants welcos 150 150 mm2 inner hole 100 100 mm2 thickness 50 μm were heat sealed around the edge 5 mm of the nasicon on both sides to keep the silicon gaskets in contact for sealing the pvc endplate was hollowed out to make a cuboid void 100 100 mm2 thickness 10 mm this surrounded the current collecting components made up of 2 sheets of carbon felt dissol 100 100 mm2 between a sheet of titanium mesh mesh size 1 3 2 0 mm2 thickness 0 48 mm and graphite samjung c g 100 100 mm2 thickness 0 3 mm at both ends they were tightly clamped with titanium nuts and bolts inside the hollow of the endplate for the counter ion selectivity measurements conventional hittorf methods were applied by using a two compartmented cell divided by the membrane sata 2007 accordingly we also followed the two compartment cell structures to compare the perm selectivity of counter ions through different types of membranes in this experiment constant voltage 2 v was applied to induce attraction of na ion towards the cathode compartment containing 0 2 m cacl2 from the anode compartment filled with 0 2 m nacl fig 2 b likewise ca2 and mg2 ions were attracted toward the cathode compartment 0 2 m nacl from the anode compartment filled with 0 2 m cacl2 or 0 2 m mgcl2 respectively during the investigation of osmosis through the membrane one cell was initially filled with 0 6 m of na2so4 solution 500 ml while the other had 0 15 m solution 500 ml as shown in fig 2 c the flow velocity of circulation from a reservoir containing 0 5 l of the solution to the cell was set to 50 ml min fig 2 c this elucidated the osmotic characteristics of the membrane by minimizing other types of pressure meanwhile the flow velocity of circulation was 200 ml min to ensure uniform blending of the solution during the electro osmosis test of the membrane fig 2 d the water electrolysis reaction was utilized during the electro osmosis experiment instead of the conventional ag agcl reaction drioli and giorno 2018 therefore h2so4 and naoh were added to the cathode and anode respectively to offset the ph variation due to water electrolysis the change in volume due to manipulation was considered for volume measurement 2 2 2 system configuration batch mode the detailed assembly sequences of the cell components are shown in fig 3 a basic cell components were used for the investigation of membrane characterization the ed cell was assembled by inserting gaskets between cem aem neosepta ase astom effective size 100 100 mm2 and two pvc endplates at either end fig 3 b the current collecting components in the hollow of the endplate were fastened with titanium bolts likewise n ed adopted the same components and assembly sequence but was equipped with nasicon instead of the cem fig 3 c the nasicon was heat sealed with sealant as prepared in the membrane characterization test similarly the same components of ed and n ed were utilized to fabricate the swb d system as shown in fig 3 a while cem or nasicon was substituted with a rectangular shaped seawater battery anode 4toone as shown in fig 3 d the anode was fabricated by injecting the electrolyte 2 m biphenyl and 0 1 m napf6 in dimethyl ether into the inner space of the airtight rectangular pe frame attached to two nasicons on either side fig s1 the injection process was performed in an argon filled glove box o2 and h2o 1 ppm mg l an sus mesh current collector 50 mesh 100 100 mm2 was dipped inside the electrolyte and electrically extended outside using an sus battery tab the basic flow configurations of ed n ed and swb d are divided into two main streams diluate and brine as shown in fig 3 e and f the brine stream simulated seawater simultaneously serves as an electrode solution which passes through the electrode chambers of the cell system and flows back to a 20 l reservoir in batch mode fig s2 a the seawater in the reservoir was circulated through a column filled with ion exchange resin amberlite ira 67 free base to buffer the ph change due to water electrolysis inside the cell system fig s2 b meanwhile the diluate stream of ed and n ed continuously passed through the chamber between the aem and cem or nasicon and flowed back to a bottle containing 250 ml of jeju magma seawater unlike the ed and n ed the swb d diluate chamber was intermittently emptied and the water was completely preserved in the bottle during the discharge process of the battery fig 3 f subsequently the diluate stream flowed into the chamber during the next charging sequence the internal circulation flow rates of both the brine and diluate streams were fixed at 0 5 l min 2 3 electrochemical tests and analytical method potentiostatic and galvanostatic experiments were conducted using a potentiostat sp 300 bio logic the ionic conductivity of the diluate was recorded in situ using an individual conductivity meter connected to a data acquisition system et902 probe connected to epu452 edaq the theoretical conductivity change was plotted by connecting initial and final spots the initial spot was attained by measuring the conductivity of feed seawater the final conductivity spot was achieved by measuring the synthesized ionic solution assuming all nacl was removed from the seawater without any loss of water the anionic and cationic compositions of seawater were analyzed using an ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 6000 thermo fisher scientific corp equipped with an anion and cation specific ic column dionex ionpactm as14 and cs12a for anions and cations respectively thermo fisher scientific corp the eluents for the anion and cation analyses were 22 mm koh sigma aldrich and 6 mm methanesulfonic acid msa 99 5 sigma aldrich respectively all water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter 25cs045as advantec to remove the non dissolved substances prior to the ic measurements 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 water permeability coefficient osmotic pressure induced water transfer across the membrane and this phenomenon can be expressed as j w a δ π δ p where j w is the water flux across the membrane a is the normalized water permeability nmp coefficient δ π is the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane and δ p is the hydrostatic pressure difference 2 4 2 charge efficiency and specific energy consumption charge efficiency ζ is a measure of how effectively ions are transported across the ion exchange membranes in a given condition it is calculated according to ζ zf v i c i v f c f q where z is the charge of the component ion in seawater f is the faraday constant 96485 a s mol v i and v f are the initial and final volumes respectively and c i and c f are the initial and final concentrations of the corresponding ion respectively the specific energy consumption sec is defined as the ratio of energy consumed to the final water volume or the mass of the extracted salt nacl this is expressed as sec v dq v d or m nacl where v is the charging voltage the discharging voltage of the battery is regarded as a negative value v d is the final volume of the diluate and m n a c l is the mass of the extracted salt nacl in this study the product could be either water or extracted sodium chloride salt 3 results and discussion 3 1 nasicon vs cem the unique properties of nasicon can be explained by its crystal structure fig s3 the representative composition of nasicon na1 xzr2sixp3 xo12 0 x 3 x 2 in this study comprises corner sharing tetrahedra sio4 po4 and octahedra zro6 which form a 3d network of channels for na transport fig 1 e the interstitial na sites present between the gaps of the framework are simultaneously filled with mobile na and available adjacent vacancies which promote na diffusion throughout the membrane although the detailed microscopic mechanism of na transfer remains to be investigated the concerted migration mechanism appears to be quite common in fast ion conductors which is triggered by the coulomb interaction between the migrating and neighboring mobile na zhang et al 2018 when the mobile na travels to the next interstitial site it should pass through the bottleneck formed by three oxygen atoms whose centers make up an isosceles triangle zou et al 2020 accordingly larger ions can hardly pass through the bottleneck although ions are smaller than na they can barely proceed while simultaneously interacting with the embedded na and overcoming the energy barrier for activation khireddine et al 1997 zhang et al 2018 moreover the solid electrolyte is not permeable to water because of its low porosity balagopal et al 1999 therefore unlike the cem nasicon facilitates na ion transfer selectively while blocking other ions or water on the basis of the above mentioned theoretical background the following experiments demonstrated the superior na ion selectivity and water impermeability of nasicon as compared to commercialized cem 3 1 1 ion selectivity target ions were attracted when the constant voltage 2 v was applied across the membrane under investigation different currents according to various target ions represent how well the membrane facilitates the ion migration when cem was inserted between the electrodes the values of total capacity were derived by integrating the current by time and they were 150 100 and 100 mah for na ca2 and mg2 respectively fig 4 a the total electrical capacity induced by the constantly applied potential difference between the electrodes can be inferred as the number of cations crossing the membrane this shows that cem has comparably higher selectivity toward na compared to ca2 or mg2 however cem is still permeable to both ca2 and mg2 which may contribute to the leakage of minerals other than na during the operation of ed furthermore the scale would be formed on the membrane when both ions encounter an alkaline environment beyond the membrane on the other hand the two compartment cell with nasicon was only operable when na was introduced as a mobile cation crossing the membrane fig 4 b when the mobility of mg2 and ca2 throughout the membrane was investigated the current densities in both cases exhibited a dramatic decrease to 0 this resulted in an incomparably small total capacity compared to that when na passed through the nasicon 89 mah this indicates that mg2 and ca2 cannot cross the nasicon unlike na this was attributed to size constraints balagopal et al 1999 and kinetic effects khireddine et al 1997 in other words it was shown that nasicon ensures superior performance in transferring na selectively while blocking mg2 and ca2 nevertheless its areal resistance was 111 ω cm2 and higher than that of the conventional cems 11 ω cm2 because of the 10 times thicker nasicon 1000 µm required for retaining its mechanical strength compared to the flexible and filmy 110 µm cem fig s4 however the total ionic conductivity of the nasicon 0 9 ms cm is similar to that of the conventional cems 1 2 ms cm which is the intrinsic property of the membrane díaz and kamcev 2021 sarapulova et al 2015 in this sense the development of the thinner nasicon will facilitate the fast and selective ion transfer through the membrane to further optimize the nasicon membrane for example it was revealed that the strategy to cut the ceramic into small bricks and put them together with elastic polymer provides flexibility preventing the break of the ceramic kim et al 2021 another strategy is changing the composition with reduced zro2 secondary phase to improve 3 times higher total conductivity than the one with higher zro2 contents go et al 2021 moreover the composition change enhances the bend strength for 30 providing opportunity for the thinner membrane fabrication then such advance would progressively contribute to adapting nasicon for ed use in place of the cem to prevent scales and effectively extract na 3 1 2 osmosis and electro osmosis the water transport through ion exchange membranes is caused by osmosis and by electroosmosis the osmotic water transport is the result of concentration differences between the two solutions separated by the membrane the electroosmosis phenomenon on the other hand accounts for the transportation of water which accompanies ions migrating through the membrane due to an electrical potential gradient while forming the hydration shell surrounding the ions one can observe the variations of water quantities using a two compartment cell containing differently concentrated solutions in each compartment separated by various types of membrane drioli and giorno 2018 fig 5 e demonstrates that the cell equipped with the cem showed variation in water level due to the osmotic pressure when no potential gradient was applied fig 5 a osmotic pressure induced water transfer from b to a through the cem and this phenomenon can be expressed by the nmp herein δ π is 11 atm at room temperature 24 c because of the differentially concentrated solutions 0 6 m vs 0 15 m when δ p was set to 0 accordingly the nmp coefficient of the cem is 0 0112 l h m2 bar and the water flux through the membrane was 0 125 l h m2 meanwhile the water level remained constant when nasicon was introduced fig 5 b this demonstrates the water impermeability of nasicon whose nmp coefficient is derived to be zero as explained nasicon accommodates channels only for na along the interstitial sites of its crystal structures and this fundamentally blocks water penetration the same osmotic pressure was applied in the electro osmotic water transport measurements as shown in fig 5 c and d owing to the same configuration of differently concentrated solutions as shown in fig 5 a and b the galvanostatic process at 100 a m2 was conducted to promote the ion migration through the membrane as a result the water level of a increased by 4 ml ah while b diminished at a similar rate of volume change in section a fig 5 f this demonstrates that the electro osmotic pressure exerted from b toward a due to the na movement accompanying water overwhelmed the osmotic pressure from a toward b on the other hand when nasicon was introduced the water levels of both a and b remained constant the transfer of na through nasicon in fig 5 d implies that na detaches surrounding water for hydration before it enters the nasicon channel hence unlike cem water cannot permeate nasicon by osmotic or electro osmotic effects previous study revealed that the nasicon crystal structure accommodates space of the na pathway 2 2 å which is smaller than the size of h2o 2 75 å so that water molecules cannot pass through it zou et al 2020 this can be explained by the densely packed structure 3 17 g cm3 97 of the theoretical density of the membrane with closed micro pores so that even air was not allowed to pass it fig s5 and s6 in every ed process both osmotic and electro osmotic pressures are always applied from the dilute to the concentrate compartment this is due to the lower concentration of the diluate after the desalination process and the direction of the moving ions which is always heading toward the concentrate compartment in this experiment the situations of a and b correspond to the concentrate and diluate compartments in the ed system respectively therefore the utilization of the nasicon membrane instead of the cem would remarkably minimize the loss of water in the diluate thus preventing water transfer through the membrane by osmosis and electro osmosis 3 2 performance of ed vs n ed system subsequently the unique desalting property of nasicon was investigated by establishing n ed and comparing it with the conventional ed as a reference as shown in fig 1 a and c in conventional ed electrolysis occurs at the electrodes with hydrogen h2 and hydroxyl oh ions being produced at the negative electrode cathode in contrast chlorine cl2 oxygen o2 and hydrogen h ions are produced at the positive electrode anode mulder and mulder 1996 during the galvanostatic charge process 2 a m2 of both ed and n ed fig 6 a the voltage plateaued at 0 8 1 1 v this is expected to be induced by the redox couple of oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode and anode respectively however the ed exhibited a slightly lower voltage 0 2 v than n ed because of the higher resistance of the thicker nasicon 1000 μm compared to the polymeric cem 110 μm as the charge process proceeds the discrepancy in salinity between the diluate and brine across the membranes may lead to the gradual increase in osmosis in addition to the electro osmotic force indeed there was a loss of diluate volume in both systems as shown in fig 6 b consequently the accelerated water transfer from the diluate to the brine chamber may widen the gap between the actual black and red dots and theoretical grey dotted line salinity trend where 100 charge efficiency was assumed without water loss as shown in the salinity trends of ed with n ed in batch mode the charge efficiency of n ed 94 is 1 13 times higher than that of ed 83 this implies that the additional effects of nasicon such as preventing the diffusion of ions into the diluate also contributed to the charge efficiency increase of the n ed system meanwhile the final volume of diluate in case of n ed 180 ml is 1 3 times larger than that of ed 132 ml the smaller loss of diluate volume in n ed is attributed to the impermeable characteristic of the nasicon against water as discussed previously in fig 5 however water leaked to some degree through the anion exchange membrane aem the energy consumption during the whole duration of the experiment of ed was 2 28 wh which is relatively lower than that of n ed 3 17 wh when both the total energy consumption and the final volume of treated water are considered the sec for the product water of n ed 17 6 wh l becomes comparable to that of ed 17 3 wh l in terms of the amount of extracted nacl salt the sec of n ed is 0 48 wh gnacl which outperforms the performance of the ed 0 55 wh gnacl throughout the desalination process na in the diluate was removed almost completely 98 in the n ed while the concentration of na in the ed declined by only 29 fig 6 c furthermore n ed successfully preserved bivalent minerals such as mg2 and ca2 in diluates other than na this demonstrates the high selectivity of nasicon toward na the rate of concentration increases in the bivalent cations 130 is inversely proportional to the reduction ratio of the diluate volume 72 this is ascribed to the complete impermeability of bivalent ions and the water in the diluate leaked only through the aem meanwhile the minerals in the ed failed to remain in the diluate because they were transported into the brine through the cem likewise concentrations of anions such as cl and so4 2 in n ed were reduced considerably compared to those in ed although no3 concentration reductions in both cases were similar this is due to the characteristics of the aem which include non selectivity toward specific ions allowing the transfer of anions randomly voltage and ionic concentration are also correlated the na concentration in the diluate of n ed was reduced continuously whereas the concentration decrease of ed was substantially low accordingly the voltage of n ed increased earlier owing to the higher ohmic drop of the dilute compartment while the voltage of ed remained nearly constant in addition the abrupt increase in the voltage of n ed can be explained by the depletion of na although the conductivity is yet to be 17 7 ms cm due to the remaining ions such as ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 3 3 concept and performance of swb d the unique properties of nasicon facilitated an exceptional pathway for na these characteristics can be utilized to accommodate na as a mobile ion in a rechargeable seawater battery swb go et al 2021 kim et al 2016 swb is a novel energy storage platform that enables the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy by tapping into seawater as an infinite medium hwang et al 2019 senthilkumar et al 2019 it consists of anode and cathode compartments separated by nasicon the seawater battery stores electrical energy in the chemical bonds of na via the electrolysis oxidation of seawater on the cathode side and the reduction of na ions extracted from seawater on the anode side upon discharging the battery reduces the seawater by transferring na ions back into it and converting the stored chemical energy into electricity the open structured cathode configuration which enables a continuous supply of fresh seawater catholyte i e cathode and electrolyte allows for the unlimited utilization of seawater during the charge discharge operation further this battery can be developed into a seawater battery for desalination swb d by replacing nasicon in n ed with a rechargeable seawater battery anode na metal with an organic electrolyte interposed between two nasicon plates as shown in fig 3 d f and fig s1 its concept and charge discharge mechanisms were proven in a previous study kim et al 2020 as follows 1 battery anode n a e na s e o 2 71 v vs she 2 battery cathode 4 o h aq o 2 aq 2 h 2 o l 4 e e o 0 75 v vs she ph 8 4 the forward reaction is favored during the charging process of the battery system with na migrating from the diluate to be reduced at the battery anode negative electrode and oxygen evolving at the battery cathode for charging positive electrode according to eqs 1 and 2 fig 7 a simultaneously cl from the diluate is attracted toward the cathode for charging positive electrode and the salinity of the diluate continuously declines during the charging process of the battery subsequently upon discharging the reduced na metal is oxidized into na and emitted toward the brine which is the battery cathode for discharging negative electrode through the nasicon on the side opposite that for the charge process the electrochemical reaction follows eqs 1 and 2 and the backward reaction is favored the overall reaction provides incomparably high energy density 4010 wh kg than other desalination batteries 78 wh kg to date chen et al 2017 desai et al 2018 nam et al 2019 nam and choi 2017 pasta et al 2012 wang et al 2018 in this experiment the operation of swb d by introducing the two sided nasicon structured rechargeable seawater battery anode was demonstrated for the first time fig 7 b the configuration is shown in fig 3 f the introduction of a two sided nasicon anode is of unique significance to the system in which the concentration of the diluate is unaffected during the discharge process this dispenses with the water exchange between every charge and discharge process which is indispensable for the operation of other desalination batteries chen et al 2017 desai et al 2018 nam et al 2019 nam and choi 2017 pasta et al 2012 wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 b the voltage during the galvanostatic charging and discharging processes 2 a m2 agrees well with the theoretical voltage when the polarization of the battery is considered in addition it was demonstrated that the salinity of the diluate continuously diminished during the charging process but remained constant during the discharging process the sequential galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles were conducted for 240 mah each until the voltage drastically soared during the charging process fig 8 a although energy was consumed during the charging process 12 18 wh 78 of the energy was recovered during the discharge process 9 55 wh hence the net energy consumption was 2 62 wh the salinity reduction throughout each charging process resembles that of n ed furthermore the water loss of the diluate was the same as that of the diluate in the n ed fig 8 b likewise the final ionic concentrations of the principal ions also matched those of n ed fig 8 c these similarities are ascribed to the effect of replacing cem with nasicon in the desalination system as discussed in section 3 2 3 4 comparison as demonstrated nasicon based systems possess outstanding capability of extracting na without loss of water and valuable minerals although it is not as conductive as the cem based system therefore the lower energy consumption of ed did not lead to the lower specific energy consumption compared to the nasicon based systems table 1 this is due to the low productivity of the diluate and salt extraction performance in addition due to severe water leakage from the diluate to the brine in the ed the final concentration of ed was incomparably higher than those of the nasicon ed and swb d systems among the nasicon based systems swb d is more energy efficient than n ed owing to energy recovery during the discharging process although it takes twice as much time to proceed with both the charge and discharge processes 4 conclusions the unique properties of nasicon were investigated which is impenetrable by water and ions other than na by utilizing nasicon instead of cem in the ed system a nasicon ed system n ed was suggested for the first time it outperformed conventional ed in terms of several factors the productivity of the diluate the specific energy consumption for nacl extraction and the na selective ion removal rate in this sense n ed is expected to be effective for various industries such as salt manufacturing chlor alkali or demineralization processes where ed has been actively applied moreover a seawater battery for desalination swb d was demonstrated with a two sided nasicon structured rechargeable seawater battery anode that enables simultaneous selective desalination and energy storage the performance of the swb d exhibited comparable productivity and na selective ion removal rate of the final diluate to that of n ed moreover its energy efficiency was superior to that of n ed due to the energy recovery discharge process subsequent to the desalination charging process swb d can expand battery applications for linking unreliable renewable energy supplies with previously developed desalination technologies e g seawater reverse osmosis ro or brackish water ro for the next generation desalination based on the results of this study the nasicon based desalination system will open up many new possibilities for selective desalination and seawater applications

extracellular inorganic minerals among these forms eps bound p mainly orthophosphate ortho p and p precipitates mainly ca p fe p al p and mg p were the major forms of phosphorus in was accounting for 65 82 of total phosphorus tp owing to the acid solubility of p precipitates acid extraction could be a potentially effective means for phosphorus recovery however the co solution of metals may hinder the phosphorus recovery and the eps bound p cannot be recovered by acid extraction to enhance phosphorus release from eps and reduce metal interference a targeted clean extraction technology using acidic cation exchange resin acer was also developed the results showed that a low dosage acer could effectively extract eps bound p and p precipitates and the content of phosphorus in the extract exceeded 50 of tp compared with acid extraction the release efficiency of tp increased by 13 23 and the dissolved metal content decreased by more than 90 in the extract by acer this was attributed to the acidification and metal capture by acer finally more than 90 of ortho p in the extract was recovered as calcium phosphate which alleviated the depletion of phosphorus resources graphical abstract

over the world wilfert et al 2015 in which around 90 of the phosphorus will finally remain in sewage sludge mainly waste activated sludge was liang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 therefore was is one of the important sources for phosphorus recovery zhang et al 2020 the typical method of phosphorus recovery from was is to release phosphorus first and then recover it from the supernatant quist jensen et al 2018 liu et al 2019 given the factor that the occurrence states of phosphorus in was determines its release efficiency identifying the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus has become an important prerequisite for phosphorus recovery it is a well established fact that biological phosphorus removal is mainly through the release of phosphorus by phosphorus accumulating organisms paos under anaerobic conditions and excessive absorption of phosphorus under aerobic conditions so that phosphorus mainly exists in the form of polyphosphate poly p in cells feng et al 2020 however numerous studies have shown that phosphorus is also found in extracellular polymeric substances eps cloete and oosthuizen 2001 li et al 2010 in addition the presence of a large number of metals e g ca mg al and fe in wastewater may precipitate with phosphate p precipitates and exist in inorganic minerals yu et al 2021 therefore in addition to the total dissolved phosphorus tdp in the supernatant phosphorus in solid phase of was may be distributed in cells eps and inorganic minerals which is consistent with the composition of was cao et al 2021 in recent years the method of european commission called standards measurements and testing smt has been usually used to analyze phosphorus chemical speciation he et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 according to the smt protocol inorganic phosphorus ip instead of organic phosphorus op was the main component 50 80 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2019 furthermore ip included apatite p 1 3 ip and non apatite inorganic p 2 3 ip however smt protocol is insufficient because some chemical speciation of phosphorus is not taken into consideration such as poly p with the development of advanced technologies the precise chemical speciation of phosphorus has been qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for example orthophosphate ortho p po4 3 p poly p phosphate monoester dna and pyrophosphate can be detected using 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 unfortunately the simultaneous identification of the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of these phosphorus forms is still an unsolved problem in particular knowledge of the micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in was is limited the insufficient identification on the chemical speciation and spatial distribution of phosphorus in was limits the development of highly efficient technologies for phosphorus recovery specifically compared with alkaline leaching bashir et al 2019 thermal treatment huang and tang 2016 and anaerobic methods li et al 2019 acid extraction has some potentials for further upgrading li et al 2018 quist jensen et al 2018 liang et al 2019 owing to its capacity for extraction of phosphorus from inorganic minerals and cells xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 however acid extraction was previously ineffective in extracting phosphorus in eps quist jensen et al 2018 in addition prior to phosphorus recovery purification of the extract is necessary because of the co dissolution of metals by acid extraction fang et al 2018 lundehoj et al 2019 which increases the complexity of the process hence there is an urgent need to develop a targeted clean phosphorus extraction technology that can effectively extract phosphorus from cells eps and inorganic minerals as well as reduce metal interference a cation exchange resin has been proven to be effective in extracting eps which is ascribed to the destruction of sludge flocs by adsorbing metal ions frølund et al 1996 on this basis the acidic cation exchange resin acer method can be used to simultaneously acidify sludge and extract eps more specifically the acer method may have the potential to simultaneously extract phosphorus from cells eps and inorganic minerals and also reduce the metal interference in the extract by adsorbing them to date such an approach has yet to be explored the objective of this study was to simultaneously identify the spatial distribution of phosphorus in was and its corresponding chemical speciation for the first time on this basis a targeted and clean phosphorus extraction technology was also developed specifically the feasibility of efficient and clean extraction of phosphorus by acer was investigated furthermore the migration and transformation mechanism of phosphorus with acer extraction was revealed all these results are believed to deepen understanding of phosphorus occurrence states in was and facilitate the recovery of non renewable phosphorus resource in the field of waste management 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge the was was discharged from the secondary sedimentation tank and then obtained from the gravity thickening unit in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in shanghai the wwtp adopted anaerobic anoxic oxic process for phosphorus removal first the was was filtered using a stainless steel screen with 1 mm sieve to remove impurities the obtained sludge was then thickened and stored in a 4 c refrigerator to inhibit the release of phosphorus caused by microbial activity wilfert et al 2016 the detailed characteristics of the was used are shown in table 1 2 2 analytical methods for spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus 2 2 1 in situ analysis first the spatial distribution of phosphorus in the sludge was comprehensively analyzed in situ sludge samples were lyophilized at 50 c for 3 days and then treated with spray gold subsequently an analytical high resolution scanning electron microscope sem mira3 czech republic with a backscatter detector in beam bse was used to observe the microstructure of the sludge and the existence of phosphorus was confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds li et al 2015 2 2 2 step by step extraction analysis for the first time the phosphorus in cells inorganic minerals and eps was extracted by cold perchloric acid pca de haas et al 2000 combined with ion exchange resin zhang et al 2013 the joint application of this step by step extraction method and the above in situ analytical method in section 2 2 1 could comprehensively and systematically analyze the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was the flowchart for the fractionation of phosphorus using step by step extraction is shown in fig 1 and the specific procedures are as follows a certain amount of sludge was centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane to analyze tdp in the sludge the pellets were washed twice with 0 1 m nacl to remove the residual dissolved phosphorus in aqueous phase the washed pellets were extracted three times with 0 5 m cold pca and each time lasted for 5 min in the mixed three pca extracts the difference between tdp and po4 3 p was regarded as the poly p in cells of was and po4 3 p was regarded as p precipitates in inorganic minerals of was the phosphorus in eps the phosphorus adsorbed by organic matter in eps eps bound p was extracted using ion exchange resin after discarding the supernatant and washing the sludge pellets twice with 0 1 m nacl the washed pellets were resuspended to its original mass with 0 1 m nacl and then the ion exchange resin dowex marathon c na form 20 50 mesh sigma aldrich added to 70 g g ts after stirring for 6 h at 500 rpm and 4 c in a 100 ml beaker the mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min the eps solution was obtained by filtering the supernatant through 0 45 µm pes membranes a portion of the eps solution was then dried using a vacuum freeze drier tf fd 1 freeze dryer nade zhejiang china at 50 c for 2 days and stored at 20 c for analyzing the chemical speciation of eps bound p by 31p nmr and the remaining eps solution was used to analyze tdp in eps 2 2 3 31p nmr analysis to obtain the optimal spectral resolution and ensure the consistency of chemical shifts the freeze dried eps powder was redissolved in 0 2 ml of d2o and 0 2 ml edta solution 0 1 m after which 0 4 ml of 1 m naoh solution was added turner et al 2003 after the sample was fully mixed the quantitative 31p nmr examination was performed using an avance neo 700 mhz spectrum operating at 162 02 mhz at 25 c with 85 phosphoric acid as the external standard the scanning times were not less than 128 according to previous studies zhang et al 2013 li et al 2019 the corresponding phosphorus forms to the chemical shift were determined and the peak area ratios of different substances were calculated using nmr data processing software bruker topspin 4 1 0 2 3 extraction of phosphorus from sludge by acer and acid hydrogen type strong acid cation exchange resin amberlite 732 shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd was used to extract phosphorus from was the main characteristics of acer are listed in table s1 a series of tests were performed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes to optimize the dosage 30 ml of sludge was first put into each tube and then 0 0 3675 0 735 1 47 2 205 3 675 or 7 35 g acer was added to these tubes resulting in an acer dosage of 0 as the control 0 5 1 2 3 5 or 10 g g ts the used acer can be separated by screening and then regenerated with acid finally the sludge with acer in each tube was stirred at 220 rpm for 4 h in a shaker at room temperature the reaction time was optimized by withdrawing the centrifuge tubes at different time intervals of 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 4 5 6 and 8 h with the optimal dosage of acer the ph of the sludge at the optimal dosage and reaction time was measured and recorded as phacer for acid extraction the ph of the sludge was adjusted to phacer by adding 3 m hcl to replace acer and other operating conditions remained unchanged a stainless steel screen 50 mesh 0 315 mm was used to separate the mixture of sludge and acer a certain amount of sludge solution with acer hcl or no treatment was immediately centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm pes membrane for solubility index analysis including tdp po4 3 p and metals the sludge residue was washed with buffer solution 0 1 m nacl and used for subsequent phosphorus speciation analysis 2 4 phosphorus recovery and ca p precipitates analysis to precipitate phosphorus from the extract 1 m naoh was added to adjust the extract ph to 4 5 6 and 7 and 4 m naoh was used to adjust the ph of the extract to 8 9 and 10 the ratio of calcium to orthophosphate in the extract was 1 5 by addition of 2 m cacl2 the precipitates were obtained by centrifugation dried naturally and then analyzed with x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv japan using cu kα radiation l ¼ 1 54 å at 40 kv and 30 ma in the 2θ range from 5 to 70 fang et al 2018 the xrd software mdi jade v6 0 was used for the processing of results and substance identification with a standard atlas 2 5 other analytical methods a ph meter with a mettler electrode was used to measure the sludge ph according to the apha standard methods apha 2005 ts vs the po4 3 p and tdp in supernatant or mixed pca extracts and the tdp in eps solution were analyzed the content of metals in sludge or ca p precipitates and the tp in sludge were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes america agilent 5110 oes after digestion with aqua regia using a microwave digestion instrument shanghai preekem wx 7000hp for soluble metals in the extract the centrifuged supernatant was digested with nitric acid and then analyzed by icp oes all experiments were performed in triplicates two tailed t test and one way analysis of variance anova were applied to evaluate the significance of results using microsoft office excel a p value 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 micro spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was 3 1 1 micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in was the micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in the was was characterized using back scattering sem eds the imaging principle of backscattering sem is that the component with a larger atomic number is brighter in the image which has been proven to have a more obvious component contrast effect compared with ordinary sem in previous studies li et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 phosphorus was detected in cells eps and inorganic minerals the large white spherical particles marked as b in fig 2a wrapped by eps were poly p in paos cells whose cations were mainly mg2 and k by eds test fig 2b in addition eps the sticky substance marked as c in fig 2a contained a larger amount of phosphorus fig 2c these results are in accordance with those of previous studies liu et al 2001 schonborn et al 2001 in particular fig 2d showed that phosphorus was also distributed in inorganic minerals marked as d in fig 2a and the phosphorus was mainly bound with ca ca p al al p fe fe p and mg mg p according to the eds test 3 1 2 chemical speciation of phosphorus in was according to the micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in was observed in section 3 1 1 the phosphorus indeed existed in cells eps inorganic minerals therefore these three fractions were further extracted by cold pca combined with ion exchange resin for the first time to comprehensively and systematically analyze the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was the results showed that the content of tdp in the supernatant poly p in cells eps bound p and p precipitates in inorganic minerals was 3 32 0 29 2 05 0 36 8 66 0 53 and 7 19 0 12 mg g ts which accounted for 13 9 1 2 8 6 1 5 36 2 2 2 and 30 1 0 5 of tp in the was respectively fig 3 a furthermore the chemical speciation of eps bound p was analyzed by 31p nmr spectroscopy as shown in fig 3b there were three forms of phosphorus in the eps orthophosphate dna and poly p orthophosphate was the main component of eps bound p accounting for 71 6 of the total which may be ascribed to the adsorption of eps the large specific surface area and abundant functional groups hydroxyl carboxyl sulfonate etc have been shown to lead to a good adsorption capacity of eps for phosphorus yang et al 2006 in addition the eps matrix was a permeable gel layer surrounded by cells and it was a necessary way to exchange substances between microbes and the external environment ok et al 2010 therefore the orthophosphate released by hydrolysis of poly p in cells under anaerobic conditions and absorbed from water under aerobic conditions may be intercepted by eps cell rupture was inevitable in sludge resulting in poly p and dna in cells leaking into the extracellular membrane the released phosphorus was further absorbed by eps as a result a small amount of poly p and dna was observed in the eps to further determine the existing forms of p precipitates in inorganic minerals the metal components in the pca extracts were analyzed fig s1 the results indicated that p precipitates mainly existed in the form of ca p fe p al p and mg p which was consistent with the eds data however the quantification of each type of p precipitates still requires new methods 3 1 3 classification for occurrence states of phosphorus in was according to the analysis in the above two sections a new perspective of phosphorus occurrence states in was was proposed in this study specifically phosphorus in was was distributed in liquid phase and solid phase phosphorus in the solid phase could be mainly divided into three parts poly p in cells eps bound p and p precipitates in extracellular inorganic minerals as shown in fig 3a the total amount of tdp in liquid phase and phosphorus extracted in solid phase was 88 7 5 4 of the total phosphorus in was given the extract losses and residual phosphorus that are difficult to extract such as phospholipids liu et al 2019 the newly proposed classification of phosphorus in was is reasonable and feasible in this way the spatial distribution and the corresponding chemical speciation of phosphorus were comprehensively and systematically analyzed for the first time in this study it was found that phosphorus in the was solid phase mostly existed in eps and inorganic minerals rather than cells in the form of poly p this was probably because part of the poly p in the cells was released during the precipitation process in the gravity thickening unit liu et al 2019 3 2 clean extraction of phosphorus by acer according to the occurrence states of phosphorus identified in section 3 1 the recovery of phosphorus from was was mainly determined by the release of eps bound p and p precipitates in inorganic minerals we proposed a novel method called acer extraction and the feasibility of efficient extraction and clean recovery of phosphorus was investigated 3 2 1 optimization of dosage the dosage of acer may affect the sludge ph and the extraction efficiency of eps thereby affecting the release of phosphorus to optimize the dosage the concentrations of po4 3 p in the supernatant with different doses of acer were investigated as shown in fig 4 a the concentrations of po4 3 p increased significantly from 59 02 8 05 mg l without acer to 258 63 12 99 mg l with 1 g g ts acer p 0 01 after further increasing the dosage the po4 3 p concentration increased slowly from 258 63 12 99 mg l at 1 g g ts to 268 27 6 71 mg l at 10 g g ts therefore the optimal dosage was 1 g g ts for the sludge used in this study in previous studies the dosage for promoting sludge hydrolysis or eps extraction was always much higher than 1 g g ts frølund et al 1996 pang et al 2020 from this perspective the proposed technique is economical and efficient the increasing trend of phosphorus in the supernatant was consistent with the decreasing trend of sludge ph fig 4a the addition of acer caused the sludge acidification and the sludge ph decreased rapidly from 6 6 without acer to 2 3 with 1 g g ts acer p precipitates and poly p can be released effectively under acidic conditions feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the lower the ph the higher the phosphorus release efficiency xu et al 2015 thus the concentration of po4 3 p in the supernatant increased rapidly when the dosage was increased to 1 g g ts when the concentration of acer was higher than 1 g g ts the sludge ph did not decrease significantly p 0 05 fig 4a resulting in a slow growth of the phosphorus release efficiency these results indicate that the phosphorus release efficiency was influenced by the dosage of acer mainly owing to the adjustment of sludge ph although the ion exchange resin can extract phosphorus from eps the increase of dosage from 1 g g ts to 10 g g ts has limited improvement of phosphorus extraction efficiency 3 2 2 optimization of reaction time to optimize the reaction time the po4 3 p release kinetics by acer extraction were investigated at 1 g g ts as shown in fig 4b the pseudo first order fit well with the po4 3 p release by acer extraction correlation coefficient r2 0 99 and the maximum theoretical release was 199 82 mg l when the reaction time was 3 5 h the po4 3 p release reached 97 4 3 1 of the maximum the increase in po4 3 p concentration hardly changed when the reaction time was longer than 3 5 h it has been reported that the longest reaction time is not more than 12 h for eps extraction from sludge with cer frølund et al 1996 therefore 3 5 h was chosen as the optimal reaction time in this study interestingly the sludge ph was basically stable ph 2 3 when the reaction time was longer than 0 5 h to further explore the influence of reaction time on phosphorus release the po4 3 p release kinetics were investigated by adjusting the ph to 2 3 with acid extraction were investigated the results showed that the pseudo first order was also well fitted with the po4 3 p release by acid extraction r2 0 99 and po4 3 p release reached 99 3 5 3 of the maximum theoretical release when the extraction process lasted for 1 h fig 4b which was consistent with the results of previous studies xu et al 2015 monea et al 2020 furthermore there was little difference in po4 3 p release between acer extraction and acid extraction at the first 0 5 h the results indicate that the release of phosphorus by acer extraction was determined by ph during the first 0 5 h and the subsequent release of phosphorus may be due to the properties of cer because of the same sludge ph further explanation is given in the sections below 3 2 3 advantages of acer extraction compared with acid extraction in comparison to acid extraction the acer method has unique advantages in particular the fact that it not only acidifies sludge but also adsorbs metals we present in fig 4 c the concentrations of phosphorus and main metal elements in the extract by acid and acer under the optimization reaction conditions dosage 1 g g ts reaction time 3 5 h the proportion of each element in the extract was calculated based on their total content of was table 2 for the tdp in the extract the concentration with acer method 303 50 9 71 mg l was 43 3 4 6 higher than that with acid extraction 211 75 14 31 mg l and the proportion increased from 36 1 2 4 to 51 8 1 7 of tp in the was table 2 due to the same ph of acidified sludge the increase of tdp is mainly attributed to the adsorption of metals by acer in previous studies the release of phosphorus was accompanied by the dissolution of metals franz 2008 fang et al 2018 liang et al 2019 so that purification of the extract is necessary prior to the production of phosphorus fertilizer therefore the main metal elements content in the extract was further investigated as shown in fig 4c the concentrations of the major metals ca mg al and fe decreased efficiently in the extract by acer compared with acid extraction due to the adsorption of the acer as shown in table 2 the decreases in main metal elements content were ca 95 2 0 1 mg 92 7 0 4 al 90 3 0 1 and fe 93 1 0 7 as a result the concentrations of residual metals in the extract were very low the values for ca mg al and fe were 16 20 0 20 9 15 0 50 14 75 0 15 and 4 65 0 50 mg l respectively at such low concentrations metals would hardly interfere with the recovery of phosphorus moreover the content of co dissolved heavy metal elements in the extract by acer also decreased significantly compared with that by acid extraction p 0 01 table s2 especially for ni 100 and cu 100 which is conducive to the subsequent clean recovery of phosphorus to consolidate and generalize the results we applied the same methodology to two other was from two different municipal wwtps using the activated sludge process and the characteristics of the sludge are shown in table s3 as same as the was used above the phosphorus in solid phase of these samples was mainly p precipitates in inorganic minerals and eps bound p accounting for 65 82 of tp in was the phosphate content in the extract first increased and then tended to flatten out with the increase of acer dosage figs s2a and 2c the phosphorus in the sludge can be effectively extracted by no more than 3 g g ts acer and the content of phosphorus in the extract exceeded 50 of tp compared with acid extraction the release efficiency of tp increased by 13 23 and the dissolved metal content decreased by more than 90 in the extract figs s2b and 2d overall the acer extraction for was not only effectively improved the phosphorus release but also significantly decreased the interference of metal dissolution compared with acid extraction as a result the phosphorus in the extract can be recovered directly without separation from metals in addition the used acer could be regenerated and recycled for further phosphorus extraction in conclusion the development of the acer method improved the efficiency of phosphorus recovery from was 3 2 4 phosphorus recovery from the extract due to the adsorption of acer pang et al 2020 the concentration of nh4 n in the extract by acer was too low table s4 to meet the requirement for struvite precipitation wang et al 2019 therefore the phosphorus in the extract was recovered in the form of ca p precipitates which is an effective component of phosphate fertilizer the most typical method to generate ca p precipitates was to increase the ph of the solution to supersaturate lei et al 2017 fig 5 a showed the phosphorus recovery efficiency at different ph values 4 10 at ca p 1 5 the precipitation reaction reached equilibrium as the ph value increased to 9 and the po4 3 p recovery efficiency reached 91 4 0 6 as a result ph 9 was chosen as the optimal ph for phosphorus recovery in this study xrd was utilized to identify precipitation solids under the optimized conditions as shown in fig 5b the product was well indexed to hydroxyapatite to evaluate the environmental safety of the product the content of heavy metal elements was investigated table s2 the results showed that only cr mn and zn were detected and their content was 0 03 0 01 0 48 0 05 and 0 38 0 07 mg g respectively which met the fertilizer standards of representative countries e g china switzerland and austria xu et al 2012 miit 2019 3 3 mechanism insights into the transformation of phosphorus extracted by acer to study the mechanism of phosphorus release in detail the phosphorus occurrence states in was under different conditions were systematically investigated table 3 after acid treatment the tdp content increased to 211 75 14 31 mg l with a tp release efficiency of 36 1 2 4 fig 6 a it is well known that p precipitates such as ca p mg p fe p and al p can be significantly dissolved when sludge is acidified to ph 2 5 quist jensen et al 2018 as a result the concentration of p precipitates decreased from 7 19 0 12 mg g ts to 3 86 0 21 mg g ts table 3 in addition the release of eps bound p also contributed to the increase in tdp and the content of eps bound p was reduced from 8 66 0 53 mg g ts to 4 85 0 33 mg g ts table 3 the release of eps bound p could be due to the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins in a strongly acidic environment neyens et al 2004 xiao et al 2016 with the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins the poly p and dna in the eps were hydrolyzed to pyrophosphate pyro p and orthophosphate as a result the eps bound p after acid extraction was composed of 96 3 orthophosphate and 3 7 pyrophosphate fig 6b in terms of poly p in cells it was reported that the paos cells would release poly p to maintain their own life activities under low ph conditions feng et al 2020 resulting in a slight decrease in poly p content when the sludge was acidified to ph 2 3 as for acer extraction owing to the increased contribution of p precipitates and eps bound p the release efficiency of tp increased by 15 7 2 1 compared with that of acid extraction fig 6a as shown in table 3 the concentration of eps bound p decreased from 8 66 0 53 to 2 35 0 18 mg g ts and the release efficiency of eps bound p was 65 6 4 7 higher than that by acid extraction on the one hand sludge acidification led to the hydrolysis of partial eps resulting in the release of eps bound p neyens et al 2004 xiao et al 2016 on the other hand acer can destroy sludge flocs by adsorbing metals to effectively extract eps frølund et al 1996 therefore the release of eps bound p was due to the hydrolysis and extraction of eps with acer treatment similar to acid extraction the eps bound p after acer extraction was mainly orthophosphate fig 6c a small amount of eps bound p existed in the form of pyrophosphate phospholipids and phosphate monoester monoester p and the concentrations were so low that the peak was not obvious fig 6c in addition under the same ph condition the content of p precipitates was reduced from 7 19 0 12 mg g ts to 2 48 0 36 mg g ts by acer extraction table 3 and the dissolution percentage of p precipitates 19 7 1 5 of tp fig 6a was 41 4 4 5 higher than that by acid extraction 14 0 0 9 of tp fig 6a the difference is likely due to the adsorption of metals by acer p precipitates predominantly exists in the forms of ca p al p and fe p the potential reactions between these p precipitates and acid are shown in equations 1 5 fang et al 2020 based on this when the dissolved metal ions duo to sludge acidification were absorbed by the acer the equilibrium of precipitation and dissolution moved to the direction of phosphate dissolution the concentrations of metal ions in the pca extract were lower after acer extraction than after acid extraction figure s1 which can further illustrate this issue 1 c a 9 al p o 4 7 21 h 9 c a 2 a l 3 7 h 3 p o 4 2 a l p o 4 3 h a l 3 h 3 p o 4 3 f e 3 p o 4 2 6 h 3 f e 2 2 h 3 p o 4 4 f e p o 4 3 h f e 3 h 3 p o 4 5 m g 3 p o 4 2 6 h 3 m g 2 2 h 3 p o 4 the aforementioned results show that the phosphorus in was solid phase indeed mainly existed in cells eps and inorganic minerals acer could effectively extract phosphorus from eps and inorganic minerals leading to the efficient release of phosphorus from was it was reported that when sludge was acidified to ph 2 5 the p precipitates could be obviously dissolved in addition some of the eps bound ortho p could be released due to the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins and the eps bound poly p would be hydrolyzed to other small molecules of phosphorus such as pyrophosphate furthermore a low ph led to the release of poly p from paos cells to maintain self activity on this foundation metals adsorption would significantly improve the extraction of eps and the dissolution of p precipitates in brief sludge flocs can be destroyed by adsorbing metals resulting in the extraction of eps bound p in addition the equilibrium of precipitation and dissolution moves in the direction of phosphate dissolution when the soluble metal ions are absorbed resulting in more p precipitates dissolution than that by acid extraction acer could acidify sludge to ph 2 3 and adsorb the soluble metals at the same time thus the potential extraction of phosphorus from was is considerable the mechanism diagram is shown in fig 7 4 conclusions to summarize this study may be the first time to comprehensively analyze the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was jointly by in situ and step by step extraction methods according to the composition of was a new perspective of phosphorus occurrence states was proposed and confirmed in this study specifically phosphorus in was was distributed in liquid phase and solid phase in which the solid phase could be mainly divided into three parts poly p in cells eps bound p and p precipitates in extracellular inorganic minerals among these forms eps bound p mainly orthophosphate and p precipitates mainly ca p fe p al p and mg p were the major forms of phosphorus in was accounting for 65 82 of tp in this study base on the new perspective of phosphorus occurrence states a targeted and clean phosphorus extraction technology acer extraction was developed compared to acid extraction under the same ph the release efficiency of tp increased by 13 23 and the aqueous metal content decreased by more than 90 the acidification and metal capture by ion exchange were the main mechanism for effective and clean extraction of eps bound p and p precipitates by acer such a finding is crucial to the innovation

16159,waste activated sludge was is an important source of non renewable phosphorus p recovery given the factor that the occurrence states of phosphorus in was determines its recovery efficiency the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus were comprehensively and simultaneously analyzed by in situ and step by step extraction methods for the first time it was confirmed that the phosphorus in solid phase of was could be mainly divided into three parts polyphosphate in cells extracellular polymeric substances eps bound p and phosphate precipitated with metals p precipitates in extracellular inorganic minerals among these forms eps bound p mainly orthophosphate ortho p and p precipitates mainly ca p fe p al p and mg p were the major forms of phosphorus in was accounting for 65 82 of total phosphorus tp owing to the acid solubility of p precipitates acid extraction could be a potentially effective means for phosphorus recovery however the co solution of metals may hinder the phosphorus recovery and the eps bound p cannot be recovered by acid extraction to enhance phosphorus release from eps and reduce metal interference a targeted clean extraction technology using acidic cation exchange resin acer was also developed the results showed that a low dosage acer could effectively extract eps bound p and p precipitates and the content of phosphorus in the extract exceeded 50 of tp compared with acid extraction the release efficiency of tp increased by 13 23 and the dissolved metal content decreased by more than 90 in the extract by acer this was attributed to the acidification and metal capture by acer finally more than 90 of ortho p in the extract was recovered as calcium phosphate which alleviated the depletion of phosphorus resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus occurrence states calcium phosphate cation exchange resin clean extraction 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential nutrient for all organisms phosphorus rock is the main raw material for phosphorus production fang et al 2020 and global consumption of phosphate rock has increased at an average rate of approximately 2 per year vaccari et al 2019 due to global population growth and intensive farming methods xu et al 2018 however phosphate rock is a non renewable resource which will be completely consumed in 50 100 years liang et al 2019 therefore phosphorus recovery has become part of the strategy for sustainable global development approximately 1 3 million tons of p enters in wastewater treatment plants with sewage every year all over the world wilfert et al 2015 in which around 90 of the phosphorus will finally remain in sewage sludge mainly waste activated sludge was liang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 therefore was is one of the important sources for phosphorus recovery zhang et al 2020 the typical method of phosphorus recovery from was is to release phosphorus first and then recover it from the supernatant quist jensen et al 2018 liu et al 2019 given the factor that the occurrence states of phosphorus in was determines its release efficiency identifying the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus has become an important prerequisite for phosphorus recovery it is a well established fact that biological phosphorus removal is mainly through the release of phosphorus by phosphorus accumulating organisms paos under anaerobic conditions and excessive absorption of phosphorus under aerobic conditions so that phosphorus mainly exists in the form of polyphosphate poly p in cells feng et al 2020 however numerous studies have shown that phosphorus is also found in extracellular polymeric substances eps cloete and oosthuizen 2001 li et al 2010 in addition the presence of a large number of metals e g ca mg al and fe in wastewater may precipitate with phosphate p precipitates and exist in inorganic minerals yu et al 2021 therefore in addition to the total dissolved phosphorus tdp in the supernatant phosphorus in solid phase of was may be distributed in cells eps and inorganic minerals which is consistent with the composition of was cao et al 2021 in recent years the method of european commission called standards measurements and testing smt has been usually used to analyze phosphorus chemical speciation he et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 according to the smt protocol inorganic phosphorus ip instead of organic phosphorus op was the main component 50 80 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2019 furthermore ip included apatite p 1 3 ip and non apatite inorganic p 2 3 ip however smt protocol is insufficient because some chemical speciation of phosphorus is not taken into consideration such as poly p with the development of advanced technologies the precise chemical speciation of phosphorus has been qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for example orthophosphate ortho p po4 3 p poly p phosphate monoester dna and pyrophosphate can be detected using 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 unfortunately the simultaneous identification of the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of these phosphorus forms is still an unsolved problem in particular knowledge of the micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in was is limited the insufficient identification on the chemical speciation and spatial distribution of phosphorus in was limits the development of highly efficient technologies for phosphorus recovery specifically compared with alkaline leaching bashir et al 2019 thermal treatment huang and tang 2016 and anaerobic methods li et al 2019 acid extraction has some potentials for further upgrading li et al 2018 quist jensen et al 2018 liang et al 2019 owing to its capacity for extraction of phosphorus from inorganic minerals and cells xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 however acid extraction was previously ineffective in extracting phosphorus in eps quist jensen et al 2018 in addition prior to phosphorus recovery purification of the extract is necessary because of the co dissolution of metals by acid extraction fang et al 2018 lundehoj et al 2019 which increases the complexity of the process hence there is an urgent need to develop a targeted clean phosphorus extraction technology that can effectively extract phosphorus from cells eps and inorganic minerals as well as reduce metal interference a cation exchange resin has been proven to be effective in extracting eps which is ascribed to the destruction of sludge flocs by adsorbing metal ions frølund et al 1996 on this basis the acidic cation exchange resin acer method can be used to simultaneously acidify sludge and extract eps more specifically the acer method may have the potential to simultaneously extract phosphorus from cells eps and inorganic minerals and also reduce the metal interference in the extract by adsorbing them to date such an approach has yet to be explored the objective of this study was to simultaneously identify the spatial distribution of phosphorus in was and its corresponding chemical speciation for the first time on this basis a targeted and clean phosphorus extraction technology was also developed specifically the feasibility of efficient and clean extraction of phosphorus by acer was investigated furthermore the migration and transformation mechanism of phosphorus with acer extraction was revealed all these results are believed to deepen understanding of phosphorus occurrence states in was and facilitate the recovery of non renewable phosphorus resource in the field of waste management 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge the was was discharged from the secondary sedimentation tank and then obtained from the gravity thickening unit in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in shanghai the wwtp adopted anaerobic anoxic oxic process for phosphorus removal first the was was filtered using a stainless steel screen with 1 mm sieve to remove impurities the obtained sludge was then thickened and stored in a 4 c refrigerator to inhibit the release of phosphorus caused by microbial activity wilfert et al 2016 the detailed characteristics of the was used are shown in table 1 2 2 analytical methods for spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus 2 2 1 in situ analysis first the spatial distribution of phosphorus in the sludge was comprehensively analyzed in situ sludge samples were lyophilized at 50 c for 3 days and then treated with spray gold subsequently an analytical high resolution scanning electron microscope sem mira3 czech republic with a backscatter detector in beam bse was used to observe the microstructure of the sludge and the existence of phosphorus was confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds li et al 2015 2 2 2 step by step extraction analysis for the first time the phosphorus in cells inorganic minerals and eps was extracted by cold perchloric acid pca de haas et al 2000 combined with ion exchange resin zhang et al 2013 the joint application of this step by step extraction method and the above in situ analytical method in section 2 2 1 could comprehensively and systematically analyze the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was the flowchart for the fractionation of phosphorus using step by step extraction is shown in fig 1 and the specific procedures are as follows a certain amount of sludge was centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane to analyze tdp in the sludge the pellets were washed twice with 0 1 m nacl to remove the residual dissolved phosphorus in aqueous phase the washed pellets were extracted three times with 0 5 m cold pca and each time lasted for 5 min in the mixed three pca extracts the difference between tdp and po4 3 p was regarded as the poly p in cells of was and po4 3 p was regarded as p precipitates in inorganic minerals of was the phosphorus in eps the phosphorus adsorbed by organic matter in eps eps bound p was extracted using ion exchange resin after discarding the supernatant and washing the sludge pellets twice with 0 1 m nacl the washed pellets were resuspended to its original mass with 0 1 m nacl and then the ion exchange resin dowex marathon c na form 20 50 mesh sigma aldrich added to 70 g g ts after stirring for 6 h at 500 rpm and 4 c in a 100 ml beaker the mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min the eps solution was obtained by filtering the supernatant through 0 45 µm pes membranes a portion of the eps solution was then dried using a vacuum freeze drier tf fd 1 freeze dryer nade zhejiang china at 50 c for 2 days and stored at 20 c for analyzing the chemical speciation of eps bound p by 31p nmr and the remaining eps solution was used to analyze tdp in eps 2 2 3 31p nmr analysis to obtain the optimal spectral resolution and ensure the consistency of chemical shifts the freeze dried eps powder was redissolved in 0 2 ml of d2o and 0 2 ml edta solution 0 1 m after which 0 4 ml of 1 m naoh solution was added turner et al 2003 after the sample was fully mixed the quantitative 31p nmr examination was performed using an avance neo 700 mhz spectrum operating at 162 02 mhz at 25 c with 85 phosphoric acid as the external standard the scanning times were not less than 128 according to previous studies zhang et al 2013 li et al 2019 the corresponding phosphorus forms to the chemical shift were determined and the peak area ratios of different substances were calculated using nmr data processing software bruker topspin 4 1 0 2 3 extraction of phosphorus from sludge by acer and acid hydrogen type strong acid cation exchange resin amberlite 732 shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd was used to extract phosphorus from was the main characteristics of acer are listed in table s1 a series of tests were performed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes to optimize the dosage 30 ml of sludge was first put into each tube and then 0 0 3675 0 735 1 47 2 205 3 675 or 7 35 g acer was added to these tubes resulting in an acer dosage of 0 as the control 0 5 1 2 3 5 or 10 g g ts the used acer can be separated by screening and then regenerated with acid finally the sludge with acer in each tube was stirred at 220 rpm for 4 h in a shaker at room temperature the reaction time was optimized by withdrawing the centrifuge tubes at different time intervals of 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 4 5 6 and 8 h with the optimal dosage of acer the ph of the sludge at the optimal dosage and reaction time was measured and recorded as phacer for acid extraction the ph of the sludge was adjusted to phacer by adding 3 m hcl to replace acer and other operating conditions remained unchanged a stainless steel screen 50 mesh 0 315 mm was used to separate the mixture of sludge and acer a certain amount of sludge solution with acer hcl or no treatment was immediately centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm pes membrane for solubility index analysis including tdp po4 3 p and metals the sludge residue was washed with buffer solution 0 1 m nacl and used for subsequent phosphorus speciation analysis 2 4 phosphorus recovery and ca p precipitates analysis to precipitate phosphorus from the extract 1 m naoh was added to adjust the extract ph to 4 5 6 and 7 and 4 m naoh was used to adjust the ph of the extract to 8 9 and 10 the ratio of calcium to orthophosphate in the extract was 1 5 by addition of 2 m cacl2 the precipitates were obtained by centrifugation dried naturally and then analyzed with x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv japan using cu kα radiation l ¼ 1 54 å at 40 kv and 30 ma in the 2θ range from 5 to 70 fang et al 2018 the xrd software mdi jade v6 0 was used for the processing of results and substance identification with a standard atlas 2 5 other analytical methods a ph meter with a mettler electrode was used to measure the sludge ph according to the apha standard methods apha 2005 ts vs the po4 3 p and tdp in supernatant or mixed pca extracts and the tdp in eps solution were analyzed the content of metals in sludge or ca p precipitates and the tp in sludge were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes america agilent 5110 oes after digestion with aqua regia using a microwave digestion instrument shanghai preekem wx 7000hp for soluble metals in the extract the centrifuged supernatant was digested with nitric acid and then analyzed by icp oes all experiments were performed in triplicates two tailed t test and one way analysis of variance anova were applied to evaluate the significance of results using microsoft office excel a p value 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 micro spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was 3 1 1 micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in was the micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in the was was characterized using back scattering sem eds the imaging principle of backscattering sem is that the component with a larger atomic number is brighter in the image which has been proven to have a more obvious component contrast effect compared with ordinary sem in previous studies li et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 phosphorus was detected in cells eps and inorganic minerals the large white spherical particles marked as b in fig 2a wrapped by eps were poly p in paos cells whose cations were mainly mg2 and k by eds test fig 2b in addition eps the sticky substance marked as c in fig 2a contained a larger amount of phosphorus fig 2c these results are in accordance with those of previous studies liu et al 2001 schonborn et al 2001 in particular fig 2d showed that phosphorus was also distributed in inorganic minerals marked as d in fig 2a and the phosphorus was mainly bound with ca ca p al al p fe fe p and mg mg p according to the eds test 3 1 2 chemical speciation of phosphorus in was according to the micro spatial distribution of phosphorus in was observed in section 3 1 1 the phosphorus indeed existed in cells eps inorganic minerals therefore these three fractions were further extracted by cold pca combined with ion exchange resin for the first time to comprehensively and systematically analyze the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was the results showed that the content of tdp in the supernatant poly p in cells eps bound p and p precipitates in inorganic minerals was 3 32 0 29 2 05 0 36 8 66 0 53 and 7 19 0 12 mg g ts which accounted for 13 9 1 2 8 6 1 5 36 2 2 2 and 30 1 0 5 of tp in the was respectively fig 3 a furthermore the chemical speciation of eps bound p was analyzed by 31p nmr spectroscopy as shown in fig 3b there were three forms of phosphorus in the eps orthophosphate dna and poly p orthophosphate was the main component of eps bound p accounting for 71 6 of the total which may be ascribed to the adsorption of eps the large specific surface area and abundant functional groups hydroxyl carboxyl sulfonate etc have been shown to lead to a good adsorption capacity of eps for phosphorus yang et al 2006 in addition the eps matrix was a permeable gel layer surrounded by cells and it was a necessary way to exchange substances between microbes and the external environment ok et al 2010 therefore the orthophosphate released by hydrolysis of poly p in cells under anaerobic conditions and absorbed from water under aerobic conditions may be intercepted by eps cell rupture was inevitable in sludge resulting in poly p and dna in cells leaking into the extracellular membrane the released phosphorus was further absorbed by eps as a result a small amount of poly p and dna was observed in the eps to further determine the existing forms of p precipitates in inorganic minerals the metal components in the pca extracts were analyzed fig s1 the results indicated that p precipitates mainly existed in the form of ca p fe p al p and mg p which was consistent with the eds data however the quantification of each type of p precipitates still requires new methods 3 1 3 classification for occurrence states of phosphorus in was according to the analysis in the above two sections a new perspective of phosphorus occurrence states in was was proposed in this study specifically phosphorus in was was distributed in liquid phase and solid phase phosphorus in the solid phase could be mainly divided into three parts poly p in cells eps bound p and p precipitates in extracellular inorganic minerals as shown in fig 3a the total amount of tdp in liquid phase and phosphorus extracted in solid phase was 88 7 5 4 of the total phosphorus in was given the extract losses and residual phosphorus that are difficult to extract such as phospholipids liu et al 2019 the newly proposed classification of phosphorus in was is reasonable and feasible in this way the spatial distribution and the corresponding chemical speciation of phosphorus were comprehensively and systematically analyzed for the first time in this study it was found that phosphorus in the was solid phase mostly existed in eps and inorganic minerals rather than cells in the form of poly p this was probably because part of the poly p in the cells was released during the precipitation process in the gravity thickening unit liu et al 2019 3 2 clean extraction of phosphorus by acer according to the occurrence states of phosphorus identified in section 3 1 the recovery of phosphorus from was was mainly determined by the release of eps bound p and p precipitates in inorganic minerals we proposed a novel method called acer extraction and the feasibility of efficient extraction and clean recovery of phosphorus was investigated 3 2 1 optimization of dosage the dosage of acer may affect the sludge ph and the extraction efficiency of eps thereby affecting the release of phosphorus to optimize the dosage the concentrations of po4 3 p in the supernatant with different doses of acer were investigated as shown in fig 4 a the concentrations of po4 3 p increased significantly from 59 02 8 05 mg l without acer to 258 63 12 99 mg l with 1 g g ts acer p 0 01 after further increasing the dosage the po4 3 p concentration increased slowly from 258 63 12 99 mg l at 1 g g ts to 268 27 6 71 mg l at 10 g g ts therefore the optimal dosage was 1 g g ts for the sludge used in this study in previous studies the dosage for promoting sludge hydrolysis or eps extraction was always much higher than 1 g g ts frølund et al 1996 pang et al 2020 from this perspective the proposed technique is economical and efficient the increasing trend of phosphorus in the supernatant was consistent with the decreasing trend of sludge ph fig 4a the addition of acer caused the sludge acidification and the sludge ph decreased rapidly from 6 6 without acer to 2 3 with 1 g g ts acer p precipitates and poly p can be released effectively under acidic conditions feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the lower the ph the higher the phosphorus release efficiency xu et al 2015 thus the concentration of po4 3 p in the supernatant increased rapidly when the dosage was increased to 1 g g ts when the concentration of acer was higher than 1 g g ts the sludge ph did not decrease significantly p 0 05 fig 4a resulting in a slow growth of the phosphorus release efficiency these results indicate that the phosphorus release efficiency was influenced by the dosage of acer mainly owing to the adjustment of sludge ph although the ion exchange resin can extract phosphorus from eps the increase of dosage from 1 g g ts to 10 g g ts has limited improvement of phosphorus extraction efficiency 3 2 2 optimization of reaction time to optimize the reaction time the po4 3 p release kinetics by acer extraction were investigated at 1 g g ts as shown in fig 4b the pseudo first order fit well with the po4 3 p release by acer extraction correlation coefficient r2 0 99 and the maximum theoretical release was 199 82 mg l when the reaction time was 3 5 h the po4 3 p release reached 97 4 3 1 of the maximum the increase in po4 3 p concentration hardly changed when the reaction time was longer than 3 5 h it has been reported that the longest reaction time is not more than 12 h for eps extraction from sludge with cer frølund et al 1996 therefore 3 5 h was chosen as the optimal reaction time in this study interestingly the sludge ph was basically stable ph 2 3 when the reaction time was longer than 0 5 h to further explore the influence of reaction time on phosphorus release the po4 3 p release kinetics were investigated by adjusting the ph to 2 3 with acid extraction were investigated the results showed that the pseudo first order was also well fitted with the po4 3 p release by acid extraction r2 0 99 and po4 3 p release reached 99 3 5 3 of the maximum theoretical release when the extraction process lasted for 1 h fig 4b which was consistent with the results of previous studies xu et al 2015 monea et al 2020 furthermore there was little difference in po4 3 p release between acer extraction and acid extraction at the first 0 5 h the results indicate that the release of phosphorus by acer extraction was determined by ph during the first 0 5 h and the subsequent release of phosphorus may be due to the properties of cer because of the same sludge ph further explanation is given in the sections below 3 2 3 advantages of acer extraction compared with acid extraction in comparison to acid extraction the acer method has unique advantages in particular the fact that it not only acidifies sludge but also adsorbs metals we present in fig 4 c the concentrations of phosphorus and main metal elements in the extract by acid and acer under the optimization reaction conditions dosage 1 g g ts reaction time 3 5 h the proportion of each element in the extract was calculated based on their total content of was table 2 for the tdp in the extract the concentration with acer method 303 50 9 71 mg l was 43 3 4 6 higher than that with acid extraction 211 75 14 31 mg l and the proportion increased from 36 1 2 4 to 51 8 1 7 of tp in the was table 2 due to the same ph of acidified sludge the increase of tdp is mainly attributed to the adsorption of metals by acer in previous studies the release of phosphorus was accompanied by the dissolution of metals franz 2008 fang et al 2018 liang et al 2019 so that purification of the extract is necessary prior to the production of phosphorus fertilizer therefore the main metal elements content in the extract was further investigated as shown in fig 4c the concentrations of the major metals ca mg al and fe decreased efficiently in the extract by acer compared with acid extraction due to the adsorption of the acer as shown in table 2 the decreases in main metal elements content were ca 95 2 0 1 mg 92 7 0 4 al 90 3 0 1 and fe 93 1 0 7 as a result the concentrations of residual metals in the extract were very low the values for ca mg al and fe were 16 20 0 20 9 15 0 50 14 75 0 15 and 4 65 0 50 mg l respectively at such low concentrations metals would hardly interfere with the recovery of phosphorus moreover the content of co dissolved heavy metal elements in the extract by acer also decreased significantly compared with that by acid extraction p 0 01 table s2 especially for ni 100 and cu 100 which is conducive to the subsequent clean recovery of phosphorus to consolidate and generalize the results we applied the same methodology to two other was from two different municipal wwtps using the activated sludge process and the characteristics of the sludge are shown in table s3 as same as the was used above the phosphorus in solid phase of these samples was mainly p precipitates in inorganic minerals and eps bound p accounting for 65 82 of tp in was the phosphate content in the extract first increased and then tended to flatten out with the increase of acer dosage figs s2a and 2c the phosphorus in the sludge can be effectively extracted by no more than 3 g g ts acer and the content of phosphorus in the extract exceeded 50 of tp compared with acid extraction the release efficiency of tp increased by 13 23 and the dissolved metal content decreased by more than 90 in the extract figs s2b and 2d overall the acer extraction for was not only effectively improved the phosphorus release but also significantly decreased the interference of metal dissolution compared with acid extraction as a result the phosphorus in the extract can be recovered directly without separation from metals in addition the used acer could be regenerated and recycled for further phosphorus extraction in conclusion the development of the acer method improved the efficiency of phosphorus recovery from was 3 2 4 phosphorus recovery from the extract due to the adsorption of acer pang et al 2020 the concentration of nh4 n in the extract by acer was too low table s4 to meet the requirement for struvite precipitation wang et al 2019 therefore the phosphorus in the extract was recovered in the form of ca p precipitates which is an effective component of phosphate fertilizer the most typical method to generate ca p precipitates was to increase the ph of the solution to supersaturate lei et al 2017 fig 5 a showed the phosphorus recovery efficiency at different ph values 4 10 at ca p 1 5 the precipitation reaction reached equilibrium as the ph value increased to 9 and the po4 3 p recovery efficiency reached 91 4 0 6 as a result ph 9 was chosen as the optimal ph for phosphorus recovery in this study xrd was utilized to identify precipitation solids under the optimized conditions as shown in fig 5b the product was well indexed to hydroxyapatite to evaluate the environmental safety of the product the content of heavy metal elements was investigated table s2 the results showed that only cr mn and zn were detected and their content was 0 03 0 01 0 48 0 05 and 0 38 0 07 mg g respectively which met the fertilizer standards of representative countries e g china switzerland and austria xu et al 2012 miit 2019 3 3 mechanism insights into the transformation of phosphorus extracted by acer to study the mechanism of phosphorus release in detail the phosphorus occurrence states in was under different conditions were systematically investigated table 3 after acid treatment the tdp content increased to 211 75 14 31 mg l with a tp release efficiency of 36 1 2 4 fig 6 a it is well known that p precipitates such as ca p mg p fe p and al p can be significantly dissolved when sludge is acidified to ph 2 5 quist jensen et al 2018 as a result the concentration of p precipitates decreased from 7 19 0 12 mg g ts to 3 86 0 21 mg g ts table 3 in addition the release of eps bound p also contributed to the increase in tdp and the content of eps bound p was reduced from 8 66 0 53 mg g ts to 4 85 0 33 mg g ts table 3 the release of eps bound p could be due to the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins in a strongly acidic environment neyens et al 2004 xiao et al 2016 with the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins the poly p and dna in the eps were hydrolyzed to pyrophosphate pyro p and orthophosphate as a result the eps bound p after acid extraction was composed of 96 3 orthophosphate and 3 7 pyrophosphate fig 6b in terms of poly p in cells it was reported that the paos cells would release poly p to maintain their own life activities under low ph conditions feng et al 2020 resulting in a slight decrease in poly p content when the sludge was acidified to ph 2 3 as for acer extraction owing to the increased contribution of p precipitates and eps bound p the release efficiency of tp increased by 15 7 2 1 compared with that of acid extraction fig 6a as shown in table 3 the concentration of eps bound p decreased from 8 66 0 53 to 2 35 0 18 mg g ts and the release efficiency of eps bound p was 65 6 4 7 higher than that by acid extraction on the one hand sludge acidification led to the hydrolysis of partial eps resulting in the release of eps bound p neyens et al 2004 xiao et al 2016 on the other hand acer can destroy sludge flocs by adsorbing metals to effectively extract eps frølund et al 1996 therefore the release of eps bound p was due to the hydrolysis and extraction of eps with acer treatment similar to acid extraction the eps bound p after acer extraction was mainly orthophosphate fig 6c a small amount of eps bound p existed in the form of pyrophosphate phospholipids and phosphate monoester monoester p and the concentrations were so low that the peak was not obvious fig 6c in addition under the same ph condition the content of p precipitates was reduced from 7 19 0 12 mg g ts to 2 48 0 36 mg g ts by acer extraction table 3 and the dissolution percentage of p precipitates 19 7 1 5 of tp fig 6a was 41 4 4 5 higher than that by acid extraction 14 0 0 9 of tp fig 6a the difference is likely due to the adsorption of metals by acer p precipitates predominantly exists in the forms of ca p al p and fe p the potential reactions between these p precipitates and acid are shown in equations 1 5 fang et al 2020 based on this when the dissolved metal ions duo to sludge acidification were absorbed by the acer the equilibrium of precipitation and dissolution moved to the direction of phosphate dissolution the concentrations of metal ions in the pca extract were lower after acer extraction than after acid extraction figure s1 which can further illustrate this issue 1 c a 9 al p o 4 7 21 h 9 c a 2 a l 3 7 h 3 p o 4 2 a l p o 4 3 h a l 3 h 3 p o 4 3 f e 3 p o 4 2 6 h 3 f e 2 2 h 3 p o 4 4 f e p o 4 3 h f e 3 h 3 p o 4 5 m g 3 p o 4 2 6 h 3 m g 2 2 h 3 p o 4 the aforementioned results show that the phosphorus in was solid phase indeed mainly existed in cells eps and inorganic minerals acer could effectively extract phosphorus from eps and inorganic minerals leading to the efficient release of phosphorus from was it was reported that when sludge was acidified to ph 2 5 the p precipitates could be obviously dissolved in addition some of the eps bound ortho p could be released due to the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins and the eps bound poly p would be hydrolyzed to other small molecules of phosphorus such as pyrophosphate furthermore a low ph led to the release of poly p from paos cells to maintain self activity on this foundation metals adsorption would significantly improve the extraction of eps and the dissolution of p precipitates in brief sludge flocs can be destroyed by adsorbing metals resulting in the extraction of eps bound p in addition the equilibrium of precipitation and dissolution moves in the direction of phosphate dissolution when the soluble metal ions are absorbed resulting in more p precipitates dissolution than that by acid extraction acer could acidify sludge to ph 2 3 and adsorb the soluble metals at the same time thus the potential extraction of phosphorus from was is considerable the mechanism diagram is shown in fig 7 4 conclusions to summarize this study may be the first time to comprehensively analyze the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus in was jointly by in situ and step by step extraction methods according to the composition of was a new perspective of phosphorus occurrence states was proposed and confirmed in this study specifically phosphorus in was was distributed in liquid phase and solid phase in which the solid phase could be mainly divided into three parts poly p in cells eps bound p and p precipitates in extracellular inorganic minerals among these forms eps bound p mainly orthophosphate and p precipitates mainly ca p fe p al p and mg p were the major forms of phosphorus in was accounting for 65 82 of tp in this study base on the new perspective of phosphorus occurrence states a targeted and clean phosphorus extraction technology acer extraction was developed compared to acid extraction under the same ph the release efficiency of tp increased by 13 23 and the aqueous metal content decreased by more than 90 the acidification and metal capture by ion exchange were the main mechanism for effective and clean extraction of eps bound p and p precipitates by acer such a finding is crucial to the innovation
