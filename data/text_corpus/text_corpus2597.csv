agroindustry residue natural hemicelluloses tanfloc sg primary treatment coagulation 1 introduction inorganic coagulants such as al2 so4 3 aln oh mcl3 n m fecl3 and feso4 have been gradually replaced by plant based coagulants as they are a renewable potentially biodegradable and non hazardous source 1 2 in addition issues related to public health stand out from others in particular coagulants from aluminum salts which have been reported in medical and environmental studies as harmful to the nervous system and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases dementias parkinson s and alzheimer s disease 1 3 4 coagulants containing iron salts on the other hand can cause problems with operation and corrosion in pipes 1 the global market for coagulants and flocculants is estimated to reach us 6 01 billion by 2022 us 4 35 billion in 2016 noting a compound annual growth rate of 5 9 between 2017 and 2022 5 these numbers indicate that the interest and importance of coagulation are expected to grow significantly in the coming years and therefore this topic is worth delving into further the strong demand and interest in the coagulation process have driven the exploration of the new generation of coagulants with better performance and coagulation efficiency this includes the search for natural coagulants as an alternative option to chemical based coagulants in the wake of sustainable development natural coagulants are an interesting alternative due to the issues associated with the use of inorganic coagulants one of the main advantages of natural coagulants is the possible safety for human health and ecosystems the following characteristics can be highlighted sustainable technology low toxicity biodegradation efficient performance in removing pollutants use of waste as a raw material for its production reduction of sludge generation and potential use of the sludge generated in soil fertilization and they are non corrosive as opposed to the iron salt coagulants 6 the cationic tannins are examples of coagulants commonly used in water treatment and wastewater and their source are polyphenolic polymers shells acacia sp and schinopsis sp 7 in order for the tannins to become positively charged and acquire coagulation properties becoming cationic tannins ct they may subjected to the mannich aminomethylation reaction by the addition of formaldehyde ammonium chloride nh4cl due to quaternary nitrogen and hydrochloric acid hcl 7 this polyelectrolyte is already available on the market and distributed by the company tanac brasil s a which developed a coagulant and flocculant based on tannin from acacia mearnsii ac√°cia negra called tanfloc furthermore natural organic coagulants are generally water soluble polymers derived from compounds of natural macromolecules cationic tannins from black wattle trees 8 9 oil moringa seeds 10 12 okra and passion fruit seeds 13 14 watermelon or melon solution 15 and cellulosic derivatives such as cationic hemicelluloses from corn residues and peanut shells 16 17 are examples of these materials the use of agro industrial residues in general by products generated from the processing of peanuts can be a promising source of lignocellulosic biomass that is composed of lignin cellulose and hemicelluloses polysaccharides and or proteins with potential clotting power in most cases this fibrous material available in large quantities 18 is discarded or burned as a solid residue which can be an environmental aggravating factor cellulosic derivatives such as cationic hemicelluloses can also come from corn residues in addition to peanut shells 17 hemicelluloses refer to the many types of heteropolymers composed of different sugar units such as d xylose l arabinose d galactose d glucuronic acid among others varying according to the type of vegetable of origin they are found in large quantities in the forest and as agricultural waste the abundance of these waste products explains why there have been advances made in this area offering prospects for the reuse of these materials for different purposes 19 cationic hemicelluloses ch are positively charged polyelectrolytes cationized by etherification reaction from the extraction of natural hemicelluloses hn they stand out for having a chemical structure rich in hydroxyls and they can add value to agroindustry waste one example is the cationization of its structure with tertiary amine presenting the possibility of application as a coagulant and flocculant in the treatment of different types of effluents such as sanitary sewage effluent 16 biodiesel 17 and industrial laundry 20 the objective of this work was to synthesize and evaluate ch derived from peanut shells as a primary coagulant agent in the treatment process coagulation flocculation and sedimentation of a synthetic dairy effluent sdw the latter was chosen due to its properties of high load of suspended solids dissolved solids and organic matter simulating an effluent with industrial characteristics a sdw also grants a better control over the studied process in addition to allowing further replicability furthermore a comparison was made with the efficiency of the commercial coagulant tanfloc sg tsg a polymer composed of ct acquired from the company tanac brasil s a 2 material and methods 2 1 coagulants obtaining and preparing 2 1 1 synthesis of cationic hemicelluloses ch from peanut shell residue from agroindustry the synthesis of ch extracted from peanut shell occurred in 3 steps fig 1 1 extraction of holocelluloses ho 2 isolation of natural hemicelluloses nh and 3 cationization of nh the extraction of holocelluloses ho took place according to the acid sodium chlorite naclo2 methodology 21 from 15 g of peanut shells for each synthesis which were mixed with distilled water in the proportion of 1 20 g ml and heated at 75 c for 30 min with the addition of acetic acid and chlorite of sodium in a ratio of 1 1 5 ml g and kept under stirring for 4 h addition of acetic acid ch3cooh naclo2 repeated every hour the reaction mixture was cooled to 5 c for 20 min and filtered with successive washes of distilled water until whitish in color the solid material was dried in an oven at 75 c for 6 h the procedure established by morais et al and ren et al was followed for the isolation of natural hemicelluloses 22 23 in which for each synthesis a 17 5 m v naoh solution was added to natural holocelluloses in a ratio of 15 1 ml g the material was then left to rest for 2 min crushed for 8 min and the mixture filtered in a nylon strainer to separate the celluloses fibrous residue from the hemicelluloses liquid part an ch3cooh ethanol c2 h5oh 1 1 v v solution was added to this liquid part to precipitate the material which after 12 h was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 3 min and the pasty part was dried in an oven at 75 c for 6 h cationic hemicelluloses were synthesized according to procedures adapted from ren et al 22 and landim et al 16 where the cationization of natural hemicelluloses was performed by the reaction that occurs with the addition of a cationizing agent 2 3 epoxy propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride eta the process occurs by an etherification reaction of the hydroxyl functions in an alkaline medium which results in the quaternization of the polysaccharide a 10 w v solution containing hemicelluloses for each synthesis was kept under stirring at 60 c for 30 min subsequently naoh was added to the reaction medium in a proportion of 14 m v and kept under stirring for 20 min after it an amount of eta in the proportion of 6 8 v v was added and again the reaction medium was kept under stirring for 20 min subsequently a suitable mass of naoh was added for the reaction medium to be 2 2 m v and kept under stirring at 60 c for 5 h the resulting mixture was cooled in an ice bath and neutralized with hcl solution then the cationic hemicelluloses were precipitated with ethanol 98 after 24 h the liquid was removed and the final precipitated material dried in an oven at 75 c for 6 h a simplified summary of the ch production steps is shown in fig 1 after selection of the peanut shells 2 1 2 spectroscopic characterization by ftir the main functional groups indicative of the process of cationization of ch presence of amine was identified by ftir in a perkin elmer ir tf frontier single range mir spectrophotometer in the region between 4000 and 220 cm 1 the measurements of the samples were carried out in the solid state using the attenuated total reflectance atr accessory with a diamond crystal the spectrophotometer used belongs to the triangle inorganic materials group gmit located at the laboratory of photochemistry and materials science lafot cm of the ufu institute of chemistry 2 1 3 theoretical spectroscopic study of the structures of cationic hemicelluloses the theoretical spectroscopic characterization of natural nh and cationized ch hemicelluloses was performed with the aid of computational chemistry whose calculations were performed with gaussian 16 software 24 initially the optimization and vibrational analysis of the structures was carried out characterizing the stationary point as a local minimum at the b3lyp 6 311g d p level with the inclusion of implicit solvent smd the inclusion of explicit h2o molecules was made in the respective chemical structures of nh and ch positioned in such a way as to generate a rectangular block 15 0 √• long 10 √• wide and high around the eta similarly to a cubic solvation 25 the system was optimized in two stages stage 1 application of a universal force field uff 26 until reaching convergence step 2 reoptimization of the system with b3lyp 6 311g d p from the structures obtained in the previous step subsequently vibrational analysis was performed generating the infrared spectra of the molecules of interest fig 2 presents the initial solvation system with the optimized structure of the eta 2 1 4 determination of degree of substitution ds by elemental analysis samples of ch and its precursors were dried at 60 c for 24 h then the determination of carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n was performed by elemental analysis in a perkinelmer model series ii 2400 equipment with a precision of 0 5 installed in the multiuser laboratory of the institute of chemistry of ufu then to follow the substitution process in the structure of the hemicelluloses the degree of substitution was calculated by the amount of nitrogen and carbon according to the eq i 17 27 i ds 60 n 14 c 72 n where n

commercial coagulant provided by tanac 2 1 6 preparation of the coagulant solution tanfloc sg tsg 10 v v to compare the performance of the cationic hemicelluloses in the treatment of sdw the commercial organic coagulant tanfloc sg provided by the company tanac s a was chosen the ph of the solution was 1 75 0 76 with an average total tannin solid of 32 to attain the best use conditions the solution applied in the tests was prepared at 10 v v due to its viscosity and the company s recommendations 2 2 treatability tests of synthetic dairy effluent 2 2 1 preparation of synthetic dairy wastewater sdw due to the large fluctuation in the characteristics of effluent generated in the dairy industry sdw was used to gain better control and reproducibility over the process sdw was prepared following the adapted formulation of muniz et al 13 being diluted twice in relation to the original recipe the formulation used by the aforementioned authors was characterized and did not contain the whey from the manufacture of cheese in its composition the following substances were dissolved in 100 l of distilled water whole milk powder 28 80 mg mgso4 7h2o 57 60 mg cacl2 2h2o 1 44 mg c6h12o6 0 10 mg nh4cl 23 33 mg nahco3 62 40 mg na2hpo4 7h2o 36 00 mg ch4n2o 108 mg mnso4 h2o 0 96 mg whole milk powder 57 60 mg feso4 7h2o 0 48 mg table 1 shows the characteristics of the sdw and the methods used the determination of the chemical oxygen demand was carried out by the closed reflux method through the digestion of the samples 2 5 ml for 2 h in catalyst solution 3 5 ml and digester 1 5 ml and their removal absorbance readings were taken in a visible spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 2 2 2 treatability tests coagulation flocculation and sedimentation the physicochemical treatment tests were simulated in the sanitation laboratory labsan ufu in the jar test bench equipment nova etica model 218 which has a digital panel for adjusting the rotation of the pallets for coagulation and flocculation assays were performed for 10 hc m v and 10 tsg v v with dosage range from 200 to 900 ppm with coagulation ph range from 5 00 to 11 00 jartest tests were carried out with the following steps i 2 l of effluent was added to each jar ii rapid mixing coagulation took place for 10 s in a mean agitation gradient gmr of 300 s 1 250 rpm 40 ml of sample was immediately collected from each jar and the coagulation ph was measured iii slow mixing flocculation occurred for 15 min in a mean flocculation gradient gmf of 20 s 1 30 rpm iv shaking was turned off and after 30 min of sedimentation samples were collected and turbidity ntu and remaining apparent color uc were measured the determination of removal efficiency for all parameters and parameters analyzed after treatment tests was calculated according to the eq ii ii re vi vf vf 100 being re removal efficiency vi initial value vf final value 2 3 determination of coagulation diagrams the coagulation diagrams were determinated in 24 tests for 10 ch m v dosages 200 400 600 and 900 ppm and 42 tests for 10 tsg v v dosages 200 300 400 500 600 700 and 900 ppm for each batch with 6 jars in each jar 2 l of effluent were added the coagulant dosage was maintained in all jars the ph was varied by the addition of hcl 2 mol l 1 as acidifier or naoh 2 mol l 1 as alkalinizing in different volumes to obtain the desired ph values measuring at approximately to ph 5 6 7 8 and 9 and 11 the records of coagulation ph readings coagulant dosage and the respective percentages of apparent color removal were tabulated in electronic spreadsheets in microsoft excel and later transferred to the computer program surfer 28 for the interpolation of the data sampled in the laboratory the aim was to estimate percentages in non sampled points and draw the curves of the same removal efficiency called coagulation diagram the kriging regression method was selected as a mathematical model for the spatial interpolation and estimation of the mean turbidity and apparent color removal percentages the model is characterized by isolines which represent the removal percentage level curves in this study ordinary kriging was used so the estimate to determine an average value in a non sampled region was made from neighboring points 2 4 characterization of the sludge formed by eds the sludge formed was dried at 80 c for 24 h macerated and characterized by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds in microanalysis detector equipment oxford brand model inca x act 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical treatment of the results obtained in this research was made using the computer program sivar and rbio to verify the existence of significant differences between different treatments the analysis of variance anova was applied when the occurrence of significant difference between treatments was identified the scott knott test of multiple comparisons was applied with a significance level of 5 and 95 confidence for both analyses 2 6 flake formation test and follow up by digital image analysis the tests were carried out in jartest coupled to a non destructive and non intrusive image capture system digital camera the methodology used was adapted from 29 30 assays were performed for obtaining the optimal point of each coagulant during flocculation thirty images were captured three clicks ten images per click at each of the following times 1 3 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min the images were obtained in a closed and dark room without interference from light coming from the environment the image capture system consisted of a plane of light generated by a laser beam incident on the jar and the acquisition of images of the flakes using a digital camera the laser used had a power of 98 000 mw a wavelength of 532 nm and a thickness of 2 mm the digital still camera had a resolution of 6000 4000 pixels and a maximum shutter speed of 1 4000 s the camera was positioned at about 50 cm from the jar and the laser at 10 cm and the images were obtained using the software camera control pro 2 the images including the calibration one were cut to the same dimensions 1740 1160 pixels and positioned using the jpegcrops software after being cut the image treatment was carried out using the imajej 1 52 by calibration binarization detection and measurement of the flakes the following parameters equivalent diameter total particle distribution tdp and fractal dimension df were determined from the data obtained from the images for each of the acquisition times during flocculation 30 images per evaluation the fractal dimension df was determined by constructing a log log graph between the projected area as and the maximum diameter dmax with the fractal dimension being the slope of the adjusted line the equivalent diameter was determined using the feret diameter d f shown in eq iv it represents the diameter of a circular object that has the same surface area as the irregular object 31 the tdp was determined from the frequency distribution of the equivalent diameters in which 10 size classes with the same amplitude were determined due to the small number of flakes larger than 0 36 mm largest flake found in the tests and smaller than 0 235 mm the last size class was built with a greater amplitude than the others the reason for it is that if all the classes had the same amplitude the last six classes would have a relative frequency close to zero iv d f 4 ai œÄ 1 2 ai is the area of the irregular object 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectroscopic characterization by infrared spectroscopy ftir ft ir spectra of each product in the cationization of ch are shown in fig 3 in the comparison of peanuts shell holocelluloses and natural hemicelluloses the cationization was confirmed by the appearance of a band at 1475 cm 1 which is at the stretching vibrations of ch2 region 32 and by the increase of the ether group band at 1152 and 1112 cm 1 27 33 the other bands are similar indicating that there is a pattern in the ir spectrum and that the basic structure of the hemicelluloses have not been modified 34 35 a band at 893 cm 1 was attributed to bonds between the xylan rings coc Œ≤ glycosidic bonds 34 35 the cn stretching of eta is indicated by an increase of the 982 cm 1 band specific to tetramethylammonium salt r4n 16 however it is a difficult region because in it the bending vibrations of both coh and cch2 are also present therefore this vibration will be discussed in the theoretical analysis of ft ir a specific water angular deformation occurs at 1605 cm 1 originating from absorbed molecules the stretching at 1739 cm 1 is characteristic of co bonds being specific to glucuronic acid characterizing the hemicelluloses of peanuts shell as a glucuronoxylan 36 37 the specific stretching of each species peanuts holocelluloses and hemicelluloses is presented in table 2 3 1 1 theoretical study of cationic hemicelluloses structure the conformation analysis of xylan structures was obtained from the literature 38 as the supposed structure presents a glucuronic acid the 4 o methyl d glucuronic acid available in pubchem database was added 39 the final structure of cationic hemicelluloses with explicit water molecules compared to the structure of xylan described in the literature is presented in fig 4 the obtained structure had an rmsd 0 117 in relation to the literature structure which suggests it is a suitable structure to perform the ft ir analysis the difference between natural hemicelluloses and cationic hemicelluloses theoretical ft ir spectra fig 5 was similar to the experimental spectrum the visual difference was the appearance of a 1538 cm 1 band associated with ch2 bending vibration the tetramethylammonium salt r4n has a band at 900 cm 1 however there is also a bending vibration from ch3 the 930 cm 1 region in both the nh and the ch is due to the absorption by the cc of the acid group a cn bond pure stretching occurs in 1305 cm 1 nevertheless the intensity signal is 1 24 d 10 40esu2cm2 in comparison the ether scattering band has an intensity of 305 d 10 40esu2cm2 to natural hemicelluloses and 317 d 10 40esu2cm2 to cationic hemicelluloses which indicates the weak intensity for pure stretching vibration of the cn bond due to the good agreement between the theoretical and experimental ft ir spectra the solvent inclusion methodology via the cubic box was an appropriate method and the theoretical spectrum helped in understanding the influence of the amine vibrational mode 3 2 characterization by elementary analysis the n measured in the peanut shells used in the present work was 0 58 0 05 which is similar to the amount described in the literature and characterizes it as rich in mineral nutrients 40 41 since the holocelluloses is a more internal structure of the peanut shell the environmental conditions are attenuated as a result the measured n was 0 20 0 02 the same results were obtained for the hemicelluloses namely a n of 0 02 0 01 after the cationization the n increased to 1 93 0 09 indicating the incorporation of eta from the cationization reaction the results are presented in table 3 if the monomer molar mass is considered to be mm 132 16 the substitution degree is 0 320 0 01 this result is similar to other sources of natural hemicelluloses exemplified in table 4 3 3 applications of cationic hemicelluloses for the sdw treatment coagulation flocculation all the conditions of coagulant concentration and ph are summarized in the diagram of fig 6 coagulation diagrams were plotted using the kriging method for the interpolation on the abscissa axis the coagulation ph values measured at 30 s of rapid mixing 250 rpm and on the abscissa axis present the concentration in ppm the curves indicate isoefficiency points for apparent turbidity removal colors scale was used to simplify the visualization where the white areas represent more turbidity and apparent color removal efficiency while regions with blue area represent less remotion of color and turbidity the removal of turbidity for ch fig 6 a after sedimentation by gravity for 30 min in a ph range of 7 to 11 and dosages greater than 350 ppm the removal is superior than 88 it is also noteworthy that the ph region from 8 to 10 together with 400 to 900 ppm showed an efficiency of 93 to 99 indicating that the basic ph is quite influential for the action of ch in the studied effluent the removal of turbidity when apply tsg as coagulant fig 6 b has a lower efficiency compared to ch in the first region of the coagulation diagram as the ph of 7 to 11 and dosed from 50 to 400 ppm present a removals efficiency from 10 to 60 at ph from 9 to 11 associated with dosages of 400 to 700 ppm the removal efficiency is of 60 to 80 the third region is between ph 5 to 6 at dosages of 200 to 900 ppm with removals between 10 and 80 the fourth includes the main region with a wide range of removals above 90 between ph 6 and 8 for dosages from 300 to 900 ppm demonstrating that ph is quite influential in the performance of tanfloc sg in the studied effluent mainly at ph close to neutral the ch diagrams for apparent color removal fig 6 c indicates a highest efficiencies of 50 to 60 are due to the ph range 9 to 11 for dosages from 300 to 900 ppm in associating with the best region for turbidity removal and lower dosages and close to the effluent ph 7 95 0 20 optimal points were chosen the optimal pont of ch include the dosages 400 and 600 ppm at ph 7 to 9 since the highly alkaline ph treatment is not feasible even the diagram indicating an alkaline region as a efficiency region in addition the advantage of ch does not promote the addition of color to the treated effluent different of tsg the tsg diagrams for apparent color fig 6 d show a predominant region of removals of 50 to 83 in the ph range from 6 to 7 5 and dosages between 250 and 500 ppm the dosages of 500 to 900 ppm in combination with ph between 8 5 and 10 5 occurs a color addition on system demonstrated in negative values with visually presenting a brown color in the treated effluent the color addition is an important factor in choosing the best apparent color removal points associated with turbidity removal thus avoiding the selection of higher dosages to optimal point of tsg therefore in fig 6 the regions corresponding to specific concentrations and ph which results in the greatest removal of color and turbidity are evident for the cationic hemicelluloses the region with basic ph and concentration above 400 ppm leads to a simultaneous removal of color and turbidity superior to 88 this indicates a better application of ch in basic effluents the best region for color removal for tsg was approximately at 400 ppm however at higher concentrations it actually increases the effluent color which does not happen for the ch therefore the four best color and turbidity removal conditions for cationic hemicelluloses and tsg are shown on table 5 3 4 characterization of the sdw after optimal treatment condition the total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod5 20 of the synthetic diary wastewater sdw after optimal treatment are shown in table 6 the following conditions 400 ppm ph 7 00 and 400 ppm ph 9 00 were used for the cationic hemicelluloses and 400 ppm ph 6 28 and 400 ppm ph 7 38 for tanfloc sg when comparing with the initial parameters of the sdw the commercial coagulant tsg obtains the lower values for color and turbidity for the organic material removal tsg is better for cod but at the same time the ch removes more bod the turbidity values are in agreement with tss since larger values were measured for ch and greater amounts of tss results in higher turbidity before the coagulants are added the initial cod bod ratio of 1 54 increases this is because they add more carbonic organic matter to the system when they are degraded by biological microorganisms all the parameters were reduced after the treatment of the sdw with hc and tsg which indicates an equivalent potential for both ch and tsg there was an increase in the initial biodegradability of the effluent shown by the cod bod ratio 1 54 since the addition of coagulant of natural origin has probably increased the carbonaceous organic matter facilitating degradation by microorganisms or a subsequent biological treatment if necessary the brazilian legislation for the release of effluents into water bodies requires that the effluent have a minimum removal of 60 of bod after the treatment is applied 43 thus the removal of 73 93 and 62 50 of bod for ch and tsg respectively meeting the national parameter however aiming at a more efficient treatment it is also suggested the additional step process such as filtration this could help to increase the efficiency to obtain even greater removals of pollutants owing to the suspended solids lightly dense floc still present from the sedimentation which were not sedimented within 30 min could be retained in the filter however for this study we chose to analyze the direct efficiency after sedimentation without filtration to evaluate the real action of hc only on sedimentation process the values for cod and bod 500 and 300 respectively found in the present work for ch are similar to the ones found in the literature andrade discusses the application of moringa oleifera mo and aluminum sulfate for water treatment with mo being able to affect the values of bod and cod while aluminum sulfate has no influence in them 44 baptista et al 45 measured a cod concentration of 5938 mg l 1 in 5 of seed mo solution extracted by hexane kansal demonstrated that the extraction of mo seeds in water increases the organic charge and this reflects the residual cod presence 46 favaretto et al 47 characterized several steps of effluent treatment in a passo fundo rs dairy industry the authors describe that the treatment process with polychloride aluminum achieves a removal of 68 0 cod 70 0 bod and 83 0 tss with the initial parameters of 2497 804 mg l 1 1136 410 mg l 1 e 880 425 mg l 1 respectively as shown by the literature the studied sdw needs more treatment steps as a biological treatment to reach the levels required by brazilian legislation 43 fig 7 demonstrates the removal percentage of ch and tsg the anova test indicates a significant difference p 0 000 0 05 between the conditions before and after the wastewater treatment with 95 confidence the scott knott test table 7 showed that the tss cod and bod are statistically different in their efficiency on turbidity vc 0 06 and color vc 3 40 removal tss is more sensitive to ph variation than concentration and ch is more effective than tsg the following conclusions can be made for cod there are no significant differences for the application of ch ph 7 0 and 9 0 and these differ from tsg where the change from ph 6 28 to 7 38 provides an increase in removal efficiency however the results show similar outcomes for both ch and tsg which indicates that ch is a promising coagulant ribeiro et al 17 investigated the application of ch as a primary flocculant in biodiesel effluent however only with an association of the ch and ct of the tanfloc sg in a solution of 50 tc 50 ch at a dose of 860 mg l 1 and ph 8 a decrease in turbidity from 1100 to 27 ntu removal of 96 was obtained these investigations are in agreement with this work in relation to the performance of neutral ch applied in ph 7 being the desirable condition a summary of these is shown in table 8 these works show that the physicochemical treatment of dairy wastewater with organic coagulants tanfloc and crushed okra seeds have removal efficiencies greater than of 90 the high pollutant removal efficiency indicates that nch has a great potential to be used as coagulant on treatment of dairy wastewaters fig 8 presents the initial a and final state b of the treatment process using the optimal condition for each organic coagulations tsg or ch although the sdw has similar color and turbidity at the end of the treatment process there are differences in the flocs and sludge to each coagulant agent 3 5 sludge characterization by eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy of the sludge indicates a pattern in elemental composition ch contains more carbon 92 16 1 13 followed by oxygen 6 23 0 91 na 0 53 0 04 and p 0 39 0 02 the element order of tsg is carbon 75 36 4 57 oxygen 20 31 4 27 p 1 06 0 01 and na 0 53 0 04 the sludge composition provides organic coagulants as cationic hemicelluloses and tanfloc sg a potential application in agriculture as a fertilizer that is due to its possible biodegradability richness in organic matter macro and micronutrients ability to improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil in addition to not containing a predominant content of inorganic substances e g aluminum which is found in the sludge of use of inorganic coagulants 6 48 3 6 flake formation test and follow up by digital image analysis 3 6 1 flocs size of ch and tsg coagulations the high turbidity of sdw prevents a well defined image of flocs formation hence the turbidity of the measured solution was lowered from 553 to 121 1 70 ntu via a 1 5 dilution the ph of the resulting solution was ph 7 89 0 05 the coagulation ph was preserved at 7 38 and 9 00 for tsg and ch respectively the dosages used were 100 200 and 400 ppm for each the turbidity removal of diluted sdw is summarized in fig 9 the best overall conditions of 100 ppm ph 9 00 and 100 ppm ph 7 38 result in a turbidity removal of 74 52 2 22 and 81 31 1 60 for ch and tsg respectively these specific new optimal conditions both to ch and tsg was used on the determination of the floc size and fractal structure a non intrusive optical sampling technique was applied to capture digital images of flocs at the moment of coagulant addition 3 6 2 fractal dimension df the fractal theory has been applied in many studies to evaluate floc structure using the fractal dimension df concepts higher fractal dimensions represent small structures and aggregate formation with circular shape while lower fractal dimensions lead to large structures commonly branched with linear shape weakly interacting and spaces pores in consequence the structures with lower fractal dimensions commonly have less density making sedimentation hard fig 10 shows the fractal dimension in function of the time from the addition of the coagulating agent the floc formation time for ch was about 5 min with an expressive variation from 5 to 10 min after this time there was a stabilization in terms of their morphological properties maintaining an average df of 1 319 0 019 tsg resulted in a larger fractal dimension reaching stabilization after 10 min with an average df of 1 871 0 001 indicating that the shape of the flakes is already well defined ch has more sedimentation time than tsg which is in agreement with the lower df value of the first in comparison with the latter therefore the df can be defined as the degree of efficiency in which the smaller particles organize themselves to complete the space according to the floc size according to waite 1999 more circular aggregates have a larger fractal dimension closer to 2 as was the case with the tsg df while aggregates with a looser structure have a smaller fractal dimension closer to 1 seen in the df of the ch 49 in the investigation by gon√ßalves df values of 1 73 and 1 86 were found when using inorganic coagulants poly aluminum chloride ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate in water with a turbidity of 6 5 unt 50 they observed that there was a high variation in fractal dimension in the first 15 min of flocculation for the three coagulants x li et al and t li et al state that the larger the fractal dimension more compact is the floc which means it is less porous indicating a better organization of the smaller particles that agglomerated to form these final floc 51 52 the results obtained in the present work show that the organics coagulant ch and tsg are similar to inorganic coagulants in relation to df 3 6 3 total particle distribution tpd flocculation is an operation that aims to change the size distribution of particles which are destabilized increasing the fraction of larger particles through energy dissipation in the liquid mass under controlled conditions this increase favors the removal of particulate material in subsequent separation units traditionally flocculation performance is evaluated indirectly by measuring turbidity however its analysis must be performed by means of direct and independent measurement through the particle size distribution function psd 53 the size of the particles was distributed into 10 classes the lower minimum and maximum upper limit of the diameter of the flakes differ ranging from 0 023 to 0 254 mm for hcn and from 0 032 to 5 718 mm for tsg fig 11 shows the final binarized image of the flakes formed within 15 min of flocculation in the same section where the difference in diameter structure and distribution of the flocs is evident the classes of tpd are represented in a histogram of the relative frequency of aggregates occurrence in terms of size ranges shown in fig 12 results for the tpd evolution over time 1 to 30 min for the selected application conditions flocculation gradient gf of 20 s 1 30 rpm with flocculation time tf of 30 min revealed that for hc the beginning of the flakes formation was detected only after 5 min at this point most of the flakes were concentrated in the first two grades with small flakes ranging from 0 023 to 0 035 mm and a relative frequency of 0 850 to 0 150 respectively as shown in the fig 12 a after 10 min the flakes growth and composition in the other classes occurred tsg flocculation starts at 1 min with larger tpd sizes from 0 032 to 0 116 mm corresponding to a relative frequency of 0 340 to 0 400 respectively for both cases the distribution in the point of 15 and 30 min sedimentation was similar indicating that the systems have stabilized after 10 min teixeira et al 54 evaluated tannin based coagulants tbcs performance as a natural coagulant and aluminum sulfate as for harvesting microalgae biomass grown in sanitary effluent for this image analysis and light scattering based equipment were used to evaluate the coagulant performance recovery efficiency floc strength and floc recovery with flocculation gradient of 15 s 1 produced the highest average maximum particle diameter dmax reaching an average dmax of 0 780 after 15 min of flocculation for tannin and an average dmax of 0 795 mm after 10 min of flocculation for aluminum sulfate times similar to those found in this work 4 conclusions cationic hemicelluloses were investigated as primary coagulant in a physicochemical treatment of synthetic dairy effluent with results similar to those of commercial tannin the synthesis and cationization of cationic hemicelluloses were confirmed by ftir and elemental analysis ftir shows the appearance of the 1475 cm 1 methyl group band which was not present on the natural hemicelluloses spectrum theoretical ftir shows the same spectrum profile of natural and cationic hemicelluloses with an increase of the 1516 cm 1 methyl group band the pure cn stretching in 1305 cm 1 has a low intensity 1 24 d10 40esu2cm2 and there is also a ch3 bending at 900 cm 1 shifted when compared to the literature stretching of r4n 900 cm 1 the elemental analysis indicates the presence of 1 92 0 09 of nitrogen on ch with a substitution degree of 0 320 0 01 application of cationic hemicelluloses was determined by percentage of color and turbidity removal in comparison with a commercial coagulant the best concentration and dosage conditions were shown on a coagulation diagram ch promotes removal efficiencies greater than 88 turbidity associated with 40 apparent color at ph of coagulation 7 to 11 at dosages 400 to 900 ppm demonstrating a more favorable performance in neutral and basic ph tanfloc sg tsg promotes the removal of 90 turbidity and 70 apparent color in its best range of ph 6 to 7 5 for dosages 300 to 500 ppm both provide a better final quality to the effluent the experimentally selected optimum point occurred for ch 400 ppm at coagulation ph 9 00 with removal efficiencies of 94 79 turbidity 56 72 apparent color 79 76 tss 47 83 cod 73 93 bod5 20 tsg optimal point occurs at 400 ppm with coagulation ph 7 38 promoting removal efficiencies of 98 67 turbidity 65 21 apparent color 62 50 tss 62 50 cod 62 39 bod5 20 noteworthy that the formation of smaller and denser flakes coupled with a unitary filtration operation after the treatment would be an alternative to promote an increase in these removals in addition the sludge generated by both coagulants has a predominantly organic composition with a high carbon content contributing to the advantages of biodegradability making it easier for a final disposal and indicating a potential use as fertilizer the application of the non destructive and non intrusive image capture method proved to be effective for extracting information about the particles from the effluent flocculation process by the coagulants there was a low variation for the fractal dimension df over the analysis time with a tendency to stabilize at values of 1 319 0 02 and 1 871 0 001 after 10 min of flocculation for ch and tsg respectively ch started the formation of detectable flakes after 5 min of flocculation with diameters from 0 023 to 0 254 mm tsg floc diameters were in the range from 0 032 to 5 718 mm therefore cationic hemicelluloses extracted and synthesized from agro industrial residue of peanut shells are promising for application as primary coagulants in physical chemical treatment they exhibited flocculation efficiency for the removal of turbidity apparent

agroindustry residue natural hemicelluloses tanfloc sg primary treatment coagulation 1 introduction inorganic coagulants such as al2 so4 3 aln oh mcl3 n m fecl3 and feso4 have been gradually replaced by plant based coagulants as they are a renewable potentially biodegradable and non hazardous source 1 2 in addition issues related to public health stand out from others in particular coagulants from aluminum salts which have been reported in medical and environmental studies as harmful to the nervous system and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases dementias parkinson s and alzheimer s disease 1 3 4 coagulants containing iron salts on the other hand can cause problems with operation and corrosion in pipes 1 the global market for coagulants and flocculants is estimated to reach us 6 01 billion by 2022 us 4 35 billion in 2016 noting a compound annual growth rate of 5 9 between 2017 and 2022 5 these numbers indicate that the interest and importance of coagulation are expected to grow significantly in the coming years and therefore this topic is worth delving into further the strong demand and interest in the coagulation process have driven the exploration of the new generation of coagulants with better performance and coagulation efficiency this includes the search for natural coagulants as an alternative option to chemical based coagulants in the wake of sustainable development natural coagulants are an interesting alternative due to the issues associated with the use of inorganic coagulants one of the main advantages of natural coagulants is the possible safety for human health and ecosystems the following characteristics can be highlighted sustainable technology low toxicity biodegradation efficient performance in removing pollutants use of waste as a raw material for its production reduction of sludge generation and potential use of the sludge generated in soil fertilization and they are non corrosive as opposed to the iron salt coagulants 6 the cationic tannins are examples of coagulants commonly used in water treatment and wastewater and their source are polyphenolic polymers shells acacia sp and schinopsis sp 7 in order for the tannins to become positively charged and acquire coagulation properties becoming cationic tannins ct they may subjected to the mannich aminomethylation reaction by the addition of formaldehyde ammonium chloride nh4cl due to quaternary nitrogen and hydrochloric acid hcl 7 this polyelectrolyte is already available on the market and distributed by the company tanac brasil s a which developed a coagulant and flocculant based on tannin from acacia mearnsii ac√°cia negra called tanfloc furthermore natural organic coagulants are generally water soluble polymers derived from compounds of natural macromolecules cationic tannins from black wattle trees 8 9 oil moringa seeds 10 12 okra and passion fruit seeds 13 14 watermelon or melon solution 15 and cellulosic derivatives such as cationic hemicelluloses from corn residues and peanut shells 16 17 are examples of these materials the use of agro industrial residues in general by products generated from the processing of peanuts can be a promising source of lignocellulosic biomass that is composed of lignin cellulose and hemicelluloses polysaccharides and or proteins with potential clotting power in most cases this fibrous material available in large quantities 18 is discarded or burned as a solid residue which can be an environmental aggravating factor cellulosic derivatives such as cationic hemicelluloses can also come from corn residues in addition to peanut shells 17 hemicelluloses refer to the many types of heteropolymers composed of different sugar units such as d xylose l arabinose d galactose d glucuronic acid among others varying according to the type of vegetable of origin they are found in large quantities in the forest and as agricultural waste the abundance of these waste products explains why there have been advances made in this area offering prospects for the reuse of these materials for different purposes 19 cationic hemicelluloses ch are positively charged polyelectrolytes cationized by etherification reaction from the extraction of natural hemicelluloses hn they stand out for having a chemical structure rich in hydroxyls and they can add value to agroindustry waste one example is the cationization of its structure with tertiary amine presenting the possibility of application as a coagulant and flocculant in the treatment of different types of effluents such as sanitary sewage effluent 16 biodiesel 17 and industrial laundry 20 the objective of this work was to synthesize and evaluate ch derived from peanut shells as a primary coagulant agent in the treatment process coagulation flocculation and sedimentation of a synthetic dairy effluent sdw the latter was chosen due to its properties of high load of suspended solids dissolved solids and organic matter simulating an effluent with industrial characteristics a sdw also grants a better control over the studied process in addition to allowing further replicability furthermore a comparison was made with the efficiency of the commercial coagulant tanfloc sg tsg a polymer composed of ct acquired from the company tanac brasil s a 2 material and methods 2 1 coagulants obtaining and preparing 2 1 1 synthesis of cationic hemicelluloses ch from peanut shell residue from agroindustry the synthesis of ch extracted from peanut shell occurred in 3 steps fig 1 1 extraction of holocelluloses ho 2 isolation of natural hemicelluloses nh and 3 cationization of nh the extraction of holocelluloses ho took place according to the acid sodium chlorite naclo2 methodology 21 from 15 g of peanut shells for each synthesis which were mixed with distilled water in the proportion of 1 20 g ml and heated at 75 c for 30 min with the addition of acetic acid and chlorite of sodium in a ratio of 1 1 5 ml g and kept under stirring for 4 h addition of acetic acid ch3cooh naclo2 repeated every hour the reaction mixture was cooled to 5 c for 20 min and filtered with successive washes of distilled water until whitish in color the solid material was dried in an oven at 75 c for 6 h the procedure established by morais et al and ren et al was followed for the isolation of natural hemicelluloses 22 23 in which for each synthesis a 17 5 m v naoh solution was added to natural holocelluloses in a ratio of 15 1 ml g the material was then left to rest for 2 min crushed for 8 min and the mixture filtered in a nylon strainer to separate the celluloses fibrous residue from the hemicelluloses liquid part an ch3cooh ethanol c2 h5oh 1 1 v v solution was added to this liquid part to precipitate the material which after 12 h was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 3 min and the pasty part was dried in an oven at 75 c for 6 h cationic hemicelluloses were synthesized according to procedures adapted from ren et al 22 and landim et al 16 where the cationization of natural hemicelluloses was performed by the reaction that occurs with the addition of a cationizing agent 2 3 epoxy propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride eta the process occurs by an etherification reaction of the hydroxyl functions in an alkaline medium which results in the quaternization of the polysaccharide a 10 w v solution containing hemicelluloses for each synthesis was kept under stirring at 60 c for 30 min subsequently naoh was added to the reaction medium in a proportion of 14 m v and kept under stirring for 20 min after it an amount of eta in the proportion of 6 8 v v was added and again the reaction medium was kept under stirring for 20 min subsequently a suitable mass of naoh was added for the reaction medium to be 2 2 m v and kept under stirring at 60 c for 5 h the resulting mixture was cooled in an ice bath and neutralized with hcl solution then the cationic hemicelluloses were precipitated with ethanol 98 after 24 h the liquid was removed and the final precipitated material dried in an oven at 75 c for 6 h a simplified summary of the ch production steps is shown in fig 1 after selection of the peanut shells 2 1 2 spectroscopic characterization by ftir the main functional groups indicative of the process of cationization of ch presence of amine was identified by ftir in a perkin elmer ir tf frontier single range mir spectrophotometer in the region between 4000 and 220 cm 1 the measurements of the samples were carried out in the solid state using the attenuated total reflectance atr accessory with a diamond crystal the spectrophotometer used belongs to the triangle inorganic materials group gmit located at the laboratory of photochemistry and materials science lafot cm of the ufu institute of chemistry 2 1 3 theoretical spectroscopic study of the structures of cationic hemicelluloses the theoretical spectroscopic characterization of natural nh and cationized ch hemicelluloses was performed with the aid of computational chemistry whose calculations were performed with gaussian 16 software 24 initially the optimization and vibrational analysis of the structures was carried out characterizing the stationary point as a local minimum at the b3lyp 6 311g d p level with the inclusion of implicit solvent smd the inclusion of explicit h2o molecules was made in the respective chemical structures of nh and ch positioned in such a way as to generate a rectangular block 15 0 √• long 10 √• wide and high around the eta similarly to a cubic solvation 25 the system was optimized in two stages stage 1 application of a universal force field uff 26 until reaching convergence step 2 reoptimization of the system with b3lyp 6 311g d p from the structures obtained in the previous step subsequently vibrational analysis was performed generating the infrared spectra of the molecules of interest fig 2 presents the initial solvation system with the optimized structure of the eta 2 1 4 determination of degree of substitution ds by elemental analysis samples of ch and its precursors were dried at 60 c for 24 h then the determination of carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n was performed by elemental analysis in a perkinelmer model series ii 2400 equipment with a precision of 0 5 installed in the multiuser laboratory of the institute of chemistry of ufu then to follow the substitution process in the structure of the hemicelluloses the degree of substitution was calculated by the amount of nitrogen and carbon according to the eq i 17 27 i ds 60 n 14 c 72 n where n

commercial coagulant provided by tanac 2 1 6 preparation of the coagulant solution tanfloc sg tsg 10 v v to compare the performance of the cationic hemicelluloses in the treatment of sdw the commercial organic coagulant tanfloc sg provided by the company tanac s a was chosen the ph of the solution was 1 75 0 76 with an average total tannin solid of 32 to attain the best use conditions the solution applied in the tests was prepared at 10 v v due to its viscosity and the company s recommendations 2 2 treatability tests of synthetic dairy effluent 2 2 1 preparation of synthetic dairy wastewater sdw due to the large fluctuation in the characteristics of effluent generated in the dairy industry sdw was used to gain better control and reproducibility over the process sdw was prepared following the adapted formulation of muniz et al 13 being diluted twice in relation to the original recipe the formulation used by the aforementioned authors was characterized and did not contain the whey from the manufacture of cheese in its composition the following substances were dissolved in 100 l of distilled water whole milk powder 28 80 mg mgso4 7h2o 57 60 mg cacl2 2h2o 1 44 mg c6h12o6 0

their removal absorbance readings were taken in a visible spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 2 2 2 treatability tests coagulation flocculation and sedimentation the physicochemical treatment tests were simulated in the sanitation laboratory labsan ufu in the jar test bench equipment nova etica model 218 which has a digital panel for adjusting the rotation of the pallets for coagulation and flocculation assays were performed for 10 hc m v and 10 tsg v v with dosage range from 200 to 900 ppm with coagulation ph range from 5 00 to 11 00 jartest tests were carried out with the following steps i 2 l of effluent was added to each jar ii rapid mixing coagulation took place for 10 s in a mean agitation gradient gmr of 300 s 1 250 rpm 40 ml of sample was immediately collected from each jar and the coagulation ph was measured iii slow mixing flocculation occurred for 15 min in a mean flocculation gradient gmf of 20 s 1 30 rpm iv shaking was turned off and after 30 min of sedimentation samples were collected and turbidity ntu and remaining apparent color uc were measured the determination of removal efficiency for all parameters and parameters analyzed after treatment tests was calculated according to the eq ii ii re vi vf vf 100 being re removal efficiency vi initial value vf final value 2 3 determination of coagulation diagrams the coagulation diagrams were determinated in 24 tests for 10 ch m v dosages 200 400 600 and 900 ppm and 42 tests for 10 tsg v v dosages 200 300 400 500 600 700 and 900 ppm for each batch with 6 jars in each jar 2 l of effluent were added the coagulant dosage was maintained in all jars the ph was varied by the addition of hcl 2 mol l 1 as acidifier or naoh 2 mol l 1 as alkalinizing in different volumes to obtain the desired ph values measuring at approximately to ph 5 6 7 8 and 9 and 11 the records of coagulation ph readings coagulant dosage and the respective percentages of apparent color removal were tabulated in electronic spreadsheets in microsoft excel and later transferred to the computer program surfer 28 for the interpolation of the data sampled in the laboratory the aim was to estimate percentages in non sampled points and draw the curves of the same removal efficiency called coagulation diagram the kriging regression method was selected as a mathematical model for the spatial interpolation and estimation of the mean turbidity and apparent color removal percentages the model is characterized by isolines which represent the removal percentage level curves in this study ordinary kriging was used so the estimate to determine an average value in a non sampled region was made from neighboring points 2 4 characterization of the sludge formed by eds the sludge formed was dried at 80 c for 24 h macerated and characterized by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds in microanalysis detector equipment oxford brand model inca x act 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical treatment of the results obtained in this research was made using the computer program sivar and rbio to verify the existence of significant differences between different treatments the analysis of variance anova was applied when the occurrence of significant difference between treatments was identified the scott knott test of multiple comparisons was applied with a significance level of 5 and 95 confidence for both analyses 2 6 flake formation test and follow up by digital image analysis the tests were carried out in jartest coupled to a non destructive and non intrusive image capture system digital camera the methodology used was adapted from 29 30 assays were performed for obtaining the optimal point of each coagulant during flocculation thirty images were captured three clicks ten images per click at each of the following times 1 3 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min the images were obtained in a closed and dark room without interference from light coming from the environment the image capture system consisted of a plane of light generated by a laser beam incident on the jar and the acquisition of images of the flakes using a digital camera the laser used had a power of 98 000 mw a wavelength of 532 nm and a thickness of 2 mm the digital still camera had a resolution of 6000 4000 pixels and a maximum shutter speed of 1 4000 s the camera was positioned at about 50 cm from the jar and the laser at 10 cm and the images were obtained using the software camera control pro 2 the images including the calibration one were cut to the same dimensions 1740 1160 pixels and positioned using the jpegcrops software after being cut the image treatment was carried out using the imajej 1 52 by calibration binarization detection and measurement of the flakes the following parameters equivalent diameter total particle distribution tdp and fractal dimension df were determined from the data obtained from the images for each of the acquisition times during flocculation 30 images per evaluation the fractal dimension df was determined by constructing a log log graph between the projected area as and the maximum diameter dmax with the fractal dimension being the slope of the adjusted line the equivalent diameter was determined using the feret diameter d f shown in eq iv it represents the diameter of a circular object that has the same surface area as the irregular object 31 the tdp was determined from the frequency distribution of the equivalent diameters in which 10 size classes with the same amplitude were determined due to the small number of flakes larger than 0 36 mm largest flake found in the tests and smaller than 0 235 mm the last size class was built with a greater amplitude than the others the reason for it is that if all the classes had the same amplitude the last six classes would have a relative frequency close to zero iv d f 4 ai œÄ 1 2 ai is the area of the irregular object 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectroscopic characterization by infrared spectroscopy ftir ft ir spectra of each product in the cationization of ch are shown in fig 3 in the comparison of peanuts shell holocelluloses and natural hemicelluloses the cationization was confirmed by the appearance of a band at 1475 cm 1 which is at the stretching vibrations of ch2 region 32 and by the increase of the ether group band at 1152 and 1112 cm 1 27 33 the other bands are similar indicating that there is a pattern in the ir spectrum and that the basic structure of the hemicelluloses have not been modified 34 35 a band at 893 cm 1 was attributed to bonds between the xylan rings coc Œ≤ glycosidic bonds 34 35 the cn stretching of eta is indicated by an increase of the 982 cm 1 band specific to tetramethylammonium salt r4n 16 however it is a difficult region because in it the bending vibrations of both coh and cch2 are also present therefore this vibration will be discussed in the theoretical analysis of ft ir a specific water angular deformation occurs at 1605 cm 1 originating from absorbed molecules the stretching at 1739 cm 1 is characteristic of co bonds being specific to glucuronic acid characterizing the hemicelluloses of peanuts shell as a glucuronoxylan 36 37 the specific stretching of each species peanuts holocelluloses and hemicelluloses is presented in table 2 3 1 1 theoretical study of cationic hemicelluloses structure the conformation analysis of xylan structures was obtained from the literature 38 as the supposed structure presents a glucuronic acid the 4 o methyl d glucuronic acid available in pubchem database was added 39 the final structure of cationic hemicelluloses with explicit water molecules compared to the structure of xylan described in the literature is presented in fig 4 the obtained structure had an rmsd 0 117 in relation to the literature structure which suggests it is a suitable structure to perform the ft ir analysis the difference between natural hemicelluloses and cationic hemicelluloses theoretical ft ir spectra fig 5 was similar to the experimental spectrum the visual difference was the appearance of a 1538 cm 1 band associated with ch2 bending vibration the tetramethylammonium salt r4n has a band at 900 cm 1 however there is also a bending vibration from ch3 the 930 cm 1 region in both the nh and the ch is due to the absorption by the cc of the acid group a cn bond pure stretching occurs in 1305 cm 1 nevertheless the intensity signal is 1 24 d 10 40esu2cm2 in comparison the ether scattering band has an intensity of 305 d 10 40esu2cm2 to natural hemicelluloses and 317 d 10 40esu2cm2 to cationic hemicelluloses which indicates the weak intensity for pure stretching vibration of the cn bond due to the good agreement between the theoretical and experimental ft ir spectra the solvent inclusion methodology via the cubic box was an appropriate method and the theoretical spectrum helped in understanding the influence of the amine vibrational mode 3 2 characterization by elementary analysis the n measured in the peanut shells used in the present work was 0 58 0 05 which is similar to the amount described in the literature and characterizes it as rich in mineral nutrients 40 41 since the holocelluloses is a more internal structure of the peanut shell the environmental conditions are attenuated as a result the measured n was 0 20 0 02 the same results were obtained for the hemicelluloses namely a n of 0 02 0 01 after the cationization the n increased to 1 93 0 09 indicating the incorporation of eta from the cationization reaction the results are presented in table 3 if the monomer molar mass is considered to be mm 132 16 the substitution degree is 0 320 0 01 this result is similar to other sources of natural hemicelluloses exemplified in table 4 3 3 applications of cationic hemicelluloses for the sdw treatment coagulation flocculation all the conditions of coagulant concentration and ph are summarized in the diagram of fig 6 coagulation diagrams were plotted using the kriging method for the interpolation on the abscissa axis the coagulation ph values measured at 30 s of rapid mixing 250 rpm and on the abscissa axis present the concentration in ppm the curves indicate isoefficiency points for apparent turbidity removal colors scale was used to simplify the visualization where the white areas represent more turbidity and apparent color removal efficiency while regions with blue area represent less remotion of color and turbidity the removal of turbidity for ch fig 6 a after sedimentation by gravity for 30 min in a ph range of 7 to 11 and dosages greater than 350 ppm the removal is superior than 88 it is also noteworthy that the ph region from 8 to 10 together with 400 to 900 ppm showed an efficiency of 93 to 99 indicating that the basic ph is quite influential for the action of ch in the studied effluent the removal of turbidity when apply tsg as coagulant fig 6 b has a lower efficiency compared to ch in the first region of the coagulation diagram as the ph of 7 to 11 and dosed from 50 to 400 ppm present a removals efficiency from 10 to 60 at ph from 9 to 11 associated with dosages of 400 to 700 ppm the removal efficiency is of 60 to 80 the third region is between ph 5 to 6 at dosages of 200 to 900 ppm with removals between 10 and 80 the fourth includes the main region with a wide range of removals above 90 between ph 6 and 8 for dosages from 300 to 900 ppm demonstrating that ph is quite influential in the performance of tanfloc sg in the studied effluent mainly at ph close to neutral the ch diagrams for apparent color removal fig 6 c indicates a highest efficiencies of 50 to 60 are due to the ph range 9 to 11 for dosages from 300 to 900 ppm in associating with the best region for turbidity removal and lower dosages and close to the effluent ph 7 95 0 20 optimal points were chosen the optimal pont of ch include the dosages 400 and 600 ppm at ph 7 to 9 since the highly alkaline ph treatment is not feasible even the diagram indicating an alkaline region as a efficiency region in addition the advantage of ch does not promote the addition of color to the treated effluent different of tsg the tsg diagrams for apparent color fig 6 d show a predominant region of removals of 50 to 83 in the ph range from 6 to 7 5 and dosages between 250 and 500 ppm the dosages of 500 to 900 ppm in combination with ph between 8 5 and 10 5 occurs a color addition on system demonstrated in negative values with visually presenting a brown color in the treated effluent the color addition is an important factor in choosing the best apparent color removal points associated with turbidity removal thus avoiding the selection of higher dosages to optimal point of tsg therefore in fig 6 the regions corresponding to specific concentrations and ph which results in the greatest removal of color and turbidity are evident for the cationic hemicelluloses the region with basic ph and concentration above 400 ppm leads to a simultaneous removal of color and turbidity superior to 88 this indicates a better application of ch in basic effluents the best region for color removal for tsg was approximately at 400 ppm however at higher concentrations it actually increases the effluent color which does not happen for the ch therefore the four best color and turbidity removal conditions for cationic hemicelluloses and tsg are shown on table 5 3 4 characterization of the sdw after optimal treatment condition the total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod5 20 of the synthetic diary wastewater sdw after optimal treatment are shown in table 6 the following conditions 400 ppm ph 7 00 and 400 ppm ph 9 00 were used for the cationic hemicelluloses and 400 ppm ph 6 28 and 400 ppm ph 7 38 for tanfloc sg when comparing with the initial parameters of the sdw the commercial coagulant tsg obtains the lower values for color and turbidity for the organic material removal tsg is better for cod but at the same time the ch removes more bod the turbidity values are in agreement with tss since larger values were measured for ch and greater amounts of tss results in higher turbidity before the coagulants are added the initial cod bod ratio of 1 54 increases this is because they add more carbonic organic matter to the system when they are degraded by biological microorganisms all the parameters were reduced after the treatment of the sdw with hc and tsg which indicates an equivalent potential for both ch and tsg there was an increase in the initial biodegradability of the effluent shown by the cod bod ratio 1 54 since the addition of coagulant of natural origin has probably increased the carbonaceous organic matter facilitating degradation by microorganisms or a subsequent biological treatment if necessary the brazilian legislation for the release of effluents into water bodies requires that the effluent have a minimum removal of 60 of bod after the treatment is applied 43 thus the removal of 73 93 and 62 50 of bod for ch and tsg respectively meeting the national parameter however aiming at a more efficient treatment it is also suggested the additional step process such as filtration this could help to increase the efficiency to obtain even greater removals of pollutants owing to the suspended solids lightly dense floc still present from the sedimentation which were not sedimented within 30 min could be retained in the filter however for this study we chose to analyze the direct efficiency after sedimentation without filtration to evaluate the real action of hc only on sedimentation process the values for cod and bod 500 and 300 respectively found in the present work for ch are similar to the ones found in the literature andrade discusses the application of moringa oleifera mo and aluminum sulfate for water treatment with mo being able to affect the values of bod and cod while aluminum sulfate has no influence in them 44 baptista et al 45 measured a cod concentration of 5938 mg l 1 in 5 of seed mo solution extracted by hexane kansal demonstrated that the extraction of mo seeds in water increases the organic charge and this reflects the residual cod presence 46 favaretto et al 47 characterized several steps of effluent treatment in a passo fundo rs dairy industry the authors describe that the treatment process with polychloride aluminum achieves a removal of 68 0 cod 70 0 bod and 83 0 tss with the initial parameters of 2497 804 mg l 1 1136 410 mg l 1 e 880 425 mg l 1 respectively as shown by the literature the studied sdw needs more treatment steps as a biological treatment to reach the levels required by brazilian legislation 43 fig 7 demonstrates the removal percentage of ch and tsg the anova test indicates a significant difference p 0 000 0 05 between the conditions before and after the wastewater treatment with 95 confidence the scott knott test table 7 showed that the tss cod and bod are statistically different in their efficiency on turbidity vc 0 06 and color vc 3 40 removal tss is more sensitive to ph variation than concentration and ch is more effective than tsg the following conclusions can be made for cod there are no significant differences for the application of ch ph 7 0 and 9 0 and these differ from tsg where the change from ph 6 28 to 7 38 provides an increase in removal efficiency however the results show similar outcomes for both ch and tsg which indicates that ch is a promising coagulant ribeiro et al 17 investigated the application of ch as a primary flocculant in biodiesel effluent however only with an association of the ch and ct of the tanfloc sg in a solution of 50 tc 50 ch at a dose of 860 mg l 1 and ph 8 a decrease in turbidity from 1100 to 27 ntu removal of 96 was obtained these investigations are in agreement with this work in relation to the performance of neutral ch applied in ph 7 being the desirable condition a summary of these is shown in table 8 these works show that the physicochemical treatment of dairy wastewater with organic coagulants tanfloc and crushed okra seeds have removal efficiencies greater than of 90 the high pollutant removal efficiency indicates that nch has a great potential to be used as coagulant on treatment of dairy wastewaters fig 8 presents the initial a and final state b of the treatment process using the optimal condition for each organic coagulations tsg or ch although the sdw has similar color and turbidity at the end of the treatment process there are differences in the flocs and sludge to each coagulant agent 3 5 sludge characterization by eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy of the sludge indicates a pattern in elemental composition ch contains more carbon 92 16 1 13 followed by oxygen 6 23 0 91 na 0 53 0 04 and p 0 39 0 02 the element order of tsg is carbon 75 36 4 57 oxygen 20 31 4 27 p 1 06 0 01 and na 0 53 0 04 the sludge composition provides organic coagulants as cationic hemicelluloses and tanfloc sg a potential application in agriculture as a fertilizer that is due to its possible biodegradability richness in organic matter macro and micronutrients ability to improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil in addition to not containing a predominant content of inorganic substances e g aluminum which is found in the sludge of use of inorganic coagulants 6 48 3 6 flake formation test and follow up by digital image analysis 3 6 1 flocs size of ch and tsg coagulations the high turbidity of sdw prevents a well defined image of flocs formation hence the turbidity of the measured solution was lowered from 553 to 121 1 70 ntu via a 1 5 dilution the ph of the resulting solution was ph 7 89 0 05 the coagulation ph was preserved at 7 38 and 9 00 for tsg and ch respectively the dosages used were 100 200 and 400 ppm for each the turbidity removal of diluted sdw is summarized in fig 9 the best overall conditions of 100 ppm ph 9 00 and 100 ppm ph 7 38 result in a turbidity removal of 74 52 2 22 and 81 31 1 60 for ch and tsg respectively these specific new optimal conditions both to ch and tsg was used on the determination of the floc size and fractal structure a non intrusive optical sampling technique was applied to capture digital images of flocs at the moment of coagulant addition 3 6 2 fractal dimension df the fractal theory has been applied in many studies to evaluate floc structure using the fractal dimension df concepts higher fractal dimensions represent small structures and aggregate formation with circular shape while lower fractal dimensions lead to large structures commonly branched with linear shape weakly interacting and spaces pores in consequence the structures with lower fractal dimensions commonly have less density making sedimentation hard fig 10 shows the fractal dimension in function of the time from the addition of the coagulating agent the floc formation time for ch was about 5 min with an expressive variation from 5 to 10 min after this time there was a stabilization in terms of their morphological properties maintaining an average df of 1 319 0 019 tsg resulted in a larger fractal dimension reaching stabilization after 10 min with an average df of 1 871 0 001 indicating that the shape of the flakes is already well defined ch has more sedimentation time than tsg which is in agreement with the lower df value of the first in comparison with the latter therefore the df can be defined as the degree of efficiency in which the smaller particles organize themselves to complete the space according to the floc size according to waite 1999 more circular aggregates have a larger fractal dimension closer to 2 as was the case with the tsg df while aggregates with a looser structure have a smaller fractal dimension closer to 1 seen in the df of the ch 49 in the investigation by gon√ßalves df values of 1 73 and 1 86 were found when using inorganic coagulants poly aluminum chloride ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate in water with a turbidity of 6 5 unt 50 they observed that there was a high variation in fractal dimension in the first 15 min of flocculation for the three coagulants x li et al and t li et al state that the larger the fractal dimension more compact is the floc which means it is less porous indicating a better organization of the smaller particles that agglomerated to form these final floc 51 52 the results obtained in the present work show that the organics coagulant ch and tsg are similar to inorganic coagulants in relation to df 3 6 3 total particle distribution tpd flocculation is an operation that aims to change the size distribution of particles which are destabilized increasing the fraction of larger particles through energy dissipation in the liquid mass under controlled conditions this increase favors the removal of particulate material in subsequent separation units traditionally flocculation performance is evaluated indirectly by measuring turbidity however its analysis must be performed by means of direct and independent measurement through the particle size distribution function psd 53 the size of the particles was distributed into 10 classes the lower minimum and maximum upper limit of the diameter of the flakes differ ranging from 0 023 to 0 254 mm for hcn and from 0 032 to 5 718 mm for tsg fig 11 shows the final binarized image of the flakes formed within 15 min of flocculation in the same section where the difference in diameter structure and distribution of the flocs is evident the classes of tpd are represented in a histogram of the relative frequency of aggregates occurrence in terms of size ranges shown in fig 12 results for the tpd evolution over time 1 to 30 min for the selected application conditions flocculation gradient gf of 20 s 1 30 rpm with flocculation time tf of 30 min revealed that for hc the beginning of the flakes formation was detected only after 5 min at this point most of the flakes were concentrated in the first two grades with small flakes ranging from 0 023 to 0 035 mm and a relative frequency of 0 850 to 0 150 respectively as shown in the fig 12 a after 10 min the flakes growth and composition in the other classes occurred tsg flocculation starts at 1 min with larger tpd sizes from 0 032 to 0 116 mm corresponding to a relative frequency of 0 340 to 0 400 respectively for both cases the distribution in the point of 15 and 30 min sedimentation was similar indicating that the systems have stabilized after 10 min teixeira et al 54 evaluated tannin based coagulants tbcs performance as a natural coagulant and aluminum sulfate as for harvesting microalgae biomass grown in sanitary effluent for this image analysis and light scattering based equipment were used to evaluate the coagulant performance recovery efficiency floc strength and floc recovery with flocculation gradient of 15 s 1 produced the highest average maximum particle diameter dmax reaching an average dmax of 0 780 after 15 min of flocculation for tannin and an average dmax of 0 795 mm after 10 min of flocculation for aluminum sulfate times similar to those found in this work 4 conclusions cationic hemicelluloses were investigated as primary coagulant in a physicochemical treatment of synthetic dairy effluent with results similar to those of commercial tannin the synthesis and cationization of cationic hemicelluloses were confirmed by ftir and elemental analysis ftir shows the appearance of the 1475 cm 1 methyl group band which was not present on the natural hemicelluloses spectrum theoretical ftir shows the same spectrum profile of natural and cationic hemicelluloses with an increase of the 1516 cm 1 methyl group band the pure cn stretching in 1305 cm 1 has a low intensity 1 24 d10 40esu2cm2 and there is also a ch3 bending at 900 cm 1 shifted when compared to the literature stretching of r4n 900 cm 1 the elemental analysis indicates the presence of 1 92 0 09 of nitrogen on ch with a substitution degree of 0 320 0 01 application of cationic hemicelluloses was determined by percentage of color and turbidity removal in comparison with a commercial coagulant the best concentration and dosage conditions were shown on a coagulation diagram ch promotes removal efficiencies greater than 88 turbidity associated with 40 apparent color at ph of coagulation 7 to 11 at dosages 400 to 900 ppm demonstrating a more favorable performance in neutral and basic ph tanfloc sg tsg promotes the removal of 90 turbidity and 70 apparent color in its best range of ph 6 to 7 5 for dosages 300 to 500 ppm both provide a better final quality to the effluent the experimentally selected optimum point occurred for ch 400 ppm at coagulation ph 9 00 with removal efficiencies of 94 79 turbidity 56 72 apparent color 79 76 tss 47 83 cod 73 93 bod5 20 tsg optimal point occurs at 400 ppm with coagulation ph 7 38 promoting removal efficiencies of 98 67 turbidity 65 21 apparent color 62 50 tss 62 50 cod 62 39 bod5 20 noteworthy that the formation of smaller and denser flakes coupled with a unitary filtration operation after the treatment would be an alternative to promote an increase in these removals in addition the sludge generated by both coagulants has a predominantly organic composition with a high carbon content contributing to the advantages of biodegradability making it easier for a final disposal and indicating a potential use as fertilizer the application of the non destructive and non intrusive image capture method proved to be effective for extracting information about the particles from the effluent flocculation process by the coagulants there was a low variation for the fractal dimension df over the analysis time with a tendency to stabilize at values of 1 319 0 02 and 1 871 0 001 after 10 min of flocculation for ch and tsg respectively ch started the formation of detectable flakes after 5 min of flocculation with diameters from 0 023 to 0 254 mm tsg floc diameters were in the range from 0 032 to 5 718 mm therefore cationic hemicelluloses extracted and synthesized from agro industrial residue of peanut shells are promising for application as primary coagulants in physical chemical treatment they exhibited flocculation efficiency for the removal of turbidity apparent color and organic matter not altering the ph of the effluent and not promoting the addition of color during the treatment of the synthetic dairy effluent in the studied dosage range declaration of

12986,immobilized laccase mediator system utilizing natural mediator is the best choice to deal with color based wastewater in the present study a bacterial laccase from alcaligenes faecalis xf1 was immobilized into chitosan clay composite beads ccb l by physical entrapment method and resulted in 88 4 of immobilization yield no leakage of enzymes was observed during washing and storage of beads ftir and edx analysis of ccb l confirmed the immobilization of laccase laccase and acetosyringone acs a natural laccase mediator were co immobilized into chitosan clay composite beads to form an immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l acs ccb l acs showed 78 decolorization of textile effluent through the packed bed reactor system pbrs uv vis spectrum analysis also confirmed the decolorization of effluent along with color bod and cod levels of the treated samples are also reduced to 91 and 87 respectively the toxicity of the treated sample was evaluated by conducting a micro toxicity assay using three different microbial species viz e coli bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae a substantial decrease in toxicity was recorded after treatment of effluent with ccb l acs all these observations indicate that the developed immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l acs can be used for the treatment of dye based industrial wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords laccase mediator system wastewater treatment chitosan clay composite beads pbrs operational stability 1 introduction industries play an important part in the development and growth of the country these are also a vast source of hazardous pollutants to the environment 1 3 dyes and their complex derivatives formed a major part of these pollutants and became a biggest challenge in wastewater treatment and management 4 6 around ten thousand different types of color pigments are used worldwide in various textile printing leather and paper industries 7 and 10 20 of which remains unutilized and gets discharged into running water through industrial effluent 8 10 the complex nature of these colored reagents supports them to persist for a long time and affect aquatic as well as human lives 11 12 the treatment of dyes based wastewater has become the hot area of research in the present time researchers have proposed various methods including chemical degradation precipitation solvent extraction and adsorption to clear these wastes 6 8 13 but these methods result in high cost long processing time and production of toxic by products which make them unfeasible for treatment of pollutants 7 10 researchers are now focusing on biological means of treatment i e by using microbes or enzymes on account of their less toxicity and low energy requirements 5 6 among the various studied enzymes like horseradish peroxidases laccase and other polyphenol oxidases laccase has been considered as an ecofriendly and safe enzyme 1 5 6 laccases are multicopper oxidases which have a natural tendency to oxidize a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic phenolic compounds by using molecular oxygen as a cofactor laccases have been used for various applications e g bioremediation of dyes and textile effluents food processing biofuel cell and biosensors 1 8 11 however low redox potential of laccases 420 780 mv enables them to oxidize large size or high redox phenolic or complex non phenolic compounds use of some redox mediators further increases their efficacy for oxidation of complex molecules most of the applied mediators like abts hbt and tempo are synthetic costly and being toxic at their high concentrations 8 14 use of natural phenolic compounds acs and sgz as a laccase mediator is found to be an effective and environment friendly approach to treat variety of organic pollutants dyes chlorophenols polyphenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released from the industries 15 18 since free and immobilized form of laccases are being studied for decolorization and detoxification of dyes and other related pollutants all over the world 17 18 however lack of operational stability and no recovery of enzymes are some serious drawbacks of using free enzymes 19 23 immobilization is an important technique to combat these types of problems 13 most common methods usually employed for immobilization are covalent binding adsorption entrapment and intermolecular cross linking 24 25 chitosan is a cheap non toxic good adsorbent easily biodegradable a biocompatible polymer and so highly recommended for immobilization of enzymes or biomolecules 20 24 25 chitosan beads have been widely studied for immobilization of laccases by means of entrapment adsorption and cross linking methods and leads to their prolonged activity and stability 25 26 but soft texture and low density of beads makes them ill suited for industrial applications 26 27 literature study showed that physical incorporation of chitosan with clay mineral or activated carbon not only enhances their stability but also improves their surface area as well as porosity 28 30 bentonite is also a clay mineral having layered structure with a large number of na or calcium ions 21 due to the large cation exchange property of bentonite it can easily be intercalated by cationic polymer 31 32 the aim of present study is to develop an ideal and ecofriendly approach to eliminate the toxic contaminants from the environment to achieve this an ecofriendly enzyme i e laccase along with a natural mediator acs was co immobilized into chitosan clay composite beads formed by utilization of two non toxic materials by physical entrapment method without use of any toxic cross linking reagent like glutaraldehyde the immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l acs was studied for its applicability in decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent by using a pbrs the efficacy of the developed system was assessed on the basis of its decolorization efficiency deduction in values of biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod along with reduction in toxicity against microbial species 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chitosan medium molecular weight 190 310 kda and bentonite clay natural colloidal hydrated aluminum silicate average particle size 25 nm were obtained from himedia mumbai india 2 6 dimethoxyphenol 2 6 dmp 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts 1 hydroxybenzotriazole hbt syringaldazine sgz and acetosyringone acs were all purchased from sigma aldrich mo usa all the chemicals reagents and solvents used were of the highest available grade and purity spectrophotometric analysis was done by uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis nir spectrophotometer lambda 750 from perkin elmer usa 2 2 immobilization of laccase into chitosan clay composite beads laccase was isolated from a bacterial strain alcaligenes faecalis xf1 19 isolated in our lab and partially purified enzyme salt precipitation and dialysis was used for immobilization laccase immobilization was carried out according to mehandia et al 2020 13 briefly 100 mg of bentonite clay along with 10 ml 1 mg ml of laccase suspension was gradually added in 2 of chitosan suspension prepared by standard method using 1 acetic acid all the components chitosan bentonite and laccase were mixed together and are dispersed into each other under consistent stirring to form a uniform mixture this mixture was allowed to drop into 2 naoh by using a syringe to form the beads entrapping the enzyme beads were kept in the same conditions for 4 h allowing them to get hard afterwards the beads were separated from the solution and washed with a phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 till neutrality the decanted buffer was studied for the presence of laccase activity and protein concentration in order to determine the immobilization yield and loading efficiency the laccase activity was determined for oxidation of 2 6 dimethoxyphenol at 470 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer the protein estimation was done by bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard protein the formed beads were stored in a phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 at 4 c in a refrigerator till use the decanted buffer was subjected to laccase activity determination in order to determine the enzyme leakage during storage of beads same procedure was followed to form the chitosan clay composite beads without enzyme and recognized as ccb the laccase immobilized chitosan clay composite beads were recognized as ccb l during the study 2 3 characterization of ccb and ccb l to confirm the immobilization of laccase ccb and ccb l beads were applied for ftir analysis by using f t infrared spectrophotometer 400mhz perkin elmer spectrum rx iftir and edx analysis by thermo scientific flash 2000 chn elemental analyzer the ir absorption spectra were recorded in the wavelength region of 4000 600 cm 1 both analyses were carried out at cil laboratory chandigarh the beads were lyophilized prior to ftir and edx analysis 2 4 application study of immobilized laccase in decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent 2 4 1 treatment of textile effluent by ccb l crude textile effluent was collected from a local industry located in ludhiana panjab india effluent was first filtered to separate solid wastes and then characterized for absorbance maxima Œª max using a uv vis spectrophotometer for decolorization study reaction mixture containing 5 ml of crude effluent diluted with 5 ml of phosphate buffer 100 mm ph 8 0 was treated with 0 5 g of ccb l the reaction was started after addition of ccb l following incubation at 50 c till 5 h of incubation control reaction using ccb l heat inactivated was also run in parallel for comparison under similar conditions the samples collected at different time intervals were studied for decolorization the decolorization was calculated spectrophotometrically as the relative decrease in optical density od of treated effluent at 595 nm Œª max all the experiments were performed in triplicates by using disposable cuvettes 2 4 2 effect of laccase mediators on effluent decolorization the effect of laccase mediators on effluent decolorization was tested for abts hbt acs and sgz all compounds were taken in the concentration ranging from 0 to 1 mm in the reaction mixture containing 5 ml of effluent 5 ml of phosphate buffer 100 mm ph 8 0 and 0 5 g of ccb l and further incubated for 5 h at 50 c 2 4 3 decolorization of effluent by continuous packed bed reactor system pbrs laccase and mediator were co immobilized into ccb to form an immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l m ccb l m was prepared in the same way as ccb l the only difference was that it utilizes 1 mm of mediator along with chitosan clay and enzyme mixture to form the beads ccb l acs beads were used to develop a pbrs a continuous pbrs was developed according to bilal et al 24 with some modifications the schematic illustration of the pbrs developed in this study shown in fig 1 5 g of immobilized laccase mediator beds were filled in a glass column 1 5 20 cm and the temperature of the column 50 c was maintained by running hot water through a water jacket around the column the effluent kept above the column in a vessel was continuously passed through the column with a flow rate of 0 5 ml min by using a peristaltic pump the extrudates were collected in beakers and examined for their decolorization parallel similar experiments were also run by utilizing ccb or ccb l for comparison developed pbrs was used for several cycles no of times and every time washed with a running phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 for 15 to 20 min to maintain the integrity of the beads the crude and treated effluent samples were subjected to wavelength scan on a uv vis spectrophotometer in the range of 200 800 nm 2 4 4 quality assessment crude and treated effluent samples were also studied for water quality parameters including biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod using the standard methods standard methods 33 the bod was determined by standard dilution method using bod bottles the dissolved oxygen do content of each sample was studied before and after 5 days of incubation at 20 c bod was calculated from the difference between initial and final do cod was determined by closed reflux method by using high range vials 2 ml of sample was mixed with 5 ml of digestive solution 1 5 ml of digestion and 3 5 ml of catalytic solution already present in a prepared vial and allowed to digest for 2 h at 150 c in an oven afterwards the samples were studied for their optical density od at 600 nm to access their cod 2 4 5 micro toxicity study in order to evaluate the toxicity of the crude and treated effluent a micro toxicity assay based on growth inhibition of three different microbial species including saccharomyces cerevisiae e coli and bacillus subtilis was conducted each microbial species was grown on broth medium as control and on broth medium either supplemented with 10 ml of crude effluent or 10 ml of ccb l treated effluent or 10 ml of ccb l m treated effluent and placed at 37 c for 10 h of incubation the microbial growth was accessed by recording od at 600 nm the percentage of growth inhibition gi was calculated using the following formula gi 1 od s od c where od s od of sample at 600 nm od c od of control at 600 nm 2 4 6 operational stability of continuous pbrs industrial application of any immobilized system depends on its operational stability to study the working stability of pbrs the reactor was continuously used for 120 h for treatment of textile effluent and samples collected after every 24 h were studied for decolorization 3 results and discussion 3 1 immobilization of laccase for immobilization of laccase the ccb beads were prepared by ion exchange reaction 31 32 between chitosan and bentonite clay as illustrated in fig 2 in the presence of acetic acid chitosan showed polycationic nature and got easily intercalated in bentonite by means of cationic exchange processes due to the coulombic interactions between nh 3 group of chitosan and negative sites in the bentonite structure the chitosan bentonite mixture droplets formed a bead structure in the presence of naoh gelling agent for immobilization the laccase solution was dispersed in a chitosan bentonite mixture and then entrapped into beads by the action of a gelling agent laccase was immobilized into ccb beads by means of physical entrapment this method resulted in an 88 4 immobilization yield with 884 0 u mg loading of enzymes in a recent report s aslam et al 26 studied chitosan beads for immobilization of laccase isolated from pleurotusnebrodensis wc 850 and attained 79 of immobilization yield using glutaraldehyde cross linking method the difference in loading of enzymes may be due to the large surface area of ccb as compared to chitosan beads and so results in maximum loading of enzymes 13 the formed beads were uniform spherical in shape with quite rigid and stable appearance fig 3 no release of enzyme leakage was observed during washing and storing of beads thus the present study offers a better choice of immobilization with respect to their higher immobilization efficiency with no leakage of enzyme and without using any additional toxic chemical reagent like glutaraldehyde for immobilization 3 2 characterization of ccb and ccb l 3 2 1 ftir analysis ftir spectra of chitosan bentonite ccb and ccb l are shown in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of chitosan showed two vibrant peaks at 3356 cm 1 and 3294 cm 1 due to overlapping of oh and nh stretching band a wide peak at 2876 cm 1 for aliphatic ch stretching 1644 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 for nh bending and at 1375 cm 1 for ch bending the ftir spectrum of bentonite showed two vibrant peaks at 3693 cm 1 and 3620 cm 1 oh stretching a wide peak at 3398 cm 1 due to interlayer and intra layer h bonded oh stretching 1633 cm 1 h o h bonding 911 cm 1 si o stretching and at 693 cm 1 al oh the ftir spectrum of ccb shows the combination of some specific absorption peaks of both chitosan and clay material a vibrant band between 3700 and 3400 cm 1 is for oh stretching and due to interlayer and intra layer h bonded oh stretching present in bentonite another band between 3400 and 3200 cm 1 is due to overlap of oh and nh stretching present in chitosan very important change observed is that the peak at 1420 cm 1 nh bending in chitosan gets shifted to 1414 cm 1 in composites corresponding to the deformation vibration of the amine group of chitosan a peak at 2876 cm 1 in chitosan ch stretching is also shifted to a lower frequency in composites which confirms that nh 3 group of chitosan is intercalated with ve group of clay to form a composite amide i band peak at 1644 cm 1 of chitosan gets overlapped by d hoh bending vibration band at 1637 cm 1represents water molecules associated with composites all these results indicate that chitosan gets intercalated in the bentonite structure hristodor et al 32 also reported similar results in their study further to confirm the immobilization of laccase the ftir spectra of ccb l was studied and compared with spectra of ccb ftir spectra of ccb l showed a broad band at a range of 3720 3000 cm 1 due to overlapping of the corresponding band in laccase for oh and nh bonds and of chitosan clay composite for oh stretching band a slight broad band was also observed at 2920 cm 1 responsible for the ch2 group present in laccase proteins the chitosan clay composite peaks in the region of 1150 800 cm 1 were also present after laccase immobilization a slight broadening of the amide i peak at around 1644 cm 1 was also observed as compared to that of ccb therefore the ftir analysis of ccb l showed that laccase was successfully immobilized into ccb beads similar observations are also reported by samui and sahu 34 3 2 2 edx analysis edx analysis of ccb and ccb l was studied and compared to confirm the presence of laccase in ccb l fig 5 edx analysis of ccb showed the presence of ca si ti n c o s na mg al and fe elemental components edx analysis of ccb l showed the presence of cu along with all other elements present in ccb the presence of cu element in the ccb l confirmed the presence of laccase as cu is a typical element present in active sites of the laccases 1 26 3 3 decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent by ccb l 3 3 1 decolorization of textile effluent by ccb l in our previous study immobilized laccase from alcaligenes faecalis xf1 was studied for decolorization of three different synthetic dyes viz remazol brilliant blue r methyl red and reactive black 5 and led to 85 82 and 69 decolorization respectively 13 in view of its significant decolorization efficiency it is possible to use it for the treatment of textile effluent and may be applied in other color based wastewater treatment applications so in the present study immobilized laccase was explored for decolorization of textile effluent according to the experimental data ccb l showed 56 decolorization of crude effluent after 10 h of treatment at 50 c and control beads heat inactivated ccb l are able to remove 6 4 of color i e may be due to adsorption of dyes on the beads as shown in previous study also so decolorization of textile effluent by ccb l is a combined dual process i e adsorption of dyes by beads and degradation of dyes by immobilized laccase present into these beads in addition this study also revealed that the maximum contribution was paid by immobilized laccase catalysis as adsorption is responsible for only 6 4 of decolorization of the effluent wen et al 21 also reported in his study that use of adsorbent material for enzyme immobilization resulted in 20 increase in removal efficiency for tetracycline in another study msk 01 laccase was immobilized in cu alginate beads and led to 38 decolorization of textile effluent out of which 5 8 was achieved by control beads 18 all these observations indicate the potential role of ccb l in treatment of dyes based industrial wastewater 3 3 2 effect of mediators on decolorization of effluent textile effluent contains different kinds of dyes including azo indigo and anthraquinone dyes which are complex and not easy to degrade by laccase alone 35 but the presence of redox mediators can improve their range of catalysis therefore in the present study two synthetic abts and hbt and two natural acs and sgz phenolic compounds in concentration range of 0 1 0 mm were examined as laccase mediators for analyzing their effect on decolorization of textile effluent the observed data showed that the presence of mediators improved the decolorization efficiency of ccb l but extent of decolorization varied with type and concentration of mediator presence of abts or hbt first improve the decolorization ability of ccb l but with increase in their concentration a considerable loss in decolorization efficiency of ccb l was observed whereas in case of acs or sgz the rate of decolorization was increased with increase in their concentration fig 6 the reason for these observations may be the synthetic nature of abts and hbt 36 as most of the synthetic mediators are expensive unstable toxic and when used in large amount their oxidation give rise to a strong oxidation intermediate which can act as a diffusion electron carrier and can easily interact with sensitive amino acid groups of laccases resulting in their inactivation and reduced efficiency 14 35 in view of their negative impact usually lower concentration of mediators is preferred in order to reduce their effects compared with synthetic mediators oxidation of natural mediators resulted in formation of low active free radicals not able to attack on the active regions of the laccase to maintain their activity and stability 35 36 camereo et al 15 found that the use of laccase along with acs or sgz resulted in 100 up to 80 and more than 80 decolorization of acid blue 74 aniline blue and reactive black 5 respectively whereas no change in decolorization of acid blue 74 and aniline blue was observed in case of abts and further presence of hbt showed only 50 60 decolorization of reactive black 5 in the present study also maximum decolorization 79 of textile effluent was observed in the presence of acs 1 mm so acs along with ccb l could be a better alternative for decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent 3 3 3 decolorization of textile effluent by using continuous pbrs use of packed bed reactor system pbrs is a very effective methodology to conduct the enzyme based catalytic reaction as they have simple design and low operating cost and also the reusability of the system again helps in managing the cost of the process 37 39 in pbrs enzyme beads are less susceptible to mechanical shear stress and its lower substrate enzyme ratio results in higher reaction performance than conventional batch reactors 40 41 the various applications of pbrs studied by researchers include processing of food and beverages wastewater treatment and clarification of fruit juices 37 41 in this study an attempt was also made to decolorize the textile effluent by using pbrs laccase and acs co immobilized into ccb to form a laccase mediator system and recognized as ccb l acs ccb l acs beads were packed in a column to develop a continuous pbrs and used for decolorization of textile effluent results showed that the treatment of effluent with ccb l and ccb l acs through pbrs achieved 61 and 78 of decolorization respectively that indicates the better catalytic efficiency of an immobilized laccase mediated system over immobilized laccase the uv vis spectrum of untreated control heat inactivated ccb l ccb l and ccb l acs treated samples is illustrated in fig 7 it was observed that the prominent peaks in spectrum of untreated sample are diminished after treatment with ccb l and ccb l acs and maximum diminishing effect was observed after treatment with ccb l acs followed by ccb l which again confirmed the more efficiency of ccb l acs over ccb l in decolorization of textile effluent sondhi et al 2018 developed a laccase abts based pbrs system and attained 60 decolorization of textile effluent 18 but the use of synthetic and high cost mediators is not a healthier approach 3 4 assessment of water quality parameters the effectiveness of immobilized laccase in decolorization of textile effluent was further assessed by analyzing bod and cod levels of treated effluent samples and results are shown in table 1 before decolorization the bod value was 1264 mg l which got significantly reduced to 392 mg l and 114 mg l in ccb l and ccb l acs assisted treatment respectively similarly a considerable reduction in cod level of all the treated samples was also observed the recorded cod level of untreated effluent was 6673 mg l which was observed to be declined to 2402 mg l and 867 mg l for ccb l and ccb l acs treated samples respectively the percentage reductions were 64 and 87 by the action of ccb l and ccb l acs respectively bod and cod levels are relative indexes of the amount of organic pollutants in water 26 41 in the present study decolorization of textile effluent by immobilized laccase and immobilized laccase mediated system has resulted in appreciable improvement in water quality parameters particularly in case of ccb l acs treated samples 3 5 toxicity evaluation of the treated and untreated effluent as textile effluent contains a mixture of various complex dyes salts surfactants degradation products and various other unknown polluting components 35 degradation of textile dyes sometimes result in formation of toxic by products that may affect the environment to evaluate the toxicity of treated and untreated effluent samples their effect on the growth of three different microbial species viz s cerevisiae bacillus subtilis and e coli were studied and results are shown in fig 8 untreated textile effluent resulted in 90 87 and 83 inhibition in the growth of s cerevisiae e coli and b subtilis respectively that was observed to be terminated largely after treatment with ccb l acs this indicates that the by products formed after treatment are not harmful to the bacterial and yeast cell growth khilfi et al 35 showed that use of laccase hbt treated effluent was toxic as resulted in complete loss of bioluminescence of vibrio fischeri whereas laccase acs treated effluent resulted in only 20 loss in bioluminescence thus ccb l acs may be used to solve the toxicity problem in effluent treatment and it can be a promising alternative for bioremediation of textile effluents 3 6 operational stability of the pbrs operational stability is an important key factor that describes the applicability of the immobilized enzymes for industrial applications 7 42 the operational stability of the developed system was tested for decolorization of textile effluent in a continuous mode and results are displayed in fig 9 the observed data revealed that the developed system retained 77 70 62 48 and 40 decolorization efficiency after 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h and 120 h of continuous use respectively successive decrease in decolorization efficiency was observed possibly due to inhibition of enzyme activity by accumulation of chemical components around the active site of enzymes as described in previous studies 43 44 also in order to retain its high catalytic efficiency there is a need to control the degradation parameters e g flow rate inlet concentration bed height and porosity etc to make the process more effective and efficient 45 the developed pbrs maintained the decolorization capability till 160 165 h of continuous operation so the use of ccb l acs based pbrs is an effective method for the decolorization of textile effluent and can be used continuously for a long duration of time with a small change in decolorization efficiency 4 conclusion laccase and laccase mediated systems are better alternatives to treat the toxicity of textile effluents however instead of free enzymes and free mediators a co immobilized laccase mediator system could be a better alternative for various industrial environmental applications in the present study laccase from alcaligenes faecalis xf1 was co immobilized with a natural mediator acs to form an immobilized laccase mediator system immobilized laccase mediator system produced 78 reduction in color of the textile effluent through pbrs further significant reduction of 91 and 87 in bod and cod levels was also attained after treatment of textile effluent in addition to this microtoxicity of the treated sample was also observed to be diminished the outcomes of the proposed system indicate the applicability of an immobilized laccase mediated system in decolorization and detoxification of dyes based wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12986,immobilized laccase mediator system utilizing natural mediator is the best choice to deal with color based wastewater in the present study a bacterial laccase from alcaligenes faecalis xf1 was immobilized into chitosan clay composite beads ccb l by physical entrapment method and resulted in 88 4 of immobilization yield no leakage of enzymes was observed during washing and storage of beads ftir and edx analysis of ccb l confirmed the immobilization of laccase laccase and acetosyringone acs a natural laccase mediator were co immobilized into chitosan clay composite beads to form an immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l acs ccb l acs showed 78 decolorization of textile effluent through the packed bed reactor system pbrs uv vis spectrum analysis also confirmed the decolorization of effluent along with color bod and cod levels of the treated samples are also reduced to 91 and 87 respectively the toxicity of the treated sample was evaluated by conducting a micro toxicity assay using three different microbial species viz e coli bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae a substantial decrease in toxicity was recorded after treatment of effluent with ccb l acs all these observations indicate that the developed immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l acs can be used for the treatment of dye based industrial wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords laccase mediator system wastewater treatment chitosan clay composite beads pbrs operational stability 1 introduction industries play an important part in the development and growth of the country these are also a vast source of hazardous pollutants to the environment 1 3 dyes and their complex derivatives formed a major part of these pollutants and became a biggest challenge in wastewater treatment and management 4 6 around ten thousand different types of color pigments are used worldwide in various textile printing leather and paper industries 7 and 10 20 of which remains unutilized and gets discharged into running water through industrial effluent 8 10 the complex nature of these colored reagents supports them to persist for a long time and affect aquatic as well as human lives 11 12 the treatment of dyes based wastewater has become the hot area of research in the present time researchers have proposed various methods including chemical degradation precipitation solvent extraction and adsorption to clear these wastes 6 8 13 but these methods result in high cost long processing time and production of toxic by products which make them unfeasible for treatment of pollutants 7 10 researchers are now focusing on biological means of treatment i e by using microbes or enzymes on account of their less toxicity and low energy requirements 5 6 among the various studied enzymes like horseradish peroxidases laccase and other polyphenol oxidases laccase has been considered as an ecofriendly and safe enzyme 1 5 6 laccases are multicopper oxidases which have a natural tendency to oxidize a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic phenolic compounds by using molecular oxygen as a cofactor laccases have been used for various applications e g bioremediation of dyes and textile effluents food processing biofuel cell and biosensors 1 8 11 however low redox potential of laccases 420 780 mv enables them to oxidize large size or high redox phenolic or complex non phenolic compounds use of some redox mediators further increases their efficacy for oxidation of complex molecules most of the applied mediators like abts hbt and tempo are synthetic costly and being toxic at their high concentrations 8 14 use of natural phenolic compounds acs and sgz as a laccase mediator is found to be an effective and environment friendly approach to treat variety of organic pollutants dyes chlorophenols polyphenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released from the industries 15 18 since free and immobilized form of laccases are being studied for decolorization and detoxification of dyes and other related pollutants all over the world 17 18 however lack of operational stability and no recovery of enzymes are some serious drawbacks of using free enzymes 19 23 immobilization is an important technique to combat these types of problems 13 most common methods usually employed for immobilization are covalent binding adsorption entrapment and intermolecular cross linking 24 25 chitosan is a cheap non toxic good adsorbent easily biodegradable a biocompatible polymer and so highly recommended for immobilization of enzymes or biomolecules 20 24 25 chitosan beads have been widely studied for immobilization of laccases by means of entrapment adsorption and cross linking methods and leads to their prolonged activity and stability 25 26 but soft texture and low density of beads makes them ill suited for industrial applications 26 27 literature study showed that physical incorporation of chitosan with clay mineral or activated carbon not only enhances their stability but also improves their surface area as well as porosity 28 30 bentonite is also a clay mineral having layered structure with a large number of na or calcium ions 21 due to the large cation exchange property of bentonite it can easily be intercalated by cationic polymer 31 32 the aim of present study is to develop an ideal and ecofriendly approach to eliminate the toxic contaminants from the environment to achieve this an ecofriendly enzyme i e laccase along with a natural mediator acs was co immobilized into chitosan clay composite beads formed by utilization of two non toxic materials by physical entrapment method without use of any toxic cross linking reagent like glutaraldehyde the immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l acs was studied for its applicability in decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent by using a pbrs the efficacy of the developed system was assessed on the basis of its decolorization efficiency deduction in values of biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod along with reduction in toxicity against microbial species 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chitosan medium molecular weight 190 310 kda and bentonite clay natural colloidal hydrated aluminum silicate average particle size 25 nm were obtained from himedia mumbai india 2 6 dimethoxyphenol 2 6 dmp 2 2 azino bis 3

were of the highest available grade and purity spectrophotometric analysis was done by uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis nir spectrophotometer lambda 750 from perkin elmer usa 2 2 immobilization of laccase into chitosan clay composite beads laccase was isolated from a bacterial strain alcaligenes faecalis xf1 19 isolated in our lab and partially purified enzyme salt precipitation and dialysis was used for immobilization laccase immobilization was carried out according to mehandia et al 2020 13 briefly 100 mg of bentonite clay along with 10 ml 1 mg ml of laccase suspension was gradually added in 2 of chitosan suspension prepared by standard method using 1 acetic acid all the components chitosan bentonite and laccase were mixed together and are dispersed into each other under consistent stirring to form a uniform mixture this mixture was allowed to drop into 2 naoh by using a syringe to form the beads entrapping the enzyme beads were kept in the same conditions for 4 h allowing them to get hard afterwards the beads were separated from the solution and washed with a phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 till neutrality the decanted buffer was studied for the presence of laccase activity and protein concentration in order to determine the immobilization yield and loading efficiency the laccase activity was determined for oxidation of 2 6 dimethoxyphenol at 470 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer the protein estimation was done by bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard protein the formed beads were stored in a phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 at 4 c in a refrigerator till use the decanted buffer was subjected to laccase activity determination in order to determine the enzyme leakage during storage of beads same procedure was followed to form the chitosan clay composite beads without enzyme and recognized as ccb the laccase immobilized chitosan clay composite beads were recognized as ccb l during the study 2 3 characterization of ccb and ccb l to confirm the immobilization of laccase ccb and ccb l beads were applied for ftir analysis by using f t infrared spectrophotometer 400mhz perkin elmer spectrum rx iftir and edx analysis by thermo scientific flash 2000 chn elemental analyzer the ir absorption spectra were recorded in the wavelength region of 4000 600 cm 1 both analyses were carried out at cil laboratory chandigarh the beads were lyophilized prior to ftir and edx analysis 2 4 application study of immobilized laccase in decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent 2 4 1 treatment of textile effluent by ccb l crude textile effluent was collected from a local industry located in ludhiana panjab india effluent was first filtered to separate solid wastes and then characterized for absorbance maxima Œª max using a uv vis spectrophotometer for decolorization study reaction mixture containing 5 ml of crude effluent diluted with 5 ml of phosphate buffer 100 mm ph 8 0 was treated with 0 5 g of ccb l the reaction was started after addition of ccb l following incubation at 50 c till 5 h of incubation control reaction using ccb l heat inactivated was also run in parallel for comparison under similar conditions the samples collected at different time intervals were studied for decolorization the decolorization was calculated spectrophotometrically as the relative decrease in optical density od of treated effluent at 595 nm Œª max all the experiments were performed in triplicates by using disposable cuvettes 2 4 2 effect of laccase mediators on effluent decolorization the effect of laccase mediators on effluent decolorization was tested for abts hbt acs and sgz all compounds were taken in the concentration ranging from 0 to 1 mm in the reaction mixture containing 5 ml of effluent 5 ml of phosphate buffer 100 mm ph 8 0 and 0 5 g of ccb l and further incubated for 5 h at 50 c 2 4 3 decolorization of effluent by continuous packed bed reactor system pbrs laccase and mediator were co immobilized into ccb to form an immobilized laccase mediator system ccb l m ccb l m was prepared in the same way as ccb l the only difference was that it utilizes 1 mm of mediator along with chitosan clay and enzyme mixture to form the beads ccb l acs beads were used to develop a pbrs a continuous pbrs was developed according to bilal et al 24 with some modifications the schematic illustration of the pbrs developed in this study shown in fig 1 5 g of immobilized laccase mediator beds were filled in a glass column 1 5 20 cm and the temperature of the column 50 c was maintained by running hot water through a water jacket around the column the effluent kept above the column in a vessel was continuously passed through the column with a flow rate of 0 5 ml min by using a peristaltic pump the extrudates were collected in beakers and examined for their decolorization parallel similar experiments were also run by utilizing ccb or ccb l for comparison developed pbrs was used for several cycles no of times and every time washed with a running phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 for 15 to 20 min to maintain the integrity of the beads the crude and treated effluent samples were subjected to wavelength scan on a uv vis spectrophotometer in the range of 200 800 nm 2 4 4 quality assessment crude and treated effluent samples were also studied for water quality parameters including biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod using the standard methods standard methods 33 the bod was determined by standard dilution method using bod bottles the dissolved oxygen do content of each sample was studied before and after 5 days of incubation at 20 c bod was calculated from the difference between initial and final do cod was determined by closed reflux method by using high range vials 2 ml of sample was mixed with 5 ml of digestive solution 1 5 ml of digestion and 3 5 ml of catalytic solution already present in a prepared vial and allowed to digest for 2 h at 150 c in an oven afterwards the samples were studied for their optical density od at 600 nm to access their cod 2 4 5 micro toxicity study in order to evaluate the toxicity of the crude and treated effluent a micro toxicity assay based on growth inhibition of three different microbial species including saccharomyces cerevisiae e coli and bacillus subtilis was conducted each microbial species was grown on broth medium as control and on broth medium either supplemented with 10 ml of crude effluent or 10 ml of ccb l treated effluent or 10 ml of ccb l m treated effluent and placed at 37 c for 10 h of incubation the microbial growth was accessed by recording od at 600 nm the percentage of growth inhibition gi was calculated using the following formula gi 1 od s od c where od s od of sample at 600 nm od c od of control at 600 nm 2 4 6 operational stability of continuous pbrs industrial application of any immobilized system depends on its operational stability to study the working stability of pbrs the reactor was continuously used for 120 h for treatment of textile effluent and samples collected after every 24 h were studied for decolorization 3 results and discussion 3 1 immobilization of laccase for immobilization of laccase the ccb beads were prepared by ion exchange reaction 31 32 between chitosan and bentonite clay as illustrated in fig 2 in the presence of acetic acid chitosan showed polycationic nature and got easily intercalated in bentonite by means of cationic exchange processes due to the coulombic interactions between nh 3 group of chitosan and negative sites in the bentonite structure the chitosan bentonite mixture droplets formed a bead structure in the presence of naoh gelling agent for immobilization the laccase solution was dispersed in a chitosan bentonite mixture and then entrapped into beads by the action of a gelling agent laccase was immobilized into ccb beads by means of physical entrapment this method resulted in an 88 4 immobilization yield with 884 0 u mg loading of enzymes in a recent report s aslam et al 26 studied chitosan beads for immobilization of laccase isolated from pleurotusnebrodensis wc 850 and attained 79 of immobilization yield using glutaraldehyde cross linking method the difference in loading of enzymes may be due to the large surface area of ccb as compared to chitosan beads and so results in maximum loading of enzymes 13 the formed beads were uniform spherical in shape with quite rigid and stable appearance fig 3 no release of enzyme leakage was observed during washing and storing of beads thus the present study offers a better choice of immobilization with respect to their higher immobilization efficiency with no leakage of enzyme and without using any additional toxic chemical reagent like glutaraldehyde for immobilization 3 2 characterization of ccb and ccb l 3 2 1 ftir analysis ftir spectra of chitosan bentonite ccb and ccb l are shown in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of chitosan showed two vibrant peaks at 3356 cm 1 and 3294 cm 1 due to overlapping of oh and nh stretching band a wide peak at 2876 cm 1 for aliphatic ch stretching 1644 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 for nh bending and at 1375 cm 1 for ch bending the ftir spectrum of bentonite showed two vibrant peaks at 3693 cm 1 and 3620 cm 1 oh stretching a wide peak at 3398 cm 1 due to interlayer and intra layer h bonded oh stretching 1633 cm 1 h o h bonding 911 cm 1 si o stretching and at 693 cm 1 al oh the ftir spectrum of ccb shows the combination of some specific absorption peaks of both chitosan and clay material a vibrant band between 3700 and 3400 cm 1 is for oh stretching and due to interlayer and intra layer h bonded oh stretching present in bentonite another band between 3400 and 3200 cm 1 is due to overlap of oh and nh stretching present in chitosan very important change observed is that the peak at 1420 cm 1 nh bending in chitosan gets shifted to 1414 cm 1 in composites corresponding to the deformation vibration of the amine group of chitosan a peak at 2876 cm 1 in chitosan ch stretching is also shifted to a lower frequency in composites which confirms that nh 3 group of chitosan is intercalated with ve group of clay to form a composite amide i band peak at 1644 cm 1 of chitosan gets overlapped by d hoh bending vibration band at 1637 cm 1represents water molecules associated with composites all these results indicate that chitosan gets intercalated in the bentonite structure hristodor et al 32 also reported similar results in their study further to confirm the immobilization of laccase the ftir spectra of ccb l was studied and compared with spectra of ccb ftir spectra of ccb l showed a broad band at a range of 3720 3000 cm 1 due to overlapping of the corresponding band in laccase for oh and nh bonds and of chitosan clay composite for oh stretching band a slight broad band was also observed at 2920 cm 1 responsible for the ch2 group present in laccase proteins the chitosan clay composite peaks in the region of 1150 800 cm 1 were also present after laccase immobilization a slight broadening of the amide i peak at around 1644 cm 1 was also observed as compared to that of ccb therefore the ftir analysis of ccb l showed that laccase was successfully immobilized into ccb beads similar observations are also reported by samui and sahu 34 3 2 2 edx analysis edx analysis of ccb and ccb l was studied and compared to confirm the presence of laccase in ccb l fig 5 edx analysis of ccb showed the presence of ca si ti n c o s na mg al and fe elemental components edx analysis of ccb l showed the presence of cu along with all other elements present in ccb the presence of cu element in the ccb l confirmed the presence of laccase as cu is a typical element present in active sites of the laccases 1 26 3 3 decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent by ccb l 3 3 1 decolorization of textile effluent by ccb l in our previous study immobilized laccase from alcaligenes faecalis xf1 was studied for decolorization of three different synthetic dyes viz remazol brilliant blue r methyl red and reactive black 5 and led to 85 82 and 69 decolorization respectively 13 in view of its

immobilized laccase was explored for decolorization of textile effluent according to the experimental data ccb l showed 56 decolorization of crude effluent after 10 h of treatment at 50 c and control

their negative impact usually lower concentration of mediators is preferred in order to reduce their effects compared with synthetic mediators oxidation of natural mediators resulted in formation of low active free radicals not able to attack on the active regions of the laccase to maintain their activity and stability 35 36 camereo et al 15 found that the use of laccase along with acs or sgz resulted in 100 up to 80 and more than 80 decolorization of acid blue 74 aniline blue and reactive black 5 respectively whereas no change in decolorization of acid blue 74 and aniline blue was observed in case of abts and further presence of hbt showed only 50 60 decolorization of reactive black 5 in the present study also maximum decolorization 79 of textile effluent was observed in the presence of acs 1 mm so acs along with ccb l could be a better alternative for decolorization and detoxification of textile effluent 3 3 3 decolorization of textile effluent by using continuous pbrs use of packed bed reactor system pbrs is a very effective methodology to conduct the enzyme based catalytic reaction as they have simple design and low operating cost and also the reusability of the system again helps in managing the cost of the process 37 39 in pbrs enzyme beads are less susceptible to mechanical shear stress and its lower substrate enzyme ratio results in higher reaction performance than conventional batch reactors 40 41 the various applications of pbrs studied by researchers include processing of food and beverages wastewater treatment and clarification of fruit juices 37 41 in this study an attempt was also made to decolorize the textile effluent by using pbrs laccase and acs co immobilized into ccb to form a laccase mediator system and recognized as ccb l acs ccb l acs beads were packed in a column to develop a continuous pbrs and used for decolorization of textile effluent results showed that the treatment of effluent with ccb l and ccb l acs through pbrs achieved 61 and 78 of decolorization respectively that indicates the better catalytic efficiency of an immobilized laccase mediated system over immobilized laccase the uv vis spectrum of untreated control heat inactivated ccb l ccb l and ccb l acs treated samples is illustrated in fig 7 it was observed that the prominent peaks in spectrum of untreated sample are diminished after treatment with ccb l and ccb l acs and maximum diminishing effect was observed after treatment with ccb l acs followed by ccb l which again confirmed the more efficiency of ccb l acs over ccb l in decolorization of textile effluent sondhi et al 2018 developed a laccase abts based pbrs system and attained 60 decolorization of textile effluent 18 but the use of synthetic and high cost mediators is not a healthier approach 3 4 assessment of water quality parameters the effectiveness of immobilized laccase in decolorization of textile effluent was further assessed by analyzing bod and cod levels of treated effluent samples and results are shown in table 1 before decolorization the bod value was 1264 mg l which got significantly reduced to 392 mg l and 114 mg l in ccb l and ccb l acs assisted treatment respectively similarly a considerable reduction in cod level of all the treated samples was also observed the recorded cod level of untreated effluent was 6673 mg l which was observed to be declined to 2402 mg l and 867 mg l for ccb l and ccb l acs treated samples respectively the percentage reductions were 64 and 87 by the action of ccb l and ccb l acs respectively bod and cod levels are relative indexes of the amount of organic pollutants in water 26 41 in the present study decolorization of textile effluent by immobilized laccase and immobilized laccase mediated system has resulted in appreciable improvement in water quality parameters particularly in case of ccb l acs treated samples 3 5 toxicity evaluation of the treated and untreated effluent as textile effluent contains a mixture of various complex dyes salts surfactants degradation products and various other unknown polluting components 35 degradation of textile dyes sometimes result in formation of toxic by products that may affect the environment to evaluate the toxicity of treated and untreated effluent samples their effect on the growth of three different microbial species viz s cerevisiae bacillus subtilis and e coli were studied and results are shown in fig 8 untreated textile effluent resulted in 90 87 and 83 inhibition in the growth of s cerevisiae e coli and b subtilis respectively that was observed to be terminated largely after treatment with ccb l acs this indicates that the by products formed after treatment are not harmful to the bacterial and yeast cell growth khilfi et al 35 showed that use of laccase hbt treated effluent was toxic as resulted in complete loss of bioluminescence of vibrio fischeri whereas laccase acs treated effluent resulted in only 20 loss in bioluminescence thus ccb l acs may be used to solve the toxicity problem in effluent treatment and it can be a promising alternative for bioremediation of textile effluents 3 6 operational stability of the pbrs operational stability is an important key factor that describes the applicability of the immobilized enzymes for industrial applications 7 42 the operational stability of the developed system was tested for decolorization of textile effluent in a continuous mode and results are displayed in fig 9 the observed data revealed that the developed system retained 77 70 62 48 and 40 decolorization efficiency after 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h and 120 h of continuous use respectively successive decrease in decolorization efficiency was observed possibly due to inhibition of enzyme activity by accumulation of chemical components around the active site of enzymes as described in previous studies 43 44 also in order to retain its high catalytic efficiency there is a need to control the degradation parameters e g flow rate inlet concentration bed height and porosity etc to make the process more effective and efficient 45 the developed pbrs maintained the decolorization capability till 160 165 h of continuous operation so the use of ccb l acs based pbrs is an effective method for the decolorization of textile effluent and can be used continuously for a long duration of time with a small change in decolorization efficiency 4 conclusion laccase and laccase mediated systems are better alternatives to treat the toxicity of textile effluents however instead of free enzymes and free mediators a co immobilized laccase mediator system could be a better alternative for various industrial environmental applications in the present study laccase from alcaligenes faecalis xf1 was co immobilized with a natural mediator acs to form an immobilized laccase mediator system immobilized laccase mediator system produced 78 reduction in color of the textile effluent through pbrs further significant reduction of 91 and 87 in bod and cod levels was also attained after treatment of textile effluent in addition to this microtoxicity of the treated sample was also observed to be diminished the outcomes of the proposed system indicate the applicability of an immobilized laccase mediated system in decolorization and detoxification of dyes based wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12987,over the past decade deep eutectic solvents dess have gathered considerable attention in the research for functional and green solvents the significant focus on the utilization of dess can be attributed to their economic benefits over ionic liquids ils practical usage through their flexible design and environmental safety linked to their potential biodegradability and low toxicity as well as low vapor pressure since their development in 2003 dess have proved to offer tremendous opportunities opening new perspectives as novel and refined materials to date significant advances have been

organization keywords deep eutectic solvents water treatment green solvents pollutant extraction 1 introduction the use of ionic liquids ils as green solvents has become a major subject of study over the last two decades because of their wide thermal stability low vapor pressure and low flammability however the high cost limited chemical compatibility and poor biodegradability of ils have made their use quite unsustainable for large scale applications 1 4 several reports have pointed out the toxicity combustible character high cost production high viscosity and poor biodegradability of ils 5 10 these drawbacks can be circumvented through the development and use of deep eutectic solvents dess as mixtures that share several physicochemical properties with ils despite not being pure compounds or strictly composed of ions 11 12 some of the interesting characteristics that dess share with ils are low volatility wide liquid range high tunability and the ability to dissolve both organic and inorganic compounds due to their high polarity 11 however unlike an il a des is generally composed of a mixture of two or more species that are inorganic and or organic and may consist of ions ionizable molecules and neutral species 11 one of the distinctive features of a des is its significantly depressed eutectic point temperature relative to that of a conventional eutectic mixture or relative to the freezing point temperature of the ideal mixture of the pure constituents another peculiar characteristic of a des is its intricate intermolecular bonding network that controls its structure solvent solvent and solvent solute interactions and dynamics these aforementioned characteristics have enabled the use of dess as a new category of solvents with functional and ionic like properties for low and room temperature applications the first des was identified by abbott et al 13 in 2003 after mixing choline chloride chcl with urea at room temperature the authors of the original work found that the mixture exhibited solvent like properties as lewis acidic ils and had a significantly lower freezing point 100 c compared to its source components 13 since 2009 an actively growing number of studies on dess fig 1 have brought forward numerous benefits of using these mixtures for advancing processes and technologies where performance and sustainability limitations observed with traditional organic solvents or ils need to be met attributes such as low production costs low toxicity biocompatibility biodegradability non inflammability reduced volatility and water miscibility have since spurred the utilization of dess for metal processing catalysis material synthesis biodiesel transformation electrochemistry separation and water purification technologies 14 15 a series of reviews have been published on the synthesis properties and different applications of dess with little emphasis placed on their uses in water treatment 16 19 199 201 however recent years have witnessed a significant rise in the application of dess as an alternative or enhancing media for water purification considering their combined green aspect and rich functionality consistently in this review the authors provide an updated picture of the industrial and microscale applications of dess in water treatment processes this includes membrane processes micro extraction and extractive distillation the emerging water treatment processes that could benefit from integrating the peculiar colligative properties rich functionality and green chemistry of dess are also highlighted lastly the current problems that need to be addressed were mentioned and future research recommendations were highlighted 2 deep eutectic solvents overview and classification a des is defined as a mixture of two or more compounds for which is the eutectic point temperature is below that of an ideal liquid mixture and with a temperature depression that keeps the mixture in its liquid form under operational temperature for a certain compositional range there are several types of dess common des systems can be constructed with large asymmetric ions obtained by combining a hydrogen bond donor hbd with an inorganic halide or more often an organic halide acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor hba as shown in fig 2 dess formed with organic halide salts can be described by the generic molecular formula cat x zy where cat can be ammonium phosphonium or sulfonium cation x is a lewis base typically a halide anion y is a lewis acid e g metal salt or hbd e g a br√∏nsted acid that forms a complex anionic species with x 11 emma et al 11 and abbott et al 13 categorized the dess into four types based on the composition of the binary mixture table 1 recently a new class of non ionic dess labeled as type v dess has emerged 21 type v dess exhibit strong negative deviations from ideality and a major depression of the melting point non ionic compounds are used to create mixtures with low freezing points to establish this new type of class type i dess are made of metal chloride combined with a quaternary ammonium organic salt type ii dess are obtained by using a metal chloride hydrate with an organic salt type iii is the most commonly documented in the literature owing to its ability to act as a solvent with a wide range of oxides and transition metal ions it consists of an hbd such as an organic acid amides amino acid alcohol and other natural compounds mixed with a quaternary ammonium salt whose structure is similar to that of ils 11 13 20 22 23 this type of dess mimics the ils properties thus possessing similar characteristics however with the proper selection of the des constituents it can be biodegradable less toxic more affordable and can be easily manufactured 24 based on their application and physicochemical properties dess can be classified into natural deep eutectic solvents nades and therapeutic deep eutectic solvents thedes nades and thedes can be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic in the next sub sections hydrophobic dess are discussed generally in addition to nades as it has a great number of applications in water treatment processes type iv is a combination of hbd and metal chloride typically as a hydrate 2 1 hydrophobic des hdes hydrophobic des hdes is an important emerging family of solvents the most reported hdes consist of a hydrophobic hba compound fig 3 combined with an hbd such as alcohol or carboxylic acid with long alkyl chains fig 4 however some of these precursors can serve as either hba or hbd depending on the system used moreover an hdes can be categorized into ionic hdes and non ionic hdes based on the ionic nature of hba 25 quaternary ammonium salts come under the category of ionic hba and are typically combined with long chain alcohols fatty alcohols saturated acids and unsaturated acids to form ionic hdess while in non ionic hdess it is more difficult to differentiate between the hba and hbd generally terpenoid based compounds such as dl menthol l menthol and thymol which are combined with carboxylic acids can be used for the synthesis of non ionic hdes 26 in subsequent studies non ionic hdess were synthesized from the same family of compounds and were used as hba and hbd such as decanoic acid and acetic acid with different molar ratios 27 other nonionic hdes were synthesized using painkillers e g lidocaine in combination with organic acids or with terpenes e g menthol and testosterone ibuprofen lidocaine ubiquinone although the interest in hydrophobic des has been increasing since 2015 only a limited number has been proposed to date due to the low number of available and low cost salts and hbds that can form hydrophobic eutectic solvents with melting points close to room temperature in 2015 van osch et al 28 combined decanoic acid and quaternary ammonium salt to produce a hydrophobic des that is stable when in contact with water however sometimes the combination of two compounds such as hba and hbd makes it impossible to obtain hdes for saturated and unsaturated short chain acids such as acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid or acrylic acid in combination with tetra n butylammonium bromide nevertheless it is possible to obtain a stable two phase des with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties by combining three compounds in the synthesis e g methyltrioctylammonium chloride as hba and two hbds as octanol and octanoic acid in a 1 2 3 molar ratio if the combination of two compounds does not give a stable hdes 29 according to van osch et al 28 and florindo et al 30 33 both compounds must be hydrophobic otherwise part of the hydrophilic species will leak into the water mainly driven by its solubility for all families of hydrophobic dess the water solubility decreases with increasing the alkyl chain of the hba because long chain ammonium salts are preferably imparting greater hydrophobicity compared to that with a short chain such as chcl 201 2 2 natural deep eutectic solvents natural deep eutectic solvents nades are a new class of dess that are increasingly being explored for their green attributes and rich chemistry 34 more than 100 nades were reported using the mixtures of chcl organic acids or alcohols or sugars amino acids organic acids or sugars and organic acids sugars naturally occurring hbd similar to dess nadess can be obtained through the significant hydrogen bonding interactions between the constituents moreover nades show high solvation properties towards non water soluble biomolecules such as gluten dna and starch than in water this gives nades the capability to act as extraction media for bioactive molecules as well as stabilizing agents 35 36 3 synthesis and physicochemical properties of des 3 1 preparation methods dess are generally synthesized by heating above room temperature a mixture of solid precursors e g hba and hbd prepared within a specific compositional range the heating is carried out at a temperature that allows melting the species and forming a liquid solution that remains stable upon cooling it back and storing it at room temperature the lower melting point component is first melted and then the higher melting point compound is added to the liquid or if both hba and hbd have high melting points the components can be melted together 34 the same method can also be applied for the synthesis of hdess based on the starting raw materials other synthesis techniques can be used such as freeze drying in freeze drying the aqueous solution of both hba and hbd is mixed and then frozen at two different temperatures afterward lyophilization is done in a freeze dryer until a clear viscous liquid is obtained for instance guti√©rrez et al 37 successfully synthesized chcl and urea des at 77 k and 223 k by applying the freeze drying method other synthesis methods are vacuum evaporation grinding twin screw extraction microwave irradiation and ultrasound assisted preparation several reviews discussed these synthesis methods in detail with their advantages and disadvantages 38 39 201 3 2 solubility of water in des generally a hydrophobic eutectic system is less thermally stable than a hydrophilic one but it is more physically stable in an aqueous solution as it has much lower water solubility in most cases a hydrophobic des has solubility lower than 7 wt in water 28 hdes properties mainly depend on the structure of hba and hbd water content as well as temperature 30 33 the selection of appropriate hba and hbd species is the key factor making the des more hydrophobic by changing the alkyl chain of hbd or hba the polarity of a hydrophobic des can be tuned the presence of a longer alkyl chain in the individual components hbd and hba lowers their solubility as well as hdes s solubility in aqueous media an hdes that contains hydrophobic hba and hbd has lower water solubility and higher hydrophobicity than an hdes composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds as hydrophilic components can dissolve in the aqueous media based on their solubility hence by synthesizing hdes from hydrophobic compounds physical stability in an aqueous solution and hydrophobicity can be increased additionally it has been evidenced that hdes with terpenes and long chain ammonium and phosphonium salts in combination with long chain organic acids have high stability in aqueous samples fatty acid based dess are the most soluble in water while quaternary ammonium salts are the least among the reported hdes tetrabutylammonium chloride and tetraoctylammonium chloride as hba with decanoic acid as hbd in the 1 2 molar ratio had the highest hydrophobicity that is 7 and 6 22 w w of water solubility respectively 28 the high solubility also depends on the availability of a nitrogen atom from at least one short alkyl chain but a minor effect was observed with the type of ion in hba cl or br recently maria et al 40 investigated the importance of the water content for the stability of the betaine urea nades using experimental studies and computational modeling density functional theory and the natural bond orbital analysis the results revealed that a minimum of 3 mol of water content needed to form a stable betaine urea nades 1 1 at 70o c the authors claimed that the stability of betaine urea nades after adding 3 mol of water is due to the difference in the hydrogen bonding analyzed by nmr and atr ftir studies and the increase in the electron density in the moiety of the carboxyl group in the betaine observed in the computational studies 3 3 rheological properties viscosity is another very important property that strongly affects the application of dess dess usually exhibit relatively high viscosities 100 mpas at room temperature which is attributed to the formation of an extensive hydrogen bonding network between hba and hbd this in return results in lower mobility of free species within the des 41 thus a des with low viscosity is preferred however the viscosity of the des depends on the structure of hba hbd and temperature viscosity is enhanced as the tetraalkyl quaternary ammonium chain increases but a visible decrease was observed when long branched chains were used as the temperature increases the viscosity decreases with arrhenius like behavior thus the application of des towards extraction is usually carried out at higher temperatures due to the lower viscosity however it is possible to alter the viscosity and other solvent properties such as conductivity and polarity by the addition of a small quantity of water 1000 ppm to dess 42 the water molecules in a small amount weight fraction 5 can form hydrogen bonds with the ions and polar hbds in the molecular matrix of the dess nevertheless above 50 mol fraction of water the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in des diminish and hence cause the properties to change drastically 43 the variation in the physical properties with the addition of water to trehalose and chcl based nades were studied by xin et al 44 upon water addition 25 the density viscosity and refractive index drastically decreased but the intensive hydrogen bonds were retained varying the molar ratios of hbas and hbds and the water content gave a higher degree of tunability of the structural and physical properties 3 4 surface tension acidity and volatility the surface tension values of dess are higher than those of the widely used organic solvents but almost comparable to the ils 41 most dess are non volatile due to their ionic nature but the vapor pressure of des increases as temperature increases the reports on the acidity of hdes are quite limited as it depends on the type of hbd and hba among the des with benzyl tri methyl ammonium chloride and p toluenesulfonic acid pka 2 8 oxalic acid pka 1 25 and citric acid pka 4 14 benzyl tri methyl ammonium chloride and citric acid reported the highest acidity 45 moreover as the temperature of des increases the acidity also increases due to the higher dissociation of the acid at high temperatures in a nades matrix carboxylic acids hydroxy groups and carbonyl groups present in the constituents are mainly responsible for the formation of a hydrogen bonding network via intermolecular interactions that determine their physicochemical properties 34 36 craveiro et al 46 have studied the properties such as density thermal behavior conductivity and polarity of nades that are based on chcl organic acids amino acids and sugars the thermal characterization of these nades revealed that synthesized nades were stable up to 170 c and glass formers depending on their composition craverio et al also studied their conductivity at a temperature between 0 and 40 c results presented the high conductivity of organic acid based nades and their temperature dependence 3 5 density ionic conductivity and polarity of dess the density is one of the most important physical properties of dess the densities of dess are greater than that of water and higher than that of the hbd in most cases while lower densities were observed for hdes than water 47 the literature revealed that the densities of des mainly depend on temperature organic salt hbd molar ratio structures of hbd and hba and choice of the hydrogen bonding donor 48 50 the density of des decreases linearly with the increasing temperature the chain length of hbd increases the density decreases the changes in density were also observed for the difference in the chain length of hbd 48 50 since the conductivity depends on the viscosity of des most of the dess have lower ionic conductivities 2 ms cm 1 at room temperature the viscosity decreases with increasing the temperature so the ionic conductivity of dess increases with temperature the other main factors that depend on the ionic conductivities of des are the hba hbd molar ratio the nature of the organic salt and the hbd as well as the salt s anion and water content 47 the polarity of a solvent is a capacity of a solvent for solvating dissolved dipolar or apolar species the polarity of the des was not considerably studied in detail ashish pandey et al 51 studied and compared the polarities of dess ethaline glyceline maline and reline using the optical spectroscopic responses of several different uv vis absorbance and molecular fluorescence probes the results indicated the ethaline and glyceline to be more dipolar out of the four dess and are due to alcohol functionalities in 1 2 ethanediol and glycerol as hbd whereas the other two hbd are the malonic acid and urea possess cooh and nh2 type groups respectively florindo et al 52 53 compared the polarity of a range of dess based on hydrophilic hba cholinium chloride and a hydrophobic hbd tetrabutylammonium chloride or dl menthol combined with several different carboxylic acids using solvatochromic responses of uv vis absorption probes and then the normalized polarity etn were evaluated when comparing the hydrophilic ch cl based dess ch cl malonic acid 0 79 has the highest etn value than ch cl levulinic acid 0 35 and ch cl glycolic acid 0 36 this confirms that the des with diacid as hbd is more polar than those based on monoacids with functional groups ketone in levulinic acid or an alcohol group in glycolic acid whereas the etn values for hydrophilic and hydrophobic dess with the same hbd as levulinic acid dl menthol levulinic acid showed high etn value 0 73 than the ch cl levulinic acid 0 35 and for dl menthol leva 0 73 it can be concluded that the latter is much more polar than the former the polarity of des was controlled by the ionic species present in the mixture that is it decreased with the increase of the aliphatic chain of the organic acid 54 3 6 toxicity because of the natural origin of most compounds used in the synthesis of dess these solvents are considered non toxic or lower toxic and harmless the toxicity profile of dess depends on the type of individual components interaction with living organisms ph of the dess synergistic effect and molar ratio 55 the non toxicity or lower toxicity of dess were mainly assigned to the group of dess composed of non toxic or low toxic compounds such as choline chloride amino acids sugars and natural carboxylic acids 56 however the toxicity of dess highly depends on the compounds forming dess hayyan et al 57 58 tested the toxicity of four dess using bacteria and reported that des has no observed toxicity radosevic et al 59 evaluated the toxicity of three dess based on chcl mixed with different hbds including glucose glycerol gly and oxalic acid oa and observed negative phytotoxicity tests result however the chcl based dess with different organic acids as hbd showed slightly higher toxicity than chcl based des with amines amino acids alcohols and sugars as hbd 56 this is because the later dess acted as nitrogen or carbon sources for bacteria hence accelerating the bacterial growth whereas des with organic acid changed the ph of the medium and therefore this environmental ph change can disturb the cellular proliferation and metabolic properties inhibited the bacterial growth 56 zhao et al revealed that among different bacteria e coli and s enteritidis were more sensitive towards chcl based dess than s aureus and l monocytogenes because of damage of cell walls of the bacteria by the hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions of dess components with the polysaccharide or peptide chains of the cell wall 60 the authors studied the toxicity of chcl based des with different organic acids and found as chcl oxalic acid chcl levulinic acid and chcl citric acid has the highest toxicity than chcl malonic acid and chcl p toluenesulfonic acid this study confirmed the toxicity of acid based des mainly depends on the length of the carbon chain and ph of the acid component of dess hayyan et al 57 58 found that the toxicity and cytotoxicity of phosphonium derived des on artemia salina brine shrimps were higher than the raw materials causing the aquatic organism to be more vulnerable ahmadi et al reported the cytotoxicity against human hek 293 cells by 28 selected chcl based dess than their individual components 61 similarly cytotoxicity of ammonium based deep eutectic solvents dess with four hbds glycerine ethylene glycol triethylene glycol and urea was investigated using in vitro cell lines and in vivo animal model 62 the authors noticed that the toxicity of all prepared dess is higher than their individual components due to the synergistic effect of dess after being prepared zhao et al also confirmed that dess were highly toxic than their individual components due to the delocalization of charges on hydrogen bonding by synergistic effect 60 in contrast the toxicity of des depends on the molar ratio of hba and hbd the chcl urea des 1 3 showed higher toxicity than with a molar ratio of 1 2 62 ahmadi et al noticed the toxicity of chcl glycerol des decreased as the glycerol proportion increased from 1 2 ratio to 1 4 ratio whereas 1 2 propanediol was used as hbd constituent with chcl their toxic effect was increased by enhancing the proportion of 1 2 propanediol from 1 to 3 61 this clearly shows that the molar ratio of individual components in dess plays an important role in the toxicity profile of dess therefore toxicity assessment studies are necessary for advancing the integration of dess into different technologies 3 7 structural aspects of des with the growing interest in using dess in water treatment and other industrial processes knowledge of the molecular dynamics of these solvents plays a vital in the process design of the intended application as it gives a deeper insight into their properties and behavior 63 dess have a lower melting point than their parent compounds owing to the asymmetric charge distribution and decrease of the intermolecular coulombic forces as a result of the formation of hydrogen bonds 64 nmr ir and mass spectrometry characterizations quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulations have provided evidence for the existence of neutral ionic and doubly ionic h bonding interactions in the dess 65 indeed these h bonding interactions between hba and hbd switched on to the formation of low transition temperature dess 12 claire et al 65 investigated the h bonding interactions in chcl urea des using bader s quantum theory of atoms in molecules qtaim their study revealed an alphabet soup of different types of h bond such as oh o c nh o c oh cl nh cl oh nh ch cl ch o c nh oh and nh nh has substantial flexibility in terms of number and strength neutron diffraction and atomistic modeling of chcl urea des revealed a layered sandwich structure stabilized by the complementary hydrogen bond formation of choline and urea with chloride along with weak hydrogen bonds between the molecules 66 a quantum chemical calculations study for three different dess including 1 2 chcl urea reline 1 2 chcl ethylene glycol ethaline and 1 1 chcl malonic acid maloline was reported by durgesh et al 67 in this study the dess were shown to exhibit a complete loop cycle structure by cooperative hydrogen bonding networks formed from strong interactions such as hbd choline hbd chloride and chcl fig 5 in the case of reline and ethaline six and seven membered ring like structures were suggested to be formed respectively through the interaction of the hbd as a bidentate ligand with cl the charge decomposition and density of states dos analyses clearly showed a charge transfer from the chcl to the hbds through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions 4 applications of dess in water purification water treatment is an important process in our modern life due to the scarcity of pure drinking water even though the earth has enormous natural water resources one possible solution to solve the availability of pure drinking water is by reusing natural water resources currently the world is searching for cost effective eco friendly methods for the purification of wastewater which depends on the type properties and toxicity of contaminants present in it des is considered a green alternative to aqueous and conventional solvents and thus the potential applications of des have been widely explored in the wastewater treatment research area 30 33 52 53 68 70 the first direct application of dess in water treatment was published in 2015 71 khezeli et al for the first time utilized hdes for the removal of various contaminants from the water via liquid liquid microextraction later on with a greater understanding of dess and their properties the number of articles published on water treatment via deep eutectic solvents increased the major research efforts on the application of dess in water treatment have been focused mainly on three areas membrane based water treatment processes extraction i e microextraction solid phase extraction and extractive distillation in the following sections we present a detailed review of the use of dess for the removal of contaminants from wastewater in these areas and highlight current weaknesses and future directions 4 1 membrane based water treatment processes the widespread existence of organic pollutants including pharmaceutical active compounds personal care products dyes organic solvents and endocrine disrupting chemicals and heavy metal pollutants such as lead mercury arsenic etc displays a formidable challenge to the water purification industry recently in addition to pure water deficiency potential adverse effects of all kinds of contaminants on human health ecosystem and aquatic life wastewater treatment is growing as a major concern the removal of pollutants using advanced membrane technology has therefore become a hot topic of significant interest in water wastewater treatment and water reuse due to the superior removal performance and easy operational method the main membrane based treatment processes are microfiltration ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo and nanofiltration 69 the main drawbacks of these treatments are lower water flux and lower selectivity along with a high running cost 70 recent studies have reported that des can act as a good pore forming agent which improves the water flux and antifouling properties 71 75 in the following sections the application of des in different membrane based water treatment processes as water flux booster and fo draw solution has been reviewed and discussed 4 1 1 application of des as water flux booster recently jiang et al 72 73 demonstrated that hydrophilic dess work as great pore forming agents for polyethersulfone pes uf membranes when added to the casting solution pes is mechanically and thermally stable and gives a chemically resilient membrane but it has a poor separation performance without any additives previously various additives such as silica nanoparticles and alcohols were incorporated into the membrane to improve its permeability and separation performance 72 73 these additives have been found to improve the permeability by changing the morphological structure of the membrane however they deteriorate the selectivity due to the enlargement of the membrane pores according to the same study the presence of hydrophilic des in the pes membrane increases both permeability and selectivity the des solvent consisted of a mixture of decanoic acid deca as hba and tetra n butylammonium chloride n4444 cl as hbd at a molar ratio of 2 1 deca n4444 cl the des was incorporated into the membrane by adding it to the polymer casting solution typically water soluble salts and organic compounds are used as pore forming agents in the membrane synthesis which explains the selection of the deca n4444 cl system for making the des specifically jiang et al 72 73 reported that the des concentration yielding the highest performance in terms of water flux was 2 wt in the membrane the enhanced water flux of the modified membrane reached a maximum of 142 84 l m2h which was 4 65 folds that of the native pes membrane this could be attributed to the formation of large and uniformly distributed pore sizes inside the membrane as confirmed from the top and cross sectional scanning electron microscopy sem photographs fig 6 also the performance of the des modified membrane towards the rejection of model biological foulants such as pepsin egg albumin and bovine serum albumin bsa was 91 5 97 3 and 99 0 respectively and superior to that achieved with the control membrane using deca and n4444 cl separately did not increase the performance of the pes membrane the enhanced morphology and performance of the des modified pes membrane could be attributed to the synergetic effect of the coordination of deca from the nmp solvent and the n4444 cl release from the non solvent coagulation bath during the membrane development by the phase inversion process later in another work jiang et al 73 studied the use of imidazole im as hbd for screening different dess as functional additives for the pes membrane to increase its water flux performance previously it has been documented that dess made of im and organic salts are great solvents for inorganic salts solid organic compounds and metal oxides and may have the ability to dissolve organic polymers 74 75 jiang et al 72 73 predicted that these additives have the potential to increase the efficiency of pes due to their excellent solvent properties and water solubility the hbas used are n4444 cl tetra n butylammonium bromide n4444 br tetra n butylphosphonium chloride p4444 cl tetra n butylphosphonium bromide p4444 br and 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride bmim cl all dess used as additives showed enhancement in membrane performance to some extent for example jiang et al reported that the pes membrane with n4444 cl im des reached a maximum flux of 781 l m2 h which is 6 45 times higher than the membrane prepared without any additives the pes modified membrane also showed bsa rejection of 97 7 at 2 bar vatanpour et al 75 reported the chcl eg based des as a hydrophilic additive in the polyethersulfone nanofiltration membrane for antifouling and separation performance enhancement the maximum pure water flux found was 241 3 l m2h for 2 wt pes polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp des membrane which was 23 times that of the neat pes membrane without pvp and des and 1 3 times that the of pes pvp membrane the pure water flux of the pes des membrane without pvp was 17 6 l m2h which indicated that the ethaline is not a good pore former the dye and bsa rejections were higher than 98 and 99 respectively showing an increased separation ability in comparison with the bare membrane an antifouling study also showed that the des blended membranes have better antifouling properties shahabi et al 74 introduced the chcl urea des as an additive to modify the polyamide pa layer of reverse osmosis ro membranes the sem and atomic force microscopy afm analyses displayed a smoother surface for the des modified membranes the membrane modified with 1 wt of des exhibited a pure water flux of 56 7 l m2h and salt rejection capacity of 96 4 indicating 27 and 3 enhancements in the water flux and salt rejection performance respectively in comparison with the unmodified membrane the authors also compared the efficiency of ionic liquids as a modifier for commercially available ro membranes their study revealed that the membranes modified with n butyl pyridinium and betaine monohydrate showed the best desalination performance with pure water flux values of 78 9 l m2h and 51 7 l m2h and nacl rejections of 97 3 and 94 4 respectively consistently the dess could be considered as efficient membrane modifiers to improve their water permeability selectivity and solute rejection performance maalige et al 78 utilized dess as flux boosting and surface cleaning agents for the thin film composite polyamide membrane tfc pa dess such as chcl eg chcl u and chcl gly were used at different temperatures 30 c 40 c and 50 c and were studied for their impact on the tfc pa membrane s performance for pure water flux and salt e g mgso4 nacl and humic acid flux and rejection the same authors found that the tfc pa membrane treated with the dess at low temperature showed a 2 5 fold higher flux than the pristine tfc pa however no substantial changes in the rejection efficiencies for the solutes have been reported the achieved increase in flux was due to the enhancement in the surface wettability of the des treated membranes the afm analysis fig 7 showed an improved surface smoothness of the tfc pa membrane after treatment with the dess and could be attributed to the presence of h bonding between the des and polyamide moieties this was also confirmed by zeta potential analysis which suggested a modification of the chemical environment of tfc pa via h bonding interactions due to des treatment also long term studies for humic acid 10 000 ppm for 250 h removal revealed that the des treated membrane showed high flux recovery without compromising flux boosting potential and rejection of humic acid compared to none treated tfc pa membrane therefore these results indicated that dess can be envisaged as both flux promoting and surface cleaning agents for the tfc pa and offer a cost effective and eco friendly membrane tuning approach on the other hand coating the dess on suitable carriers i e silica nanoparticles and using such as membrane fillers can greatly improve the water flux and selectivity performance of the membrane while reducing the des consumption and enabling its recovery 79 81 4 1 2 application of des as new draw solution in forward osmosis forward osmosis fo is an emerging technology that produces both clean water and energy via osmotic pressure difference across the semi permeable membrane 197 this process has recently received attention because of its simple and environmentally friendly operation low energy requirement and low membrane fouling in the fo process the semi permeable membrane allows water to pass through the pores and prevents ions from passing enabling spontaneous mixing in fo 82 fig 8 illustrates the process of generating fresh water from seawater via fo the clean water passes through the semi permeable membrane towards the draw solution and the mixture is then separated via a recovery system to produce fresh water water production by fo is not commercialized due to the lack of suitable membranes and draw solutions the fo membrane must have high water flux and salt rejection low concentration polarization and must be chemically and mechanically stable also the ideal fo draw solute must be easy to recover have zero toxicity and is cost effective many efforts have been dedicated to finding a draw solute that fulfills these characteristics recently studies have shown that the des can offer a sustainable means as a fo draw solution in 2017 mahto et al 83 utilized dess as draw solutions in fo for the recovery of freshwater from contaminated streams such as seawater contaminated wastewater brackish water and tannery wastewater two dess were prepared with chcl as hba and eg and glycerol gly as hbds at a mol ratio of 1 2 as hba hbd using a tfc polyamide membrane as the fo separation medium the average flux achieved in various feed streams was in the range of 2 5 l m2h which was higher than other reported fluxes for wastewater treatment whereas the achieved water recovery was higher than 90 the des was separated from the water mixture using the phase separation concept at 5 c and thus the obtained draw solutions were reused in subsequent experiments resulting in minimal water loss although the product water obtained in the study had low contamination which could make it suitable for several applications its effective recovery from des needs an improvised gradual cooling system in another work the same group of scientists has reported on the use of chcl eg 1 2 and chcl gly 1 2 as a draw solution in fo for concentrating low abundant dna and proteins in brackish feed water through a tfc polyamide membrane 84 a flow rate of 1 8 lpm and pressure of 1 atm were maintained on both sides during the fo process the chcl eg and chcl gly dess could generate very high osmotic pressures of 365 atm and 317 atm respectively the osmotic potential œÄ 150 atm could be recovered after 50 dilution and œÄ 60 atm after 80 dilution due to the retention of the osmotic potential the draw solution could be recycled for a longer time both draw solutions chcl eg and chcl gly showed high flux values of 7 85 and 3 71 l m2 h respectively achieving high protein and dna enrichment without the use of chemicals makes the des an attractive draw solution the draw solute was recovered by chilling the diluted solutions after fo at 5 c which is an easy separation process and requires a low amount of energy recently hydrophobic des are being synthesized with considerable ionic strength indeed hydrophobic dess can be introduced as a draw solution in fo this will reduce the need for the high energy intrusive regeneration process as simple separation would be possible and will reduce the cost considerably thus further research is encouraged in developing hydrophobic dess with high ionic strength and applying them as draw solutions 4 2 dess as extraction solvents in the area of extraction applications in water treatment processes des became a prominent research area due to the poor water solubility or non solubility in water hdes are currently widely applied both as liquid extractants in liquid liquid extraction techniques and sorbents in solid phase extraction techniques however not all hdess are suitable for extraction processes the melting freezing point of hdes increases with increasing tetraalkyl ammonium phosphonium quaternary chain and alkyl chain in hbd while the density decreases thus the cost of the process on a large scale can increase if hdess with longer hba and hbd chains are utilized since they usually have a higher melting point or freezing point than hdes synthesized from hbd and hba with shorter alkyl chains requiring more heat in the process 201 another main disadvantage is that if the long chain in hba and hbd has a density close to water s density the hdes will require an extended time to form two phases during separation and extraction processes it is well known that density strongly depends on temperature therefore at a higher temperature the density of hdes decreases an hdes with a very high density 1400 kg m3 was synthesized by using hexafluoroisopropanol hfip as hbd and l carnitine betaine as hba at different molar ratios 85 the subsequent section demonstrated the application of des in different liquid extraction techniques and includes the summarized reports in the literature table 2 4 2 1 liquid liquid extraction liquid liquid extraction lle also known as solvent extraction is a separation technique that uses a solvent to separate a solute from a liquid phase without a chemical reaction usually the solute is transferred from water to an organic phase via a chemical potential mechanism after the transfer is completed the system reaches equilibrium and achieves a stable configuration with low energy the solvent used and the raffinate must have opposite polarities for the extraction process to be possible this separation method is used in various industries such as the production of biodiesel organic compounds perfumes and many other industries in water treatment hydrophobic solvents can be used to extract various trace contaminants in water this can be done when stripping is not feasible if the boiling point of the contaminate is much higher than water the separation of contaminants from water cannot be handled by stripping the advantages that lle offers over other techniques are low energy requirement flexibility and recycling capability however its main limitation is the requirement of a large volume of samples toxic organic solvents low selectivity and the potential problems that the solvent can produce des became a great potential as extraction solvents because of their extraction efficiency recyclability green credentials and easy synthesis the possibility for structural tuning makes them suitable extractors for the wide range of metals and ions from water without many drawbacks florindo et al 30 33 have proved hydrophobic des capability as a solvent extractor by utilizing it to extract ciprofloxacin from water environments ciprofloxacin is a water pollutant that has wide use in the pharmaceutical industry the authors synthesized des that has low water and high ciprofloxacin solubility enabling it to efficiently extract ciprofloxacin from water moreover the activated carbon was chosen to adsorb ciprofloxacin from des normally activated carbon is used to purify water in water treatment plants however an hdes was alternatively used to extract ciprofloxacin from water because it imposes fewer environmental or health concerns also the hydrophobic des works on removing specific compounds from aqueous phases without contaminating the water they prepared a series of hydrophobic des using dl menthol tetraheptylammonium bromide n7777 br tetraoctylammonium bromide n8888 br methyltrioctylammonium bromide n8881 br octanoic acid c8 decanoic acid c10 and dodecanoic acid c12 in definite molar ratio c12 c10 is proven to be the best extractor with an efficiency of 87 the first recycle extraction efficiency is found to be 82 which is higher than fresh des for c12 c10 a possible explanation is that activated carbon removed some impurities present in des however overall c12 c10 des shows good efficiency for extracting ciprofloxacin and the ability to recycle is an additional advantage florindo et al 52 53 have also reported using natural hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents as environmentally friendly and cheap extractors of pesticides from aqueous solutions pesticides are a group of compounds used to kill insects to improve agriculture production these compounds are highly toxic and can pass through the soil and subsoil to contaminate quality water processes such as membrane filtration and adsorption are not effective for the removal of pesticides ionic liquids have been proven as effective absorbents of pesticides but their high cost and difficult purification have prevented their industrial use deep eutectic solvents mimic the ionic liquid properties and the low cost and easy preparation make them more favorable than ionic liquids florinda et al demonstrated that the hydrophobic des has removal efficiency higher than 80 for four different types of pesticides which are imidacloprid neonicotinoids nitenpyram and acetamiprid the used dess were dl menthol and n4444cl hba with different molar ratios of acetic acid pyruvic acid levulinic acid butyric acid hexanoic acid octanoic acid decanoic acid dodecanoic acid hbds no relationship between chain length and hydrophobicity was observed in the case of hbds van osch et al 91 reported using hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents for removing metal ions from water the presence of certain metals in water makes it toxic and thus undrinkable to avoid health issues extracting metals from contaminated water is important moreover the extraction of certain metals such as gold and silver can be of economic value the same authors demonstrated that all transition metal ions could be removed with high distribution coefficient values the investigated hydrophobic dess consist of decanoic acid deca and lidocaine lid in a 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 molar ratio the measured distribution coefficient d for the ions of the metal salts cobalt chloride cocl2 nickel chloride nicl2 iron ii chloride fecl2 manganese chloride mncl2 zinc chloride zncl2 copper chloride cucl2 sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl and lithium chloride licl was reported the authors reported that the extraction mechanism occurs via an ion exchange in which all transition metal ions could be extracted with high distribution coefficients even for high co2 concentrations and low mass fractions of des maximum extraction efficiency could be reached within 5 s and regeneration of des was possible by shaking it with sodium oxalate with an equal weight of des for 1 h phenolic compounds are of major concern since they are toxic and inflict severe damage in water due to discharging industrial agricultural and domestic wastewater streams into water bodies and tend to persist in water over a long period sas et al 86 attempted extracting phenolic pollutants from water using des that is based on organic acids such as octanoic acid dodecanoic acid and decanoic acid as hbd and menthol and thymol as hba the targeted phenolic compounds are phenol o cresol and 2 chlorophenol the authors of the aforementioned work demonstrated that des liquid liquid extraction is a suitable method for the extraction of phenolic compounds present in water bodies the extraction efficiency was above 85 for all phenolic compounds used additionally increasing the des hydrophobicity resulted in a lower water phenolic interaction and increased solute extraction efficiency in 2019 florindo et al 30 33 prepared non ionic hdes and ionic hdes composed of dl menthol or quaternary ammonium salts dl menthol tetraoctylammonium bromide n8888 br tetraheptylammonium bromide n7777 br methyltrioctylammonium bromide n8881 br as hba and natural fatty acids octanoic acid c8 decanoic acid c10 as hbd respectively and were applied for the removal of bisphenol a bpa using lle the quaternary ammonium salts based hdes yielded higher extraction efficiency than dl menthol based hdes when compared with hbas and also different hbds due to the more hydrophobic nature of ionic hbas than nonionic hbas hence the higher the extraction efficiencies among different ionic hdes n8888 br c10 can extract almost 100 of bsa from water environments under the optimal conditions bpa 0 1 g l des water ratio 1 1 temperature 25 c and contact time 10 min the des water mass ratio did not have a significant influence on the hdes extraction efficiencies of bpa and only a small quantity of des was needed to treat large volumes of bpa contaminated water recently the bpa extraction efficiency of dl menthol based des with different carboxylic acids in the 1 1 molar ratio was also reported by an et al 87 in this study a series of alcohols n butyl alcohol oleyl alcohol and acids hexanoic acid 1 dodecanol propionic acid decanoic acid acetic acid octanoic acid formic acid were examined as hbd the same authors also reported that dl menthol propionic acid and dl menthol formic acid displayed 98 2 and 99 0 extraction efficiency in 3 min for bpa using 0 75ml of des 4 ml of spiked water and bpa concentration of 100 mg l other important phenolic derivatives such as 3 chlorophenol 3 cp 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 4 dichlorophenol were extracted by hdess menthol thymol 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 des1 des2 des3 des4 menthol hexanoic acid 1 2 des5 menthol octanoic acid 1 2 des6 and menthol decanoic acid 1 2 des 7 from aqueous water by adeyemi et al 92 this is the first reported study on the extraction of 3 chlorophenols and 2 4 dichlorophenols with these seven hdess all synthesized hdes exhibited densities within 0 8 1 6 g cm3 and the viscosities of the menthol based hdess were 30 mpa s the reported lower viscosity of the menthol based hdess could be attributed to the strength of the hydrogen bond network between the hydrogen bond acceptor hba and the hydrogen bond donor hbd the extraction efficiency was above 94 and the extraction of chlorophenols followed the order 3 cp 2 4 dcp 2 cp with des 1 4 and 3 cp 2 cp 2 4 dcp for des 5 7 among the different dess studied des5 showed almost 99 extraction efficiencies for all chlorophenols more precisely the alkanoic acid based hdess exhibited generally higher extraction efficiencies than thymol based hdess this could be ascribed to the fact that alkanoic acids are more polar and possess more hydrogen bond acceptability tendencies than thymol based des this would further enhance the hydrogen bonding between the chlorophenols and the hdess composed of alkanoic acid resulting in higher extraction efficiency riveiro et al 88 reported the extraction of adipic acid levulinic acid and succinic acid using the two hydrophobic trioctylphosphine oxide topo based deep eutectic solvents dess through lle both topo decanoic acid decac and topo dodecanoic acid dodecac were found to be stable in water confirming that these dess can be used as extracting agents of the aforementioned acids in aqueous solutions the viscosity measurements indicated that des exhibit lower densities than water that is 0 8813 g cm3 and 0 8795 g cm3 at 298 15 k for topo decac and topo dodecac respectively the highest extraction efficiency was found to be above 70 for topo dodecac des for 10 g l of acid concentration at room temperature and the extraction capability of dess regarding the structure of the extracted acid is adipic acid levulinic acid succinic acid while when compared with des topo showed extraction efficiency above 97 and followed the order adipicacid succinic acid levulinic acid the better extraction efficiencies with topo over topo des can be attributed to the hydrogen bond interaction between the oxygen of the po group in topo and the oh group of the extracted acid on the other hand these po group is involved in the des formation in topo des and it is not freely available to form hydrogen bonds with the extracted acid which leads to lower efficiency mcgaughy et al 93 studied the liquid liquid extraction lle of furfural from water using n quaternary ammonium bromide ranging from tetramethylammonium n4444 br to tetraoctylammonium n8888 br as hba and decanoic acid and dodecanoic acid as hbd 1 3 using density functional theory dft modeling with experimental validations the cosmotherm modeling and experimental evaluation demonstrated that both hdes can remove furfural from aqueous water even at very low concentrations 0 1 mol these resulted in computational predictions the of lle method between these hdes with above 95 accuracy of experimental results 4 2 2 liquid liquid microextraction liquid liquid microextraction llme liquid phase microextraction lpme or solvent microextraction sme is a miniaturized form of conventional lle in which a few microliters of extraction solvent are used the main advantages of this method are high enrichment factor and low consumption of solvents and aqueous samples 94 recently dess and especially hdes have been successfully applied as extraction solvent that is a less toxic alternative to conventional toxic organic solvents kaur et al 89 synthesized dess by combining chcl and glycolic acid to extract eriochrome black t ebt dye from an aqueous solution using liquid liquid microextraction technique discharged effluent from various industries contains a toxic dye that must be treated before its release to the environment ebt has been identified as one of the most problematic anionic dyes due to its persistence in industrial effluents liquid liquid extraction has been demonstrated as an effective method for dye extraction however it requires a large volume of solvents longer extraction time and requires the use of organic solvents as previously mentioned liquid liquid microextraction is a more effective method for dye extraction since it requires a single drop of solvent and delivers high phase ratio values kaur et al used des as an extracting agent in the microextraction process due to its advantageous properties the combination of chcl and glycolic acid gave good separation performance for various compounds the molar ratio of ga chcl 2 1 gave the highest partition ratio 193 46 indicating a high affinity towards ebt 4 2 3 dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme is a small scale extraction technique that is used to extract small amounts of organic compounds from liquid samples this process is achieved by injecting a dispersive solvent and extraction solvent into the liquid solution afterward the solution is centrifuged to separate the aqueous and organic layers this process was developed for simple and rapid sample preparation for both on site applications and in the laboratory which requires only a manual syringe and a few micrometers of an extractive liquid in 2016 farajzadeh et al 95 are the first to utilize hydrophobic des as an extraction solvent for sample preparation in their study chcl and 4 chlorophenol were mixed at a molar ratio of 1 2 to extract pesticides from vegetables and fruit juice before gas chromatography flame ionization detection acetonitrile was used as a disperser which is miscible with both des and water the authors obtained an enrichment factor in the range of 312 482 and a wide linear range the hydrophobic des was enriched with 6 different types of pesticides indicating that des has potential in microextraction processes water immiscible hydrophobic des can be dispersed into an aqueous solution without a dispersive solvent by using an external physical disturbance such as ultrasound irradiation and air agitation an et al 96 demonstrated a method for the extraction of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp from wastewater by hdes the hdes was constructed by combining decanoic acid or octanoic acid as hbd with different hba of quaternary ammonium salts e g tetrabutylammonium chloride tetraoctylammonium chloride methyltrioctylammonium chloride and tetraheptylammonium chloride in a 1 2 molar ratio 1 ml of 1 Œºg ml standard solutions of 4 cp 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp was added to a 10 ml tube and then 100 Œºl of the hdes was added to the mixture this resulting 10 Œºl of the upper layer of the hdes phase containing the chlorophenol targets was directly analyzed using the hplc method fig 9 the hdes composed of methyltrioctylammonium chloride and octanoic acid hdes showed 90 8 to 93 0 recoveries for three chlorophenols with optimized conditions 100 Œºl of hdes 2 5 min extraction time room temperature the limits of detection were 0 05 Œºg ml with relative standard deviations between 1 8 and 3 1 and satisfactory extraction factors of 8 26 to 8 69 demonstrating the feasibility of this hydrophobic des based dllme method liu et al 98 utilized hdes for the extraction of five Œ≤ agonists including terbutaline clorprenaline tulobuterol clenbuterol and salbutamol from aqueous samples via the dllme method the methyltrioctylammonium chloride tac tetrabutylammonium chloride tbac and dodecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride dtac served as hba and decanoic acid octanoic acid and lauric acid as hbd in the synthesis of des in a molar ratio of 1 2 respectively in this work the hdes based on tbac octanoic acid showed high extraction efficiency of Œ≤ agonists from aqueous samples the optimized conditions are hdes 500 Œºl disperser volume 1000 Œºl and nacl 2 samples were analyzed using chiral lc ms analysis sadeghi et al 99 studied the thorium extraction using the dllme method for preconcentration of th iv in water and rock samples before uv vis spectrophotometric detection in this method thorin was used as a chelating agent cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as an ion pairing agent 1 hexyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide and 1 butyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide as hbas and salicylic acid and benzoic acid as hbds the hdes based on 1 hexyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide and salicylic acid 1 1 molar ratio under the optimal conditions such as ph 3 2 sample volume 10 ml th iv 250 ng ml 1 thorin 60 Œºm ctab 50 Œºm hdes 170 Œºl showed the best extraction efficiency the developed method was reported to be green facile fast selective and sensitive which could detect th iv in the concentration range of 10 600 ng ml 1 with 2 1 ng ml 1 a limit of detection lod and preconcentration factor as 59 and relative standard deviation was 1 7 of five replicate measurements of th iv at 100 ng ml 1 nacs are highly toxic compounds present in the effluent wastewater from the tnt purification process the united states environmental protection agency us epa has listed these compounds as one of the 127 important pollutants in 2017 zarei et al 100 used a novel method for the preconcentration and determination of nitroaromatic compounds nacs in water based on the dispersive solid phase extraction dspe technique this approach is based on the dispersion of a solid sorbent in liquid samples to extract a specific analyte and is easier to perform and more economic than typical solid phase extraction introducing magnetic nanoparticles to dspe facilitates the removal of the sorbent however nanoparticles do not disperse effectively without the use of external sources also introducing nanoparticles in the nanofluid or colloidal gels form to the solution can increase the dispersion effectively moreover colloidal gels are easily prepared by dispersing nanoparticles in a hot base fluid in the same study 100 a thermally stable and magnetic colloidal gel made of multi wall carbon nanotubes and urea chcl was prepared and utilized in the dspe process for the enrichment of nacs in water the method achieved recovery values as high as 90 110 enrichment factors of 267 to 415 and a wider linear range than other common analytical approaches 4 2 4 ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme method associated with ultrasound irradiation ua dllme is attracting research interest as this method can improve the generation of droplets with and without dispersive solvents in this modified method organic solvent and a liquid dispersant mixture are added to the sample matrix resulting in the dispersion of the organic solvent which leads to the formation of solvent droplets after centrifugation the organic phase contains droplets of the organic solvent that are removed with the analyte using a micro syringe the organic solvent which was dispersed in the sample matrix in the presence of ultrasound irradiation facilitates the rapid formation of a steady state between both organic and aqueous phases by increasing the surface of analyte transfer thus accelerating the extraction process 101 panhwar et al 102 carried out a study on using des as an extracting solvent to determine the concentration and enrichment of aluminum ions al3 in water samples via ultrasound assisted phase microextraction method aluminum is a toxic element that causes neuropathological diseases if consumed the world health organization who has defined a maximum level of 200 Œºg l 1 in drinking water many reports are published on using organic solvents to extract aluminum ions via the liquid liquid extraction method however this method on a large scale is time consuming environmentally unfriendly and expensive liquid liquid microextraction has been recently found to overcome liquid liquid extraction drawbacks in addition utilizing des in the microextraction process lowers organic solvent discharge panhwar et al 102 reported synthesizing des by combining chcl and phenol oxalic acid and urea hbd at different molar ratios using ultrasound assisted liquid phase microextraction method ualpme for the extraction of aluminum a pre enrichment factor of 50 was observed which was measured from the ratio of the slopes of the calibration curves with and without des quantitative recoveries reached above 95 in the model studies for al3 this method is better than other established methods because of its simplicity and low cost makos et al 103 used novel hydrophobic des in ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction for the isolation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah analytes from industrial effluents the purpose of the study was to obtain an easy and sensitive method for monitoring pahs during wastewater treatment processes the des was prepared by combining thymol th with camphor c and thymol with 10 undecylenic acid ua and deca the determination of analytes in des was carried out by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms in contrast with ionic liquids the nonionic nature of the selected des and the volatility of its components allow its use in gas chromatography analysis in addition its easy synthesis and nontoxicity are a good alternative to toxic chlorinated solvents the results show low limits of detection and quantitation good precision rsd 6 a wide linear range and an analyte recovery range from 76 to 126 5 a total of 16 pahs with concentrations ranging from 0 12 to 46 2 Œºg l 1 were determined in the effluent indicating the need for an effective treatment method this study illustrates the efficiency of des as a liquid liquid micro extractant zounr et al 104 demonstrated the ua lpme method for the extraction of cadmium in water and food samples using des in this study z n 3 5 diphenyl 1h pyrrol 2 yl 3 5 diphenyl 2h pyrrol 2 imine azo was used as a complexing agent for cadmium and was analyzed using the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry etaas dess based on chcl as hba and urea oxalic acid lactic acid and eg as hbd in the molar ratio of 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 respectively were used the chcl phenol 1 4 showed 95 maximum extraction efficiency with 0 5 ml des ph of 6 400 Œºl of complexing reagent and 3 min of ultrasonication time the developed method showed excellent accuracy improved precision and adequate recovery hence presenting advantages for the analysis of complex matrices such as food and water samples the chcl phenol dess in 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 mol ratios respectively were applied by kanberoglu et al 105 in the extraction of patent blue v from syrup and water samples using an ultrasound assisted emulsification liquid phase microextraction method ua elpme the uv visible spectrophotometry studies indicated that the extraction efficiency of chcl phenol 1 4 des was above 95 for patent blue v when 500 Œºl of thf as an emulsifier agent an aqueous of ph of 4 and 3 min ultrasonication were added and applied to 10 ml of a model solution containing 5 10 7 m patent blue v wang et al 106 examined the use of trioctylmethylammonium chloride tac and decanoic acid deca based hdes in 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 5 molar ratios for the removal of uv filters from the spiked swimming pool and river water samples via ua dllme followed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis the model analytes used as uv filters were 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 benzophenone bp and 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 3 the relative recoveries of the target analytes ranged from 83 6 to 105 0 for the swimming pool water and from 82 1 to 106 5 for the river water under the conditions of 0 03 g des 1 3 8 ml of sample solution and 80 mg of nacl in addition the proposed method provided acceptable recoveries 90 2 103 5 good repeatability rsd 5 9 and a wide linear range 0 5 500 ng ml 1 werner 107 synthesized the des based on trihexyl tetradecyl phosphonium chloride as a hba with decanol or dodecanol as the hbd at molar ratios of 1 1 1 2 1 3 hba hbd for the extraction of a set of aromatic amines such as 2 chloroaniline 4 chloroaniline and 1 naphthylamine using a ua dllme method the optimized experimental conditions were 10 ng ml 1 for 2 chloroaniline and 4 chloroaniline and 20 ng ml 1 for 1 naphthylamine at a ph of 12 using 40 Œºl of des and 60 s ultrasonic irradiation the des composition of 1 2 hba hbd showed good spike recoveries in the range of 85 1 99 9 and was recommended for the determination of aromatic amines in aqueous environmental samples 4 2 5 vortex assisted liquid liquid microextraction in 2010 yiantzi et al 108 introduced vortex assisted liquid liquid microextraction vallme a new microextraction method whereby vortex mixing was used for dispersion of low density extraction solvent into water because of the shorter diffusion distance and larger interfacial area the fine droplets can rapidly extract target analytes from water in contrast to other microextraction methods vortex agitation is a low cost and effective way to break and disperse extracting solvent droplets into the aqueous sample the main advantages of this method are the generation of fine droplets which enhances the interfacial area available for mass transfer emulsion formation could proceed without adding a disperser solvent this in return reduces the diffusion distance and improves the extraction rates enabling the analytes to reach partition equilibrium within a fast time the easy operational method and fast extraction resulted in the widespread application of vallme for the determination of a wide range of target analytes in aqueous solutions 109 tang et al 110 111 employed des in liquid liquid microextraction process to extract antibiotics from environmental water using vortex assisted method the antibiotics in environmental water targeted are ciprofloxacin cof and levofloxacin lof the authors of the aforementioned work demonstrated that a fatty acid based des is a good alternative to organic solvents in the microextraction process a total of 16 hydrophobic dess were tested and the results show that 1 octanol tricaprylyl methylammonium chloride based des has the best extraction efficiency using the vortex assisted method the extraction efficiency of both cof and lof was above 94 8 in addition this method gives an acceptable limit of both detection and quantitation good linearity and high precision thus this method has the potential to replace organic solvents for the microextraction of antibiotics recently faraji 112 introduced the des for the extraction of two auxins indole 3 acetic acid iaa and 1 naphthaleneacetic acid naa in water and fruit juice samples and determination by high performance liquid chromatography the authors reported four hdess namely benzyltriethylammonium chloride bteac thymol trioctylmethylammonium chloride tomac butanol tomac isoamyl alcohol tomac octanol in a 1 4 molar ratio the experimental results showed that tomac isoamyl alcohol showed a high extraction recovery 94 0 99 8 for the target compounds the main advantages of the proposed method are simplicity good linearity high precision good sensitivity rapidity and low cost in another study by altunay et al 113 introduced the des based vallme for the extraction of arsenic and antimony from the sample matrix in their study chcl tetrabutyl ammonium chloride and trioctyl ammonium chloride were used as hba while phenol glycerol decanoic acid oxalic acid were applied as hbd in the 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 molar ratio respectively the dithizone was selected as the ph dependent selective ligand in the extraction process and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry was used for detecting as iii and sb iii concentration compared with the prepared des the 700 Œºl chcl oa 1 3 showed the best recovery of 87 because the oa acted as both a reducing and chelating agent or stabilizer for as iii and sb iii with a limit of detection of 7 5 ng l 1 and 15 6 ng l 1 and enhancement factors of 104 and 85 for as and sb respectively dess based on trioctylmethylammonium chloride and methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate be and isobutyl 4 hydroxybenzoate 1 1 were used for the extraction of cr vi from the water phase 114 using vallme the content of cr vi was measured by 1 5 diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometry the results showed that the extraction efficiency is 90 for ultra trace cr vi 0 51 Œºg l 1 and the preconcentration factor is up to 700 the extraction efficiency of cr iv in the presence of coexisting metal ions cd2 cu2 and organic compounds c6h10o5 n c6h12o6 h2o was also analyzed and found to be 2000 times that of cr vi the extraction efficiency is still above 90 114 4 2 6 shaker assisted liquid liquid microextraction in shaker assisted liquid liquid microextraction sallme method the device automatically mixes samples with a water immiscible extraction solvent through vigorous shaking well mixing of extraction solvent and the samples occurs 115 the extraction procedure can be easily implemented furthermore it is an innovative physical strategy that can rapidly eliminate the disperser solvent or surfactants in addition to saving time 116 li et al 117 119 utilized thymol based hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents for the extraction of antibiotics analysis in surface water by llme method coupling with shaker assisted method the hdes comprising thymol and heptanoic acid ha 2 1 exhibited the highest extraction efficiency for ofloxacin norfloxacin ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin using 100 Œºl of hdes in 10 ml of the aqueous sample with an incubation temperature of 52 c for 5 min the extracted antibiotics were analyzed using liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection analysis the proposed method showed good linearity in the 15 3000 ng ml 1 concentration range with a limit of detection of 3 0 ng ml 1 and a limit of quantification of 9 0 ng ml 1 with an accuracy of 84 1 113 65 sallme method combined with back extraction sallme be was employed by ahmadi et al 120 for the extraction of methylene blue mb using a des the 40 Œºl of methyltrioctylammonium bromide decanoic acid 1 2 des was used for the 10 ml of mb 50 ng ml 1 solution containing naoh 0 5 m this approach was employed for the extraction of mb from an alkaline solution and for its back extraction into an acidic aqueous solution the interference effects of cations such as fe2 fe3 cu2 ba2 ce2 co2 hg2 cd2 ni2 mn2 ca2 mg2 and ag and dyes such as rhodamine b ponceau s and nile blue were also investigated for mb 50 ng ml 1 among the tested cations mn2 ca2 and mg2 were the interfering ions and none of the tested dyes affected mb absorption for the back extraction step 70 Œºl of a solution containing hcl 2 m and ethanol 50 20 was used and was found effective in increasing the selectivity and calibration range of the method and lowering the limit of detection 4 2 7 air assisted liquid liquid microextraction air assisted liquid liquid microextraction aallme is a recently modified disperser solvent free approach of dllme in which the extraction solvent is dispersed into the aqueous phase with the help of air bubbles 116 in this method fine droplets of extraction solvent are formed by pulling in and pushing out the extraction solvent and sample mixture repeatedly using a syringe thus making the methods greener by avoiding the disperser solvent the hdes based on chcl and phenethyl alcohol ph etoh 1 4 was utilized at the service of air agitated emulsification microextraction for amphetamine type stimulants amphetamine and methamphetamine in human plasma and pharmaceutical wastewater 121 des was easily practicable due to low density via a homemade extraction cell without an extra emulsifier the procedure provides a relatively low lod 2 5 ng ml 1 value and good repeatability under 250 Œºl of des at ph 12 with air agitation cycles of 8 the method is characterized by a relatively low extraction recovery of analytes 63 66 with a df value close to 0 98 in another study ge et al 122 investigated the application of hdes for the preconcentration of benzophenone type uv filters from environmental water samples using aallme the dl menthol tbab and tbac were selected as hba and were combined with three straight chain monobasic acids namely octanoic acid decanoic acid and dodecanoic acid as hbd the corresponding dess were synthesized in the molar ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 the dl menthol and decanoic acid 1 1 des based aadllme approach showed potential for use in the analysis of trace bp type uv filters 2 2 4 4 tetrahydroxybenzophenone bp 2 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone bp 3 2 2 dihydroxy 4 4 dimethoxybenzophenone bp 6 and 4 hydroxybenzophenone 4oh bp in liquid samples the main outcome of this study is the rapid formation of fine droplets of the extraction solvent in the aqueous solution with the help of air assisted method without using a disperser solvent the extraction equilibrium was attained in a short period 1 min and exhibited good analytical features low lods short extraction time and good repeatability however to increase the dispersion efficiency of the extracting solvent several researchers tried the dispersing agent along with the air assisted method in aallme recently zounr et al 123 developed a simple and green des based aallme method for the separation and determination of lead in water and food samples in their study the chcl phenol chcl ph was applied as des and 4 2 thiazolylazo resorcinol as a complexing agent for lead ions 600 Œºl of des 1 4 as hydrophilic extraction solvent was added to an aqueous solution containing 30 ml 25 ng l of pb ii and 500 Œºl of 4 2 thiazolylazo resorcinol 0 1 w v at ph 6 then 800 Œºl of thf was added and mixed into a homogenous solution upon the addition of thf a turbid solution was achieved this is because thf was used as a demulsifying solvent which interacts with water and eases extraction the concentration of lead was analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaas the authors claimed that the proposed procedure has good selectivity for pb ii in the presence of other interfering ions and almost 100 recoveries were obtained with low detection limit low relative standard deviation and high preconcentration factor compared with other reported works thus this work was simple efficient less expensive rapid less toxic and has better extraction efficiency of targeted metal ions similar work was done by lamei et al 124 for the extraction of methadone from water and biological samples using chcl and 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 5 5 8 8 tetramethylnaphthalen 2 ol tno in 1 2 des in this procedure des droplets were dispersed in the sample solution by air assisted method and tetrahydrofuran was used as a demulsifier solvent into a homogeneous solution for providing a turbid state the 10 ml glass syringe was used and hdes was injected 10 times to enhance the turbidity of the solution and disperse the aggregated des droplets into an aqueous phase the appropriate recovery for methadone from water and biological samples was 98 4 101 2 with a limit of detection 7 0 Œºg l 1 and a limit of quantification 3 2 Œºg l 1 4 2 8 emulsification liquid liquid microextraction in emulsification liquid liquid microextraction method ellme an emulsifier is used for the dispersion of extraction solvent in aqueous media thus the procedure needs no external sources such as ultrasound irradiation or shaker the main problem is the toxicity of the emulsifier ellme based des is a simple inexpensive green and rapid method and based on self aggregation and emulsification of dess in water phase medium khezeli et al 125 have also tested the microextraction of benzene toluene ethylbenzene bte and seven polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from water samples using dess as water miscible extraction solvent three different dess were prepared by combining phenol and chcl in 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 molar ratios the dess were separated from aqueous solution by adding aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran thf acetone or 1 4 dioxane or after extraction by des the two phases were separated by centrifugation phase rich with des was withdrawn using a micro syringe and submitted to isocratic reverse phase hplc with uv detection results demonstrate that this method is successful for the determination of target analytes in water the concentration of benzene in des was in the range of 10 to 200 Œºg l 1 0 1 400 Œºg l 1 for anthracene benzo a pyrene phenanthrene and pyrene 1 400 Œºg l 1 for ethylbenzene biphenyl chrysene and fluorene and 10 400 Œºg l 1 for toluene yang et al 126 127 developed a method for determining the concentration of phenolic compounds in a large volume of water using acid based des via microextraction technique this is the first report on the use of des in a large volume of aqueous samples to extract phenolic compounds authors prepared a range of fatty acids n octanoic acid c8 1 nonanoic acid c9 dodecanoic acid c12 that can act as both hbds and hbas for the synthesis of hydrophobic des properties were adjusted by altering the molar ratio and fatty acid type water containing phenol with a volume of 1000 ml was then prepared and a selected des was added to the solution an emulsifying agent nh3 h2o was added to the mixture to form an emulsion the gas assisted mixing was then used to separate the two phases the fast gas transfer rate increases the distribution ratio between the two phases giving excellent mixing for large water volume the authors selected n2 for the gas mixing process since the hydroxyl group on its surface makes it prone to capture the des phase in the mixture the experimental process is shown in fig 10 phenolic compounds are recovered by adding hcl to the emulsion phase results show that the volume of the emulsifying agent and des can significantly affect the extraction efficiency while sample volume does not affect the extraction efficiency ternary dess c8 c9 c12 with a molar ratio of 3 2 1 gave the highest extraction efficiency 91 0 of phenolic compounds 400 Œºl of nh3 h2o and 2000 Œºl of des gave the highest extraction efficiency 4 2 9 hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction the hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction hflpme method was first developed by pedersen bjergaard and rasmussen 128 in which a low cost and disposable piece of a porous polypropylene hollow fiber is used in this method the hollow fiber is placed in the sample and then the membrane phase is formed by immobilizing organic solvent in the pores of the hollow fiber afterwards the internal lumen of the hollow fiber is filled with an acceptor solution the analytes are extracted from the aqueous samples into the membrane phase and then into the acceptor solution generally a two phase or three phase configuration can be used in hflpme in a two phase configuration the acceptor phase is the same as the organic solvent used in the liquid membrane while in the three phase configuration a three phase extraction system can be obtained by using the acceptor solution as an aqueous solution seidi et al 129 considered the introduction of chcl eg 1 1 based des as the acceptor phase in a three phase carrier mediated hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction cm hflpme for the preconcentration of raloxifene and ethinylestradiol in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants combined with hplc uv analysis central composite design ccd and response surface methodology rsm were applied for optimization of the experimental parameters on the extraction of the target analytes by this proposed method the raloxifene and ethinylestradiol analytes were extracted from 17 ml basic solution as the supported liquid membrane n octanol containing n n n cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab and then back extracted into the acceptor phase des and hcl the important experimental factors including sample extraction time ph hcl concentration and ctab amount were optimized using a central composite design ccd the preconcentration factors of raloxifene and ethinylestradiol were found to be 86 and 53 and the limits of detections lods were found to be 5 0 ng ml 1 for raloxifene and 10 ng ml 1 for ethinylestradiol respectively morelli et al 130 used the thymol camphor 1 1 des as an extraction solvent for hollow fiber microporous membrane liquid liquid microextraction hf mmlle for the multiclass determination of 11 compounds classified as emerging contaminants in water to replace the common toxic organic solvents the thymol camphor mixture was impregnated into the polypropylene membrane pores for 10 min the optimized parameters were obtained by multi and univariate models and extractions were done using 1 5 ml of water sample at ph 6 for 50 min without the addition of salt while desorption was carried out in a mixture of acetone methanol 3 1 v v for 15 min the quantification was conducted by hplc with a diode array detection dad relative recoveries were performed in tap and stream water and ranged from 64 to 123 with limits of detection ranging from 0 3 to 6 1 Œºg l 1 4 2 10 solidification of floating drop dispersive liquid liquid microextraction leung et al 200 2008 introduced a new method of dispersion liquid liquid microextraction based on solidifying floating organic droplets dllme sfo in this method solvents with a lower density of water are applied as a liquid extractor at room temperature and the extraction is the basis of the classic dllme that is an extraction solvent together with a dispersion solvent immiscible with the sample solution and the extraction solvent with only the exception that the extractor solvent solidifies at relatively high temperatures and therefore this makes its separation is easy 131 the hdess that are lighter than water were successfully applied for the extraction of organic and inorganic compounds from aqueous samples in dllme sfo for these purposes the hdes based on 1 octyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride omim cl 1 octyl 2 3 dimethylimidazolium chloride odmim cl 1 decyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride dmim cl 1 decyl 2 3 dimethylimidazolium chloride ddmim cl and 1 dodecyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride c12mim cl as hba and 1 dodecanol as hbd was used as an extraction solvent based on the sfd dllme coupled with high performance liquid chromatography for the determination of five benzoylureas diflubenzuron triflumuron hexaflumuron flufenoxuron and lufenuron in real water samples 132 40 Œºl of 1 decyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride c10mim cl and 1 dodecoh 1 2 showed approximately 81 38 97 67 recoveries for all five benzoylureas with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 9994 to 0 9997 the limits of detection 0 09 0 16 Œºg l 1 and the enrichment factors were in the range of 171 188 a novel dllme sfo method was developed by el deen et al 133 using tetrabutylammonium bromide as hba and a set of aliphatic acids formic acid acetic acid and propionic acid and ethylene glycol eg as hbd based des 1 2 as a dispersive solvent and 2 dodecanol as an extractant for series of steroids in this method very small quantity of 2 dodecanol 50 0 Œºl and des 231 0 Œºl were required in the whole extraction procedure for steroids this method revealed correlation coefficients of 0 998 with low detection limits in the range of 1 0 9 7 ng ml 1 and high inter and intra day precision 5 with high preconcentration factors 44 112 for the nine concerning steroids moreover the method was successfully applied to determine the concerned steroids in different real aqueous samples with an expanded measurement uncertainty of the results 17 at a 95 confidence level mostafavi et al 134 applied the theoretical studies using the same method for the extraction of selenium from water samples using hdes benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and 1 undecanol 1 dodecanol 2 dodecanol n hexadecane and 1 decanol in different molar ratios combined with uv vis spectrophotometry the analytical signal was linear in the range of 2 0 100 0 Œºg l 1 satisfactory recoveries 95 0 104 9 and limit of detection and limit of quantitation were obtained at the concentration of 0 76 and 1 92 Œºg l 1 respectively in another study yousefi et al 135 demonstrated the application of hdes tetra n butyl ammonium bromide tbab and carboxylic acids oleic acid decanoic acid octanoic acid propionic acid acrylic acid acetic acid and butyric acid 1 2 for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons naphthalene 99 0 fluorene 98 0 phenanthrene 99 5 anthracene 99 0 fluoranthene 98 0 and pyrene using microextraction methods based on solidification of floating drop method from environmental water samples by coupling this method with high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection 80 Œºl of the tbab decanoic acid des as the extraction solvent for the 20 ml of sample solution displayed 83 to 117 recovery with good linearity and low limits of detection of 0 7 6 6 ng l 1 4 2 11 reactive liquid liquid extraction method reactive liquid liquid extraction method rlle is a promising method for the recovery of carboxylic acids from water samples generally in this method a reaction between the solute and extractant molecules occurs at the interface of the aqueous and organic phases in which the transfer of the solute molecules occurs by the diffusion and solubilization mechanism the nonaromatic water immiscible polar solvents with intermediate molecular weights and high boiling points are commonly utilized as extractant solvents to obtain high distribution and selectivity the extraction of solute strongly depends on the organic phase composition aqueous phase composition types of complexes 1 1 2 1 etc formed type of solvent properties of the solvent extractant and diluent temperature and ph 137 toprak√ßƒ± et al 138 applied reactive liquid liquid extraction rlle for the removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d from aqueous solution using menthol carboxylic acid based dess the best 2 4 d removal was obtained by menthol formic acid 1 2 molar ratio by almost 2 3 times than other synthesized des that is 90 of 2 4 d were extracted by the recommended method with the designed solvent thermodynamics studies showed that the transfer of 2 4 d from the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic des phase is a spontaneous and endothermic process hence driven by entropy the same dess menthol and carboxylic acids acetic acid and formic acid 1 1 and 1 2 were used for the extraction of carbamazepine by pekel et al in rllle 139 the deep eutectic liquid was used as the extractant while diethyl succinate acted as a diluent in their work 138 the authors proposed menthol acetic acid 1 1 des as the best extractant as it enhanced the extraction performance approximately 5 9 times that of conventional diethyl succinate more than 90 of the target pharmaceutical compound was extracted from its aqueous solution in 30 min based on thermodynamics studies the transfer process of carbamazepine from the aqueous phase into the hydrophobic phase is endothermic and spontaneous in nature another study by kurtulba≈ü et al 140 reported on using menthol acetic acid des for the extraction of diclofenac from its aqueous medium was investigated by rlle the removal of diclofenac was found to be 80 through the proposed des and diethyl succinate system similar to the above works thermodynamics of the diclofenac transfer from the aqueous environment to the organic phase containing des was observed to be a spontaneous and endothermic process which is incentivized by entropy 4 2 12 single drop microextraction single drop microextraction sdme is one of the simplest and most powerful variants of the preconcentration liquid phase microextraction technique there are two different extraction modes those involving two liquid phases sample extraction from an aqueous sample solution to an organic solvent or three phases extraction from the aqueous sample solution to an organic solvent and then a subsequent transfer to an aqueous drop back extraction 110 111 sdme generally need a common micro syringe with no need for non dependence on sophisticated apparatus or tools with which to conduct it the sdme technique has extended to direct immersion di mode and the headspace hs mode in di mode the droplet is directly immersed in the sample and the main disadvantage of di sdme is the stability of the droplet which depend on the used organic solvent in hs mode it avoids the possible interferences from the sample matrix and has been widely used in the extraction of the more volatile compounds the application of des in the di sdme technique is not explored yet however the only reported study with hdes is the use of dl menthol deca 1 2 based des for the extraction and preconcentration of explosives in water coupled with ferrofluid of montmorillonite nanocomposite mmt fe3o4 des without using any additional stabilizer 141 in this method a micro droplet of ferrofluid des was suspended into the vortex of a stirring aqueous solution collected from the well and surface water near the explosive manufacturing site and after completing the extraction process ferrofluid des was easily removed from the aqueous solution by a magnetic rod the relative recoveries for explosives are in the range of 88 to 104 for 50 Œºl ferrofluid des and 10 ml of sample solution the limits of detection 0 22 0 91 Œºg l 1 the enrichment factors 23 and 93 and the relative standard deviations were 10 showed the potential application of hydrophobic ferrofluid for the extraction of emerging materials in the wastewater yousefi et al 136 reported the hdes composed of chcl as hba with phenol chlorophenol and resorcinol as hbd 1 2 combined with magnetic multiwall carbon nanotube nanocomposite des mbg applied for the determination of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene in water and urine samples using hs sdme technique in this method the 30 ml of sample solution 50 Œºg l 1 in 20 nacl w v were used and 20 Œºl of the des mbg micro drop with rod magnet as an acceptor phase for the extraction procedure after extraction at room 30 c an external magnet was used for isolating des mbg from the solution the limit of detection of 0 05 0 90 ng ml 1 an enrichment factor of 520 587 linearity range of 0 2 2000 ng ml 1 and the relative recoveries 92 0 105 3 proved that coupling des mbgs with hs sdme can result in a powerful fast and facile method for the trace analysis of volatile compounds in water samples 4 3 des as a surface modifier 4 3 1 solid phase extraction the solid phase extraction spe is similar to liquid solid extraction the isolation and separation of analytes from a liquid is done using a solid adsorbent in this method spe columns packed with small quantities of various chromatographic sorbents such as silica florisil or alumina are used for normal phase separations while nonpolar bonded silica phases or polymers are used for reversed phase separations in comparison with liquid liquid extraction spe is easy requires less solvent has no emulsions formation needs smaller sample volumes and it is much more amenable to automation however the main limitation of spe is the low selectivity and adsorption capacity because the adsorption of analytes is mainly based on the chemical nature of adsorbents that is the adhesion of atoms ions or molecules from a liquid or a gas to a surface organic solvents are conventionally used as functionalizing agents to enhance the surface charge of adsorbents and increase the adsorption capacity for a variety of contaminants 142 although organic solvents are efficient functionalizes they are hazardous and are considered air pollutants 143 deep eutectic solvents can be used instead as functionalizing agents for adsorbents and give a similar increase of the adsorption capacity without any negative environmental impact in addition the lower cost and simple preparation make them more favorable since 2015 various studies have reported using hydrophobic des as functionalizing agent for carbon nanotubes to adsorb various contaminants from water carbon nanotubes exhibit excellent adsorption properties for a wide range of impurities in water such as lead and mercury but oxidative functionalizing is normally used to enhance its properties which requires the use of organic solvents utilizing dess as surface functionalizing agents can give a similar increase in the charge of carbon nanotubes surfaces without any offsets alomar and coworkers 144 were the first to use dess in functionalizing adsorbents the authors functionalized carbon nanotubes using des for the adsorption of hg2 ions from water mercury is a toxic element that is present in freshwater seawater and the waste streams of many industries when mercury concentration exceeds 1 Œºl l in water it becomes dangerous to consume even at such low concentration levels there are several conventional techniques to remove mercury ions from water such as ion exchange and filtration but alomar et al 144 145 reported that adsorption has been proven as the most suitable for industrial scale carbon nanotubes cnts were used as effective adsorbents for mercury from water samples while the functionalization with a des prepared from tetra n butyl ammonium bromide tbab as hba and gly as hbd served to enhance the surface charge of the cnts the modified materials showed a great affinity towards different compounds including hg2 ions the adsorption capacity of the material for hg2 ions was found to be 177 76 mg g which agreed with the published data in addition functionalizing cnts with the des increased surface area significantly from 123 54 m2 g to 204 52 m2 g which explains the increased adsorption capacity alomar et al 145 have also reported using allyl bromide atpb based des functionalized carbon nanotubes for the removal of mercury from water allyl triphenylphosphonium bromide was combined with gly as the hbd to form des which can act as a novel cnts functionalization agent response surface methodology was used to optimize the removal conditions for hg2 the optimum removal conditions were found to be ph 5 5 contact time of 28 min and an adsorbent dosage of 5 mg the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the experimental data was 186 97 mg g which is higher than that of tbab with gly reported by the same authors another study by alomar et al 146 reported using functionalized carbon nanotube with des to extract arsenic ions from water cnts have shown a great affinity for interaction with arsenic ions especially after surface functionalization two dess were tested for surface functionalization methyltri phenylphosphonium bromide mtpb and benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride btpc salts as hba in combination with gly as an hbd optimization studies were carried out utilizing rsm ccd experimental designs to estimate the optimum removal conditions for each adsorbent the adsorption experimental data of the two adsorbents was found to fit well with the pseudo second order kinetics the freundlich and the langmuir adsorption isotherm models results show that the surface charge increased drastically after functionalizing and the maximum capacity obtained was 23 4 mg g with mtpb as salt lead can enter plumbing water if the pipes contain lead corrode exposure to lead results in serious health consequences even at low concentrations because of this the epa has set the maximum contamination limit at zero 148 alomar et al 147 have also synthesized six various deep eutectic solvents for carbon nanotubes to absorb lead ions pb ii from water the solvents were based on chcl and with different hbds namely gly eg diethylene glycol deg triethylene glycol teg urea and malonic acid ma studies for over 24 different des cnt have been conducted and the removal capacity has been optimized using rsm ccd experimental design in addition an optimization study was performed to find the ideal conditions for pb ii sorption onto the novel adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 288 4 mg g using cnts functionalized with kmno4 and teg based des kteg cnts the optimum conditions were ph 5 adsorbent dosage of 5 mg l and contact time of 15 min ibrahim et al 149 150 used functionalized carbon nanotubes with deep eutectic solvents to adsorb methyl orange mo from an aqueous solution methyl orange is an example of a toxic azo dye that is discharged into water by various industries such as pharmaceutical and paper industries several methods have been reported for azo dyes like electrochemical treatment and reverse osmosis however the adsorption technique is more cost efficient and advantageous than other techniques it has low energy requirements and its operational design is simple ibrahim et al prepared two deep eutectic solvents dess using eg and two different ammonium based salts which are chcl and n n diethylethanolammonium chloride dac the surface area of carbon nanotubes has reached 197 8 m2 g by adding des functional groups to the surface of carbon nanotubes no damage to the surface of carbon nanotubes has been reported after functionalization the adsorption conditions have also been optimized with removal conditions at ph 2 0 adsorbent dosage of 10 0 mg and contact time around 60 min the maximum adsorption capacity has reached 310 2 mg g and 263 14 mg g for chcl eg cnt and dac eg cnt respectively gissawong et al 151 developed tetrabutylammonium bromide tbabr and various fatty acids heptanoic acid decanoic acid and 4 phenylbutyric acid based des in different molar ratios and these des embedded in the melamine the des embedded sponge for the removal of acid blue 29 ab29 malachite green mg disperse yellow 3 dy3 disperse orange 25 do25 congo red cr acid red 73 ar73 rhodamine b rb basic black 2 bb2 acid black 24 ab24 basic blue 12 bb12 and reichardt s dye from water samples and soil in this study the melamine sponge helped in the phase separation of des from the aqueous solution and also enhanced the removal of the target pollutants by their adsorption into its pores the strong hydrophobic interaction between target pollutants and des was responsible for the enhanced removal the authors concluded that the proposed method was simple rapid environmentally friendly and effective with the removal efficiency higher than 65 for all target pollutants mehrabi et al 177 hypothesized the surface functionalization of go with chcl urea here dess can provide a new route to conjugate pre synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles onto go nanosheets at different go fe3o4 ratios des go fe3o4 nanohybrids synergistically enhanced adsorption than both go and fe3o4 as adsorbents for organic dyes methylene blue mb and heavy metals lead ii however the adsorption behavior was dependent on the ratio of go and fe3o4 in the nanohybrid the des go fe3o4 1 2 0 3 mg ml showed a 100 mb removal performance for 25 mg l mb within 5 min and the des go fe3o4 1 1 showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 120 5 1 3 mg g for lead ii at initial analyte concentration of 150 mg l marullo et al 152 used the eutectogels as nanostructured sorbents for the removal of cationic dyes methyl violet mv rhodamine b and methylene blue from water the authors prepared natural eutectogels based on the chcl eg gly phenylacetic acid 1 2 des with a series of l amino acids l proline l tryptophan l isoleucine l leucine l phenylalanine fmoc lphenylalanine fmoc l isoleucine the best efficiency was observed towards acidic solutions in which the gels performed better than the des itself the best performing eutectogel was based on l phenylalanine giving a better removal efficiency for dyes in single dye solution as well as binary mixtures owing to its larger surface area and good recyclability in addition the gel can be used in columns for the removal of mv dye from flowing water with a removal efficiency of 85 the gel loaded columns can be reused four times with only a minor drop in relative recovery percentage the result obtained demonstrates good potential for the scale up of the process authors claimed that the main advantages of eutectogels are their low environmentally impacting nature and their recycling does not require intermediate washing which leads to decreasing the amount of waste derived from the whole process lawal et al 153 154 illustrated the application of glycerol hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide 1 2 des as an efficient modifier of low cost adsorbent prepared from biomass hyd des for the removal of pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin cip and acetaminophen acte and acid blue 74 ab74 they have studied the column adsorption capacity effect of pollutant concentration and effect of flow rate were studied using thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart model furthermore batch adsorption experiments were performed to study the effect of effect ph time dose and concentration the almost 100 adsorptive ability of hyd des on the pollutants is in the order ab74 cip acte probably due to multiple mechanisms through weak van der waal forces and electrostatic interactions the kinetic studies showed that ab74 cip and acte followed the pseudo second order the same group of authors 153 154 also synthesized des functionalized cnt znco2o4 des nanoparticles for the adsorption of eosin y they selected des that consists of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and glycerol 1 2 due to its already reported high adsorption capacity the percentage removal of 30 ml 100 mg l 1 dye solution was 40 for cnt znco2o4 0 02 g and above 90 for cnt zn co2o4 des 0 02 g these results indicate that the sorption efficiency of des modified cnt zn co2o4 is far better than the unmodified cnt zn co2o4 kinetic studies revealed that pseudo second order kinetics followed by both samples li et al 118 introduced the magnesium oxide micro nanostructured materials with des for dye adsorption synthesized from the mgcl2 6h2o and urea molar ratio of 1 2 via a solvothermal method followed by calcination the studies revealed that the adsorption capacity of the mgo microcubes towards congo red cr amaranth ar and indigo carmine ic are found to be 666 7 43 74 and 54 32 mg g 1 at 25 c respectively this was attributed to the fact that the hierarchical porous structure of mgo could provide plenty of active sites which provide electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions for the pollutant removal the adsorption kinetics data conformed to the pseudo second order model and the isotherms are described by the langmuir model 4 3 2 magnetic solid phase extraction magnetic solid phase extraction mspe is a different separation method that uses magnetic adsorptions to extract target materials in aqueous solutions magnetic adsorbents can be extracted from the system easily and efficiently making them more favorable over other conventional adsorbents chen et al 155 156 reported utilizing mspe to extract mercury from real contaminated water using magnetic carbon dioxide nanoparticles that are modified with fe3o4 and coated with ternary hydrosulphonyl based deep eutectic solvent the maximum achieved adsorption capacity was 215 1 mg g and with a removal efficiency of 99 91 after 7 cycles of adsorption the removal efficiency dropped to only 90 23 without using des as a functionalizing agent magnetic graphene oxide nanoparticles have a removal efficiency of 34 76 155 156 wang et al 157 investigated the extraction efficiency of fe3o4 coated with polydopamine pda and des fe3o4 pda des for the herbicides sulfosulfuron pyrazosulfuron ethyl bensulfuron methyl and halosulfuron methyl from aqueous samples in this work dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride hba and 4 chlorophenolin hbd in 1 5 molar ratio based hdes were coated on fe3o4 pda the presented method showed the limits of detections varied from 0 0098 to 0 0110 g l with good linearity 5 0 200 g l 1 and extraction recoveries were between 61 3 and 108 6 for all analytes the chcl with a different hydrogen bond donor including eg oxalic acid or urea based des coated fe3o4 mnps was used for the extraction of lead and cadmium from environmental water samples using the mspe technique 158 the sample volume of 60 ml resulted in a preconcentration factor of 100 the 1 2 5 chcl urea des 200 Œºl showed high extraction capacity for lead 25 0 mg g and cadmium 23 7 mg g with the detection limits 0 4 and 0 1 Œºg l 1 and the linear dynamic ranges 2 to 250 Œºg l 1 0 5 to 30 Œºg l 1 for lead and cadmium recently jamshidi et al 159 introduced the polymeric des for the extraction of pesticides using a magnetic based solid phase extraction process in this method they successfully synthesized the magnetic fe3o4 poly acrylic acid menthol 1 2 des hydrogel using thermal frontal polymerization process and applied it as an extractant for the series of pesticides including lindane alachlor aldrin bromophos methyl heptachlor epoxide Œ± endosulfan hexaconazole dieldrin endrin Œ≤ endosulfan diazinon endosulfan sulfate bromopropylate fenpropathrin tetradifon and fenvalerate determined by gc ms analysis the ph dependent studies found that this polymer hydrogel was unstable in alkaline solutions and the best results were obtained at ph 6 using 0 2 g of extractant for the 5 ml pesticides solution the validation results showed that this polymer hydrogel could act as an excellent sorbent for these pesticides with lods were in the range of 0 001 0 120 Œºg l 1 enrichment factors were obtained from 152 to 550 and the linear range was between 0 003 and 20 Œºg l 1 the optimized method was applied for the extraction of pesticides in different real environmental water samples and the observed recoveries were in the range of 61 0 120 0 the magnetic polymer hydrogel yielded twice higher recovery efficiencies than those of the unpolymerized des due to the extra porosity large specific surface area and enhanced selectivity furthermore it could be easily recovered with a magnet wei et al 160 utilized benzyltributylammonium chloride lactic acid des 1 2 to regulate magnetic fe3o4 metal organic framework muio 66 nh2 composites des muio 66 nh2 the obtained nanoparticles were then used as adsorbents to adsorb ofloxacin and mefenamic acid the study showed that the adsorption capacity of des muio 66 nh2 towards ofloxacin and mefenamic acid reached up to 97 60 and 79 22 mg g respectively with prominent anti interference ability and outstanding regeneration capability and reusability the mechanism study indicated that the adsorption capacity of des muio 66 nh2 towards ofloxacin and mefenamic acid due to the electrostatic interaction chelation hydrophobic interaction œÄ œÄ stacking and hydrogen bonding present in the des in another study li et al 119 used poly dimethylsiloxane pdms fiber coated with hdes as sorbent for extractive determination of toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene from water samples coupled with gas chromatography with flame ionization detector gc fid the des based ethyl 4 hydroxybenzoate and methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride 2 1 were selected in this procedure results revealed the coating surface on pdms des gave a highly porous structure which was responsible for 3 times higher extraction performance than the homemade pdms fiber the linear range of the proposed method lied between 10 and 1000 Œºg l 1 and the limit of detection was in the range from 0 005 to 0 025 Œºg l 1 4 3 3 advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely used for water treatment processes for their high efficiency and easy operation persulfate based aops specifically have been extensively studied and applied in environmental remediation for contaminates degradation due to their high oxidation potential and persulfate stability 161 however in recent years many kinds of organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals dyes pesticides have emerged to degrade these pollutants the activation in the persulfate is important as the persulfate alone has weak oxidation potential 162 hence various activation methods have been investigated to increase the oxidation efficiency carbon based catalysts have great potential to activate the persulfate their electron rich functional groups and the actives sites located on the carbon basal plane are effective for lengthening and splitting the peroxide oo bond of peroxydisulfate 155 156 163 164 several studies have incorporated carbonaceous materials such as cnts nanodiamonds and reduced graphene oxide into water as metal free catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants 110 111 165 they were proven to be effective due to their high conductivity and low dimensional structure however the high cost of fabrication and their toxicity are the main limitations for using these carbon based catalysts on a large application on the other hand biochar which is produced by the pyrolysis of biomass in the absence of oxygen can be easily prepared is environmentally friendly and cost effective 166 several studies have reported biochar with good peroxydisulfate activation for pollutant degradation via its carbon bridge role and reactive species generation 167 202 however the structure of biochar is complex and disordered which hinders electron transfer and consumes radicals making its application less satisfactory 168 this issue could be solved by tuning and the structure and the surface properties to minimize the limitations of its application however this requires the use of acids and alkalis to tune the pore structure and surface properties of biochar to expose the active sites but these reagents are toxic and risks damage to the ecological environment in a recent study ye et al 169 utilized dess for the surface medication and structural engineering of nitrogen doping on biochar derived from filaments biomass nrbf results showed that fine tuning the surface of nrbf with choline chloride urea des helped achieve more regular structure and better configuration and allowed the introduction of nitrogen which improved the catalytic performance in terms of peroxydisulfate activation the modified nrbf has a 4 5 times higher degradation rate for tetracycline in comparison with pristine biochar this was attributed to the more regular structure which facilitated the electron transfer and the higher cluster number of aromatic compounds with n doping furthermore the non radical nrbf pds system showed good potential for bacteria inactivation and disinfection applications these results open more opportunities for developing metal free catalysts for water purification applications on the basis that dess can be used for structural and nitrogen modification in addition to surface modification dess can be used as precursors dispersants or templates for the preparation of various nanomaterials or carbocatalysts to enhance their catalytic properties for example using chcl urea assisted method nickel nickel nitride nanocomposites with various morphologies and compositions were prepared 170 in another study zno particles were synthesized by ionothermal precipitation using chcl eg 171 the nanomaterials fabricated using dess were stable and had superior catalytic efficiency for the degradation of various organic pollutants in water treatment processes yang et al 126 127 have also utilized fecl3 catalyzed des for the preparation of cellulose nanocrystals cncs cncs can be impeded in membranes and filters to remove heavy metals microbes pesticides and dyes from water the optimum composition for fecl3 catalyzed des is the mass ratio of 4 1 0 2 for oxalic acid dihydrate choline chloride and fecl3 6h2o respectively results show that the produced cncs had higher thermal stability in comparison with sulfuric acid hydrolyzed cncs furthermore the carboxyl groups on the surface of cncs introduced by esterification gave better dispersion stability in water the prepared fecl3 catalyzed des can be separated and used to prepare cncs at least three times zhang et al 172 also used acidic des for the synthesis of biochar using a simple one pot method the biomass treated in acidic des p toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate choline chloride had high content of carbon porous structure and was rich in oxygen containing functional groups these excellent properties enable its use in various water treatment applications 4 4 extractive distillation extractive distillation is a form of separation that uses a high boiling and non volatile solvent that does not form an azeotrope in the mixture this method of separation is used when the components have a low value of relative volatility making typical distillation not possible the solvent selected must change relative volatility drastically enough to allow for separation and must be easily separated from the bottom products gjineci et al 173 have tested two chcl based dess as entrainment substances for the separation of ethanol from their ethanol water mixture distillation is impossible using ordinary distillation and the addition of an entrainer makes the mixture easier to separate usually entrainers added are chemically heavy and environmentally unfriendly gjineci et al 173 tested chcl teg 1 3 and chcl urea 1 2 as des entrainers because of its negligible vapor pressure and wide liquid range the vapor liquid equilibrium data show that the addition of des to the mixture removes the azeotropic point completely by using a concentration of 5 5 w w for chcl urea 1 2 the selected dess were also found to be biodegradable unlike ionic liquids in addition 1h nmr analysis showed that the des could be recycled and reused qui et al 174 have developed the process of extractive distillation of water ethanol mixture using chcl urea 1 2 as entrainer by modeling it and analyzing it using aspen plus to demonstrate its practicality in large scale production the schematic illustration of the ethanol dehydration using des is shown in fig 11 deep eutectic solvents can also be used to separate acetonitrile from water acetonitrile is an important organic solvent that has many applications in the industry several industries produce a mixture of acetonitrile and water as waste streams however its separation from water is problematic as it has a minimum boiling azeotrope at 67 4 mol acn at 349 5 k and 101 32 kpa 175 extraction distillation has been proven as the best separation technique for bulk production of acetonitrile they synthesized ammonium based des and tested their feasibility as an extracting agent for the separation of water and acetonitrile mixture using extractive distillation glycolic acid and tetramethylammonium chloride tmac with a 3 1 molar ratio was used to prepare the des tmac is known to have several advantages over ionic liquids that include easy synthesis less toxicity and good biodegradability in addition it is non reactive with water and shares many physicochemical properties with ionic liquids the data of pseudo ternary vapor liquid equilibrium vle of water glycolic acid tetramethylammonium chloride gtm 3 1 was determined at 101 kpa by keeping the des concentration constant results indicated that ammonium based des can improve relative volatility and successfully remove the azeotrope from the system jiang et al 176 tested dess as entertainers for the separation of allyl alcohol from water using extractive distillation a mixture of allyl alcohol and water is produced during the production of epichlorohydrin a compound used in making plastics and other polymers via the propyl acetate method allyl alcohol forms an azeotrope with water making its separation via conventional distillation difficult they tested two dess as entrainment substances chcl urea and chcl glycerin at the molar ratios of 1 2 and 1 1 respectively the vapor liquid equilibrium data for the system was determined at 101 3 kpa results showed that adding chc urea at a concentration of 15 and adding chcl glycerin at a concentration of 10 removes the azeotropic point enabling extractive distillation 4 5 mechanism and by products in the pollutant extraction process using dess the mechanism of extraction of analytes from their aqueous media into deep eutectic solvents and the by products formed are essential as it aids the acquisition of insightful understanding of the process and its further development consequently there have been numerous studies 28 89 91 92 110 111 114 178 182 that have reported the mode of extraction of analytes from water using different techniques such as ftir nmr dls tem toc cosmo rs in one of such studies almustafa et al 180 examined the mechanism of extraction of boron in aqueous solution with menthol 2 methyl 2 4 pentanediol 2 1 men mpd 2 1 and thymol 2 methyl 2 4 pentanediol 2 1 thy mpd 2 1 the mechanism for the extraction of boron was presumed to be through the formation of mpd complex with boron with ftir spectra evaluation before and after extraction they observed that two new absorption peaks were formed after the extraction of boron with men mpd fig 12a the two peaks consist of one between 1155 cm 1 and 1175 cm 1 co stretching vibration and another between 1310 cm 1 and 1372 cm 1 bo stretching vibration moreover they discovered a stretching vibration of o ch2 moieties which was attributed to the peak at 1512 cm 1 after the extraction of boron with thy mpd hdes it was noted that these moieties the symmetric bo stretching with absorption peak at 1317 cm 1 and the co stretching vibrations with peaks appearing at 856 and 898 cm 1 the extraction mode through complex formation between boric acid and the mpd in the hdes was validated in another study van osch et al 91 studied the mechanism of extraction of chloride ion of different salts from water with lidocaine decanoic acid based hdess using total organic carbon and nmr analysis in order to explain the low distribution coefficient for the extraction of chloride ion from aqueous medium they suggested that the mechanism of extraction was via ion exchange between lidocaine ion and metal ion whereby the chloride ion interacted with protonated lidocaine they observed that as the initial concentration of the metal ion co2 was increased higher toc in the aqueous phase was detected fig 12d similar observation was noticed with the nmr whereby the relative amount of lidocaine to decanoic acid increased as the initial metal ion concentration was raised based on the findings from the toc and nmr they suggested that the mechanism of extraction the chloride ion is very likely through ion exchange between protonated lidocaine and metal ion in their study adeyemi et al 92 investigated the mechanism of extraction of chlorophenols cps from water with seven hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents hdess the cps studied are 2 chlorophenol 3 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol and the hdess consists of menthol hexanoic acid 1 2 menthol octanoic acid 1 2 menthol decanoic acid 1 2 menthol thymol 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 the mechanism of extraction was determined with cosmo rs cosmothermx and tmolex they suggested that the mode of extraction of the cps from aqueous media occurs through two different pathways one mode is through the hydrogen bonding between the cps and the hdess and the other is through hydrophobic interaction between the cps in water and the hdess they explained that hydrogen bond could be formed between the cps and the hdess because cps possesses hydrogen bond donor tendencies due to their overall peak on the left of the threshold value and hdess possesses hydrogen bond acceptor abilities fig 12b similar reports of hydrogen bonding between cps in water and hydrophobic ionic liquids hils can be observed in the works of fan et al 183 deng et al 184 lakshmi et al 185 and sulaiman et al 186 furthermore hydrophobic interaction has been well established in the studies of pratt and chandler 187 pangali et al 188 israelachvili and pashley 189 luzar et al 190 and israelachvili and pashley 191 reports of hydrogen bonding as a mode of extraction of analytes from water could also be found in studies with deep eutectic solvents for instance tang et al 110 111 suggested that the mechanism of extraction of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin from aqueous solution with 1 octanol tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride des 14 is through hydrogen bonding it was inferred that since the analytes levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin contains hydroxyl groups they could act as hydrogen bond donors hence they would be extracted from the water medium through hydrogen bonding between the analyte and the hdes in another report xu et al 182 described the mechanism of extraction of methylene blue from water through the utilization of aqueous biphasic systems abs the abs consisting of tetrabutylammonium bromide polypropylene glycol 400 tbab ppg 400 choline chloride glycerol chcl g was selected and measurements were made with the dynamic light scattering dls and transmission electron microscope tem they speculated that the mode of transfer of the methylene blue into the des was via aggregation which enhanced the solubility capacity with hydrogen bonding this was observed with the dls through an increase in particle size from 342 nm to about 2300 nm before and after extraction respectively in the tem the aggregates were validated with the transformation of the des from being uniformly distribution before extraction to a clustered form after extraction fig 12c hence they presumed that the aggregation was a major route of extraction of the solute the extraction of metals from wastewater using dess mostly occurs through the ion pair mechanism or cation exchange mechanism the main by products of these extractions are metal ion exchanged des fragments or metal ion paired des fragments 192 van osch et al described the mechanism of extraction of metal ions such as cobalt iron manganese potassium and their chloride ions from an aqueous medium with hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents hdess 91 the hdess used were composed of decanoic acid and lidocaine with molar ratios of 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 based on total organic carbon toc and nmr analyses of the water after metal extraction the ion exchange mechanism produced lidocaine hydrochloride as a by product in the water it was suggested that the metal ions in the aqueous medium were interchanged with protonated lidocaine from the hdess subsequently the protonated lidocaine reacted with the chloride ions in the water to form lidocaine hydrochloride as a by product similar hdes containing lidocaine and decanoic acid was used by ola et al for the investigation of the extraction of iron and manganese ions from water 192 at lower ph 2 ion pair mechanism occurs between fe3 and decanoic anion resulting the by products as fe decanoic acid 3 lidocaine n org whereas at ph 2 3 5 mn decanoic acid 2 lidocaine m org as the by product through a similar ion pair mechanism 192 phelps et al examined the removal of pertechnetate from water with three hdess which includes tetraoctylammonium bromide decanoic acid 1 2 trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride decanoic acid 1 2 and tetraoctylammonium bromide hexanoic acid 1 2 193 the mode of extraction was via ion exchange between the halide ion in the hdes with the pertechnetate ion in the treated water consequently there is the discharge of halide ions chloride and bromide ions into the aqueous medium as by products of the wastewater treatment 5 conclusions and future outlook dess have many advantageous characteristics e g low volatility no flammability large liquidus range easy preparation and chemical versatility all these properties are in line with the green chemistry principles and have found potential uses in a wide range of application areas the interest of researchers in the fabrication and use of dess has been growing exponentially lately where a sizeable number of investigations have geared towards advancing the water purification processes and technologies the available studies revealed that dess are good pore forming additives water permeate booster and antifouling agents in membrane based treatment processes and can also give high water recovery if utilized as a draw solution in forward osmosis applications furthermore hydrophobic des can efficiently extract various pollutants without contaminating water which enables various applications in the microextraction area of research including solid phase extraction in addition adding des to an azeotropic mixture can completely remove the azeotropic point making des more favorable than organic solvents this review has confirmed the ability of des as a pore forming agent adsorbent for heavy metals and a good extractant for wastewater treatment indeed few studies have been reported on the applications of des in water treatment since its discovery due to the hydrophilicity of the early dess before the breakthrough in the development of hydrophobic dess in 2015 in addition no pilot scale research has been done in applications other than microextraction it is obvious from the above discussion that dess have a high potential for removing contaminants from wastewater and will be able to potentially solve the current water treatment problems such as cumbersome procedures low performance high cost and short life of methods to some extent there is a need for studies on the adsorption capacity separation performance and extraction ability of dess in membrane based water technologies as they have not been explored yet moreover it is evident from the results that they are good pore forming agents water flux boosters and anti fouling enhancers but their highly viscous nature limits their application as membrane modifiers in terms of removal performance consequently modification of des with suitable methods to overcome the challenges and tailoring their properties with a suitable selection of hba and hbd is a hot topic in research 12 194 furthermore the physicochemical properties of des such as low volatility high viscosity polarity and high surface tension need to be investigated in details in addition to acidity and volatility the systematic experimental studies to determine the effect of salt hbd type and molar ratio on solvent properties in the literature are also scarce 12 further properties evaluation is essential because it impacts the application of hdes and another category of des in the microextraction process coupled with pollutant determination methods in the microextraction processes the high viscosity of dess causes some challenges in the analysis of des extracts in the analysis of des extracts the exact volume of analyte injects into hplc or gc injector using a microliter syringe which limits the possibility of using an autosampler thus to reduce the viscosity organic solvents are mixed along with a des this will affect the green approach of the method even though a green des solvent is used to overcome these limitations possible solutions are to increase the working temperature application of mechanical force during extraction or use an autosampler at high temperature the cnts graphene oxide magnetic modified nanoparticles polymeric des have shown promising examples for the modification of des and displayed good extraction efficiency therefore more research should be carried out on des modified materials for the adsorption of pollutants from the water thus further development in des for pollutant extraction from aqueous media still needs to focus on areas such as properties of des specific heat capacity extraction or absorption heat compositional flexibility which will help to develop new functional dess with more promising properties can be developed for novel applications modification of des with nanoparticles and regeneration recycle of des this review calls for the active design and integration of innovative dess with favorable physicochemical properties to address some of the persisting challenges with the existing water treatment processes declaration of competing interest the author s declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research authorship and or publication of this review acknowledgment

12987,over the past decade deep eutectic solvents dess have gathered considerable attention in the research for functional and green solvents the significant focus on the utilization of dess can be attributed to their economic benefits over ionic liquids ils practical usage through their flexible design and environmental safety linked to their potential biodegradability and low toxicity as well as low vapor pressure since their development in 2003 dess have proved to offer tremendous opportunities opening new perspectives as novel and refined materials to date significant advances have been achieved in the synthesis and applications of dess with more than ten thousand journal papers documented on this topic across different scientific fields in particular the use of dess in water and

organization keywords deep eutectic solvents water treatment green solvents pollutant extraction 1 introduction the use of ionic liquids ils as green solvents has become a major subject of study over the last two decades because of their wide thermal stability low vapor pressure and low flammability however the high cost limited chemical compatibility and poor biodegradability of ils have made their use quite unsustainable for large scale applications 1 4 several reports have pointed out the toxicity combustible character high cost production high viscosity and poor biodegradability of ils 5 10 these drawbacks can be circumvented through the development and use of deep eutectic solvents dess as mixtures that share several physicochemical properties with ils despite not being pure compounds or strictly composed of ions 11 12 some of the interesting characteristics that dess share with ils are low volatility wide liquid range high tunability and the ability to dissolve both organic and inorganic compounds due to their high polarity 11 however unlike an il a des is generally composed of a mixture of two or more species that are inorganic and or organic and may consist of ions ionizable molecules and neutral species 11 one of the distinctive features of a des is its significantly depressed eutectic point temperature relative to that of a conventional eutectic mixture or relative to the freezing point temperature of the ideal mixture of the pure constituents another peculiar characteristic of a des is its intricate intermolecular bonding network that controls its structure solvent solvent and solvent solute interactions and dynamics these aforementioned characteristics have enabled the use of dess as a new category of solvents with functional and ionic like properties for low and room temperature applications the first des was identified by abbott et al 13 in 2003 after mixing choline chloride chcl with urea at room temperature the authors of the original work found that the mixture exhibited solvent like properties as lewis acidic ils and had a significantly lower freezing point 100 c compared to its source components 13 since 2009 an actively growing number of studies on dess fig 1 have brought forward numerous benefits of using these mixtures for advancing processes and technologies where performance and sustainability limitations observed with traditional organic solvents or ils need to be met attributes such as low production costs low toxicity biocompatibility biodegradability non inflammability reduced volatility and water miscibility have since spurred the utilization of dess for metal processing catalysis material synthesis biodiesel transformation electrochemistry separation and water purification technologies 14 15 a series of reviews have been published on the synthesis properties and different applications of dess with little emphasis placed on their uses in water treatment 16 19 199 201 however recent years have witnessed a significant rise in the application of dess as an alternative or enhancing media for water purification considering their combined green aspect and rich functionality consistently in this review the authors provide an updated picture of the industrial and microscale applications of dess in water treatment processes this includes membrane processes micro extraction and extractive distillation the emerging water treatment processes that could benefit from integrating the peculiar colligative properties rich functionality and green chemistry of dess are also highlighted lastly the current problems that need to be addressed were mentioned and future research recommendations were highlighted 2 deep eutectic solvents overview and classification a des is defined as a mixture of two or more compounds for which is the eutectic point temperature is below that of an ideal liquid mixture and with a temperature depression that keeps the mixture in its liquid form under operational temperature for a certain compositional range there are several types of dess common des systems can be constructed with large asymmetric ions obtained by combining a hydrogen bond donor hbd with an inorganic halide or more often an organic halide acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor hba as shown in fig 2 dess formed with organic halide salts can be described by the generic molecular formula cat x zy where cat can be ammonium phosphonium or sulfonium cation x is a lewis base typically a halide anion y is a lewis acid e g metal salt or hbd e g a br√∏nsted acid that forms a complex anionic species with x 11 emma et al 11 and abbott et al 13 categorized the dess into four types based on the composition of the binary mixture table 1 recently a new class of non ionic dess labeled as type v dess has emerged 21 type v dess exhibit strong negative deviations from ideality and a major depression of the melting point non ionic compounds are used to create mixtures with low freezing points to establish this new type of class type i dess are made of metal chloride combined with a quaternary ammonium organic salt type ii dess are obtained by using a metal chloride hydrate with an organic salt type iii is the most commonly documented in the literature owing to its ability to act as a solvent with a wide range of oxides and transition metal ions it consists of an hbd such as an organic acid amides amino acid alcohol and other natural compounds mixed with a quaternary ammonium salt whose structure is similar to that of ils 11 13 20 22 23 this type of dess mimics the ils properties thus possessing similar characteristics however with the proper selection of the des constituents it can be biodegradable less toxic more affordable and can be easily manufactured 24 based on their application and physicochemical properties dess can be classified into natural deep eutectic solvents nades and therapeutic deep eutectic solvents thedes nades and thedes can be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic in the next sub sections hydrophobic dess are discussed generally in addition to nades as it has a great number of applications in water treatment processes type iv is a combination of hbd and metal chloride typically as a hydrate 2 1 hydrophobic des hdes hydrophobic des hdes is an important emerging family of solvents the most reported hdes consist of a hydrophobic hba compound fig 3 combined with an hbd such as alcohol or carboxylic acid with long alkyl chains fig 4 however some of these precursors can serve as either hba or hbd depending on the system used moreover an hdes can be categorized into ionic hdes and non ionic hdes based on the ionic nature of hba 25 quaternary ammonium salts come under the category of ionic hba and are typically combined with long chain alcohols fatty alcohols saturated acids and unsaturated acids to form ionic hdess while in non ionic hdess it is more difficult to differentiate between the hba and hbd generally terpenoid based compounds such as dl menthol l menthol and thymol which are combined with carboxylic acids can be used for the synthesis of non ionic hdes 26 in subsequent studies non ionic hdess were synthesized from the same family of compounds and were used as hba and hbd such as decanoic acid and acetic acid with different molar ratios 27 other nonionic hdes were synthesized using painkillers e g lidocaine in combination with organic acids or with terpenes e g menthol and testosterone ibuprofen lidocaine ubiquinone although the interest in hydrophobic des has been increasing since 2015 only a limited number has been proposed to date due to the low number of available and low cost salts and hbds that can form hydrophobic eutectic solvents with melting points close to room temperature in 2015 van osch et al 28 combined decanoic acid and quaternary ammonium salt to produce a hydrophobic des that is stable when in contact with water however sometimes the combination of two compounds such as hba and hbd makes it impossible to obtain hdes for saturated and unsaturated short chain acids such as acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid or acrylic acid in combination with tetra n butylammonium bromide nevertheless it is possible to obtain a stable two phase des with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties by combining three compounds in the synthesis e g methyltrioctylammonium chloride as hba and two hbds as octanol and octanoic acid in a 1 2 3 molar ratio if the combination of two compounds does not give a stable hdes 29 according to van osch et al 28 and florindo et al 30 33 both compounds must be hydrophobic otherwise part of the hydrophilic species will leak into the water mainly driven by its solubility for all families of hydrophobic dess the water solubility decreases with increasing the alkyl chain of the hba because long chain ammonium salts are preferably imparting greater hydrophobicity compared to that with a short chain such as chcl 201 2 2 natural deep eutectic solvents natural deep eutectic solvents nades are a new class of dess that are increasingly being explored for their green attributes and rich chemistry 34 more than 100 nades were reported using the mixtures of chcl organic acids or alcohols or sugars amino acids organic acids or sugars and organic acids sugars naturally occurring hbd similar to dess nadess can be obtained through the significant hydrogen bonding interactions between the constituents moreover nades show high solvation properties towards non water soluble biomolecules such as gluten dna and starch than in water this gives nades the capability to act as extraction media for bioactive molecules as well as stabilizing agents 35 36 3 synthesis and physicochemical properties of des 3 1 preparation methods dess are generally synthesized by heating above room temperature a mixture of solid precursors e g hba and hbd prepared within a specific compositional range the heating is carried out at a temperature that allows melting the species and forming a liquid solution that remains stable upon cooling it back and storing it at room temperature the lower melting point component is first melted and then the higher melting point compound is added to the liquid or if both hba and hbd have high melting points the components can be melted together 34 the same method can also be applied for the synthesis of hdess based on the starting raw materials other synthesis techniques can be used such as freeze drying in freeze drying the aqueous solution of both hba and hbd is mixed and then frozen at two different temperatures afterward lyophilization is done in a freeze dryer until a clear viscous liquid is obtained for instance guti√©rrez et al 37 successfully synthesized chcl and urea des at 77 k and 223 k by applying the freeze drying method other synthesis methods are vacuum evaporation grinding twin screw extraction microwave irradiation and ultrasound assisted preparation several reviews discussed these synthesis methods in detail with their advantages and disadvantages 38 39 201 3 2 solubility of water in des generally a hydrophobic eutectic system is less thermally stable than a hydrophilic one but it is more physically stable in an aqueous solution as it has much lower water solubility in most cases a hydrophobic des has solubility lower than 7 wt in water 28 hdes properties mainly depend on the structure of hba and hbd water content as well as temperature 30 33 the selection of appropriate hba and hbd species is the key factor making the des more hydrophobic by changing the alkyl chain of hbd or hba the polarity of a hydrophobic des can be tuned the presence of a longer alkyl chain in the individual components hbd and hba lowers their solubility as well as hdes s solubility in aqueous media an hdes that contains hydrophobic hba and hbd has lower water solubility and higher hydrophobicity than an hdes composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds as hydrophilic components can dissolve in the aqueous media based on their solubility hence by synthesizing hdes from hydrophobic compounds physical stability in an aqueous solution and hydrophobicity can be increased additionally it has been evidenced that hdes with terpenes and long chain ammonium and phosphonium salts in combination with long chain organic acids have high stability in aqueous samples fatty acid based dess are the most soluble in water while quaternary ammonium salts are the least among the reported hdes tetrabutylammonium chloride and tetraoctylammonium chloride as hba with decanoic acid as hbd in the 1 2 molar ratio had the highest hydrophobicity that is 7 and 6 22 w w of water solubility respectively 28 the high solubility also depends on the availability of a nitrogen atom from at least one short alkyl chain but a minor effect was observed with the type of ion in hba cl or br recently maria et al 40 investigated the importance of the water content for the stability of the betaine urea nades using experimental studies and computational modeling density functional theory and the natural bond orbital analysis the results revealed that a minimum of 3 mol of water content needed to form a stable betaine urea nades 1 1 at 70o c the authors claimed that the stability of betaine urea nades after adding 3 mol of water is due to the difference in the hydrogen bonding analyzed by nmr and atr ftir studies and the increase in the electron density in the moiety of the carboxyl group in the betaine observed in the computational studies 3 3 rheological properties viscosity is another very important property that strongly affects the application of dess dess usually exhibit relatively high viscosities 100 mpas at room temperature which is attributed to the formation of an extensive hydrogen bonding network between hba and hbd this in return results in lower mobility of free species within the des 41 thus a des with low viscosity is preferred however the viscosity of the des depends on the structure of hba hbd and temperature viscosity is enhanced as the tetraalkyl quaternary ammonium chain increases but a visible decrease was observed when long branched chains were used as the temperature increases the viscosity decreases with arrhenius like behavior thus the application of des towards extraction is usually carried out at higher temperatures due to the lower viscosity however it is possible to alter the viscosity and other solvent properties such as conductivity and polarity by the addition of a small quantity of water 1000 ppm to dess 42 the water molecules in a small amount weight fraction 5 can form hydrogen bonds with the ions and polar hbds in the molecular matrix of the dess nevertheless above 50 mol fraction of water the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in des diminish and hence cause the properties to change drastically 43 the variation in the physical properties with the addition of water to trehalose and chcl based nades were studied by xin et al 44 upon water addition 25 the density viscosity and refractive index drastically decreased but the intensive hydrogen bonds were retained varying the molar ratios of hbas and hbds and the water content gave a higher degree of tunability of the structural and physical properties 3 4 surface tension acidity and volatility the surface tension values of dess are higher than those of the widely used organic solvents but almost comparable to the ils 41 most dess are non volatile due to their ionic nature but the vapor pressure of des increases as temperature increases the reports on the acidity of hdes are quite limited as it depends on the type of hbd and hba among the des with benzyl tri methyl ammonium chloride and p toluenesulfonic acid pka 2 8 oxalic acid pka 1 25 and citric acid pka 4 14 benzyl tri methyl ammonium chloride and citric acid reported the highest acidity 45 moreover as the temperature of des increases the acidity also increases due to the higher dissociation of the acid at high temperatures in a nades matrix carboxylic acids hydroxy groups and carbonyl groups present in the constituents are mainly responsible for the formation of a hydrogen bonding network via intermolecular interactions that determine their physicochemical properties 34 36 craveiro et al 46 have studied the properties such as density thermal behavior conductivity and polarity of nades that are based on chcl organic acids amino acids and sugars the thermal characterization of these nades revealed that synthesized nades were stable up to 170 c and glass formers depending on their composition craverio et al also studied their conductivity at a temperature between 0 and 40 c results presented the high conductivity of organic acid based nades and their temperature dependence 3 5 density ionic conductivity and polarity of dess the density is one of the most important physical properties of dess the densities of dess are greater than that of water and higher than that of the hbd in most cases while lower densities were observed for hdes than water 47 the literature revealed that the densities of des mainly depend on temperature organic salt hbd molar ratio structures of hbd and hba and choice of the hydrogen bonding donor 48 50 the density of des decreases linearly with the increasing temperature the chain length of hbd increases the density decreases the changes in density were also observed for the difference in the chain length of hbd 48 50 since the conductivity depends on the viscosity of des most of the dess have lower ionic conductivities 2 ms cm 1 at room temperature the viscosity decreases with increasing the temperature so the ionic conductivity of dess increases with temperature the other main factors that depend on the ionic conductivities of des are the hba hbd molar ratio the nature of the organic salt and the hbd as well as the salt s anion and water content 47 the polarity of a solvent is a capacity of a solvent for solvating dissolved dipolar or apolar species the polarity of the des was not considerably studied in detail ashish pandey et al 51 studied and compared the polarities of dess ethaline glyceline maline and reline using the optical spectroscopic responses of several different uv vis absorbance and molecular fluorescence probes the results indicated the ethaline and glyceline to be more dipolar out of the four dess and are due to alcohol functionalities in 1 2 ethanediol and glycerol as hbd whereas the other two hbd are the malonic acid and urea possess cooh and nh2 type groups respectively florindo et al 52 53 compared the polarity of a range of dess based on hydrophilic hba cholinium chloride and a hydrophobic hbd tetrabutylammonium chloride or dl menthol combined with several different carboxylic acids using solvatochromic responses of uv vis absorption probes and then the normalized polarity etn were evaluated when comparing the hydrophilic ch cl based dess ch cl malonic acid 0 79 has the highest etn value than ch cl levulinic acid 0 35 and ch cl glycolic acid 0 36 this confirms that the des with diacid as hbd is more polar than those based on monoacids with functional groups ketone in levulinic acid or an alcohol group in glycolic acid whereas the etn values for hydrophilic and hydrophobic dess with the same hbd as levulinic acid dl menthol levulinic acid showed high etn value 0 73 than the ch cl levulinic acid 0 35 and for dl menthol leva 0 73 it can be concluded that the latter is much more polar than the former the polarity of des was controlled by the ionic species present in the mixture that is it decreased with the increase of the aliphatic chain of the organic acid 54 3 6 toxicity because of the natural origin of most compounds used in the synthesis of dess these solvents are considered non toxic or lower toxic and harmless the toxicity profile of dess depends on the type of individual components interaction with living organisms ph of the dess synergistic effect and molar ratio 55 the non toxicity or lower toxicity of dess were mainly assigned to the group of dess composed of non toxic or low toxic compounds such as choline chloride amino acids sugars and natural carboxylic acids 56 however the toxicity of dess highly depends on the compounds forming dess hayyan et al 57 58 tested the toxicity of four dess using bacteria and reported that des has no observed toxicity radosevic et al 59 evaluated the toxicity of three dess based on chcl mixed with different hbds including glucose glycerol gly and oxalic acid oa and observed negative phytotoxicity tests result however the chcl based dess with different organic acids as hbd showed slightly higher toxicity than chcl based des with amines amino acids alcohols and sugars as hbd 56 this is because the later dess acted as nitrogen or carbon sources for bacteria hence accelerating the bacterial growth whereas des with organic acid changed the ph of the medium and therefore this environmental ph change can disturb the cellular proliferation and metabolic properties inhibited the bacterial growth 56 zhao et al revealed that among different bacteria e coli and s enteritidis were more sensitive towards chcl based dess than s aureus and l monocytogenes because of damage of cell walls of the bacteria by the hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions of dess components with the polysaccharide or peptide chains of the cell wall 60 the authors studied the toxicity of chcl based des with different organic acids and found as chcl oxalic acid chcl levulinic acid and chcl citric acid has the highest toxicity than chcl malonic acid and chcl p toluenesulfonic acid this study confirmed the toxicity of acid based des mainly depends on the length of the carbon chain and ph of the acid component of dess hayyan et al 57 58 found that the toxicity and cytotoxicity of phosphonium derived des on artemia salina brine shrimps were higher than the raw materials causing the aquatic organism to be more vulnerable ahmadi et al reported the cytotoxicity against human hek 293 cells by 28 selected chcl based dess than their individual components 61 similarly cytotoxicity of ammonium based deep eutectic solvents dess with four hbds glycerine ethylene glycol triethylene glycol and urea was investigated using in vitro cell lines and in vivo animal model 62 the authors noticed that the toxicity of all prepared dess is higher than their individual components due to the synergistic effect of dess after being prepared zhao et al also confirmed that dess were highly toxic than their individual components due to the delocalization of charges on hydrogen bonding by synergistic effect 60 in contrast the toxicity of des depends on the molar ratio of hba and hbd the chcl urea des 1 3 showed higher toxicity than with a molar ratio of 1 2 62 ahmadi et al noticed the toxicity of chcl glycerol des decreased as the glycerol proportion increased from 1 2 ratio to 1 4 ratio whereas 1 2 propanediol was used as hbd constituent with chcl their toxic effect was increased by enhancing the proportion of 1 2 propanediol from 1 to 3 61 this clearly shows that the molar ratio of individual components in dess plays an important role in the toxicity profile of dess therefore toxicity assessment studies are necessary for advancing the integration of dess into different technologies 3 7 structural aspects of des with the growing interest in using dess in water treatment and other industrial processes knowledge of the molecular dynamics of these solvents plays a vital in the process design of the intended application as it gives a deeper insight into their properties and behavior 63 dess have a lower melting point than their parent compounds owing to the asymmetric charge distribution and decrease of the intermolecular coulombic forces as a result of the formation of hydrogen bonds 64 nmr ir and mass spectrometry characterizations quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulations have provided evidence for the existence of neutral ionic and doubly ionic h bonding interactions in the dess 65 indeed these h bonding interactions between hba and hbd switched on to the formation of low transition temperature dess 12 claire et al 65 investigated the h bonding interactions in chcl urea des using bader s quantum theory of atoms in molecules qtaim their study revealed an alphabet soup of different types of h bond such as oh o c nh o c oh cl nh cl oh nh ch cl ch o c nh oh and nh nh has substantial flexibility in terms of number and strength neutron diffraction and atomistic modeling of chcl urea des revealed a layered sandwich structure stabilized by the complementary hydrogen bond formation of choline and urea with chloride along with weak hydrogen bonds between the molecules 66 a quantum chemical calculations study for three different dess including 1 2 chcl urea reline 1 2 chcl ethylene glycol ethaline and 1 1 chcl malonic acid maloline was reported by durgesh et al 67 in this study the dess were shown to exhibit a complete loop cycle structure by cooperative hydrogen bonding networks formed from strong interactions such as hbd choline hbd chloride and chcl fig 5 in the case of reline and ethaline six and seven membered ring like structures were suggested to be formed respectively through the interaction of the hbd as a bidentate ligand with cl the charge decomposition and density of states dos analyses clearly showed a charge transfer from the chcl to the hbds through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions 4 applications of dess in water purification water treatment is an important process in our modern life due to the scarcity of pure drinking water even though the earth has enormous natural water resources one possible solution to solve the availability of pure drinking water is by reusing natural water resources currently the world is searching for cost effective eco friendly methods for the purification of wastewater which depends on the type properties and toxicity of contaminants present in it des is considered a green alternative to aqueous and conventional solvents and thus the potential applications of des have been widely explored in the wastewater treatment research area 30 33 52 53 68 70 the first direct application of dess in water treatment was published in 2015 71 khezeli et al for the first time utilized hdes for the removal of various contaminants from the water via liquid liquid microextraction later on with a greater understanding of dess and their properties the number of articles published on water treatment via deep eutectic solvents increased the major research efforts on the application of dess in water treatment have been focused mainly on three areas membrane based water treatment processes extraction i e microextraction solid phase extraction and extractive distillation in the following sections we present a detailed review of the use of dess for the removal of contaminants from wastewater in these areas and highlight current weaknesses and future directions 4 1 membrane based water treatment processes the widespread existence of organic pollutants including pharmaceutical active compounds personal care products dyes organic solvents and endocrine disrupting chemicals and heavy metal pollutants such as lead mercury arsenic etc displays a formidable challenge to the water purification industry recently in addition to pure water deficiency potential adverse effects of all kinds of contaminants on human health ecosystem and aquatic life wastewater treatment is growing as a major concern the removal of pollutants using advanced membrane technology has therefore become a hot topic of significant interest in water wastewater treatment and water reuse due to the superior removal performance and easy operational method the main membrane based treatment processes are microfiltration ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo and nanofiltration 69 the main drawbacks of these treatments are lower water flux and lower selectivity along with a high running cost 70 recent studies have reported that des can act as a good pore forming agent which improves the water flux and antifouling properties 71 75 in the following sections the application of des in different membrane based water treatment processes as water flux booster and fo draw solution has been reviewed and discussed 4 1 1 application of des as water flux booster recently jiang et al 72 73 demonstrated that hydrophilic dess work as great pore forming agents for polyethersulfone pes uf membranes when added to the casting solution pes is mechanically and thermally stable and gives a chemically resilient membrane but it has a poor separation performance without any additives previously various additives such as silica nanoparticles and alcohols were incorporated into the membrane to improve its permeability and separation performance 72 73 these additives have been found to improve the permeability by changing the morphological structure of the membrane however they deteriorate the selectivity due to the enlargement of the membrane pores according to the same study the presence of hydrophilic des in the pes membrane increases both permeability and selectivity the des solvent consisted of a mixture of decanoic acid deca as hba and tetra n butylammonium chloride n4444 cl as hbd at a molar ratio of 2 1 deca n4444 cl the des was incorporated into the membrane by adding it to the polymer casting solution typically water soluble salts and organic compounds are used as pore forming agents in the membrane synthesis which explains the selection of the deca n4444 cl system for making the des specifically jiang et al 72 73 reported that the des concentration yielding the highest performance in terms of water flux was 2 wt in the membrane the enhanced water flux of the modified membrane reached a maximum of 142 84 l m2h which was 4 65 folds that of the native pes membrane this could be attributed to the formation of large and uniformly distributed pore sizes inside the membrane as confirmed from the top and cross sectional scanning electron microscopy sem photographs fig 6 also the performance of the des modified membrane towards the rejection of model biological foulants such as pepsin egg albumin and bovine serum albumin bsa was 91 5 97 3 and 99 0 respectively and superior to that achieved with the control membrane using deca and n4444 cl separately did not increase the performance of the pes membrane the enhanced morphology and performance of the des modified pes membrane could be attributed to the synergetic effect of the coordination of deca from the nmp solvent and the n4444 cl release from the non solvent coagulation bath during the membrane development by the phase inversion process later in another work jiang et al 73 studied the use of imidazole im as hbd for screening different dess as functional additives for the pes membrane to increase its water flux performance previously it has been documented that dess made of im and organic salts are great solvents for inorganic salts solid organic compounds and metal oxides and may have the ability to dissolve organic polymers 74 75 jiang et al 72 73 predicted that these additives have the potential to increase the efficiency of pes due to their excellent solvent properties and water solubility the hbas used are n4444 cl tetra n butylammonium bromide n4444 br tetra n butylphosphonium chloride p4444 cl tetra n butylphosphonium bromide p4444 br and 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride bmim cl all dess used as additives showed enhancement in membrane performance to some extent for example jiang et al reported that the pes membrane with n4444 cl im des reached a maximum flux of 781 l m2 h which is 6 45 times higher than the membrane prepared without any additives the pes modified membrane also showed bsa rejection of 97 7 at 2 bar vatanpour et al 75 reported the chcl eg based des as a hydrophilic additive in the polyethersulfone nanofiltration membrane for antifouling and separation performance enhancement the maximum pure water flux found was 241 3 l m2h for 2 wt pes polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp des membrane which was 23 times that of the neat pes membrane without pvp and des and 1 3 times that the of pes pvp membrane the pure water flux of the pes des membrane without pvp was 17 6 l m2h which indicated that the ethaline is not a good pore former the dye and bsa rejections were higher than 98 and 99 respectively showing an increased separation ability in comparison with the bare membrane an antifouling study also showed that the des blended membranes have better antifouling properties shahabi et al 74 introduced the chcl urea des as an additive to modify the polyamide pa layer of reverse osmosis ro membranes the sem and atomic force microscopy afm analyses displayed a smoother surface for the des modified membranes the membrane modified with 1 wt of des exhibited a pure water flux of 56 7 l m2h and salt rejection capacity of 96 4 indicating 27 and 3 enhancements in the water flux and salt rejection performance respectively in comparison with the unmodified membrane the authors also compared the efficiency of ionic liquids as a modifier for commercially available ro membranes their study revealed that the membranes modified with n butyl pyridinium and betaine monohydrate showed the best desalination performance with pure water flux values of 78 9 l m2h and 51 7 l m2h and nacl rejections of 97 3 and 94 4 respectively consistently the dess could be considered as efficient membrane modifiers to improve their water permeability selectivity and solute rejection performance maalige et al 78 utilized dess as flux boosting and surface cleaning agents for the thin film composite polyamide membrane tfc pa dess such as chcl eg chcl u and chcl gly were used at different temperatures 30 c 40 c and 50 c and were studied for their impact on the tfc pa membrane s performance for pure water flux and salt e g mgso4 nacl and humic acid flux and rejection the same authors found that the tfc pa membrane treated with the dess at low temperature showed a 2 5 fold higher flux than the pristine tfc pa however no substantial changes in the rejection efficiencies for the solutes have been reported the achieved increase in flux was due to the enhancement in the surface wettability of the des treated membranes the afm analysis fig 7 showed an improved surface smoothness of the tfc pa membrane after treatment with the dess and could be attributed to the presence of h bonding between the des and polyamide moieties this was also confirmed by zeta potential analysis which suggested a modification of the chemical environment of tfc pa via h bonding interactions due to des treatment also long term studies for humic acid 10 000 ppm for 250 h removal revealed that the des treated membrane showed high flux recovery without compromising flux boosting potential and rejection of humic acid compared to none treated tfc pa membrane therefore these results indicated that dess can be envisaged as both flux promoting and surface cleaning agents for the tfc pa and offer a cost effective and eco friendly membrane tuning approach on the other hand coating the dess on suitable carriers i e silica nanoparticles and using such as membrane fillers can greatly improve the water flux and selectivity performance of the membrane while reducing the des consumption and enabling its recovery 79 81 4 1 2 application of des as new draw solution in forward osmosis forward osmosis fo is an emerging technology that produces both clean water and energy via osmotic pressure difference across the semi permeable membrane 197 this process has recently received attention because of its simple and environmentally friendly operation low energy requirement and low membrane fouling in the fo process the semi permeable membrane allows water to pass through the pores and prevents ions from passing enabling spontaneous mixing in fo 82 fig 8 illustrates the process of generating fresh water from seawater via fo the clean water passes through the semi permeable membrane towards the draw solution and the mixture is then separated via a recovery system to produce fresh water water production by fo is not commercialized due to the lack of suitable membranes and draw solutions the fo membrane must have high water flux and salt rejection low concentration polarization and must be chemically and mechanically stable also the ideal fo draw solute must be easy to recover have zero toxicity and is cost effective many efforts have been dedicated to finding a draw solute that fulfills these characteristics recently studies have shown that the des can offer a sustainable means as a fo draw solution in 2017 mahto et al 83 utilized dess as draw solutions in fo for the recovery of freshwater from contaminated streams such as seawater contaminated wastewater brackish water and tannery wastewater two dess were prepared with chcl as hba and eg and glycerol gly as hbds at a mol ratio of 1 2 as hba hbd using a tfc polyamide membrane as the fo separation medium the average flux achieved in various feed streams was in the range of 2 5 l m2h which was higher than other reported fluxes for wastewater treatment whereas the achieved water recovery was higher than 90 the des was separated from the water mixture using the phase separation concept at 5 c and thus the obtained draw solutions were reused in subsequent experiments resulting in minimal water loss although the product water obtained in the study had low contamination which could make it suitable for several applications its effective recovery from des needs an improvised gradual cooling system in another work the same group of scientists has reported on the use of chcl eg 1 2 and chcl gly 1 2 as a draw solution in fo for concentrating low abundant dna and proteins in brackish feed water through a tfc polyamide membrane 84 a flow rate of 1 8 lpm and pressure of 1 atm were maintained on both sides during the fo process the chcl eg and chcl gly dess could generate very high osmotic pressures of 365 atm and 317 atm respectively the osmotic potential œÄ 150 atm could be recovered after 50 dilution and œÄ 60 atm after 80 dilution due to the retention of the osmotic potential the draw solution could be recycled for a longer time both draw solutions chcl eg and chcl gly showed high flux values of 7 85 and 3 71 l m2 h respectively achieving high protein and dna enrichment without the use of chemicals makes the des an attractive draw solution the draw solute was recovered by chilling the diluted solutions after fo at 5 c which is an easy separation process and requires a low amount of energy recently hydrophobic des are being synthesized with considerable ionic strength indeed hydrophobic dess can be introduced as a draw solution in fo this will reduce the need for the high energy intrusive regeneration process as simple separation would be possible and will reduce the cost considerably thus further research is encouraged in developing hydrophobic dess with high ionic strength and applying them as draw solutions 4 2 dess as extraction solvents in the area of extraction applications in water treatment processes des became a prominent research area due to the poor water solubility or non solubility in water hdes are currently widely applied both as liquid extractants in liquid liquid extraction techniques and sorbents in solid phase extraction techniques however not all hdess are suitable for extraction processes the melting freezing point of hdes increases with increasing tetraalkyl ammonium phosphonium quaternary chain and alkyl chain in hbd while the density decreases thus the cost of the process on a large scale can increase if hdess with longer hba and hbd chains are utilized since they usually have a higher melting point or freezing point than hdes synthesized from hbd and hba with shorter alkyl chains requiring more heat in the process 201 another main disadvantage is that if the long chain in hba and hbd has a density close to water s density the hdes will require an extended time to form two phases during separation and extraction processes it is well known that density strongly depends on temperature therefore at a higher temperature the density of hdes decreases an hdes with a very high density 1400 kg m3 was synthesized by using hexafluoroisopropanol hfip as hbd and l carnitine betaine as hba at different molar ratios 85 the subsequent section demonstrated the application of des in different liquid extraction techniques and includes the summarized reports in the literature table 2 4 2 1 liquid liquid extraction liquid liquid extraction lle also known as solvent extraction is a separation technique that uses a solvent to separate a solute from a liquid phase without a chemical reaction usually the solute is transferred from water to an organic phase via a chemical potential mechanism after the transfer is completed the system reaches equilibrium and achieves a stable configuration with low energy the solvent used and the raffinate must have opposite polarities for the extraction process to be possible this separation method is used in various industries such as the production of biodiesel organic compounds perfumes and many other industries in water treatment hydrophobic solvents can be used to extract various trace contaminants in water this can be done when stripping is not feasible if the boiling point of the contaminate is much higher than water the separation of contaminants from water cannot be handled by stripping the advantages that lle offers over other techniques are low energy requirement flexibility and recycling capability however its main limitation is the requirement of a large volume of samples toxic organic solvents low selectivity and the potential problems that the solvent can produce des became a great potential as extraction solvents because of their extraction efficiency recyclability green credentials and easy synthesis the possibility for structural tuning makes them suitable extractors for the wide range of metals and ions from water without many drawbacks florindo et al 30 33 have proved hydrophobic des capability as a solvent extractor by utilizing it to extract ciprofloxacin from water environments ciprofloxacin is a water pollutant that has wide use in the pharmaceutical industry the authors synthesized des that has low water and high ciprofloxacin solubility enabling it to efficiently extract ciprofloxacin from water moreover the activated carbon was chosen to adsorb ciprofloxacin from des normally activated carbon is used to purify water in water treatment plants however an hdes was alternatively used to extract ciprofloxacin from water because it imposes fewer environmental or health concerns also the hydrophobic des works on removing specific compounds from aqueous phases without contaminating the water they prepared a series of hydrophobic des using dl menthol tetraheptylammonium bromide n7777 br tetraoctylammonium bromide n8888 br methyltrioctylammonium bromide n8881 br octanoic acid c8 decanoic acid c10 and dodecanoic acid c12 in definite molar ratio c12 c10 is proven to be the best extractor with an efficiency of 87 the first recycle extraction efficiency is found to be 82 which is higher than fresh des for c12 c10 a possible explanation is that activated carbon removed some impurities present in des however overall c12 c10 des shows good efficiency for extracting ciprofloxacin and the ability to recycle is an additional advantage florindo et al 52 53 have also reported using natural hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents as environmentally friendly and cheap extractors of pesticides from aqueous solutions pesticides are a group of compounds used to kill insects to improve agriculture production these compounds are highly toxic and can pass through the soil and subsoil to contaminate quality water processes such as membrane filtration and adsorption are not effective for the removal of pesticides ionic liquids have been proven as effective absorbents of pesticides but their high cost and difficult purification have prevented their industrial use deep eutectic solvents mimic the ionic liquid properties and the low cost and easy preparation make them more favorable than ionic liquids florinda et al demonstrated that the hydrophobic des has removal efficiency higher than 80 for four different types of pesticides which are imidacloprid neonicotinoids nitenpyram and acetamiprid the used dess were dl menthol and n4444cl hba with different molar ratios of acetic acid pyruvic acid levulinic acid butyric acid hexanoic acid octanoic acid decanoic acid dodecanoic acid hbds no relationship between chain length and hydrophobicity was observed in the case of hbds van osch et al 91 reported using hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents for removing metal ions from water the presence of certain metals in water makes it toxic and thus undrinkable to avoid health issues extracting metals from contaminated water is important moreover the extraction of certain metals such as gold and silver can be of economic value the same authors demonstrated that all transition metal ions could be removed with high distribution coefficient values the investigated hydrophobic dess consist of decanoic acid deca and lidocaine lid in a 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 molar ratio the measured distribution coefficient d for the ions of the metal salts cobalt chloride cocl2 nickel chloride nicl2 iron ii chloride fecl2 manganese chloride mncl2 zinc chloride zncl2 copper chloride cucl2 sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl and lithium chloride licl was reported the authors reported that the extraction mechanism occurs via an ion exchange in which all transition metal ions could be extracted with high distribution coefficients even for high co2 concentrations and low mass fractions of des maximum extraction efficiency could be reached within 5 s and regeneration of des was possible by shaking it with sodium oxalate with an equal weight of des for 1 h phenolic compounds are of major concern since they are toxic and inflict severe damage in water due to discharging industrial agricultural and domestic wastewater streams into water bodies and tend to persist in water over a long period sas et al 86 attempted extracting phenolic pollutants from water using des that is based on organic acids such as octanoic acid dodecanoic acid and decanoic acid as hbd and menthol and thymol as hba the targeted phenolic compounds are phenol o cresol and 2 chlorophenol the authors of the aforementioned work demonstrated that des liquid liquid extraction is a suitable method for the extraction of phenolic compounds present in water bodies the extraction efficiency was above 85 for all phenolic compounds used additionally increasing the des hydrophobicity resulted in a lower water phenolic interaction and increased solute extraction efficiency in 2019 florindo et al 30 33 prepared non ionic hdes and ionic hdes composed of dl menthol or quaternary ammonium salts dl menthol tetraoctylammonium bromide n8888 br tetraheptylammonium bromide n7777 br methyltrioctylammonium bromide n8881 br as hba and natural fatty acids octanoic acid c8 decanoic acid c10 as hbd respectively and were applied for the removal of bisphenol a bpa using lle the quaternary ammonium salts based hdes yielded higher extraction efficiency than dl menthol based hdes when compared with hbas and also different hbds due to the more hydrophobic nature of ionic hbas than nonionic hbas hence the higher the extraction efficiencies among different ionic hdes n8888 br c10 can extract almost 100 of bsa from water environments under the optimal conditions bpa 0 1 g l des water ratio 1 1 temperature 25 c and contact time 10 min the des water mass ratio did not have a significant influence on the hdes extraction efficiencies of bpa and only a small quantity of des was needed to treat large volumes of bpa contaminated water recently the bpa extraction efficiency of dl menthol based des with different carboxylic acids in the 1 1 molar ratio was also reported by an et al 87 in this study a series of alcohols n butyl alcohol oleyl alcohol and acids hexanoic acid 1 dodecanol propionic acid decanoic acid acetic acid octanoic acid formic acid were examined as hbd the same authors also reported that dl menthol propionic acid and dl menthol formic acid displayed 98 2 and 99 0 extraction efficiency in 3 min for bpa using 0 75ml of des 4 ml of spiked water and bpa concentration of 100 mg l other important phenolic derivatives such as 3 chlorophenol 3 cp 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 4 dichlorophenol were extracted by hdess menthol thymol 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 des1 des2 des3 des4 menthol hexanoic acid 1 2 des5 menthol octanoic acid 1 2 des6 and menthol decanoic acid 1 2 des 7 from aqueous water by adeyemi et al 92 this is the first reported study on the extraction of 3 chlorophenols and 2 4 dichlorophenols with these seven hdess all synthesized hdes exhibited densities within 0 8 1 6 g cm3 and the viscosities of the menthol based hdess were 30 mpa s the reported lower viscosity of the menthol based hdess could be attributed to the strength of the hydrogen bond network between the hydrogen bond acceptor hba and the hydrogen bond donor hbd the extraction efficiency was above 94 and the extraction of chlorophenols followed the order 3 cp 2 4 dcp 2 cp with des 1 4 and 3 cp 2 cp 2 4 dcp for des 5 7 among the different dess studied des5 showed almost 99 extraction efficiencies for all chlorophenols more precisely the alkanoic acid based hdess exhibited generally higher extraction efficiencies than thymol based hdess this could be ascribed to the fact that alkanoic acids are more polar and possess more hydrogen bond acceptability tendencies than thymol based des this would further enhance the hydrogen bonding between the chlorophenols and the hdess composed of alkanoic acid resulting in higher extraction efficiency riveiro et al 88 reported the extraction of adipic acid levulinic acid and succinic acid using the two hydrophobic trioctylphosphine oxide topo based deep eutectic solvents dess through lle both topo decanoic acid decac and topo dodecanoic acid dodecac were found to be stable in water confirming that these dess can be used as extracting agents of the aforementioned acids in aqueous solutions the viscosity measurements indicated that des exhibit lower densities than water that is 0 8813 g cm3 and 0 8795 g cm3 at 298 15 k for topo decac and topo dodecac respectively the highest extraction efficiency was found to be above 70 for topo dodecac des for 10 g l of acid concentration at room temperature and the extraction capability of dess regarding the structure of the extracted acid is adipic acid levulinic acid succinic acid while when compared with des topo showed extraction efficiency above 97 and followed the order adipicacid succinic acid levulinic acid the better extraction efficiencies with topo over topo des can be attributed to the hydrogen bond interaction between the oxygen of the po group in topo and the oh group of the extracted acid on the other hand these po group is involved in the des formation in topo des and it is not freely available to form hydrogen bonds with the extracted acid which leads to lower efficiency mcgaughy et al 93 studied the liquid liquid extraction lle of furfural from water using n quaternary ammonium bromide ranging from tetramethylammonium n4444 br to tetraoctylammonium n8888 br as hba and decanoic acid and dodecanoic acid as hbd 1 3 using density functional theory dft modeling with experimental validations the cosmotherm modeling and experimental evaluation demonstrated that both hdes can remove furfural from aqueous water even at very low concentrations 0 1 mol

liquid phase microextraction lpme or solvent microextraction sme is a miniaturized form of conventional lle in which a few microliters of extraction solvent are used the main advantages of this method are high enrichment factor and low consumption of solvents and aqueous samples 94 recently dess and especially hdes have been successfully applied as extraction solvent that is a less toxic alternative to conventional toxic organic solvents kaur et al 89 synthesized dess by combining chcl and glycolic acid to extract eriochrome black t ebt dye from an aqueous solution using liquid liquid microextraction technique discharged effluent from various industries contains a toxic dye that must be treated before its release to the environment ebt has been identified as one of the most problematic anionic dyes due to its persistence in industrial effluents liquid liquid extraction has been demonstrated as an effective method for dye extraction however it requires a large volume of solvents longer extraction time and requires the use of organic solvents as previously mentioned liquid liquid microextraction is a more effective method for dye extraction since it requires a single drop of solvent and delivers high phase ratio values kaur et al used des as an extracting agent in the microextraction process due to its advantageous properties the combination of chcl and glycolic acid gave good separation performance for various compounds the molar ratio of ga chcl 2 1 gave the highest partition ratio 193 46 indicating a high affinity towards ebt 4 2 3 dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme is a small scale extraction technique that is used to extract small amounts of organic compounds from liquid samples this process is achieved by injecting a dispersive solvent and extraction solvent into the liquid solution afterward the solution is centrifuged to separate the aqueous and organic layers this process was developed for simple and rapid sample preparation for both on site applications and in the laboratory which requires only a manual syringe and a few micrometers of an extractive liquid in 2016 farajzadeh et al 95 are the first to utilize hydrophobic des as an extraction solvent for sample preparation in their study chcl and 4 chlorophenol were mixed at a molar ratio of 1 2 to extract pesticides from vegetables and fruit juice before gas chromatography flame ionization detection acetonitrile was used as a disperser which is miscible with both des and water the authors obtained an enrichment factor in the range of 312 482 and a wide linear range the hydrophobic des was enriched with 6 different types of pesticides indicating that des has potential in microextraction processes water immiscible hydrophobic des can be dispersed into an aqueous solution without a dispersive solvent by using an external physical disturbance such as ultrasound irradiation and air agitation an et al 96 demonstrated a method for the extraction of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp from wastewater by hdes the hdes was constructed by combining decanoic acid or octanoic acid as hbd with different hba of quaternary ammonium salts e g tetrabutylammonium chloride tetraoctylammonium chloride methyltrioctylammonium chloride and tetraheptylammonium chloride in a 1 2 molar ratio 1 ml of 1 Œºg ml standard solutions of 4 cp 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp was added to a 10 ml tube and then 100 Œºl of the hdes was added to the mixture this resulting 10 Œºl of the upper layer of the hdes phase containing the chlorophenol targets was directly analyzed using the hplc method fig 9 the hdes composed of methyltrioctylammonium chloride and octanoic acid hdes showed 90 8 to 93 0 recoveries for three chlorophenols with optimized conditions 100 Œºl of hdes 2 5 min extraction time room temperature the limits of detection were 0 05 Œºg ml with relative standard deviations between 1 8 and 3 1 and satisfactory extraction factors of 8 26 to 8 69 demonstrating the feasibility of this hydrophobic des based dllme method liu et al 98 utilized hdes for the extraction of five Œ≤ agonists including terbutaline clorprenaline tulobuterol clenbuterol and salbutamol from aqueous samples via the dllme method the methyltrioctylammonium chloride tac tetrabutylammonium chloride tbac and dodecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride dtac served as hba and decanoic acid octanoic acid and lauric acid as hbd in the synthesis of des in a molar ratio of 1 2 respectively in this work the hdes based on tbac octanoic acid showed high extraction efficiency of Œ≤ agonists from aqueous samples the optimized conditions are hdes 500 Œºl disperser volume 1000 Œºl and nacl 2 samples were analyzed using chiral lc ms analysis sadeghi et al 99 studied the thorium extraction using the dllme method for preconcentration of th iv in water and rock samples before uv vis spectrophotometric detection in this method thorin was used as a chelating agent cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as an ion pairing agent 1 hexyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide and 1 butyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide as hbas and salicylic acid and benzoic acid as hbds the hdes based on 1 hexyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide and salicylic acid 1 1 molar ratio under the optimal conditions

of five replicate measurements of th iv at 100 ng ml 1 nacs are highly toxic compounds present in the effluent wastewater from the tnt purification process the united states environmental protection agency us epa has listed these compounds as one of the 127 important pollutants in 2017 zarei et al 100 used a novel method for the preconcentration and determination of nitroaromatic compounds nacs in water based on the dispersive solid phase extraction dspe technique this approach is based on the dispersion of a solid sorbent in liquid samples to extract a specific analyte and is easier to perform and more economic than typical solid phase extraction introducing magnetic nanoparticles to dspe facilitates the removal of the sorbent however nanoparticles do not disperse effectively without the use of external sources also introducing nanoparticles in the nanofluid or colloidal gels form to the solution can increase the dispersion effectively moreover colloidal gels are easily prepared by dispersing nanoparticles in a hot base fluid in the same study 100 a thermally stable and magnetic colloidal gel made of multi wall carbon nanotubes and urea chcl was prepared and utilized in the dspe process for the enrichment of nacs in water the method achieved recovery values as high as 90 110 enrichment factors of 267 to 415 and a wider linear range than other common analytical approaches 4 2 4 ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme method associated with ultrasound irradiation ua dllme is attracting research interest as this method can improve the generation of droplets with and without dispersive solvents in this modified method organic solvent and a liquid dispersant mixture are added to the sample matrix resulting in the dispersion of the organic solvent which leads to the formation of solvent droplets after centrifugation the organic phase contains droplets of the organic solvent that are removed with the analyte using a micro syringe the organic solvent which was dispersed in the sample matrix in the presence of ultrasound irradiation facilitates the rapid formation of a steady state between both organic and aqueous phases by increasing the surface of analyte transfer thus accelerating the extraction process 101 panhwar et al 102 carried out a study on using des as an extracting solvent to determine the concentration and enrichment of aluminum ions al3 in water samples via ultrasound assisted phase microextraction method aluminum is a toxic element that causes neuropathological diseases if consumed the world health organization who has defined a maximum level of 200 Œºg l 1 in drinking water many reports are published on using organic solvents to extract aluminum ions via the liquid liquid extraction method however this method on a large scale is time consuming environmentally unfriendly and expensive liquid liquid microextraction has been recently found to overcome liquid liquid extraction drawbacks in addition utilizing des in the microextraction process lowers organic solvent discharge panhwar et al 102 reported synthesizing des by combining chcl and phenol oxalic acid and urea hbd at different molar ratios using ultrasound assisted liquid phase microextraction method ualpme for the extraction of aluminum a pre enrichment factor of 50 was observed which was measured from the ratio of the slopes of the calibration curves with and without des quantitative recoveries reached above 95 in the model studies for al3 this method is better than other established methods because of its simplicity and low cost makos et al 103 used novel hydrophobic des in ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction for the isolation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah analytes

camphor c and thymol with 10 undecylenic acid ua and deca the determination of analytes in des was carried out by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms in contrast with ionic liquids the nonionic nature of the selected des and the volatility of its components allow its use in gas chromatography analysis in addition its easy synthesis and nontoxicity are a good alternative to toxic chlorinated solvents the results show low limits of detection and quantitation good precision rsd 6 a wide linear range and an analyte recovery range from 76 to 126 5 a total of 16 pahs with concentrations ranging from 0 12 to 46 2 Œºg l 1 were determined in the effluent indicating the need for an effective treatment method this study illustrates the efficiency of des as a liquid liquid micro extractant zounr et al 104 demonstrated the ua lpme method for the extraction of cadmium in water and food samples using des in this study z n 3 5 diphenyl 1h pyrrol 2 yl 3 5 diphenyl 2h pyrrol 2 imine azo was

determination of aromatic amines in aqueous environmental samples 4 2 5 vortex assisted liquid liquid microextraction in 2010 yiantzi et al 108 introduced vortex assisted liquid liquid microextraction vallme a new microextraction method whereby vortex mixing was used for dispersion of low density extraction solvent into water because of the shorter diffusion distance and larger interfacial area the fine droplets can rapidly extract target analytes from water in contrast to other microextraction methods vortex agitation is a low cost and effective way to break and disperse extracting solvent droplets into the aqueous sample the main advantages of this method are the generation of fine droplets which enhances the interfacial area available for mass transfer emulsion formation could proceed without adding a disperser solvent this in return reduces the diffusion distance and improves the extraction rates enabling the analytes to reach partition equilibrium within a fast time the easy operational method and fast extraction resulted in the widespread application of vallme for the determination of a wide range of target analytes in aqueous solutions 109 tang et al 110 111 employed des in liquid liquid microextraction process to extract antibiotics from environmental water using vortex assisted method the antibiotics in environmental water targeted are ciprofloxacin cof and levofloxacin lof the authors of the aforementioned work demonstrated that a fatty acid based des is a good alternative to organic solvents in the microextraction process a total of 16 hydrophobic dess

and lof was above 94 8 in addition this method gives an acceptable limit of both detection and quantitation good linearity and high precision thus this method has the potential to replace organic solvents for the microextraction of antibiotics recently faraji 112 introduced the des for the extraction of two auxins indole 3 acetic acid iaa and 1 naphthaleneacetic acid naa in water and fruit juice samples and determination by high performance liquid chromatography the authors reported four hdess namely benzyltriethylammonium chloride bteac thymol trioctylmethylammonium chloride tomac butanol tomac isoamyl alcohol tomac octanol in a 1 4 molar ratio the experimental results showed that tomac isoamyl alcohol showed a high extraction recovery 94 0 99 8 for the target compounds the main advantages of the proposed method are simplicity good linearity high precision good sensitivity rapidity and low cost in another study by altunay et al 113 introduced the des based vallme for the extraction of arsenic and antimony from the sample matrix in their study chcl tetrabutyl ammonium chloride and trioctyl ammonium chloride were used as hba while phenol glycerol decanoic acid oxalic acid were applied as hbd in the 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 molar ratio respectively the dithizone was selected as the ph dependent selective ligand in the extraction process and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry was used for detecting as iii and sb iii concentration compared with the prepared des the 700 Œºl chcl oa 1 3 showed the best recovery of 87 because the oa acted as both a reducing and chelating agent or stabilizer for as iii and sb iii with a limit of detection of 7 5 ng l 1 and 15 6 ng l 1 and enhancement factors of 104 and 85 for as and sb respectively dess based on trioctylmethylammonium chloride and methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate be and isobutyl 4 hydroxybenzoate 1 1 were used for the extraction of cr vi from the water phase 114 using vallme the content of cr vi was measured by 1 5 diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometry the results showed that the extraction efficiency is 90 for ultra trace cr vi 0 51 Œºg l 1 and the preconcentration factor is up to 700 the extraction efficiency of cr iv in the presence of coexisting metal ions cd2 cu2 and organic compounds c6h10o5 n c6h12o6 h2o was also analyzed and found to be 2000 times that of cr vi the extraction efficiency is still above 90 114 4 2 6 shaker assisted liquid liquid microextraction in shaker assisted liquid liquid microextraction sallme method the device automatically mixes samples with a water immiscible extraction solvent through vigorous shaking well mixing of extraction solvent and the samples occurs 115 the extraction procedure can be easily implemented furthermore it is an innovative physical strategy that can rapidly eliminate the disperser solvent or surfactants in addition to saving time 116 li et al 117 119 utilized thymol based hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents for the extraction of antibiotics analysis in surface water by llme method coupling with shaker assisted method the hdes comprising thymol and heptanoic acid ha 2 1 exhibited the highest extraction efficiency for ofloxacin norfloxacin ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin using 100 Œºl of hdes in 10 ml of the aqueous sample with an incubation temperature of 52 c for 5 min the extracted antibiotics were analyzed using liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection analysis the proposed method showed good linearity in the 15 3000 ng ml 1 concentration range with a limit of detection of 3 0 ng ml 1 and a limit of quantification of 9 0 ng ml 1 with an accuracy of 84 1 113 65 sallme method combined with back extraction sallme be was employed by ahmadi et al 120 for the extraction of methylene blue mb using a des the 40 Œºl of methyltrioctylammonium bromide decanoic acid 1 2 des was used for the 10 ml of mb 50 ng ml 1 solution containing naoh 0 5 m this approach was employed for the extraction of mb from an alkaline solution and for its back extraction into an acidic aqueous solution the interference effects of cations such as fe2 fe3 cu2 ba2 ce2 co2 hg2 cd2 ni2 mn2 ca2 mg2 and ag and dyes such as rhodamine b ponceau s and nile blue were also investigated for mb 50 ng ml 1 among the tested cations mn2 ca2 and mg2 were the interfering ions and none of the tested dyes affected mb absorption for the back extraction step 70 Œºl of a solution containing hcl 2 m and ethanol 50 20 was used and was found effective in increasing the selectivity and calibration range of the method and lowering the limit of detection 4 2 7 air assisted liquid liquid microextraction air assisted liquid liquid microextraction aallme is a recently modified disperser solvent free approach of dllme in which the extraction solvent is dispersed into the aqueous phase with the help of air bubbles 116 in this method fine droplets of extraction solvent are formed by pulling in and pushing out the extraction solvent and sample mixture repeatedly using a syringe thus making the methods greener by avoiding the disperser solvent the hdes based on chcl and phenethyl alcohol ph etoh 1 4 was utilized at the service of air agitated emulsification microextraction for amphetamine type stimulants amphetamine and methamphetamine in human plasma and pharmaceutical wastewater 121 des was easily practicable due to low density via a homemade extraction cell without an extra emulsifier the procedure provides a relatively low lod 2 5 ng ml 1 value and good repeatability under 250 Œºl of des at ph 12 with air agitation cycles of 8 the method is characterized by a relatively low extraction recovery of analytes 63 66 with a df value close to 0 98 in another study ge et al 122 investigated the application of hdes for the preconcentration of benzophenone type uv filters from environmental water samples using aallme the dl menthol tbab and tbac were selected as hba and were combined with three straight chain monobasic acids namely octanoic acid decanoic acid and dodecanoic acid as hbd the corresponding dess were synthesized in the molar ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 the dl menthol and decanoic acid 1 1 des based aadllme approach showed potential for use in the analysis of trace bp type uv filters 2 2 4 4 tetrahydroxybenzophenone bp 2 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone bp 3 2 2 dihydroxy 4 4 dimethoxybenzophenone bp 6 and 4 hydroxybenzophenone 4oh bp in liquid samples the main outcome of this study is the rapid formation of fine droplets of the extraction solvent in the aqueous solution with the help of air assisted method without using a disperser solvent the extraction equilibrium was attained in a short period 1 min and exhibited good analytical features low lods short extraction time and good repeatability however to increase the dispersion efficiency of the extracting solvent several researchers tried the dispersing agent along with the air assisted method in aallme recently zounr et al 123 developed a simple and green des based aallme method for the separation and determination of lead in water and food samples in their study the chcl phenol chcl ph was applied as des and 4 2 thiazolylazo resorcinol as a complexing agent for lead ions 600 Œºl of des 1 4 as hydrophilic extraction solvent was added to an aqueous solution containing 30 ml 25 ng l of pb ii and 500 Œºl of 4 2 thiazolylazo resorcinol 0 1 w v at ph 6 then 800 Œºl of thf was added and mixed into a homogenous solution upon the addition of thf a turbid solution was achieved this is because thf was used as a demulsifying solvent which interacts with water and eases extraction the concentration of lead was analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaas the authors claimed that the proposed procedure has good selectivity for pb ii in the presence of other interfering ions and almost 100 recoveries were obtained with low detection limit low relative standard deviation and high preconcentration factor compared with other reported works thus this work was simple efficient less expensive rapid less toxic and has better extraction efficiency of targeted metal ions similar work was done by lamei et al 124 for the extraction of methadone from water and biological samples using chcl and 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 5 5 8 8 tetramethylnaphthalen 2 ol tno in 1 2 des in this procedure des droplets were dispersed in the sample solution by air assisted method and tetrahydrofuran was used as a demulsifier solvent into a homogeneous solution for providing a turbid state the 10 ml glass syringe was used and hdes was injected 10 times to enhance the turbidity of the solution and disperse the aggregated des droplets into an aqueous phase the appropriate recovery for methadone from water and biological samples was 98 4 101 2 with a limit of detection 7 0 Œºg l 1 and a limit of quantification 3 2 Œºg l 1 4 2 8 emulsification liquid liquid microextraction in emulsification liquid liquid microextraction method ellme an emulsifier is used for the dispersion of extraction solvent in aqueous media thus the procedure needs no external sources such as ultrasound irradiation or shaker the main problem is the toxicity of the emulsifier ellme based des is a simple inexpensive green and rapid method and based on self aggregation and emulsification of dess in water phase medium khezeli et al 125 have also tested the microextraction of benzene toluene ethylbenzene bte and seven polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from water samples using dess as water miscible extraction solvent three different dess were prepared by combining phenol and chcl in 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 molar ratios the dess were separated from aqueous solution by adding aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran thf acetone or 1 4 dioxane or after extraction by des the two phases were separated by centrifugation phase rich with des was withdrawn using a micro syringe and submitted to isocratic reverse phase hplc with uv detection results demonstrate that this method is successful for the determination of target analytes in water the concentration of benzene in des was in the range of 10 to 200 Œºg l 1 0 1 400 Œºg l 1 for anthracene benzo a pyrene phenanthrene and pyrene 1 400 Œºg l 1 for ethylbenzene biphenyl chrysene and fluorene and 10 400 Œºg l 1 for toluene yang et al 126 127 developed a method for determining the concentration of phenolic compounds in a large volume of water using acid based des via microextraction technique this is the first report on the use of des in a large volume of aqueous samples to extract phenolic compounds authors prepared a range of fatty acids n octanoic acid c8 1 nonanoic acid c9 dodecanoic acid c12 that can act as both hbds and hbas for the synthesis of hydrophobic des properties were adjusted by altering the molar ratio and fatty acid type water containing phenol with a volume of 1000 ml was then prepared and a selected des was added to the solution an emulsifying agent nh3 h2o was added to the mixture to form an emulsion the gas assisted mixing was then used to separate the two phases the fast gas transfer rate increases the distribution ratio between the two phases giving excellent mixing for large water volume the authors selected n2 for the gas mixing process since the hydroxyl group on its surface makes it prone to capture the des phase in the mixture the experimental process is shown in fig 10 phenolic compounds are recovered by adding hcl to the emulsion phase results show that the volume of the emulsifying agent and des can significantly affect the extraction efficiency while sample volume does not affect the extraction efficiency ternary dess c8 c9 c12 with a molar ratio of 3 2 1 gave the highest extraction efficiency 91 0 of phenolic compounds 400 Œºl of nh3 h2o and 2000 Œºl of des gave the highest extraction efficiency 4 2 9 hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction the hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction hflpme method was first developed by pedersen bjergaard and rasmussen 128 in which a low cost and disposable piece of a porous polypropylene hollow fiber is used in this method the hollow fiber is placed in the sample and then the membrane phase is formed by immobilizing organic solvent in the pores of the hollow fiber afterwards the internal lumen of the hollow fiber is filled with an acceptor solution the analytes are extracted from the aqueous samples into the membrane phase and then into the acceptor solution generally a two phase or three phase configuration can be used in hflpme in a two phase configuration the acceptor phase is the same as the organic solvent used in the liquid membrane while in the three phase configuration a three phase extraction system can be obtained by using the acceptor solution as an aqueous solution seidi et al 129 considered the introduction of chcl eg 1 1 based des as the acceptor phase in a three phase carrier mediated hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction cm hflpme for the preconcentration of raloxifene and ethinylestradiol in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants combined with hplc uv

the raloxifene and ethinylestradiol analytes were extracted from 17 ml basic solution as the supported liquid membrane n octanol containing n n n cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab and then back extracted into the acceptor phase des and hcl the important experimental factors including sample extraction time ph hcl concentration and ctab amount were optimized using a central composite design ccd the preconcentration factors of raloxifene and ethinylestradiol were found to be 86 and 53 and the limits of detections lods were found to be 5 0 ng ml 1 for raloxifene and 10 ng ml 1 for ethinylestradiol respectively morelli et al 130 used the thymol camphor 1 1 des as an extraction solvent for hollow fiber microporous membrane liquid liquid microextraction hf mmlle for the multiclass determination of 11 compounds classified as emerging contaminants in water to replace the common toxic organic solvents the thymol camphor mixture was impregnated into the polypropylene membrane pores for 10 min the optimized parameters were obtained by multi and univariate models and extractions were done using 1 5 ml of water sample at ph 6 for 50 min without the addition of salt while desorption was carried out in a mixture of acetone methanol 3 1 v v for 15 min the quantification was conducted by hplc with a diode array detection dad relative recoveries were performed in tap and stream water and ranged from 64 to 123 with limits of detection ranging from 0 3 to 6 1 Œºg l 1 4 2 10 solidification of floating drop dispersive liquid liquid microextraction leung et al 200 2008 introduced a new method of dispersion liquid liquid microextraction based on solidifying floating organic droplets dllme sfo in this method solvents with a lower density of water are applied as a liquid extractor at room temperature and the extraction is the basis of the classic dllme that is an extraction solvent together with a dispersion solvent immiscible with the sample solution and the extraction solvent with only the exception that the extractor solvent solidifies at relatively high temperatures and therefore this makes its separation is easy 131 the hdess that are lighter than water were successfully applied for the extraction of organic and inorganic compounds from aqueous samples in dllme sfo for these purposes the hdes based on 1 octyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride omim cl 1 octyl 2 3 dimethylimidazolium chloride odmim cl 1 decyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride dmim cl 1 decyl 2 3 dimethylimidazolium chloride ddmim cl and 1 dodecyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride c12mim cl as hba and 1 dodecanol as hbd was used as an extraction solvent based on the sfd dllme coupled with high performance liquid chromatography for the determination of five benzoylureas diflubenzuron triflumuron hexaflumuron flufenoxuron and lufenuron in real water samples 132 40 Œºl of 1 decyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride c10mim cl and 1 dodecoh 1 2 showed approximately 81 38 97 67 recoveries for all five benzoylureas with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 9994 to 0 9997 the limits of detection 0 09 0 16 Œºg l 1 and the enrichment factors were in the range of 171 188 a novel dllme sfo method was developed by el deen et al 133 using tetrabutylammonium bromide as hba and a set of aliphatic acids formic acid acetic acid and propionic acid and ethylene glycol eg as hbd based des 1 2 as a dispersive solvent and 2 dodecanol as an extractant for series of steroids in this method very small quantity of 2 dodecanol 50 0 Œºl and des 231 0 Œºl were required in the whole extraction procedure for steroids this method revealed correlation coefficients of 0 998 with low detection limits in the range of 1 0 9 7 ng ml 1 and high inter and intra day precision 5 with high preconcentration factors 44 112 for the nine concerning steroids moreover the method was successfully applied to determine the concerned steroids in different real aqueous samples with an expanded measurement uncertainty of the results 17 at a 95 confidence level mostafavi et al 134 applied the theoretical studies using the same method for the extraction of selenium from water samples using hdes benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and 1 undecanol 1 dodecanol 2 dodecanol n hexadecane and 1 decanol in different molar ratios combined with uv vis spectrophotometry the analytical signal was linear

another study yousefi et al 135 demonstrated the application of hdes tetra n butyl ammonium bromide tbab and carboxylic acids oleic acid decanoic acid octanoic acid propionic acid acrylic acid acetic acid and butyric acid 1 2 for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons naphthalene 99 0 fluorene 98 0 phenanthrene 99 5 anthracene 99 0 fluoranthene 98 0 and pyrene using microextraction methods based on solidification of floating drop method from environmental water samples by coupling this method with high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection 80 Œºl of the tbab decanoic acid des as the extraction solvent for the 20 ml of sample solution displayed 83 to 117 recovery with good linearity and low limits of detection of 0 7 6 6 ng l 1 4 2 11 reactive liquid liquid extraction method reactive liquid liquid extraction method rlle is a promising method for the recovery of carboxylic acids from water samples generally in this method a reaction between the solute and extractant molecules occurs at the interface of the aqueous and organic phases in which the transfer of the solute molecules occurs by the diffusion and solubilization mechanism the nonaromatic water immiscible polar solvents with intermediate molecular weights and high boiling points are commonly utilized as extractant solvents to obtain high distribution and selectivity the extraction of solute strongly depends on the organic phase composition aqueous phase composition types of complexes 1 1 2 1 etc formed type of solvent properties of the solvent extractant and diluent temperature and ph 137 toprak√ßƒ± et al 138 applied reactive liquid liquid extraction rlle for the removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d from aqueous solution using menthol carboxylic acid based dess the best 2 4 d removal was obtained by menthol formic acid 1 2 molar ratio by almost 2 3 times than other synthesized des that is 90 of 2 4 d were extracted by the recommended method with the designed solvent thermodynamics studies showed that the transfer of 2 4 d from the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic des phase is a spontaneous and endothermic process hence driven by entropy the same dess menthol and carboxylic acids acetic acid and formic acid 1 1 and 1 2 were used for the extraction of carbamazepine by pekel et al in rllle 139 the deep eutectic liquid was used as the extractant while diethyl succinate acted as a diluent in their work 138 the authors proposed menthol acetic acid 1 1 des as the best extractant as it enhanced the extraction performance approximately 5 9 times that of conventional diethyl succinate more than 90 of the target pharmaceutical compound was extracted from its aqueous solution in 30 min based on thermodynamics studies the transfer process of carbamazepine from the aqueous phase into the hydrophobic phase is endothermic and spontaneous in nature another study by kurtulba≈ü et al 140 reported on using menthol acetic acid des for the extraction of diclofenac from its aqueous medium was investigated by rlle the removal of diclofenac was found to be 80 through the proposed des and diethyl succinate system similar to the above works thermodynamics of the diclofenac transfer from the aqueous environment to the organic phase containing des was observed to be a spontaneous and endothermic process which is incentivized by entropy 4 2 12 single drop microextraction single drop microextraction sdme is one of the simplest and most powerful variants of the preconcentration liquid phase microextraction technique there are two different extraction modes those involving two liquid phases sample extraction from an aqueous sample solution to an organic solvent or three phases extraction from the aqueous sample solution to an organic solvent and then a subsequent transfer to an aqueous drop back extraction 110 111 sdme generally need a common micro syringe with no need for non dependence on sophisticated apparatus or tools with which to conduct it the sdme technique has extended to direct immersion di mode and the headspace hs mode in di mode the droplet is directly immersed in the sample and the main disadvantage of di sdme is the stability of the droplet which depend on the used organic solvent in hs mode it avoids the possible interferences from the sample matrix and has been widely used in the extraction of the more volatile compounds the application of des in the di sdme technique is not explored yet however the only reported study with hdes is the use of dl menthol deca 1 2 based des for the extraction and preconcentration of explosives in water coupled with ferrofluid of montmorillonite nanocomposite mmt fe3o4 des without using any additional stabilizer 141 in this method a micro droplet of ferrofluid des was suspended into the vortex of a stirring aqueous solution collected from the well and surface water near the explosive manufacturing site and after completing the extraction process ferrofluid des was easily removed from the aqueous solution by a magnetic rod the relative recoveries for explosives are in the range of 88 to 104 for 50 Œºl ferrofluid des and 10 ml of sample solution the limits of detection 0 22 0 91 Œºg l 1 the enrichment factors 23 and 93 and the relative standard deviations were 10 showed the potential application of hydrophobic ferrofluid for the extraction of emerging materials in the wastewater yousefi et al 136 reported the hdes composed of chcl as hba with phenol chlorophenol and resorcinol as hbd 1 2 combined with magnetic multiwall carbon nanotube nanocomposite des mbg applied for the determination of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene in water and urine samples using hs sdme technique in this method the 30 ml of sample solution 50 Œºg l 1 in 20 nacl w v were used and 20 Œºl of the des mbg micro drop with rod magnet as an acceptor phase for the extraction procedure after extraction at room 30 c an external magnet was used for isolating des mbg from the solution the limit of detection of 0 05 0 90 ng ml 1 an enrichment factor of 520 587 linearity range of 0 2 2000 ng ml 1 and the relative recoveries 92 0 105 3 proved that coupling des mbgs with hs sdme can result in a powerful fast and facile method for the trace analysis of volatile compounds in water samples 4 3 des as a surface modifier 4 3 1 solid phase extraction the solid phase extraction spe is similar to liquid solid extraction the isolation and separation of analytes from a liquid is done using a solid adsorbent in this method spe columns packed with small quantities of various chromatographic sorbents such as silica florisil or alumina are used for normal phase separations while nonpolar bonded silica phases or polymers are used for reversed phase separations in comparison with liquid liquid extraction spe is easy requires less solvent has no emulsions formation needs smaller sample volumes and it is much more amenable to automation however the main limitation of spe is the low selectivity and adsorption capacity because the adsorption of analytes is mainly based on the chemical nature of adsorbents that is the adhesion of atoms ions or molecules from a liquid or a gas to a surface organic solvents are conventionally used as functionalizing agents to enhance the surface charge of adsorbents and increase the adsorption capacity for a variety of contaminants 142 although organic solvents are efficient functionalizes they are hazardous and are considered air pollutants 143 deep eutectic solvents can be used instead as functionalizing agents for adsorbents and give a similar increase of the adsorption capacity without any negative environmental impact in addition the lower cost and simple preparation make them more favorable since 2015 various studies have reported using hydrophobic des as functionalizing agent for carbon nanotubes to adsorb various contaminants from water carbon nanotubes exhibit excellent adsorption properties for a wide range of impurities in water such as lead and mercury but oxidative functionalizing is normally used to enhance its properties which requires the use of organic solvents utilizing dess as surface functionalizing agents can give a similar increase in the charge of carbon nanotubes surfaces without any offsets alomar and coworkers 144 were the first to use dess in functionalizing adsorbents the authors functionalized carbon nanotubes using des for the adsorption of hg2 ions from water mercury is a toxic element that is present in freshwater seawater and the waste streams of many industries when mercury concentration exceeds 1 Œºl l in water it becomes dangerous to consume even at such low concentration levels there are several conventional techniques to remove mercury ions from water such as ion exchange and filtration but alomar et al 144 145 reported that adsorption has been proven as the most suitable for industrial scale carbon nanotubes cnts were used as effective adsorbents for mercury from water samples while the functionalization with a des prepared from tetra n butyl ammonium bromide tbab as hba and gly as hbd served to enhance the surface charge of the cnts the modified materials showed a great affinity towards different compounds including hg2 ions the adsorption capacity of the material for hg2 ions was found to be 177 76 mg g which agreed with the published data in addition functionalizing cnts with the des increased surface area significantly from 123 54 m2 g to 204 52 m2 g which explains the increased adsorption capacity alomar et al 145 have also reported using allyl bromide atpb based des functionalized carbon nanotubes for the removal of mercury from water allyl triphenylphosphonium bromide was combined with gly as the hbd to form des which can act as a novel cnts functionalization agent response surface methodology was used to optimize the removal conditions for hg2 the optimum removal conditions were found to be ph 5 5 contact time of 28 min and an adsorbent dosage of 5 mg the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the experimental data was 186 97 mg g which is higher than that of tbab with gly reported by the same authors another study by alomar et al 146 reported using functionalized carbon nanotube with des to extract arsenic ions from water cnts have shown a great affinity for interaction with arsenic ions especially after surface functionalization two dess were tested for surface functionalization methyltri phenylphosphonium bromide mtpb and benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride btpc salts as hba in combination with gly as an hbd optimization studies were carried out utilizing rsm ccd experimental designs to estimate the optimum removal conditions for each adsorbent the adsorption experimental data of the two adsorbents was found to fit well with the pseudo second order kinetics the freundlich and the langmuir adsorption isotherm models results show that the surface charge increased drastically after functionalizing and the maximum capacity obtained was 23 4 mg g with mtpb as salt lead can enter plumbing water if the pipes contain lead corrode exposure to lead results in serious health consequences even at low concentrations because of this the epa has set the maximum contamination limit at zero 148 alomar et al 147 have also synthesized six various deep eutectic solvents for carbon nanotubes to absorb lead ions pb ii from water the solvents were based on chcl and with different hbds namely gly eg diethylene glycol deg triethylene glycol teg urea and malonic acid ma studies for over 24 different des cnt have been conducted and the removal capacity has been optimized using rsm ccd experimental design in addition an optimization study was performed to find the ideal conditions for pb ii sorption onto the novel adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 288 4 mg g using cnts functionalized with kmno4 and teg based des kteg cnts the optimum conditions were ph 5 adsorbent dosage of 5 mg l and contact time of 15 min ibrahim et al 149 150 used functionalized carbon nanotubes with deep eutectic solvents to adsorb methyl orange mo from an aqueous solution methyl orange is an example of a toxic azo dye that is discharged into water by various industries such as pharmaceutical and paper industries several methods have been reported for azo dyes like electrochemical treatment and reverse osmosis however the adsorption technique is more cost efficient and advantageous than other techniques it has low energy requirements and its operational design is simple ibrahim et al prepared two deep eutectic solvents dess using eg and two different ammonium based salts which are chcl and n n diethylethanolammonium chloride dac the surface area of carbon nanotubes has reached 197 8 m2 g by adding des functional groups to the surface of carbon nanotubes no damage to the surface of carbon nanotubes has been reported after functionalization the adsorption conditions have also been optimized with removal conditions at ph 2 0 adsorbent dosage of 10 0 mg and contact time around 60 min the maximum adsorption capacity has reached 310 2 mg g and 263 14 mg g for chcl eg cnt and dac eg cnt respectively gissawong et al 151 developed tetrabutylammonium bromide tbabr and various fatty acids heptanoic acid decanoic acid and 4 phenylbutyric acid based des in different molar ratios and these des embedded in the melamine the des embedded sponge for the removal of acid blue 29 ab29 malachite green mg disperse yellow 3 dy3 disperse orange 25 do25 congo red cr acid red 73 ar73 rhodamine b rb basic black 2 bb2 acid black 24 ab24 basic blue 12 bb12 and reichardt s dye from water samples and soil in this study the melamine sponge helped in the phase separation of des from the aqueous solution and also enhanced the removal of the target pollutants by their adsorption into its pores the strong hydrophobic interaction between target pollutants and des was responsible for the enhanced removal the authors concluded that the proposed method was simple rapid environmentally friendly and effective with the removal efficiency higher than 65 for all target pollutants mehrabi et al 177 hypothesized the surface functionalization of go with chcl urea here dess can provide a new route to conjugate pre synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles onto go nanosheets at different go fe3o4 ratios des go fe3o4 nanohybrids synergistically enhanced adsorption than both go and fe3o4 as adsorbents for organic dyes methylene blue mb and heavy metals lead ii however the adsorption behavior was dependent on the ratio of go and fe3o4 in the nanohybrid the des go fe3o4 1 2 0 3 mg ml showed a 100 mb removal performance for 25 mg l mb within 5 min and the des go fe3o4 1 1 showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 120 5 1 3 mg g for lead ii at initial analyte concentration of 150 mg l marullo et al 152 used the eutectogels as nanostructured sorbents for the removal of cationic dyes methyl violet mv rhodamine b and methylene blue from water the authors prepared natural eutectogels based on the chcl eg gly phenylacetic acid 1 2 des with a series of l amino acids l proline l tryptophan l isoleucine l leucine l phenylalanine fmoc lphenylalanine fmoc l isoleucine the best efficiency was observed towards acidic solutions in which the gels performed better than the des itself the best performing eutectogel was based on l phenylalanine giving a better removal efficiency for dyes in single dye solution as well as binary mixtures owing to its larger surface area and good recyclability in addition the gel can be used in columns for the removal of mv dye from flowing water with a removal efficiency of 85 the gel loaded columns can be reused four times with only a minor drop in relative recovery percentage the result obtained demonstrates good potential for the scale up of the process authors claimed that the main advantages of eutectogels are their low environmentally impacting nature and their recycling does not require intermediate washing which leads to decreasing the amount of waste derived from the whole process lawal et al 153 154 illustrated the application of glycerol hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide 1 2 des as an efficient modifier of low cost adsorbent prepared from biomass hyd des for the removal of pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin cip and acetaminophen acte and acid blue 74 ab74 they have studied the column adsorption capacity effect of pollutant concentration and effect of flow rate were studied using thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart model furthermore batch adsorption experiments were performed to study the effect of effect ph time dose and concentration the almost 100 adsorptive ability of hyd des on the pollutants is in the order ab74 cip acte probably due to multiple mechanisms through weak van der waal forces and electrostatic interactions the kinetic studies showed that ab74 cip and acte followed the pseudo second order the same group of authors 153 154 also synthesized des functionalized cnt znco2o4 des nanoparticles for the adsorption of eosin y they selected des that consists of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and glycerol 1 2 due to its already reported high adsorption capacity the percentage removal of 30 ml 100 mg l 1 dye solution was 40 for cnt znco2o4 0 02 g and above 90 for cnt zn co2o4 des 0 02 g these results indicate that the sorption efficiency of des modified cnt zn co2o4 is far better than the unmodified cnt zn co2o4 kinetic studies revealed that pseudo second order kinetics followed by both samples li et al 118 introduced the magnesium oxide micro nanostructured materials with des for dye adsorption synthesized from the mgcl2 6h2o and urea molar ratio of 1 2 via a solvothermal method followed by calcination the studies revealed that the adsorption capacity of the mgo microcubes towards congo red cr amaranth ar and indigo carmine ic are found to be 666 7 43 74 and 54 32 mg g 1 at 25 c respectively this was attributed to the fact that the hierarchical porous structure of mgo could provide plenty of active sites which provide electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions for the pollutant removal the adsorption kinetics data conformed to the pseudo second order model and the isotherms are described by the langmuir model 4 3 2 magnetic solid phase extraction magnetic solid phase extraction mspe is a different separation method that uses magnetic adsorptions to extract target materials in aqueous solutions magnetic adsorbents can be extracted from the system easily and efficiently making them more favorable over other conventional adsorbents chen et al 155 156 reported utilizing mspe to extract mercury from real contaminated water using magnetic carbon dioxide nanoparticles that are modified with fe3o4 and coated with ternary hydrosulphonyl based deep eutectic solvent the maximum achieved adsorption capacity was 215 1 mg g and with a removal efficiency of 99 91 after 7 cycles of adsorption the removal efficiency dropped to only 90 23 without using des as a functionalizing agent magnetic graphene oxide nanoparticles have a removal efficiency of 34 76 155 156 wang et al 157 investigated the extraction efficiency of fe3o4 coated with polydopamine pda and des fe3o4 pda des for the herbicides sulfosulfuron pyrazosulfuron ethyl bensulfuron methyl and halosulfuron methyl from aqueous samples in this work dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride hba and 4 chlorophenolin hbd in 1 5 molar ratio based hdes were coated on fe3o4 pda the presented method showed the limits of detections varied from 0 0098 to 0 0110 g l with good linearity 5 0 200 g l 1 and extraction recoveries were between 61 3 and 108 6 for all analytes the chcl with a different hydrogen bond donor including eg oxalic acid or urea based des coated fe3o4 mnps was used for the extraction of lead and cadmium from environmental water samples using the mspe technique 158 the sample volume of 60 ml resulted in a preconcentration factor of 100 the 1 2 5 chcl urea des 200 Œºl showed high extraction capacity for lead 25 0 mg g and cadmium 23 7 mg g with the detection limits 0 4 and 0 1 Œºg l 1 and the linear dynamic ranges 2 to 250 Œºg l 1 0 5 to 30 Œºg l 1 for lead and cadmium recently jamshidi et al 159 introduced the polymeric des for the extraction of pesticides using a magnetic based solid phase extraction process in this method they successfully synthesized the magnetic fe3o4 poly acrylic acid menthol 1 2 des hydrogel using thermal frontal polymerization process and applied it as an extractant for the series of pesticides including lindane alachlor aldrin bromophos methyl heptachlor epoxide Œ± endosulfan hexaconazole dieldrin endrin Œ≤ endosulfan diazinon endosulfan sulfate bromopropylate fenpropathrin tetradifon and fenvalerate determined by gc ms analysis the ph dependent studies found that this polymer hydrogel was unstable in alkaline solutions and the best results were obtained at ph 6 using 0 2 g of extractant for the 5 ml pesticides solution the validation results showed that this polymer hydrogel could act as an excellent sorbent for these pesticides with lods were in the range of 0 001 0 120 Œºg l 1 enrichment factors were obtained from 152 to 550 and the linear range was between 0 003 and 20 Œºg l 1 the optimized method was applied for the extraction of pesticides in different real environmental water samples and the observed recoveries were in the range of 61 0 120 0 the magnetic polymer hydrogel yielded twice higher recovery efficiencies than those of the unpolymerized des due to the extra porosity large specific surface area and enhanced selectivity furthermore it could be easily recovered with a magnet wei et al 160 utilized benzyltributylammonium chloride lactic acid des 1 2 to regulate magnetic fe3o4 metal organic framework muio 66 nh2 composites des muio 66 nh2 the obtained nanoparticles were then used as adsorbents to adsorb ofloxacin and mefenamic acid the study showed that the adsorption capacity of des muio 66 nh2 towards ofloxacin and mefenamic acid reached up to 97 60 and 79 22 mg g respectively with prominent anti interference ability and outstanding regeneration capability and reusability the mechanism study indicated that the adsorption capacity of des muio 66 nh2 towards ofloxacin and mefenamic acid due to the electrostatic interaction chelation hydrophobic interaction œÄ œÄ stacking and hydrogen bonding present in the des in another study li et al 119 used poly dimethylsiloxane pdms fiber coated with hdes as sorbent for extractive determination of toluene ethylbenzene and o xylene from water samples coupled with gas chromatography with flame ionization detector gc fid the des based ethyl 4 hydroxybenzoate and methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride 2 1 were selected in this procedure results revealed the coating surface on pdms des gave a highly porous structure which was responsible for 3 times higher extraction performance than the homemade pdms fiber the linear range of the proposed method lied between 10 and 1000 Œºg l 1 and the limit of detection was in the range from 0 005 to 0 025 Œºg l 1 4 3 3 advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely used for water treatment processes for their high efficiency and easy operation persulfate based aops specifically have been extensively studied and applied in environmental remediation for contaminates degradation due to their high oxidation potential and persulfate stability 161 however in recent years many kinds of organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals dyes pesticides have emerged to degrade these pollutants the activation in the persulfate is important as the persulfate alone has weak oxidation potential 162 hence various activation methods have been investigated to increase the oxidation efficiency carbon based catalysts have great potential to activate the persulfate their electron rich functional groups and the actives sites located on the carbon basal plane are effective for lengthening and splitting the peroxide oo bond of peroxydisulfate 155 156 163 164 several studies have incorporated carbonaceous materials such as cnts nanodiamonds and reduced graphene oxide into water as metal free catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants 110 111 165 they were proven to be effective due to their high conductivity and low dimensional structure however the high cost of fabrication and their toxicity are the main limitations for using these carbon based catalysts on a large application on the other hand biochar which is produced by the pyrolysis of biomass in the absence of oxygen can be easily prepared is environmentally friendly and cost effective 166 several studies have reported biochar with good peroxydisulfate activation for pollutant degradation via its carbon bridge role and reactive species generation 167 202 however the structure of biochar is complex and disordered which hinders electron transfer and consumes radicals making its application less satisfactory 168 this issue could be solved by tuning and the structure and the surface properties to minimize the limitations of its application however this requires the use of acids and alkalis to tune the pore structure and surface properties of biochar to expose the active sites but these reagents are toxic and risks damage to the ecological environment in a recent study ye et al 169 utilized dess for the surface medication and structural engineering of nitrogen doping on biochar derived from filaments biomass nrbf results showed that fine tuning the surface of nrbf with choline chloride urea des helped achieve more regular structure and better configuration and allowed the introduction of nitrogen which improved the catalytic performance in terms of peroxydisulfate activation the modified nrbf has a 4 5 times higher degradation rate for tetracycline in comparison with pristine biochar this was attributed to the more regular structure which facilitated the electron transfer and the higher cluster number of aromatic compounds with n doping furthermore the non radical nrbf pds system showed good potential for bacteria inactivation and disinfection applications these results open more opportunities for developing metal free catalysts for water purification applications on the basis that dess can be used for structural and nitrogen modification in addition to surface modification dess can be used as precursors dispersants or templates for the preparation of various nanomaterials or carbocatalysts to enhance their catalytic properties for example using chcl urea assisted method nickel nickel nitride nanocomposites with various morphologies and compositions were prepared 170 in another study zno particles were synthesized by ionothermal precipitation using chcl eg 171 the nanomaterials fabricated using dess were stable and had superior catalytic efficiency for the degradation of various organic pollutants in water treatment processes yang et al 126 127 have also utilized fecl3 catalyzed des for the preparation of cellulose nanocrystals cncs cncs can be impeded in membranes and filters to remove heavy metals microbes pesticides and dyes from water the optimum composition for fecl3 catalyzed des is the mass ratio of 4 1 0 2 for oxalic acid dihydrate choline chloride and fecl3 6h2o respectively results show that the produced cncs had higher thermal stability in comparison with sulfuric acid hydrolyzed cncs furthermore the carboxyl groups on the surface of cncs introduced by esterification gave better dispersion stability in water the prepared fecl3 catalyzed des can be separated and used to prepare cncs at least three times zhang et al 172 also used acidic des for the synthesis of biochar using a simple one pot method the biomass treated in acidic des p toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate choline chloride had high content of carbon porous structure and was rich in oxygen containing functional groups these excellent properties enable its use in various water treatment applications 4 4 extractive distillation extractive distillation is a form of separation that uses a high boiling and non volatile solvent that does not form an azeotrope in the mixture this method of separation is used when the components have a low value of relative volatility making typical distillation not possible the solvent selected must change relative volatility drastically enough to allow for separation and must be easily separated from the bottom products gjineci et al 173 have tested two chcl based dess as entrainment substances for the separation of ethanol from their ethanol water mixture distillation is impossible using ordinary distillation and the addition of an entrainer makes the mixture easier to separate usually entrainers added are chemically heavy and environmentally unfriendly gjineci et al 173 tested chcl teg 1 3 and chcl urea 1 2 as des entrainers because of its negligible vapor pressure and wide liquid range the vapor liquid equilibrium data show that the addition of des to the mixture removes the azeotropic point completely by using a concentration of 5 5 w w for chcl urea 1 2 the selected dess were also found to be biodegradable unlike ionic liquids in addition 1h nmr analysis showed that the des could be recycled and reused qui et al 174 have developed the process of extractive distillation of water ethanol mixture using chcl urea 1 2 as entrainer by modeling it and analyzing it using aspen plus to demonstrate its practicality in large scale production the schematic illustration of the ethanol dehydration using des is shown in fig 11 deep eutectic solvents can also be used to separate acetonitrile from water acetonitrile is an important organic solvent that has many applications in the industry several industries produce a mixture of acetonitrile and water as waste streams however its separation from water is problematic as it has a minimum boiling azeotrope at 67 4 mol acn at 349 5 k and 101 32 kpa 175 extraction distillation has been proven as the best separation technique for bulk production of acetonitrile they synthesized ammonium based des and tested their feasibility as an extracting agent for the separation of water and acetonitrile mixture using extractive distillation glycolic acid and tetramethylammonium chloride tmac with a 3 1 molar ratio was used to prepare the des tmac is known to have several advantages over ionic liquids that include easy synthesis less toxicity and good biodegradability in addition it is non reactive with water and shares many physicochemical properties with ionic liquids the data of pseudo ternary vapor liquid equilibrium vle of water glycolic acid tetramethylammonium chloride gtm 3 1 was determined at 101 kpa by keeping the des concentration constant results indicated that ammonium based des can improve relative volatility and successfully remove the azeotrope from the system jiang et al 176 tested dess as entertainers for the separation of allyl alcohol from water using extractive distillation a mixture of allyl alcohol and water is produced during the production of epichlorohydrin a compound used in making plastics and other polymers via the propyl acetate method allyl alcohol forms an azeotrope with water making its separation via conventional distillation difficult they tested two dess as entrainment substances chcl urea and chcl glycerin at the molar ratios of 1 2 and 1 1 respectively the vapor liquid equilibrium data for the system was determined at 101 3 kpa results showed that adding chc urea at a concentration of 15 and adding chcl glycerin at a concentration of 10 removes the azeotropic point enabling extractive distillation 4 5 mechanism and by products in the pollutant extraction process using dess the mechanism of extraction of analytes from their aqueous media into deep eutectic solvents and the by products formed are essential as it aids the acquisition of insightful understanding of the process and its further development consequently there have been numerous studies 28 89 91 92 110 111 114 178 182 that have reported the mode of extraction of analytes from water using different techniques such as ftir nmr dls tem toc cosmo rs in one of such studies almustafa et al 180 examined the mechanism of extraction of boron in aqueous solution with menthol 2 methyl 2 4 pentanediol 2 1 men mpd 2 1 and thymol 2 methyl 2 4 pentanediol 2 1 thy mpd 2 1 the mechanism for the extraction of boron was presumed to be through the formation of mpd complex with boron with ftir spectra evaluation before and after extraction they observed that two new absorption peaks were formed after the extraction of boron with men mpd fig 12a the two peaks consist of one between 1155 cm 1 and 1175 cm 1 co stretching vibration and another between 1310 cm 1 and 1372 cm 1 bo stretching vibration moreover they discovered a stretching vibration of o ch2 moieties which was attributed to the peak at 1512 cm 1 after the extraction of boron with thy mpd hdes it was noted that these moieties the symmetric bo stretching with absorption peak at 1317 cm 1 and the co stretching vibrations with peaks appearing at 856 and 898 cm 1 the extraction mode through complex formation between boric acid and the mpd in the hdes was validated in another study van osch et al 91 studied the mechanism of extraction of chloride ion of different salts from water with lidocaine decanoic acid based hdess using total organic carbon and nmr analysis in order to explain the low distribution coefficient for the extraction of chloride ion from aqueous medium they suggested that the mechanism of extraction was via ion exchange between lidocaine ion and metal ion whereby the chloride ion interacted with protonated lidocaine they observed that as the initial concentration of the metal ion co2 was increased higher toc in the aqueous phase was detected fig 12d similar observation was noticed with the nmr whereby the relative amount of lidocaine to decanoic acid increased as the initial metal ion concentration was raised based on the findings from the toc and nmr they suggested that the mechanism of extraction the chloride ion is very likely through ion exchange between protonated lidocaine and metal ion in their study adeyemi et al 92 investigated the mechanism of extraction of chlorophenols cps from water with seven hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents hdess the cps studied are 2 chlorophenol 3 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol and the hdess consists of menthol hexanoic acid 1 2 menthol octanoic acid 1 2 menthol decanoic acid 1 2 menthol thymol 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 the mechanism of extraction was determined with cosmo rs cosmothermx and tmolex they suggested that the mode of extraction of the cps from aqueous media occurs through two different pathways one mode is through the hydrogen bonding between the cps and the hdess and the other is through hydrophobic interaction between the cps in water and the hdess they explained that hydrogen bond could be formed between the cps and the hdess because cps possesses hydrogen bond donor tendencies due to their overall peak on the left of the threshold value and hdess possesses hydrogen bond acceptor abilities fig 12b similar reports of hydrogen bonding between cps in water and hydrophobic ionic liquids hils can be observed in the works of fan et al 183 deng et al 184 lakshmi et al 185 and sulaiman et al 186 furthermore hydrophobic interaction has been well established in the studies of pratt and chandler 187 pangali et al 188 israelachvili and pashley 189 luzar et al 190 and israelachvili and pashley 191 reports of hydrogen bonding as a mode of extraction of analytes from water could also be found in studies with deep eutectic solvents for instance tang et al 110 111 suggested that the mechanism of extraction of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin from aqueous solution with 1 octanol tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride des 14 is through hydrogen bonding it was inferred that since the analytes levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin contains hydroxyl groups they could act as hydrogen bond donors hence they would be extracted from the water medium through hydrogen bonding between the analyte and the hdes in another report xu et al 182 described the mechanism of extraction of methylene blue from water through the utilization of aqueous biphasic systems abs the abs consisting of tetrabutylammonium bromide polypropylene glycol 400 tbab ppg 400 choline chloride glycerol chcl g was selected and measurements were made with the dynamic light scattering dls and transmission electron microscope tem they speculated that the mode of transfer of the methylene blue into the des was via aggregation which enhanced the solubility capacity with hydrogen bonding this was observed with the dls through an increase in particle size from 342 nm to about 2300 nm before and after extraction respectively in the tem the aggregates were validated with the transformation of the des from being uniformly distribution before extraction to a clustered form after extraction fig 12c hence they presumed that the aggregation was a major route of extraction of the solute the extraction of metals from wastewater using dess mostly occurs through the ion pair mechanism or cation exchange mechanism the main by products of these extractions are metal ion exchanged des fragments or metal ion paired des fragments 192 van osch et al described the mechanism of extraction of metal ions such as cobalt iron manganese potassium and their chloride ions from an aqueous medium with hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents hdess 91 the hdess used were composed of decanoic acid and lidocaine with molar ratios of 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 based on total organic carbon toc and nmr analyses of the water after metal extraction the ion exchange mechanism produced lidocaine hydrochloride as a by product in the water it was suggested that the metal ions in the aqueous medium were interchanged with protonated lidocaine from the hdess subsequently the protonated lidocaine reacted with the chloride ions in the water to form lidocaine hydrochloride as a by product similar hdes containing lidocaine and decanoic acid was used by ola et al for the investigation of the extraction of iron and manganese ions from water 192 at lower ph 2 ion pair mechanism occurs between fe3 and decanoic anion resulting the by products as fe decanoic acid 3 lidocaine n org whereas at ph 2 3 5 mn decanoic acid 2 lidocaine m org as the by product through a similar ion pair mechanism 192 phelps et al examined the removal of pertechnetate from water with three hdess which includes tetraoctylammonium bromide decanoic acid 1 2 trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride decanoic acid 1 2 and tetraoctylammonium bromide hexanoic acid 1 2 193 the mode of extraction was via ion exchange between the halide ion in the hdes with the pertechnetate ion in the treated water consequently there is the discharge of halide ions chloride and bromide ions into the aqueous medium as by products of the wastewater treatment 5 conclusions and future outlook dess have many advantageous characteristics e g low volatility no flammability large liquidus range easy preparation and chemical versatility all these properties are in line with the green chemistry principles and have found potential uses in a wide range of application areas the interest of researchers in the fabrication and use of dess has been growing exponentially lately where a sizeable number of investigations have geared towards advancing the water purification processes and technologies the available studies revealed that dess are good pore forming additives water permeate booster and antifouling agents in membrane based treatment processes and can also give high water recovery if utilized as a draw solution in forward osmosis applications furthermore hydrophobic des can efficiently extract various pollutants without contaminating water which enables various applications in the microextraction area of research including solid phase extraction in addition adding des to an azeotropic mixture can completely remove the azeotropic point making des more favorable than organic solvents this review has confirmed the ability of des as a pore forming agent adsorbent for heavy metals and a good extractant for wastewater treatment indeed few studies have been reported on the applications of des in water treatment since its discovery due to the hydrophilicity of the early dess before the breakthrough in the development of hydrophobic dess in 2015 in addition no pilot scale research has been done in applications other than microextraction it is obvious from the above discussion that dess have a high potential for removing contaminants from wastewater and will be able to potentially solve the current water treatment problems such as cumbersome procedures low performance high cost and short life of methods to some extent there is a need for studies on the adsorption capacity separation performance and extraction ability of dess in membrane based water technologies as they have not been explored yet moreover it is evident from the results that they are good pore forming agents water flux boosters and anti fouling enhancers but their highly viscous nature limits their application as membrane modifiers in terms of removal performance consequently modification of des with suitable methods to overcome the challenges and tailoring their properties with a suitable selection of hba and hbd is a hot topic in research 12 194 furthermore the physicochemical properties of des such as low volatility high viscosity polarity and high surface tension need to be investigated in details in addition to acidity and volatility the systematic experimental studies to determine the effect of salt hbd type and molar ratio on solvent properties in the literature are also scarce 12 further properties evaluation is essential because it impacts the application of hdes and another category of des in the microextraction process coupled with pollutant determination methods in the microextraction processes the high viscosity of dess causes some challenges in the analysis of des extracts in the analysis of des extracts the exact volume of analyte injects into hplc or gc injector using a microliter syringe which limits the possibility of using an autosampler thus to reduce the viscosity organic solvents are mixed along with a des this will affect the green approach of the method even though a green des solvent is used to overcome these limitations possible solutions are to increase the working temperature application of mechanical force during extraction or use an autosampler at high temperature the cnts graphene oxide magnetic modified nanoparticles polymeric des have shown promising examples for the modification of des and displayed good extraction efficiency therefore more research should be carried out on des modified materials for the adsorption of pollutants from the water thus further development in des for pollutant extraction from aqueous media still needs to focus on areas such as properties of des specific heat capacity extraction or absorption heat compositional flexibility which will help to develop new functional dess with more promising properties can be developed for novel applications modification of des with nanoparticles and regeneration recycle of des this review calls for the active design and integration of innovative dess with favorable physicochemical properties to address some of the persisting challenges with the existing water

12988,steel slag refers to solid waste with high specific surface area and large porosity that is discharged from the crude steel smelting process in steel mills the concentration of heavy metal ions leached from the steel slag fulfils many industry criteria and is extremely safe suggesting that it may be employed as a new form of low cost adsorbent for removing pollutants from water this paper reviews the potential of steel slag as an adsorbent for removing pollutants in water the results demonstrate that steel slag can be used for removing inorganic non metallic ions e g phosphate nitrogen etc heavy metal ions organic dyes and other pollutants from wastewater in addition the effect of modified steel slag and reconstituted steel slag in removing pollutants were explored to address problems such as limited adsorption efficiency owing to the limitations of steel slag characteristics to better clarify the relationship between the use of steel slag in removing pollutants from water the removal mechanism and influencing factors were analyzed the results demonstrated that factors such as solution ph temperature and steel slag characteristics affect the pollutant removal efficiency analyzed from the perspective of economic benefits environmental benefits and safety applications the use of steel slag for removing pollutants in water not only utilizes solid waste resources safely but also treats wastewater thereby indicating future large scale applications of steel slag in water treatment engineering graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords steel slag pollutants removal removal mechanism influencing factors water treatment 1 introduction steel is an essential material in life it is the main solid waste generated in the process of steel smelting with an output of approximately 15 20 of the annual crude steel production 1 china is the world s largest steel producer according to 2021 global steel statistics the global crude steel production in 2020 was 1 878 billion tons china s crude steel production reached 1 064 billion tons accounting for 56 7 of the global total crude steel production fig 1 2 in 2020 china s steel slag production reached 160 million tons for every 1 ton of crude steel produced nearly 0 15 to 0 2 tons of steel slag will be generated 35 of which is dumped as waste 3 the comprehensive utilization rate of steel slag in the united states europe japan and other industrialized countries is 85 98 4 whereas this is approximately only 29 5 in china 5 a large amount of steel slag is still piled in open air which not only occupies a large amount of land resources but after a certain period of weathering erosion will also result in migration of certain toxic and harmful substances from steel slag to soil groundwater and air thereby leading to different forms of pollution and several environmental problems 6 however the valuable components in the steel slag cannot be used resulting in resource wastage steel slag can be divided into open hearth furnace slag ohfs electric arc furnace slag eafs basic oxygen furnace slag bofs energy optimizing furnace slag eofs ladle furnace slag lfs and induction furnace slag ifs 7 8 however most open hearth steelmaking has been replaced by basic oxygen furnace converter steelmaking 9 and induction furnace steelmaking is also gradually replacing electric arc furnace steelmaking owing to cleaner and more efficient processes 10 steel slag is an alkaline material mainly composed of different oxides including cao sio2 fe2o3 al2o3 mgo mno and various alkaline substances that can be combined by h2o water to release oh ions 11 12 from the chemical composition of steel slag in table 1 we note that the cao and fe2o3 contents of bofs and eafs are high while the cao content of ifs is low 8 13 indicating that the chemical composition of steel slag of different origins and types is considerably different the presence of cao and mgo in steel slag results in lower activity and poor volumetric stability microscopically the surface of steel slag particles shows slightly concave and convex folds 14 characterized by porous structures with random distribution of pores and microcracks 8 and present a large specific surface area with high adsorption and precipitation capacity it has been reported that raw steel slag modified steel slag or reconstituted steel slag composites have been used as adsorbents to remove phosphate ammonia nitrogen sulfide organic pollutants and heavy metal ions copper cu arsenic as lead pb manganese mn chromium cr nickel ni zinc zn etc all with adequate removal results 15 18 to further improve the resourcefulness of steel slag and reduce the amount of steel slag stockpiles extensive research has been conducted on steel slag use in water treatment to realize resourceful and comprehensive utilization of solid waste to provide a reference for future research on the resource utilization of steel slag and the removal performance and mechanism of various types of pollutants this review paper discusses the main removal mechanisms of steel slag for pollutants in water presents a review and analysis of the removal effects and influencing factors of various types of pollutants in water bodies and provides a development direction for the further application of steel slag in water treatment 2 mechanism for removing pollutants from water by steel slag 2 1 adsorption mechanism physical adsorption is caused by intermolecular forces van der waals force between the adsorbent and the adsorbate and can occur on any solid surface chemical adsorption refers to the process of chemical bonding between the adsorbate molecules and the atoms or molecules in the adsorbent by electron transfer exchange and sharing and is often accompanied by chemical reactions the main mechanisms of chemisorption include reduction effect surface coordination chemical precipitation and ion exchange in the process of removing pollutants from water steel slag not only undergoes physical adsorption but is also often accompanied by chemical adsorption processes such as reduction precipitation coordination exchange and ion exchange using their synergistic effects to finally remove various types of pollutants 2 1 1 physical adsorption 1 surface adsorption it is determined by the porosity and specific surface area of steel slag the larger the specific surface area the better the physical adsorption effect particle size can be reduced and the porosity and micropore volume can be increased by grinding or modifying the steel slag the smaller the particle size of steel slag the higher the porosity the more active sites available on the slag surface for pollutant adsorption the greater the rate of diffusion and mass transfer of pollutants within the slag and the better the physical adsorption effect 6 26 28 2 electrostatic adsorption the hydroxyl group oh and other groups on the surface of steel slag can easily dissociate in aqueous solution forming adsorption sites on the surface of steel slag centered on negative charge while cations in solution can be adsorbed onto the surface of steel slag through electrostatic adsorption to remove pollutants when the solution ph is low a large amount of h in the acidic solution can protonate the hydroxyl group on the surface of the steel slag forming positive charge centered adsorption sites on the steel slag surface 29 this is not conducive to the adsorption of metal cations in solution but suitable for anions such as f in solution which can be adsorbed onto the surface of the steel slag through electrostatic adsorption to remove pollutants the adsorption mechanism of f on the surface of activated steel slag is shown in fig 2 2 1 2 chemical adsorption 1 surface coordination calcium ca iron fe aluminum al and other metal ions and their metal oxides in steel slag surface ion coordination unsaturated in aqueous solutions and undergo water dissociation reactions to form hydroxyl groups steel oh such that a large number of interrelated or separated hydroxyl groups are present on the surface of steel slag these hydroxyl groups can react with metal cations to generate surface coordination complexes which can adsorb heavy metal ions 27 31 taking the surface coordination process of a heavy metal ion m adsorption by steel slag as an example the specific removal mechanism is as follows 6 27 1 2steel oh m 2 steel o 2 m 2h 2 steel oh x m 2 steel om x h 3 steel oh y m 2 h 2 o steel omoh y 1 h 2 ion exchange ion exchange adsorption mainly relies on the ratio of electrostatic gravitational force between the adsorbate and the adsorbent to remove pollutants the steel slag surface comprises a large number of negative charges that repel each other however these can enable the exchange of ca ii and other metal cations on the steel slag surface with the metal cations in the solution to remove heavy metal ions in the solution steel slag can remove pb2 cu2 and cd2 by the combined action of ion exchange and chemical precipitation moreover under acidic conditions the compounds formed by ion exchange are very stable and heavy metal ions adsorbed onto the surface of the slag are not easily released into solution the main ion exchange mechanisms between steel slag and heavy metal ions are as follows m denotes heavy metals such as cu pb cd and ni 32 4 ca 2 fe 2 o 5 m 2 m 2 fe 2 o 5 ca 2 5 ca 2 sio 4 m 2 m 2 sio 4 ca 2 because the steel slag surface contains fe zn al and other metal oxides ion exchange reactions between the phosphate ions and the hydroxyl groups on the slag can occur during the process of phosphorus removal from steel slag covalent chemical bonding can be established between the phosphate and metal cations on the steel slag and other anions will be released to offer more sites for phosphate and other anions to attach thus resulting in phosphorus removal 33 3 chemical precipitation steel slag which contains a large amount of al2o3 mgo cao and other alkaline metal oxides releases a large amount of oh after being added to the water body owing to mixed hydrolysis of metal oxides the pollutants in the water body can combine with oh to form chemical precipitates to realize pollutant removal phosphate ion removal from steel slag is based on the following mechanism phosphate in the water body is adsorbed onto the surface of steel slag by surface adsorption and reacts chemically with the metal ions such as ca2 mg2 and al3 released by the hydrolytic ionization of steel slag in water therefore when the critical ph of phosphate precipitation is reached phosphate precipitates are formed thus removing phosphorus from water fig 3 depicts the main reaction processes for phosphate removal by adsorption on steel slag among the dissolved metal ions in the steel slag the ca2 concentration is the key factor for removing phosphorus by slag adsorption a large amount of ca2 dissolves on the surface of the steel slag and reacts chemically with the phosphate in wastewater to form a relatively stable hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3 oh precipitate the main removal mechanisms of phosphate are as follow 15 28 34 35 6 cao h 2 o ca 2 2oh 7 5ca 2 3 po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh because steel slag also contains compounds such as 2cao sio2 caco3 and ca oh 2 these substances also dissolve in solution to form ca2 ions thus relying on precipitation reactions to achieve phosphate removal 4 reduction effect in the steelmaking process oxygen o is blown to remove carbon c phosphorus p and sulfur s creating an oxidizing environment some of the iron atoms in the molten iron bath are oxidized to feo which undergoes indirect oxidation with dissolved oxygen in the iron bath to form fe2o3 and fe3o4 in addition unoxidized fe atoms are carried over during slagging adding a certain amount of steel slag to the solution owing to the presence of feo in the slag can provide electrons to the solution such that the redox potential in the solution changes and the pollutant can be removed via iron reduction in the slag steel slag is added to the synthetic wastewater containing cr6 the dissolved fe2 in the steel slag can reduce cr6 to cr3 part of the cr3 is adsorbed on the surface of the slag 36 and the remaining cr3 is removed by combining with oh to form a precipitate 37 the main removal mechanisms are shown in eqs 8 10 8 cr 2 o 7 2 6fe 2 14 h 2cr 3 6fe 3 7h 2 o 9 cr 3 3oh cr oh 3 10 ca 3 sio 4 2cr 3 cr 2 sio 4 3ca 2 the process of removing cr6 by using modified steel slag mainly relies on the reduction effect cr6 was removed from the water sample using recycled limestone residue rlr modified steel slag the reduction of cr6 by dissolved fe2 in the modified steel slag is an inner sphere reaction forming an rlr oh cr 5 inner sphere complex by reaction 11 the reaction uses dissolved fe2 in rlr to bridge oh in order to promote electron transfer in the inner sphere complex and later splits the bridged complex by reaction 12 to produce cr5 after repeated reactions toxic cr6 is finally reduced to nontoxic cr3 by reduction of dissolved fe2 using rlr 38 11 rlr oh cr 6 rlr oh cr 5 12 rlr oh cr 5 rlr cr 5 oh steel slag is used to remove hydrogen sulfide from artificial seawater and sediments in enclosed seas and inner harbors and iron is eluted from the slag and iron sulfide and singlet sulfur are formed by the reaction of iron on the reduction of dissolved hydrogen sulfide thus suppressing hydrogen sulfide in seawater and sediments 16 39 41 the main removal mechanisms are shown in eqs 13 16 13 hs fe 2 fes h 14 hs 2fe 3 s 0 2fe 2 h 15 fes s 0 fes 2 16 2fes 2 7o 2 2h 2 o 2feso 4 2h 2 so 4 2 2 adsorption kinetics during the adsorption of pollutants on steel slag the diffusion of pollutants from the solution to the slag surface and the rate of adsorption of pollutants to the active sites on the slag surface determine the kinetics and efficiency of the entire adsorption process a fast adsorption rate is as important as a high adsorption capacity for obtaining a high adsorption performance the adsorption kinetic model can not only evaluate the rate and adsorption amount of the adsorption process but can also be used to explain the removal mechanism of pollutants adsorbed by steel slag pseudo first order kinetics pseudo second order kinetics intra particle diffusion model and extra particle diffusion model have been used to elucidate the kinetics and adsorption mechanism of pollutants in water adsorbed on the surface of steel slag the pseudo first order kinetics is a kinetic model applied to liquid phase adsorption based on the amount of solid adsorption and the pseudo second order kinetics is based on the assumption that the adsorption rate is mainly controlled by the chemical adsorption process 42 in kinetic studies on the removal of various types of pollutants by adsorption using steel slag the actual adsorption processes based on the different properties of steel slag for the removal of phosphate po4 3 28 43 46 heavy metal ions 11 26 32 47 49 vanadate vo3 50 fluoride f 30 51 52 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 46 53 and nitrate nitrogen no3 n 54 were adequately described by pseudo second order kinetics fig 4 demonstrates the maximum removal efficiency of different properties of steel slag for several different pollutants in accordance with pseudo second order kinetics the adsorption of these types of pollutants by steel slag is mainly controlled by the active sites on the slag surface with chemisorption playing a dominant role and the main limiting factor affecting the adsorption rate of the entire adsorption process in the process of ammonia nitrogen removal by adsorption on steel slag the entire adsorption process can be described by a pseudo second order kinetic model nevertheless the results of boyd and kannan equations show that internal and external diffusion of particles also affect the ammonia nitrogen adsorption while only one factor plays a key role under certain conditions 53 in the process of no3 n adsorption using steel slag and modified steel slag it is mainly achieved by the chemisorption process of surface coordination and ion exchange the correlation coefficients of the pseudo second order kinetic model are higher than those of the pseudo first order kinetic model which could better describe the actual adsorption process of no3 n by steel slag and modified steel slag 42 54 the actual adsorption process of uranium by steel slag with differing properties can be well described by pseudo first order kinetic model 55 in the kinetic study of phenol adsorption the pseudo second order kinetic model can describe the adsorption process of phenol removal by unmodified steel slag whereas the process of phenol removal by modified steel slag is consistent with the pseudo first order kinetic model 56 indicating that the adsorption of phenol by steel slag is accompanied by both physisorption and chemisorption processes such as ion exchange the mechanisms and controlling factors of organic dye removal by steel slag differ for different types of organic dyes the adsorption of methylene blue dyes 57 by unmodified steel slag is consistent with the pseudo first order kinetic model the adsorption process of methylene blue mb 58 59 and methyl orange mo 59 dyes by modified steel slag is dominated by chemisorption which is better described by the pseudo second order kinetic model for acid jujube red dyes 60 and congo red dyes 61 pseudo second order kinetic models can also adequately describe the adsorption processes of these dyes by steel slags with differing properties for kd 8b dye the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model is more consistent with the adsorption process for its removal indicating that the adsorption process is controlled by pore diffusion 62 the analysis indicated that the kinetics and mechanisms of the removal of different types of organic dyes by adsorption from different properties of steel slag are related to the structure and properties of the dyes themselves 2 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are essential for explaining the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate elucidating the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent resolving the adsorption mechanism and predicting the behavior of the adsorbate langmuir and freundlich are the most widely used adsorption isotherm models to describe the adsorption of pollutants in water it has also been shown that the redlich peterson r p dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin adsorption isotherm models also provide good fit for the adsorption process for removing various pollutants 28 51 the langmuir isotherm assumes that the thickness of the adsorption layer is limited to one molecule monolayer adsorption the adsorbent surface is homogeneous and there is no interaction between adjacent sites of adsorbed molecules the freundlich isotherm assumes that the adsorbent surface is multiphase and the particles adsorbed on the adsorbent surface can interact with each other 63 64 the process of phosphorus removal by steel slag is based on chemisorption supplemented by physical adsorption for steel slag with a small particle size 2 mm its surface is considered homogeneous and dominated by monolayer adsorption and the adsorption process of phosphorus is better described by the langmuir isotherm for steel slag with a large particle size its surface energy is not uniform and there are often other particles competing with phosphorus for adsorption sites on the surface of the steel slag as such freundlich isotherms can better describe this adsorption process 28 43 65 66 the different adsorption properties for removing low concentrations of ammonia nitrogen 46 53 67 fluoride 30 etc follow single molecular layer adsorption which occur on specific homogeneous sites of steel slag the langmuir isotherm can better describe the adsorption process of these pollutants no3 n removal is mainly controlled by chemisorption such that ionic interactions occur on non uniform surfaces of steel slag the freundlich isotherm can adequately describe the adsorption mechanism of nitrate 54 nevertheless the adsorption isotherm of nitrate removal by modified steel slag is better fitted by langmuir after modification of steel slag which may be due to the more uniform distribution of active sites on the surface of modified steel slag moreover the adsorption process of nitrate on the surface of modified steel slag is dominated by monomolecular layer adsorption 65 both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms can describe the adsorption of steel slag on heavy metal ions and organic dyes but the different sources and treatment conditions of steel slag lead to differences in the slag surface energy distribution further because of the differences in the nature of different heavy metal ions and organic dyes for a given heavy metal ion or organic dye only one type of adsorption isotherm is fit for the adsorption process for example the adsorption characteristics of different properties of steel slag for the removal of different types of heavy metal ions such as pb2 49 cr6 68 cu2 23 cd2 26 mn2 69 and as3 47 can be better explained by the langmuir isotherm fig 5 shows the variation in adsorption capacity of different steel slag properties for removing various types of heavy metals in accordance with langmuir isotherm indicating that the adsorption capacity of different heavy metals is influenced by steel slag properties in contrast for removing heavy metal ions such as ni2 11 zn2 11 and hg2 70 the freundlich isotherm is more suitable than the langmuir isotherm to describe the adsorption mechanism both langmuir and freundlich isotherms can better fit the process of vanadium removal by adsorption of steel slag 50 and phenol 71 but the freundlich isotherm shows lower deviation and can better resolve the mechanism of vanadium and phenol removal by steel slag 3 recycling application of steel slag to remove pollutants in water in an environment that promotes resource conservation and recycling the solid waste generated in the steelmaking process is recycled as a low cost adsorption material for removing pollutants from contaminated water offering a new research direction for solid waste applications steel slag contains a variety of metal oxides with high porosity high specific surface area and good adsorption properties steel slag can be used to adsorb and remove pollutants such as phosphorus nitrogen hydrogen sulfide fluoride heavy metal ions organic dyes and phenol from water table 2 lists the applications of steel slag in removing these pollutants from water 3 1 removal of inorganic non metal ions 3 1 1 phosphate phosphorus is an important nutrient in the water environment and also a common pollutant excess phosphorus can lead to eutrophication of water bodies and damage water ecosystems effective control of phosphorus content in water and recovery of phosphorus are essential for resource and environmental protection currently the commonly used methods for phosphorus removal include biological treatment 72 ion exchange 73 chemical precipitation 74 membrane separation 75 and adsorption 76 adsorption is widely used because of its low application cost no secondary pollution and small footprint in engineering applications the removal of phosphorus from wastewater can be achieved by designing filtration systems using steel slag 77 78 during the application of steel slag filters there are signs of inhibited phosphorus removal due to reduced flow rates and the gradual appearance of sediments steel slag can successfully treat phosphorus in surface runoff however the use of untreated steel slag to remove dissolved phosphorus from subsurface drainage is not recommended to prevent ditch clogging and calcium carbonate precipitation due to reduced phosphorus treatment capacity 79 the presence of bicarbonate which can interfere with the chemical precipitation of calcium ions and phosphate by consuming the water soluble calcium ions and precipitating calcium carbonate 80 affects the efficiency of phosphate removal by adsorption of steel slag and reduces the service life of eafs for phosphate removal therefore aluminum treated steel slag was used instead of ordinary eafs to remove dissolved phosphorus from subsurface drainage 81 compared with common steel slag which is dominated by calcium ion precipitation of phosphate aluminum treated steel slag achieves phosphate removal by ligand exchange of phosphate with aluminum oxygen hydroxide and or chemical precipitation of aluminum with phosphate 82 this is more rapid than the calcium phosphorus precipitation reaction and does not compete as strongly with bicarbonate for adsorption thereby increasing total removal of phosphorus from 37 79 to 50 81 in subsurface drainage systems in the same ditch style phosphorus removal structure 79 81 83 aluminum treated steel slag removes phosphorus pollutants in the subsurface drainage system more effectively than untreated steel slag most studies 28 77 84 have been conducted on steel slag to remove water samples containing phosphorus with a concentration of above 5 mg l for the treatment of water samples containing phosphorus at low concentrations some researchers have modified steel slag for phosphorus removal at low concentrations improving phosphorus removal phosphorus removal by adsorption on lanthanum iron composite oxide leads to modification of steel slag ceramics in a solution with an initial phosphorus concentration of 1 mg l when the adsorbent dosing amount was 5 g l and ph 7 the phosphorus removal efficiency was as high as 99 07 44 45 a large number of studies and analyses have shown that steel slag has a large specific surface area and evident surface porous characteristics which entail high adsorption properties steel slag contains a variety of metal elements such as ca fe mg and mn which present a strong affinity to phosphate therefore steel slag has good potential and application prospects for removing phosphorus from waters 3 1 2 nitrogen domestic sewage industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation water discharged into the water environment result in a large accumulation of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen in the water environment disrupting the balance of the water ecosystem causing environmental problems such as eutrophication of water bodies and posing a serious threat to human health the adsorption method is widely used in treating nitrogen containing wastewater because of its simple operation easy recovery and adsorbent reuse etc the adsorption characteristics of steel slag for removing nh4 n 53 and no3 n 54 from aqueous solutions were studied showing that factors such as the initial solubility of the solution the particle size of the slag and the reaction time all affect the removal of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen however the removal mechanisms of the two nitrogenous pollutants are different as the removal of nh4 n is controlled by both external and internal diffusion mechanisms whereas that of no3 n is mainly accomplished by chemisorption to enhance the treatment performance of steel slag researchers have studied the effects of modified steel slag on the removal of nitrogen from wastewater through the high temperature activation treatment of steel slag the surface cracking of the modified steel slag after heat treatment increases the specific surface area and the negative charge on the surface resulting in increased adsorption of nh4 ions which greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of ammonia nitrogen 65 67 the ability of acid modified steel slag to remove nitrates using modified steel slag is greater than that of alkali modified and thermally modified slag the maximum adsorption of nitrate could be increased to 3 97 mg g at 5 mol l for acid modified conditions the adsorption of nitrate was 3 06 mg g for alkali modified steel slag at 3 mol l naoh concentration which was higher than the adsorption of the original steel slag 2 107 mg g when the temperature was 1000 c the specific surface area of thermally modified steel slag decreased and its optimal adsorption amount was 1 43 mg g which was lower than that of the original steel slag 65 nitrate adsorption by aluminum hydroxide modified steel slag has higher removal capacity than conventional acid alkali and thermal modification methods the aluminum hydroxide modified steel slag was prepared by compound modification method by mixing steel slag deionized water and aluminum hydroxide in the mass ratio of 3 0 45 2 and calcined at a temperature of 800 c the specific surface area of modified steel slag 9 531 m2 g was 3 34 times larger than the original steel slag 2 854 m2 g and the number of active adsorption sites was increased which greatly improved the nitrate removal capacity at ph of 4 nitrate concentration of 20 mg l modified steel slag was added at 10 g l and the reaction was carried out for 180 min the maximum adsorption capacity of modified steel slag was up to 6 165 mg g which was 1 9 times higher than that of original steel slag 3 482 mg g 42 3 1 3 hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide h2s is formed by the reduction of sulfate ions by sulfate reducing bacteria in organic enriched sediments under anoxic conditions hydrogen sulfide causes ecological degradation bad odor and other environmental issues and is highly toxic to living organisms therefore reducing hydrogen sulfide concentrations in sediments is critical for restoring and maintaining healthy water ecosystems a mixture of steelmaking slag and dredged soil set up for field trials in the waters of kawasaki city japan effectively restored seaweed beds and shoals indicating that iron ions were effectively dissolved in the steelmaking slag 85 however the solubility of the total iron content in steel slag is very small and hence it is easily oxidized to fe3 in oxygenated seawater resulting in the formation of water insoluble iron hydroxide the use of gluconic acid can greatly improve the solubility of iron in seawater by forming iron gluconic acid complexes to inhibit the conversion of fe2 to fe3 86 the mode of action and material change of the inhibition of hydrogen sulfide production in fig 6 shows that before employing steel slag sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate ions in seawater to form hydrogen sulfide in the bottom sediment enriched with organic matter laying steel slag on the bottom sediment not only prevents hydrogen sulfide generation by reducing contact between sulfate ions and sulfate reducing bacteria in the bottom sediment but also enables the use of the iron ions eluted by the steel slag these iron can react with the artificial seawater containing sulfide and the bottom sediment to reduce hs and form insoluble substances such as troilite fes and pyrite fes2 thereby effectively inhibiting the generation and diffusion of h2s 40 by analyzing the reaction products of steel slag and sulfide ions the possibility of reducing the sulfide content by iron ions in steel slag was proposed however to eliminate external disturbances due to the sulfide in seawater the reaction between iron ions and sulfide in steel slag was studied using nacl solution instead of seawater under the condition that it is not influenced by sulfate ions so4 2 eqs 13 16 41 the results showed that sulfate in solution originated from the reaction between iron in the steel slag and sulfide ions to form iron sulfides this process increased the redox potential of the solution and promoted the oxidation of sulfide ions to sulfate in addition mn ions present in steelmaking slag also react with sulfide eq 17 to form sulfur and mns and subsequently oxidize mns to sulfur and partially sulfate thus removing hydrogen sulfide from water 87 17 mn 2 o 3 h 2 s 4h 2mn 2 s 0 3h 2 o through research and analyses on the removal of sulfide steelmaking slag has been shown to be a promising material for application in the remediation of organic rich marine sediments and its use is expected to contribute to social and environmental sustainability however there are relatively few studies on the adsorption of steel slag for removing sulfide from water and there is no literature studying its adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm type hence its influencing effects and adsorption mechanism require further investigation 3 1 4 fluorine fluoride ions are one of the most toxic pollutants responsible for water pollution excess fluoride can cause dental bone fluorosis and neurological damage in humans effective and widely used treatment technologies for fluoride removal from water include adsorption coagulation precipitation electrocoagulation and membrane separation 88 adsorption is widely used in treatment processes to reduce the fluoride concentration in water because of its simplicity and high removal efficiency the adsorption performance of steel slag for fluoride removal from water was studied using the oscillatory adsorption method under acidic conditions the efficiency of fluoride ion removal by adsorption on steel slag increased with increasing ph under alkaline conditions the efficiency of fluoride ion removal by adsorption decreased with increasing ph a removal rate of 77 77 was achieved for fluorinated wastewater 40 mg l fluoride at the suitable ph of 4 10 steel slag dosage of 9 0 g and adsorption time of 90 min 89 to improve the performance of steel slag for fluoride removal the slag can be modified changing its pore properties specific surface area and surface functional groups to enhance the adsorption efficiency of steel slag a novel modified ferroalloy electric arc furnace feaf slag adsorbent was prepared for removing fluoride ions from wastewater using heat and acid treatment to destroy the internal compact structure of the original slag loosening it and increasing its specific surface area under the conditions of optimal ph 4 adsorbent dosage of 36 g l and initial fluorine concentration of 40 mg l the surface of feaf slag comprises more active adsorption sites which presents a positive charge on the surface of feaf slag this leads to the removal of more fluorine ions by adsorption through electrostatic attraction and ion exchange between sulfate and hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of feaf slag and fluorine ions presenting a fluorine removal efficiency of 97 42 compared with the efficiency of the original steel slag 68 98 30 some researchers have studied a new steel slag modification method which loads nanoparticles with steel slag to reduce the surface energy of steel slag and improve adsorption performance nanocomposite steel slag al cu ssw al cu was prepared by chemical reduction by loading al cu oxide nanoparticles with steel slag waste ssw fluoride removal was achieved by electrostatic interaction and chemisorption between nanoparticles and fluoride the maximum adsorption capacity of ssw al cu composites was 3 99 mg g with a fluoride removal rate of 89 5 51 3 2 removal of metal ions 3 2 1 heavy metal ions metals such as mercury hg chromium cr lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn copper cu nickel ni arsenic as and manganese mn are regarded as toxic heavy metals and wastewater containing these ions is usually a by product of metallurgy mining painting and electroplating industries which are harmful to the environment and human health 90 adsorption is one of the most widely applicable methods for removing heavy metal ions steel slag has adequate adsorption properties and is an effective adsorbent for treating heavy metal contaminated wastewater industrial acidic wastewater contains a large amount of heavy metal ions such as pb cd and cu the use of low cost adsorbents such as steel slag to remove cd ii pb ii cu ii plasma present in the wastewater presents a high removal efficiency and effective treatment without secondary pollution steel slag was used to remove heavy metals from acidic mine wastewater the reaction of steel slag with pb2 cu2 and cd2 ions formed compounds such as hydroxides ferrites carbonates silicates and oxides the characterization of these adsorption products and adsorption kinetic analyses showed that the removal mechanism of heavy metal ions was mainly a chemisorption process based on ion exchange and chemical precipitation under acidic conditions the coexistence of heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions facilitates the removal of heavy metal ions in acidic wastewater 32 the adsorption of heavy metal by steel slag based on its own characteristics has some limitations removal performance can be greatly enhanced by steel slag modification the removal of arsenic from wastewater by adsorption on modified steel slag has achieved removal rates of over 90 and up to 99 21 47 91 in addition to conventional modification methods such as acid alkali salt and heat composite modification of steel slag can be achieved by mixing one or more materials with steel slag followed by inorganic modification or heat treatment thus enhancing the adsorption properties of steel slag steel slag derived calcium silicate hydrate csh was prepared by alkali modification of steel slag using a composite activator of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate to remove heavy metal ions such as pb2 zn2 ni2 cu2 and cr3 the csh composite possesses a large adsorption capacity for these specific heavy metal ions with adsorption amounts greater than 100 mg g for all heavy metal ions 92 in general the performance of heavy metal ion removal by adsorption can be improved by steel slag modification but the adsorption effects of modified steel slag vary widely for different modification methods and different types of heavy metals for both pb2 and cu2 ions leaching of the slag with hcl solution only caused slight perturbation of the internal particle structure of the slag with insignificant enhancement in adsorption efficiency of the modified slag compared with the original slag 21 to improve the adsorption performance of modified steel slag for some heavy metal ions steel slag could be reconstituted with some abundant and inexpensive adsorbents to synthesize a new composite adsorbent material to improve the removal capacity through synergistic adsorption coalescence synergy steel slag and bentonite were mixed in the ratio of 5 5 5 na2co3 was added as a binder and after aging for 12 h the new bentonite steel slag composite bsc was reconstituted by calcination at 500 c for 1 h compared with raw steel slag bsc has a non uniform surface large specific surface area and numerous pores which is favorable for heavy metal ion adsorption the surface of bsc particles contain a large number of sio4 4 groups which can form a hydrated oxide covering layer with water thereby presenting an overall negative charge and achieving the removal of pb2 cd2 cr3 and zn2 ions through ion exchange complexation precipitation and synergistic adsorption coagulation under the optimal process conditions the adsorption amounts of pb2 cd2 and cr3 in wastewater by bsc were 4 98 mg g 4 95 mg g and 4 86 mg g respectively thus achieving adequate adsorption effects and providing a new research direction for the preparation of multifunctional environmental protection materials 48 93 94 the use of raw steel slag modified steel slag and reconstructed steel slag to treat wastewater containing heavy metal ions not only presents high treatment efficiency and good removal effects but also meets the relevant safety standards on leaching toxicity of treated steel slag to prevent secondary pollution and provide an effective adsorbent material this is of great significance for the treatment of heavy metal wastewater using low cost adsorbents 3 2 2 radioactive metal elements uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element that is widely used in the nuclear industry many nuclear wastewaters contain high concentrations of uranium u vi industrial wastewater containing uranium is characterized by strong radioactivity high acidity and coexistence with other metal ions 95 and its untreated discharge into the environment can cause environmental pollution and affect human health therefore there is a need to effectively remove u vi from water before contaminated wastewater is discharged into the environment numerous studies have shown that the use of steel slag as adsorbent material can effectively remove uranium elements from nuclear wastewater to efficiently remove u u vi is adsorbed by steel slag by physical adsorption ion exchange and chemical precipitation 55 the removal of u vi from nuclear wastewater by steel slag can be enhanced by modifying the raw steel slag the steel slag was treated with 1 sulfuric acid for 24 h and calcined at 500 c the acid treated and heat treated modified steel slag had a larger specific surface area and richer pore structure than the unmodified slag which providing more active adsorption sites for uranium and contained more oh functional groups that could combine with uranium thus improving the efficiency of uranium removal the maximum adsorption efficiency of complex adsorption of 10 mg l of uranium containing nuclear wastewater could reach 98 5 with the adsorption capacity of 6 41 mg g at a modified steel slag dosage of 0 3 g ph of 4 and adsorption time of 3 h 96 3 2 3 rare metal elements vanadium v is a rare metal element with a wide range of applications in the field of steel and metallurgy during vanadium processing large amounts of vanadium contaminated waste are released into the environment high vanadium concentrations can be potentially harmful to animals plants microorganisms and human health 97 vanadate can be removed from soil washing waste streams using converter steel slag as an adsorbent the removal rate of 97 1 was achieved at a steel slag particle size less than 0 15 mm a slag dosing rate of 50 g l and an initial vanadate concentration of 100 mg l during the removal of vanadium from aqueous solution using steel slag part of the converter slag dissolved in solution releases ca2 and vanadium exists in the aqueous solution in ionic form which forms a precipitate through reaction 18 and is adsorbed onto the slag surface to achieve vanadium removal 50 18 ca 2 vo 3 ca vo 3 2 3 3 removal of organic matter 3 3 1 organic dyes wastewater containing organic dyestuffs mainly originates from textile dyeing leather printing cosmetic and plastic industries and is characterized by complex composition high generation high organic content difficult degradation high chromaticity and high toxicity 98 it is important to effectively remove the various dyes present in industrial wastewater before discharged into the environment steel slag was used as adsorbent to treat acid jujube red dye wastewater reactive brilliant red kd 8b dye wastewater direct big red 4be dye wastewater navy blue dye wastewater and fuchsia dye wastewater all of which achieved adequate adsorption results with the decolorization rate of fuchsia dye reaching 96 16 under appropriate conditions 60 62 99 100 for removing acid jujube red dye molecules from steel slag the physical phase of the slag undergoes a hydration reaction whereby compounds enter the solution phase to combine with the dye molecules causing chemical precipitation and removal 101 numerous studies have shown that the modified steel slag adsorbs methylene blue dye effectively which is an organic cationic basic dye the surface of steel slag has a large number of adsorption sites with an overall negative charge while methylene blue ions present a positive charge decolorization of methylene blue dye is achieved under the action of electrostatic force through ion exchange adsorption on the surface of steel slag 57 salicylic acid methanol sam modified steel converter slag scs was used for the adsorption removal of methylene blue dye from wastewater the maximum adsorption of methylene blue by sam modified steel slag was 41 62 mg g which was 35 2 times higher than that of the original steel slag 1 15 mg g 58 although these studies adopted similar experimental conditions and used methylene blue dye the surface area of the acid modified steel slag bet prepared by plaza et al 102 was more than three times larger than that of the modified steel slag prepared by cheng et al 58 and was more influenced by the initial solubility of methylene blue the maximum adsorption of methylene blue dye using acid modified steel slag was 9 35 mg g ss cl hydrochloric acid modified steel slag which is lower than that obtained by cheng et al 3 3 2 phenolic compounds phenol containing wastewater mainly originates from leather and textile manufacturing petroleum refining steel casting and pharmaceutical and chemical industries phenolic compounds cannot be effectively degraded in the aqueous environment eventually causing environmental pollution and affecting human health therefore it is necessary to remove phenolic compounds from industrial wastewater before discharging into the environment using steel slag as the adsorbent the removal of phenol in wastewater was realized by oscillation adsorption the ph was less than 4 most phenol existed in the molecular state and the high concentration of h in the solution competed with phenol for adsorption resulting in a low phenol removal rate at higher ph the surface of steel slag was negatively charged as phenol was a weak acid ionization produced negatively charged c6h5o phenolic ions and the negatively charged sites on the surface of steel slag exhibited electrostatic repulsion with c6h5o ion which was not conducive to the adsorption and removal of phenol at a ph of 4 a slag particle size of 120 180 mesh and a phenol concentration of 500 mg l or less the efficiency of steel slag adsorption for phenol removal was nearly 50 71 103 to improve the removal efficiency of phenol and increase its potential for engineering applications several studies have been conducted to show that steel slag can be modified to increase its specific surface area and porosity thus improving its ability to adsorb phenol for phenolic compounds the adsorption of phenol by steel slag involves both surface adsorption and ion exchange although the modified slag could increase the specific surface area of the slag the removal efficiency of phenol by the acid and alkali modified slags 36 08 and 38 67 was lower than that of the unmodified slag 41 2 acid and alkali modified steel slags contain metal oxides react to generate soluble sulfate or ca oh 2 and other micro soluble substances which are attached to the surface of the slag it is difficult to dissolve the material attached to the modified steel slag surface as it partially blocks the original internal pores of the slag thus decreasing the phenol removal rate 56 3 3 3 high molecular polymer the residual hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam in oilfield polymer flooding wastewater exist in surface and groundwater for long periods which not only pollutes the water environment but also affects human health steel slag is denser and has a faster settling speed in water enabling easy solid liquid separation the metal oxides present in the slag can combine with hpam functional groups to achieve more effective treatment of oilfield polymer flooding wastewater through van der waals force adsorption and hydrogen bonding adsorption 104 in the adsorption of hpam by steel slag factors such as adsorbent dosage adsorption time ph value and slag particle size affect the efficiency of the adsorption process with a maximum removal of 89 31 of hapm at ph of 5 6 adsorption time of 95 4 min and slag dosage of 105 2 g l 105 steel slag has good prospects for the treatment of poly driven oil recovery wastewater however the change in functional groups on the surface of steel slag during its specific adsorption and regeneration require further research 4 factors influencing pollutant removal 4 1 solution ph the ph of a solution affects the adsorption performance of the adsorbent and is essential for removing pollutants from water using steel slag changes in ph not only affect the surface charge of the adsorbent and the stability of the functional groups on the active surface sites but also affect the adsorption process through precipitation caused by the neutralization effect of oh changes in the concentration of h and oh in solution affect the adsorption efficiency for anions or cations in strongly acidic media the protonation reaction 19 occurs on the hydrated surface of the steel slag consuming h from the solution such that a positive charge is generated on the slag surface increasing the initial solution ph 19 sur oh h sur oh 2 where sur represents the slag surface position and sur oh represents the slag surface hydroxyl group as the initial solution ph increases the steel slag surface acquires a negative charge through the deprotonation reaction 20 which continuously consumes the oh in the solution 20 sur oh oh sur o h 2 o therefore when the h concentration is high the adsorbent surface favors the adsorption of anions at low ph whereas when the ph is high adsorption or precipitation of cations is favored owing to the precipitation of oh 11 26 47 90 106 numerous studies 28 33 43 45 have shown that any change in solution ph affects the efficiency of phosphorus removal from steel slag at low ph the electrostatic gravitational force between the positively charged steelmaking slag surface and phosphate ions facilitates the adsorption process near the zero charge point phpzc an increase in ph leads to a decrease in the slag surface charge which reduces the attraction and thus the phosphorus removal rate when the initial ph is higher than phpzc the formation of calcium phosphate on the slag surface at high ph leads to precipitation which increases the phosphorus removal rate however for some specific types of pollutants ph has almost no effect on the removal when the initial ph of the solution was between 1 and 11 the removal efficiency of vanadium was approximately 96 vanadium existed in solution as an anion and did not form a precipitate with oh and the solution ph range was sufficiently large to remove vanadium effectively thus expanding the use of steel slag as an adsorbent 50 fig 7 demonstrates the effect of steel slag on the removal performance of several different pollutants at different solution ph levels 4 2 temperature the effect of temperature on the adsorption process is more complex and varies based on the adsorption amount of different pollutants in the process of phosphorus removal by steel slag adsorption first the phosphorus in solution must overcome the resistance of the liquid film around the slag particles to diffuse to the outer surface of the adsorbent before diffusion into its fine pores when the temperature increases it not only enhances the ability of the phosphorus in solution to overcome the liquid film resistance around the slag surface but also aids migration of phosphorus adsorbed on the slag surface along the slag micropores to its interior increasing the availability of surface sites for pollutant adsorption therefore increasing the temperature is beneficial for phosphorus removal by adsorption of steel slag powder 14 107 simultaneously the reaction temperature is increased the migration rate of heavy metal ions in solution is enhanced due to activation of the steel slag surface and the pore size increases to overcome the spatial site resistance which accelerates the adsorption of heavy metal ions 108 however when the temperature reaches a certain value continuing to increase the temperature will accelerate the desorption process and affect the adsorption of heavy metal ions resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate 70 109 110 the adsorption capacity of fluoride ions by steel slag also increased with increasing temperature during the removal of fluoride ions by adsorption using modified steel slag the gibbs free energy Œ¥g0 was negative when the temperature varied in the range of 298 318 k indicating that this reaction process was spontaneous Œ¥g0 increased with increasing temperature and the spontaneity of the adsorption process enhanced with increasing temperature moreover the standard enthalpy of the process Œ¥h0 0 indicating that the adsorption of fluoride by modified slag is a heat absorbing process and that a higher temperature is favorable for the adsorption 30 52 however it has also been shown that increasing the adsorption temperature may lead to a decrease in adsorption capacity for instance increasing the adsorption temperature decreased the decolorization of ag27 and ar138 acid dyes by steel slag which may be related to the fact that this adsorption process is exothermic enthalpy change Œ¥h0 0 111 4 3 initial solution concentration the adsorption capacity of pollutants removed by steel slag adsorption depends greatly on concentration of the pollutants in the initial solution the effect of the concentration of the initial solution depends on the relationship between the solution concentration and the available adsorption sites on the steel slag surface on the one hand the removal rate of pollutants decreases with increasing initial solution concentration which may be due to the saturation of adsorption sites on the steel slag surface however it has been shown that at low initial solution concentrations there are a large number of binding active adsorption sites on the surface of the slag and metal ions are readily adsorbed and removed by the slag with increased adsorption efficiency with the increase of solution concentration the binding adsorption sites on the surface of steel slag are gradually occupied by metal ions to reach saturation such that the availability of adsorption binding sites on the surface of steel slag decreases stabilizing the adsorption efficiency of steel slag on metal ions 11 on the other hand the increase in initial solution concentration leads to an increase in adsorption capacity and then approaches a steady state this is due to the high diffusion driving force at high solution concentrations which facilitates the diffusion of pollutants on the steel slag surface and achieves the adsorption and removal of pollutants fig 8 shows the removal efficiency of several pollutants by different types of steel slag at different initial solution concentrations 4 4 adsorption time the adsorption time determines the contact time and reaction time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate which in turn determines the adsorption effect of the adsorbent on the adsorbate in the early stages of adsorption the pollutant removal rate increases with time but once the steel slag has fully adsorbed pollutants from water and approaches equilibrium the mass concentration of pollutants in the solution stabilizes such there is no significant increase in the adsorption rate with time related research shows that the contact time between steel slag and solution increases which facilitates the dissolution of cao and the precipitation of cap which improves the efficiency of phosphorus removal 14 24 however studies have also shown that the efficiency of phosphorus removal does not increase linearly with increasing reaction time and exceeding the optimal reaction time reduces the phosphorus removal rate and generates excess caco3 which clogs the steel slag filter 112 4 5 mixing rate the stirring rate determines the speed of contact between the steel slag and the pollutants in the solution which in turn has an impact on the adsorption rate increasing the stirring rate increases the diffusion coefficient and mass transfer coefficient in the solution thereby reducing the mass transfer resistance of pollutants in the solution which facilitates easier contact between pollutants and the surface of steel slag to improve the pollutant removal efficiency however when the stirring rate reaches a certain value the adsorption of pollutants does not change significantly when the stirring speed continues to increase 53 60 which is not conducive to the complete separation of the steel slag from the solution therefore adjusting the stirring speed to a suitable value is crucial for the adsorption of pollutants from steel slag 4 6 steel slag dosage the rate of pollutant adsorption by steel slag is related to the number of available adsorption sites on the steel slag surface when the amount of steel slag added is low the adsorption driving force of the adsorption sites on the steel slag surface for pollutants is not evident further gradually increasing the amount of adsorbent whose available adsorption sites on the steel slag surface have not reached saturation can enhance the adsorption capacity of steel slag for pollutants some studies have shown that increasing the amount of steel slag adsorbent can increase the specific surface area of steel slag improving the adsorption of no3 n however when the steel slag dosage exceeds 50 g the removal rate does not improve significantly 54 the adsorption driving force per unit mass of steel slag decreases when the slag dosage reaches a certain value and the adsorption driving force per unit mass of steel slag further decreases when the adsorption site reaches saturation resulting in a gradual decrease in the adsorption capacity per unit mass of steel slag for pollutants 4 7 steel slag characteristics steel slag characteristics mainly include specific surface area particle size pore volume and pore radius its specific surface area pore size distribution and pore volume is determined using brunauer emmett teller bet analysis while particle size is determined using a particle size analyzer when the steel slag particle size is reduced the active area of the slag surface is increased as such the slag can be finely ground or modified activated to improve its porosity increase its specific surface area and surface energy and stimulate its activity to enhance the performance of the slag to remove pollutants table 3 shows the surface properties of several types of steel slag before and after modification however while increasing the specific surface area of steel slag its economics should also be considered smaller particle sizes can lead to greater ca2 release for phosphorus precipitation thus improving phosphorus removal 28 as the particle size of steel slag decreases the specific surface area increases the external diffusion and pore diffusion mass transfer distance decrease and the adsorbate has a greater potential for contact with the adsorption sites on the surface of steel slag which increases the decolorization rate of organic dyes by steel slag 58 however if the particle size is too small although it has a large specific surface area and surface energy its microstructure is easily destroyed during the grinding process and the best adsorption effect is not achieved 4 8 modifiers the ratio of the modifier and the change of modification conditions can significantly affect steel slag adsorption for removing pollutants lanthanum iron composite oxide modifier can chemically react with phosphorus to form insoluble precipitates 113 and the phosphorus removal rate of modified steel slag ceramic pellets can be improved by adjusting the ratio of improved lanthanum and iron complex oxides to steel slag lanthanum iron composite oxide steel slag powder starch and montmorillonite powder were mixed in the mass ratio of 10 50 15 25 and roasted at 1000 c for 30 min to produce lanthanum iron composite oxide modified steel slag ceramics lfsc its surface was rough and porous with high mechanical strength and the removal rate of phosphorus reached 84 5 within 2 h continuing to increase the modifier ratio or prolong the calcination time easily damaged the pore structure of lfsc and the phosphorus removal rate was not significantly improved 45 al2o3 is an active substance that can be used as an adsorbent to adsorb nh4 po4 3 cd2 and other pollutants in wastewater steel slag was mixed with aluminum hydroxide modifier at a mass ratio of 4 3 and treated at 700 c the mass fraction of al2o3 in the modified slag was increased from 2 42 to 40 76 as compared to the original slag presenting significantly increased al2o3 content and number of active sites in the slag the specific surface area of the modified slag increased from 0 911 m2 g to 37 251 m2 g due to the opening of pore channels and the expansion of micropore and mesopore pore size which improved the performance of the slag in adsorption of cd2 nh4 and po4 3 26 46 reasonable adjustment of the mass ratio of modifier and steel slag to prepare a well performing modified steel slag adsorbent can greatly enhance the ability of steel slag to remove pollutants from water bodies 4 9 coexisting ions the presence of both anions and cations in the solution affects the performance of the steel slag in the adsorption and removal of pollutants thereby lowering the removal efficiency of the pollutants in steel slag phosphorus removal experiments the dissolution of steel slag in solution releases oh which induces the conversion of hco3 to co3 2 which forms precipitates with ca2 on the slag surface leaving fewer active sites on the slag surface to bind to po4 3 thus resulting in reduced phosphorus removal during adsorption 44 114 in the process of phosphorus removal as cap precipitates are formed the presence of p in solution hinders the continuous increase of ca2 concentration in the aqueous phase which also impacts phosphorus removal 28 therefore to improve the removal efficiency of different classes of pollutants it is necessary to exclude the interference of other coexisting ions in removing water pollutants using steel slag 5 environmental safety and economic assessment of steel slag application for water treatment 5 1 safety performance assessment as a solid waste steel slag contains traces of chromium cadmium lead zinc mercury barium manganese and other heavy metals hence its environmental safety should be evaluated prior to its discharge into the aquatic environment to prevent secondary pollution gwon et al 115 studied the trace element content and leaching potential of different steel slags and only ba and mn were found to exceed 1 mg l the remining trace metal elements did not exceed this limit the toxicity characterization leaching potential standard of 1 mg l has been set by the u s environmental protection agency usepa for determining whether steel slags are hazardous to the environment during water treatment owing to the presence of cao f cao and other active ingredients the steel slag causes the water ph to increase however the ph does not exceed 12 5 thereby meeting the index requirements specified in hazardous waste identification standards leaching toxicity identification gb 5085 3 2007 hence the toxic heavy metals contained in the leachate except for zinc arsenic cadmium and iron were not detected and the content of the remaining heavy metals did not exceed the maximum limit value specified by the surface water class i standard 14 although steel slag dissolves phosphorus in seawater increasing the concentration of active phosphate in seawater the phosphate index of seawater treated by steel slag is nevertheless in line with the second class of seawater quality standards gb 3097 1997 and the concentration of heavy metals in seawater is also reduced to varying degrees 70 which not only does not cause secondary pollution of water bodies but also reduces the phosphorus heavy metals and other pollutants content in water bodies therefore steel slag can be applied as a harmless by product for effectively removing pollutants from waters with low potential of environmental risk 5 2 economic benefit assessment thus far various studies using steel slag for water treatment have focused on the properties mechanisms and technical advantages of steel slag as an adsorbent for treating wastewater containing various pollutants in order to make steel slag available for large scale application in water pollution treatment projects its cost and availability also need to be evaluated steel slag as a misplaced resource used in water treatment projects for removing pollutants not only prevents secondary pollution but also results in reasonable disposal of waste and utilization for curing waste by turning it into treasure this will lead to significant social economic and environmental benefits the use of steel slag to remove pollutants from water bodies reduces the cost and hazards of steel slag stockpiling such that the treated slag can be recycled as raw material for cement production and as a backfill material for wetlands and seabed among other uses according to usgs mrp u s geological survey mineral resources program data prices per ton of steel slag in 2021 ranged from a few cents to about us 120 or more per ton 116 comparison with other commonly used adsorbents in water treatment such as coconut shell based activated carbon us 0 88 1 32 103 t 1 117 commercial activated carbon us 2 20 5 00 103 t 1 118 water lily mango seed shell us 4 43 103 t 1 119 activated alumina us 0 66 1 19 103 t 1 117 modified graphene oxide us 60 104 t 1 120 carbon nanotubes us 441 85 106 t 1 121 the cost of steel slag is much lower and has good application prospects as an adsorbent material for water treatment however in practical engineering applications the costs associated with steel slag transportation disposal and spreading and post maintenance operations need to be evaluated moreover to maximize the ability of steel slag to remove pollutants and improve its treatment performance and utilization cost effectively the cost of modified materials also needs to be evaluated kumari et al 30 evaluated the cost required for the removal of fluoride from wastewater by raw feaf slag and activated feaf slag the cost of treating 10 000 l of wastewater contaminated with 5 mg l fluorine using activated feaf slag consists of acid addition and electricity costs totaling 489 60 usd whereas for the original feaf slag without activation treatment only its procurement and transportation costs needed to be considered few studies related to the economic performance assessment of steel slag for removing pollutants in water have been conducted thus far in the future we need to strengthen the economic performance assessment of steel slag applied to water treatment and perform cost estimation and life cycle assessments 6 conclusions the mechanisms of pollutant removal from water by steel slag include physical adsorption and chemisorption physical adsorption mainly involves two mechanisms surface adsorption and electrostatic adsorption which rely on van der waals forces between steel slag and the ionic state of pollutants in solution for removing pollutants chemisorption relies on one or more of surface coordination cation exchange chemical precipitation and reduction mechanisms to achieve the adsorption precipitation and reduction of pollutants ultimately achieving pollutant removal water pollutant removal upon adsorption by steel slag is dominated by the chemical adsorption process and is often accompanied by a physical adsorption process the two work synergistically to efficiently remove water pollutants steel slag has a large specific surface area and porosity which is a solid waste with good adsorption properties solid waste application to water bodies to remove inorganic non metallic ions such as phosphorus nitrogen sulfide and fluoride heavy metal ions such as copper nickel lead cadmium and chromium radioactive elements such as uranium rare metal elements such as vanadium and organic compounds such as organic dyes and phenols has achieved better removal results in the application of steel slag to remove pollutants from water factors such as solution ph temperature initial solution concentration adsorption time mixing rate steel slag dosage slag properties modifiers and coexisting ions can all influence the removal efficiency of pollutants finally the application of steel slag in water does not produce secondary pollution realizes the reuse of waste and has a certain economic value 7 future perspectives the low activity of steel slag owing to its own physical properties and chemical composition limits its adsorption performance although some studies have modified steel slag and mixed it with other materials to prepare composite materials the effect of removal of different types of pollutants is not the same in the future steel slag and other low cost adsorbents such as activated alumina tailings agricultural waste dredged soil and other reconstituted composite functional materials should be explored not only to improve the adsorption performance of steel slag but also to enable the maximum utilization of various solid wastes and improve the utilization rate of solid waste resources the application of steel slag to remove pollutants from water bodies has promising applications however most studies have been conducted on a single pollutant in water bodies in actual polluted waters such as domestic wastewater industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation wastewater and enclosed seas the multiple pollutants therein may have competing effects during adsorption therefore the removal effect and mechanism of steel slag applied to actual polluted waters in the presence of multiple pollutants should be investigated in the future further the performance of steel slag in treating pollutants in different waters should be comprehensively evaluated to provide theoretical support for future large scale application of steel slag moreover most studies have focused on the removal of phosphorus nitrogen heavy metals organic dyes and other pollutants by steel slag conversely studies on the use of steel slag modified steel slag and steel slag composites to treat sulfide pollution in water bodies are limited further studies are required to investigate the removal mechanism involved and practical application performance steel slag contains many ionic elements that can promote the growth of algae and aquatic organisms and play an important role in the restoration of water ecosystems furthermore the steel slag used for the treatment of pollutants in water bodies can be recycled as backfill materials and road base construction materials among other uses the overall process of steel slag application in water treatment can be scientifically analyzed in terms of improvement of water ecosystem before and after application and steel slag materials can be reused to maximize the utilization value of steel slag resources therefore multiple dimensions of steel slag application in waters should be explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12988,steel slag refers to solid waste with high specific surface area and large porosity that is discharged from the crude steel smelting process in steel mills the concentration of heavy metal ions

removal mechanism influencing factors water treatment 1 introduction steel is an essential material in life it is the main solid waste generated in the process of steel smelting with an output of approximately 15 20 of the annual crude steel production 1 china is the world s largest steel producer according to 2021 global steel statistics the global crude steel production in 2020 was 1 878 billion tons china s crude steel production reached 1 064 billion tons accounting for 56 7 of the global total crude steel production fig 1 2 in 2020 china s steel slag production reached 160 million tons for every 1 ton of crude steel produced nearly 0 15 to 0 2 tons of steel slag will be generated 35 of which is dumped as waste 3 the comprehensive utilization rate of steel slag in the united states europe japan and other industrialized countries is 85 98 4 whereas this is approximately only 29 5 in china 5 a large amount of steel slag is still piled in open air which not only occupies a large amount of land resources but after a certain period of weathering erosion will also result in migration of certain toxic and harmful substances from steel slag to soil groundwater and air thereby leading to different forms of pollution and several environmental problems 6 however the valuable components in the steel slag cannot be used resulting in resource wastage steel slag can be divided into open hearth furnace slag ohfs electric arc furnace slag eafs basic oxygen furnace slag bofs energy optimizing furnace slag eofs ladle furnace slag lfs and induction furnace slag ifs 7 8 however most open hearth steelmaking has been replaced by basic oxygen furnace converter steelmaking 9 and induction furnace steelmaking is also gradually replacing electric arc furnace steelmaking owing to cleaner and more efficient processes 10 steel slag is an alkaline material mainly composed of different oxides including cao sio2 fe2o3 al2o3 mgo mno and various alkaline substances that can be combined by h2o water to release oh ions 11 12 from the chemical composition of steel slag in table 1 we note that the cao and fe2o3 contents of bofs and eafs are high while the cao content of ifs is low 8 13 indicating that the chemical composition of steel slag of different origins and types is considerably different the presence of cao and mgo in steel slag results in lower activity and poor volumetric stability microscopically the surface of steel slag particles shows slightly concave and convex folds 14 characterized by porous structures with random distribution of pores and microcracks 8 and present a large specific surface area with high adsorption and precipitation capacity it has been reported that raw steel slag modified steel slag or reconstituted steel slag composites have been used as adsorbents to remove phosphate ammonia nitrogen sulfide organic pollutants and heavy metal ions copper cu arsenic as lead pb manganese mn chromium cr nickel ni zinc zn etc all with adequate removal results 15 18 to further improve the resourcefulness of steel slag and reduce the amount of steel slag stockpiles extensive research has been conducted on steel slag use in water treatment to realize resourceful and comprehensive utilization of solid waste to provide a reference for future research on the resource utilization of steel slag and the removal performance and mechanism of various types of pollutants this review paper discusses the main removal mechanisms of steel slag for pollutants in water presents a review and analysis of the removal effects and influencing factors of various types of pollutants in water bodies and provides a development direction for the further application of steel slag in water treatment 2 mechanism for removing pollutants from water by steel slag 2 1 adsorption mechanism physical adsorption is caused by intermolecular forces van der waals force between the adsorbent and the adsorbate and can occur on any solid surface chemical adsorption refers to the process of chemical bonding between the adsorbate molecules and the atoms or molecules in the adsorbent by electron transfer exchange and sharing and is often accompanied by chemical reactions the main mechanisms of chemisorption include reduction effect surface coordination chemical precipitation and ion exchange in the process of removing pollutants from water steel slag not only undergoes physical adsorption but is also often accompanied by chemical adsorption processes such as reduction precipitation coordination exchange and ion exchange using their synergistic effects to finally remove various types of pollutants 2 1 1 physical adsorption 1 surface adsorption it is determined by the porosity and specific surface area of steel slag the larger the specific surface area the better the physical adsorption effect particle size can be reduced and the porosity and micropore volume can be increased by grinding or modifying the steel slag the smaller the particle size of steel slag the higher the porosity the more active sites available on the slag surface for pollutant adsorption the greater the rate of diffusion and mass transfer of pollutants within the slag and the better the physical adsorption effect 6 26 28 2 electrostatic adsorption the hydroxyl group oh and other groups on the surface of steel slag can easily dissociate in aqueous solution forming adsorption sites on the surface of steel slag centered on negative charge while cations in solution can be adsorbed onto the surface of steel slag through electrostatic adsorption to remove pollutants when the solution ph is low a large amount of h in the acidic solution can protonate the hydroxyl group on the surface of the steel slag forming positive charge centered adsorption sites on the steel slag surface 29 this is not conducive to the adsorption of metal cations in solution but suitable for anions such as f in solution which can be adsorbed onto the surface of the steel slag through electrostatic adsorption to remove pollutants the adsorption mechanism of f on the surface of activated steel slag is shown in fig 2 2 1 2 chemical adsorption 1 surface coordination calcium ca iron fe aluminum al and other metal ions and their metal oxides in steel slag surface ion coordination unsaturated in aqueous solutions and undergo water dissociation reactions to form hydroxyl groups steel oh such that a large number of interrelated or separated hydroxyl groups are present on the surface of steel slag these hydroxyl groups can react with metal cations to generate surface coordination complexes which can adsorb heavy metal ions 27 31 taking the surface coordination process of a heavy metal ion m adsorption by steel slag as an example the specific removal mechanism is as follows 6 27 1 2steel oh m 2 steel o 2 m 2h 2 steel oh x m 2 steel om x h 3 steel oh y m 2 h 2 o steel omoh y 1 h 2 ion exchange ion exchange adsorption mainly relies on the ratio of electrostatic gravitational force between the adsorbate and the adsorbent to remove pollutants the steel slag surface comprises a large number of negative charges that repel each other however these can enable the exchange of ca ii and other metal cations on the steel slag surface with the metal cations in the solution to remove heavy metal ions in the solution steel slag can remove pb2 cu2 and cd2 by the combined action of ion exchange and chemical precipitation moreover under acidic conditions the compounds formed by ion exchange are very stable and heavy metal ions adsorbed onto the surface of the slag are not easily released into solution the main ion exchange mechanisms between steel slag and heavy metal ions are as follows m denotes heavy metals such as cu pb cd and ni 32 4 ca 2 fe 2 o 5 m 2 m 2 fe 2 o 5 ca 2 5 ca 2 sio 4 m 2 m 2 sio 4 ca 2 because the steel slag surface contains fe zn al and other metal oxides ion exchange reactions between the phosphate ions and the hydroxyl groups on the slag can occur during the process of phosphorus removal from steel slag covalent chemical bonding can be established between the phosphate and metal cations on the steel slag and other anions will be released to offer more sites for phosphate and other anions to attach thus resulting in phosphorus removal 33 3 chemical precipitation steel slag which contains a large amount of al2o3 mgo cao and other alkaline metal oxides releases a large amount of oh after being added to the water body owing to mixed hydrolysis of metal oxides the pollutants in the water body can combine with oh to form chemical precipitates to realize pollutant removal phosphate ion removal from steel slag is based on the following mechanism phosphate in the water body is adsorbed onto the surface of steel slag by surface adsorption and reacts chemically with the metal ions such as ca2 mg2 and al3 released by the hydrolytic ionization of steel slag in water therefore when the critical ph of phosphate precipitation is reached phosphate precipitates are formed thus removing phosphorus from water fig 3 depicts the main reaction processes for phosphate removal by adsorption on steel slag among the dissolved metal ions in the steel slag the ca2 concentration is the key factor for removing phosphorus by slag adsorption a large amount of ca2 dissolves on the surface of the steel slag and reacts chemically with the phosphate in wastewater to form a relatively stable hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3 oh precipitate the main removal mechanisms of phosphate are as follow 15 28 34 35 6 cao h 2 o ca 2 2oh 7 5ca 2 3 po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh because steel slag also contains compounds such as 2cao sio2 caco3 and ca oh 2 these substances also dissolve in solution to form ca2 ions thus relying on precipitation reactions to achieve phosphate removal 4 reduction effect in the steelmaking process oxygen o is blown to remove carbon c phosphorus p and sulfur s creating an oxidizing environment some of the iron atoms in the molten iron bath are oxidized to feo which undergoes indirect oxidation with dissolved oxygen in the iron bath to form fe2o3 and fe3o4 in addition unoxidized fe atoms are carried over during slagging adding a certain amount of steel slag to the solution owing to the presence of feo in the slag can provide electrons to the solution such that the redox potential in the solution changes and the pollutant can be removed via iron reduction in the slag steel slag is added to the synthetic wastewater containing cr6 the dissolved fe2 in the steel slag can reduce cr6 to cr3 part of the cr3 is adsorbed on the surface of the slag 36 and the remaining cr3 is removed by combining with oh to form a precipitate 37 the main removal mechanisms are shown in eqs 8 10 8 cr 2 o 7 2 6fe 2 14 h 2cr 3 6fe 3 7h 2 o 9 cr 3 3oh cr oh 3 10 ca 3 sio 4 2cr 3 cr 2 sio 4 3ca 2 the process of removing cr6 by using modified steel slag mainly relies on the reduction effect cr6 was removed from the water sample using recycled limestone residue rlr modified steel slag the reduction of cr6 by dissolved fe2 in the modified steel slag is an inner sphere reaction forming an rlr oh cr 5 inner sphere complex by reaction 11 the reaction uses dissolved fe2 in rlr to bridge oh in order to promote electron transfer in the inner sphere complex and later splits the bridged complex by reaction 12 to produce cr5 after repeated reactions toxic cr6 is finally reduced to nontoxic cr3 by reduction of dissolved fe2 using rlr 38 11 rlr oh cr 6 rlr oh cr 5 12 rlr oh cr 5 rlr cr 5 oh steel slag is used to remove hydrogen sulfide from artificial seawater and sediments in enclosed seas and inner harbors and iron is eluted from the slag and iron sulfide and singlet sulfur are formed by the reaction of iron on the reduction of dissolved hydrogen sulfide thus suppressing hydrogen sulfide in seawater and sediments 16 39 41 the main removal mechanisms are shown in eqs 13 16 13 hs fe 2 fes h 14 hs 2fe 3 s 0 2fe 2 h 15 fes s 0 fes 2 16 2fes 2 7o 2 2h 2 o 2feso 4 2h 2 so 4 2 2 adsorption kinetics during the adsorption of pollutants on steel slag the diffusion of pollutants from the solution to the slag surface and the rate of adsorption of pollutants to the active sites on the slag surface determine the kinetics and efficiency of the entire adsorption process a fast adsorption rate is as important as a high adsorption capacity for obtaining a high adsorption performance the adsorption kinetic model can not only evaluate the rate and adsorption amount of the adsorption process but can also be used to explain the removal mechanism of pollutants adsorbed by steel slag pseudo first order kinetics pseudo second order kinetics intra particle diffusion model and extra particle diffusion model have been used to elucidate the kinetics and adsorption mechanism of pollutants in water adsorbed on the surface of steel slag the pseudo first order kinetics is a kinetic model applied to liquid phase adsorption based on the amount of solid adsorption and the pseudo second order kinetics is based on the assumption that the adsorption rate is mainly controlled by the chemical adsorption process 42 in kinetic studies on the removal of various types of pollutants by adsorption using steel slag the actual adsorption processes based on the different properties of steel slag for the removal of phosphate po4 3 28 43 46 heavy metal ions 11 26 32 47 49 vanadate vo3 50 fluoride f 30 51 52 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 46 53 and nitrate nitrogen no3 n 54 were adequately described by pseudo second order kinetics fig 4 demonstrates the maximum removal efficiency of different properties of steel slag for several different pollutants in accordance with pseudo second order kinetics the adsorption of these types of pollutants by steel slag is mainly controlled by the active sites on the slag surface with chemisorption playing a dominant role and the main limiting factor affecting the adsorption rate of the entire adsorption process in the process of ammonia nitrogen removal by adsorption on steel slag the entire adsorption process can be described by a pseudo second order kinetic model nevertheless the results of boyd and kannan equations show that internal and external diffusion of particles also affect the ammonia nitrogen adsorption while only one factor plays a key role under certain conditions 53 in the process of no3 n adsorption using steel slag and modified steel slag it is mainly achieved by the chemisorption process of surface coordination and ion exchange the correlation coefficients of the pseudo second order kinetic model are higher than those of the pseudo first order kinetic model which could better describe the actual adsorption process of no3 n by steel slag and modified steel slag 42 54 the actual adsorption process of uranium by steel slag with differing properties can be well described by pseudo first order kinetic model 55 in the kinetic study of phenol adsorption the pseudo second order kinetic model can describe the adsorption process of phenol removal by unmodified steel slag whereas the process of phenol removal by modified steel slag is consistent with the pseudo first order kinetic model 56 indicating that the adsorption of phenol by steel slag is accompanied by both physisorption and chemisorption processes such as ion exchange the mechanisms and controlling factors of organic dye removal by steel slag differ for different types of organic dyes the adsorption of methylene blue dyes 57 by unmodified steel slag is consistent with the pseudo first order kinetic model the adsorption process of methylene blue mb 58 59 and methyl orange mo 59 dyes by modified steel slag is dominated by chemisorption which is better described by the pseudo second order kinetic model for acid jujube red dyes 60 and congo red dyes 61 pseudo second order kinetic models can also adequately describe the adsorption processes of these dyes by steel slags with differing properties for kd 8b dye the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model is more consistent with the adsorption process for its removal indicating that the adsorption process is controlled by pore diffusion 62 the analysis indicated that the kinetics and mechanisms of the removal of different types of organic dyes by adsorption from different properties of steel slag are related to the structure and properties of the dyes themselves 2 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are essential for explaining the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate elucidating the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent resolving the adsorption mechanism and predicting the behavior of the adsorbate langmuir and freundlich are the most widely used adsorption isotherm models to describe the adsorption of pollutants in water it has also been shown that the redlich peterson r p dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin adsorption isotherm models also provide good fit for the adsorption process for removing various pollutants 28 51 the langmuir isotherm assumes that the thickness of the adsorption layer is limited to one molecule monolayer adsorption the adsorbent surface is homogeneous and there is no interaction between adjacent sites of adsorbed molecules the freundlich isotherm assumes that the adsorbent surface is multiphase and the particles adsorbed on the adsorbent surface can interact with each other 63 64 the process of phosphorus removal by steel slag is based on chemisorption supplemented by physical adsorption for steel slag with a small particle size 2 mm its surface is considered homogeneous and dominated by monolayer adsorption and the adsorption process of phosphorus is better described by the langmuir isotherm for steel slag with a large particle size its surface energy is not uniform and there are often other particles competing with phosphorus for adsorption sites on the surface of the steel slag as such freundlich isotherms can better describe this adsorption process 28 43 65 66 the different adsorption properties for removing low concentrations of ammonia nitrogen 46 53 67 fluoride 30 etc follow single molecular layer adsorption which occur on specific homogeneous sites of steel slag the langmuir isotherm can better describe the adsorption process of these pollutants no3 n removal is mainly controlled by chemisorption such that ionic interactions occur on non uniform surfaces of steel slag the freundlich isotherm can adequately describe the adsorption mechanism of nitrate 54 nevertheless the adsorption isotherm of nitrate removal by modified steel slag is better fitted by langmuir after modification of steel slag which may be due to the more uniform distribution of active sites on the surface of modified steel slag moreover the adsorption process of nitrate on the surface of modified steel slag is dominated by monomolecular layer adsorption 65 both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms can describe the adsorption of steel slag on heavy metal ions and organic dyes but the different sources and treatment conditions of steel slag lead to differences in the slag surface energy distribution further because of the differences in the nature of different heavy metal ions and organic dyes for a given heavy metal ion or organic dye only one type of adsorption isotherm is fit for the adsorption process for example the adsorption characteristics of different properties of steel slag for the removal of different types of heavy metal ions such as pb2 49 cr6 68 cu2 23 cd2 26 mn2 69 and as3 47 can be better explained by the langmuir isotherm fig 5 shows the variation in adsorption capacity of different steel slag properties for removing various types of heavy metals in accordance with langmuir isotherm indicating that the adsorption capacity of different heavy metals is influenced by steel slag properties in contrast for removing heavy metal ions such as ni2 11 zn2 11 and hg2 70 the freundlich isotherm is more suitable than the langmuir isotherm to describe the adsorption mechanism both langmuir and freundlich isotherms can better fit the process of vanadium removal by adsorption of steel slag 50 and phenol 71 but the freundlich isotherm shows lower deviation and can better resolve the mechanism of vanadium and phenol removal by steel slag 3 recycling application of steel slag to remove pollutants in water in an environment that promotes resource conservation and recycling the solid waste generated in the steelmaking process is recycled as a low cost adsorption material for removing pollutants from contaminated water offering a new research direction for solid waste applications steel slag contains a variety of metal oxides with high porosity high specific surface area and good adsorption properties steel slag can be used to adsorb and remove pollutants such as phosphorus nitrogen hydrogen sulfide fluoride heavy metal ions organic dyes and phenol from water table 2 lists the applications of steel slag in removing these pollutants from water 3 1 removal of inorganic non metal ions 3 1 1 phosphate phosphorus is an important nutrient in the water environment and also a common pollutant excess phosphorus can lead to eutrophication of water bodies and damage water ecosystems effective control of phosphorus content in water and recovery of phosphorus are essential for resource and environmental protection currently the commonly used methods for phosphorus removal include biological treatment 72 ion exchange 73 chemical precipitation 74 membrane separation 75 and adsorption 76 adsorption is widely used because of its low application cost no secondary pollution and small footprint in engineering applications the removal of phosphorus from wastewater can be achieved by designing filtration systems using steel slag 77 78 during the application of steel slag filters there are signs of inhibited phosphorus removal due to reduced flow rates and the gradual appearance of sediments steel slag can successfully treat phosphorus in surface runoff however the use of untreated steel slag to remove dissolved phosphorus from subsurface drainage is not recommended to prevent ditch clogging and calcium carbonate precipitation due to reduced phosphorus treatment capacity 79 the presence of bicarbonate which can interfere with the chemical precipitation of calcium ions and phosphate by consuming the water soluble calcium ions and precipitating calcium carbonate 80 affects the efficiency of phosphate removal by adsorption of steel slag and reduces the service life of eafs for phosphate removal therefore aluminum treated steel slag was used instead of ordinary eafs to remove dissolved phosphorus from subsurface drainage 81 compared with common steel slag which is dominated by calcium ion precipitation of phosphate aluminum treated steel slag achieves phosphate removal by ligand exchange of phosphate with aluminum oxygen hydroxide and or chemical precipitation of aluminum with phosphate 82 this is more rapid than the calcium phosphorus precipitation reaction and does not compete as strongly with bicarbonate for adsorption thereby increasing total removal of phosphorus from 37 79 to 50 81 in subsurface drainage systems in the same ditch style phosphorus removal structure 79 81 83 aluminum treated steel slag removes phosphorus pollutants in the subsurface drainage system more effectively than untreated steel slag most studies 28 77 84 have been conducted on steel slag to remove water samples containing phosphorus with a concentration of above 5 mg l for the treatment of water samples containing phosphorus at low concentrations some researchers have modified steel slag for phosphorus removal at low concentrations improving phosphorus removal phosphorus removal by adsorption on lanthanum iron composite oxide leads to modification of steel slag ceramics in a solution with an initial phosphorus concentration of 1 mg l when the adsorbent dosing amount was 5 g l and ph 7 the phosphorus removal efficiency was as high as 99 07 44 45 a large number of studies and analyses have shown that steel slag has a large specific surface area and evident surface porous characteristics which entail high adsorption properties steel slag contains a variety of metal elements such as ca fe mg and mn which present a strong affinity to phosphate therefore steel slag has good potential and application prospects for removing phosphorus from waters 3 1 2 nitrogen domestic sewage industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation water discharged into the water environment result in a large accumulation of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen in the water environment disrupting the balance of the water ecosystem causing environmental problems such as eutrophication of water bodies and posing a serious threat to human health the adsorption method is widely used in treating nitrogen containing wastewater because of its simple operation easy recovery and adsorbent reuse etc the adsorption characteristics of steel slag for removing nh4 n 53 and no3 n 54 from aqueous solutions were studied showing that factors such as the initial solubility of the solution the particle size of the slag and the reaction time all affect the removal of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen however the removal mechanisms of the two nitrogenous pollutants are different as the removal of nh4 n is controlled by both external and internal diffusion mechanisms whereas that of no3 n is mainly accomplished by chemisorption to enhance the treatment performance of steel slag researchers have studied the effects of modified steel slag on the removal of nitrogen from wastewater through the high temperature activation treatment of steel slag the surface cracking of the modified steel slag after heat treatment increases the specific surface area and the negative charge on the surface resulting in increased adsorption of nh4 ions which greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of ammonia nitrogen 65 67 the ability of acid modified steel slag to remove nitrates using modified steel slag is greater than that of alkali modified and thermally modified slag the maximum adsorption of nitrate could be increased to 3 97 mg g at 5 mol l for acid modified conditions the adsorption of nitrate was 3 06 mg g for alkali modified steel slag at 3 mol l naoh concentration which was higher than the adsorption of the original steel slag 2 107 mg g when the temperature was 1000 c the specific surface area of thermally modified steel slag decreased and its optimal adsorption amount was 1 43 mg g which was lower than that of the original steel slag 65 nitrate adsorption by aluminum hydroxide modified steel slag has higher removal capacity than conventional acid alkali and thermal modification methods the aluminum hydroxide modified steel slag was prepared by compound modification method by mixing steel slag deionized water and aluminum hydroxide in the mass ratio of 3 0 45 2 and calcined at a temperature of 800 c the specific surface area of modified steel slag 9 531 m2 g was 3 34 times larger than the original steel slag 2 854 m2 g and the number of active adsorption sites was increased which greatly improved the nitrate removal capacity at ph of 4 nitrate concentration of 20 mg l modified steel slag was added at 10 g l and the reaction was carried out for 180 min the maximum adsorption capacity of modified steel slag was up to 6 165 mg g which was 1 9 times higher than that of original steel slag 3 482 mg g 42 3 1 3 hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide h2s is formed by the reduction of sulfate ions by sulfate reducing bacteria in organic enriched sediments under anoxic conditions hydrogen sulfide causes ecological degradation bad odor and other environmental issues and is highly toxic to living organisms therefore reducing hydrogen sulfide concentrations in sediments is critical for restoring and maintaining healthy water ecosystems a mixture of steelmaking slag and dredged soil set up for field trials in the waters of kawasaki city japan effectively restored seaweed beds and shoals indicating that iron ions were effectively dissolved in the steelmaking slag 85 however the solubility of the total iron content in steel slag is very small and hence it is easily oxidized to fe3 in oxygenated seawater resulting in the formation of water insoluble iron hydroxide the use of gluconic acid can greatly improve the solubility of iron in seawater by forming iron gluconic acid complexes to inhibit the conversion of fe2 to fe3 86 the mode of action and material change of the inhibition of hydrogen sulfide production in fig 6 shows that before employing steel slag sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate ions in seawater to form hydrogen sulfide in the bottom sediment enriched with organic matter laying steel slag on the bottom sediment not only prevents hydrogen sulfide generation by reducing contact between sulfate ions and sulfate reducing bacteria in the bottom sediment but also enables the use of the iron ions eluted by the steel slag these iron can react with the artificial seawater containing sulfide and the bottom sediment to reduce hs and form insoluble substances such as troilite fes and pyrite fes2 thereby effectively inhibiting the generation and diffusion of h2s 40 by analyzing the reaction products of steel slag and sulfide ions the possibility of reducing the sulfide content by iron ions in steel slag was proposed however to eliminate external disturbances due to the sulfide in seawater the reaction between iron ions and sulfide in steel slag was studied using nacl solution instead of seawater under the condition that it is not influenced by sulfate ions so4 2 eqs 13 16 41 the results showed that sulfate in solution originated from the reaction between iron in the steel slag and sulfide ions to form iron sulfides this process increased the redox potential of the solution and promoted the oxidation of sulfide ions to sulfate in addition mn ions present in steelmaking slag also react with sulfide eq 17 to form sulfur and mns and subsequently oxidize mns to sulfur and partially sulfate thus removing hydrogen sulfide from water 87 17 mn 2 o 3 h 2 s 4h 2mn 2 s 0 3h 2 o through research and analyses on the removal of sulfide steelmaking slag has been shown to be a promising material for application in the remediation of organic rich marine sediments and its use is expected to contribute to social and environmental sustainability however there are relatively few studies on the adsorption of steel slag for removing sulfide from water and there is no literature studying its adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm type hence its influencing effects and adsorption mechanism require further investigation 3 1 4 fluorine fluoride ions are one of the most toxic pollutants responsible for water pollution excess fluoride can cause dental bone fluorosis and neurological damage in humans effective and widely used treatment technologies for fluoride removal from water include adsorption coagulation precipitation electrocoagulation and membrane separation 88 adsorption is widely used in treatment processes to reduce the fluoride concentration in water because of its simplicity and high removal efficiency the adsorption performance of steel slag for fluoride removal from water was studied using the oscillatory adsorption method under acidic conditions the efficiency of fluoride ion removal by adsorption on steel slag increased with increasing ph under alkaline conditions the efficiency of fluoride ion removal by adsorption decreased with increasing ph a removal rate of 77 77 was achieved for fluorinated wastewater 40 mg l fluoride at the suitable ph of 4 10 steel slag dosage of 9 0 g and adsorption time of 90 min 89 to improve the performance of steel slag for fluoride removal the slag can be modified changing its pore properties specific surface area and surface functional groups to enhance the adsorption efficiency of steel slag a novel modified ferroalloy electric arc furnace feaf slag adsorbent was prepared for removing fluoride ions from wastewater using heat and acid treatment to destroy the internal compact structure of the original slag loosening it and increasing its specific surface area under the conditions of optimal ph 4 adsorbent dosage of 36 g l and initial fluorine concentration of 40 mg l the surface of feaf slag comprises more active adsorption sites which presents a positive charge on the surface of feaf slag this leads to the removal of more fluorine ions by adsorption through electrostatic attraction and ion exchange between sulfate and hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of feaf slag and fluorine ions presenting a fluorine removal efficiency of 97 42 compared with the efficiency of the original steel slag 68 98 30 some researchers have studied a new steel slag modification method which loads nanoparticles with steel slag to reduce the surface energy of steel slag and improve adsorption performance nanocomposite steel slag al cu ssw al cu was prepared by chemical reduction by loading al cu oxide nanoparticles with steel slag waste ssw fluoride removal was achieved by electrostatic interaction and chemisorption between nanoparticles and fluoride the maximum adsorption capacity of ssw al cu composites was 3 99 mg g with a fluoride removal rate of 89 5 51 3 2 removal of metal ions 3 2 1 heavy metal ions metals such as mercury hg chromium cr lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn copper cu nickel ni arsenic as and manganese mn are regarded as toxic heavy metals and wastewater containing these ions is usually a by product of metallurgy mining painting and electroplating industries which are harmful to the environment and human health 90 adsorption is one of the most widely applicable methods for removing heavy metal ions steel slag has adequate adsorption properties and is an effective adsorbent for treating heavy metal contaminated wastewater industrial acidic wastewater contains a large amount of heavy metal ions such as pb cd and cu the use of low cost adsorbents such as steel slag to remove cd ii pb ii cu ii plasma present in the wastewater presents a high removal efficiency and effective treatment without secondary pollution steel slag was used to remove heavy metals from acidic mine wastewater the reaction of steel slag with pb2 cu2 and cd2 ions formed compounds such as hydroxides ferrites carbonates silicates and oxides the characterization of these adsorption products and adsorption kinetic analyses showed that the removal mechanism of heavy metal ions was mainly a chemisorption process based on ion exchange and chemical precipitation under acidic conditions the coexistence of heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions facilitates the removal of heavy metal ions in acidic wastewater 32 the adsorption of heavy metal by steel slag based on its own characteristics has some limitations removal performance can be greatly enhanced by steel slag modification the removal of arsenic from wastewater by adsorption on modified steel slag has achieved removal rates of over 90 and up to 99 21 47 91 in addition to conventional modification methods such as acid alkali salt and heat composite modification of steel slag can be achieved by mixing one or more materials with steel slag followed by inorganic modification or heat treatment thus enhancing the adsorption properties of steel slag steel slag derived calcium silicate hydrate csh was prepared by alkali modification of steel slag using a composite activator of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate to remove heavy metal ions such as pb2 zn2 ni2 cu2 and cr3 the csh composite possesses a large adsorption capacity for these specific heavy metal ions with adsorption amounts greater than 100 mg g for all heavy metal ions 92 in general the performance of heavy metal ion removal by adsorption can be improved by steel slag modification but the adsorption effects of modified steel slag vary widely for different modification methods and different types of heavy metals for both pb2 and cu2 ions leaching of the slag with hcl solution only caused slight perturbation of the internal particle structure of the slag with insignificant enhancement in adsorption efficiency of the modified slag compared with the original slag 21 to improve the adsorption performance of modified steel slag for some heavy metal ions steel slag could be reconstituted with some abundant and inexpensive adsorbents to synthesize a new composite adsorbent material to improve the removal capacity through synergistic adsorption coalescence synergy steel slag and bentonite were mixed in the ratio of 5 5 5 na2co3 was added as a binder and after aging for 12 h the new bentonite steel slag composite bsc was reconstituted by calcination at 500 c for 1 h compared with raw steel slag bsc has a non uniform surface large specific surface area and numerous pores which is favorable for heavy metal ion adsorption the surface of bsc particles contain a large number of sio4 4 groups which can form a hydrated oxide covering layer with water thereby presenting an overall negative charge and achieving the removal of pb2 cd2 cr3 and zn2 ions through ion exchange complexation precipitation and synergistic adsorption coagulation under the optimal process conditions the adsorption amounts of pb2 cd2 and cr3 in wastewater by bsc were 4 98 mg g 4 95 mg g and 4 86 mg g respectively thus achieving adequate adsorption effects and providing a new research direction for the preparation of multifunctional environmental protection materials 48 93 94 the use of raw steel slag modified steel slag and reconstructed steel slag to treat wastewater containing heavy metal ions not only presents high treatment efficiency and good removal effects but also meets the relevant safety standards on leaching toxicity of treated steel slag to prevent secondary pollution and provide an effective adsorbent material this is of great significance for the treatment of heavy metal wastewater using low cost adsorbents 3 2 2 radioactive metal elements uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element that is widely used in the nuclear industry many nuclear wastewaters contain high concentrations of uranium u vi industrial wastewater containing uranium is characterized by strong radioactivity high acidity and coexistence with other metal ions 95 and its untreated discharge into the environment can cause environmental pollution and affect human health therefore there is a need to effectively remove u vi from water before contaminated wastewater is discharged into the environment numerous studies have shown that the use of steel slag as adsorbent material can effectively remove uranium elements from nuclear wastewater to efficiently remove u u vi is adsorbed by steel slag by physical adsorption ion exchange and chemical precipitation 55 the removal of u vi from nuclear wastewater by steel slag can be enhanced by modifying the raw steel slag the steel slag was treated with 1 sulfuric acid for 24 h and calcined at 500 c the acid treated and heat treated modified steel slag had a larger specific surface area and richer pore structure than the unmodified slag which providing more active adsorption sites for uranium and contained more oh functional groups that could combine with uranium thus improving the efficiency of uranium removal the maximum adsorption efficiency of complex adsorption of 10 mg l of uranium containing nuclear wastewater could reach 98 5 with the adsorption capacity of 6 41 mg g at a modified steel slag dosage of 0 3 g ph of 4 and adsorption time of 3 h 96 3 2 3 rare metal elements vanadium v is a rare metal element with a wide range of applications in the field of steel and metallurgy during vanadium processing large amounts of vanadium contaminated waste are released into the environment high vanadium concentrations can be potentially harmful to animals plants microorganisms and human health 97 vanadate can be removed from soil washing waste streams using converter steel slag as an adsorbent the removal rate of 97 1 was achieved at a steel slag particle size less than 0 15 mm a slag dosing rate of 50 g l and an initial vanadate concentration of 100 mg l during the removal of vanadium from aqueous solution using steel slag part of the converter slag dissolved in solution releases ca2 and vanadium exists in the aqueous solution in ionic form which forms a precipitate through reaction 18 and is adsorbed onto the slag surface to achieve vanadium removal 50 18 ca 2 vo 3 ca vo 3 2 3 3 removal of organic matter 3 3 1 organic dyes wastewater containing organic dyestuffs mainly originates from textile dyeing leather printing cosmetic and plastic industries and is characterized by complex composition high generation high organic content difficult degradation high chromaticity and high toxicity 98 it is important to effectively remove the various dyes present in industrial wastewater before discharged into the environment steel slag was used as adsorbent to treat acid jujube red dye wastewater reactive brilliant red kd 8b dye wastewater direct big red 4be dye wastewater navy blue dye wastewater and fuchsia dye wastewater all of which achieved adequate adsorption results with the decolorization rate of fuchsia dye reaching 96 16 under appropriate conditions 60 62 99 100 for removing acid jujube red dye molecules from steel slag the physical phase of the slag undergoes a hydration reaction whereby compounds enter the solution phase to combine with the dye molecules causing chemical precipitation and removal 101 numerous studies have shown that the modified steel slag adsorbs methylene blue dye effectively which is an organic cationic basic dye the surface of steel slag has a large number of adsorption sites with an overall negative charge while methylene blue ions present a positive charge decolorization of methylene blue dye is achieved under the action of electrostatic force through ion exchange adsorption on the surface of steel slag 57 salicylic acid methanol sam modified steel converter slag scs was used for the adsorption removal of methylene blue dye from wastewater the maximum adsorption of methylene blue by sam modified steel slag was 41 62 mg g which was 35 2 times higher than that of the original steel slag 1 15 mg g 58 although these studies adopted similar experimental conditions and used methylene blue dye the surface area of the acid modified steel slag bet prepared by plaza et al 102 was more than three times larger than that of the modified steel slag prepared by cheng et al 58 and was more influenced by the initial solubility of methylene blue the maximum adsorption of methylene blue dye using acid modified steel slag was 9 35 mg g ss cl hydrochloric acid modified steel slag which is lower than that obtained by cheng et al 3 3 2 phenolic compounds phenol containing wastewater mainly originates from leather and textile manufacturing petroleum refining steel casting and pharmaceutical and chemical industries phenolic compounds cannot be effectively degraded in the aqueous environment eventually causing environmental pollution and affecting human health therefore it is necessary to remove phenolic compounds from industrial wastewater before discharging into the environment using steel slag as the adsorbent the removal of phenol in wastewater was realized by oscillation adsorption the ph was less than 4 most phenol existed in the molecular state and the high concentration of h in the solution competed with phenol for adsorption resulting in a low phenol removal rate at higher ph the surface of steel slag was negatively charged as phenol was a weak acid ionization produced negatively charged c6h5o phenolic ions and the negatively charged sites on the surface of steel slag exhibited electrostatic repulsion with c6h5o ion which was not conducive to the adsorption and removal of phenol at a ph of 4 a slag particle size of 120 180 mesh and a phenol concentration of 500 mg l or less the efficiency of steel slag adsorption for phenol removal was nearly 50 71 103 to improve the removal efficiency of phenol and increase its potential for engineering applications several studies have been conducted to show that steel slag can be modified to increase its specific surface area and porosity thus improving its ability to adsorb phenol for phenolic compounds the adsorption of phenol by steel slag involves both surface adsorption and ion exchange although the modified slag could increase the specific surface area of the slag the removal efficiency of phenol by the acid and alkali modified slags 36 08 and 38 67 was lower than that of the unmodified slag 41 2 acid and alkali modified steel slags contain metal oxides react to generate soluble sulfate or ca oh 2 and other micro soluble substances which are attached to the surface of the slag it is difficult to dissolve the material attached to the modified steel slag surface as it partially blocks the original internal pores of the slag thus decreasing the phenol removal rate 56 3 3 3 high molecular polymer the residual hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam in oilfield polymer flooding wastewater exist in surface and groundwater for long periods which not only pollutes the water environment but also affects human health steel slag is denser and has a faster settling speed in water enabling easy solid liquid separation the metal oxides present in the slag can combine with hpam functional groups to achieve more effective treatment of oilfield polymer flooding wastewater through van der waals force adsorption and hydrogen bonding adsorption 104 in the adsorption of hpam by steel slag factors such as adsorbent dosage adsorption time ph value and slag particle size affect the efficiency of the adsorption process with a maximum removal of 89 31 of hapm at ph of 5 6 adsorption time of 95 4 min and slag dosage of 105 2 g l 105 steel slag has good prospects for the treatment of poly driven oil recovery wastewater however the change in functional groups on the surface of steel slag during its specific adsorption and regeneration require further research 4 factors influencing pollutant removal 4 1 solution ph the ph of a solution affects the adsorption performance of the adsorbent and is essential for removing pollutants from water using steel slag changes in ph not only affect the surface charge of the adsorbent and the stability of the functional groups on the active surface sites but also affect the adsorption process through precipitation caused by the neutralization effect of oh changes in the concentration of h and oh in solution affect the adsorption efficiency for anions or cations in strongly acidic media the protonation reaction 19 occurs on the hydrated surface of the steel slag consuming h from the solution such that a positive charge is generated on the slag surface increasing the initial solution ph 19 sur oh h sur oh 2 where sur represents the slag surface position and sur oh represents the slag surface hydroxyl group as the initial solution ph increases the steel slag surface acquires a negative charge through the deprotonation reaction 20 which continuously consumes the oh in the solution 20 sur oh oh sur o h 2 o therefore when the h concentration is high the adsorbent surface favors the adsorption of anions at low ph whereas when the ph is high adsorption or precipitation of cations is favored owing to the precipitation of oh 11 26 47 90 106 numerous studies 28 33 43 45 have shown that any change in solution ph affects the efficiency of phosphorus removal from steel slag at low ph the electrostatic gravitational force between the positively charged steelmaking slag surface and phosphate ions facilitates the adsorption process near the zero charge point phpzc an increase in ph leads to a decrease in the slag surface charge which reduces the attraction and thus the phosphorus removal rate when the initial ph is higher than phpzc the formation of calcium phosphate on the slag surface at high ph leads to precipitation which increases the phosphorus removal rate however for some specific types of pollutants ph has almost no effect on the removal when the initial ph of the solution was between 1 and 11 the removal efficiency of vanadium was approximately 96 vanadium existed in solution as an anion and did not form a precipitate with oh and the solution ph range was sufficiently large to remove vanadium effectively thus expanding the use of steel slag as an adsorbent 50 fig 7 demonstrates the effect of steel slag on the removal performance of several different pollutants at different solution ph levels 4 2 temperature the effect of temperature on the adsorption process is more complex and varies based on the adsorption amount of different pollutants in the process of phosphorus removal by steel slag adsorption first the phosphorus in solution must overcome the resistance of the liquid film around the slag particles to diffuse to the outer surface of the adsorbent before diffusion into its fine pores when the temperature increases it not only enhances the ability of the phosphorus in solution to overcome the liquid film resistance around the slag surface but also aids migration of phosphorus adsorbed on the slag surface along the slag micropores to its interior increasing the availability of surface sites for pollutant adsorption therefore increasing the temperature is beneficial for phosphorus removal by adsorption of steel slag powder 14 107 simultaneously the reaction temperature is increased the migration rate of heavy metal ions in solution is enhanced due to activation of the steel slag surface and the pore size increases to overcome the spatial site resistance which accelerates the adsorption of heavy metal ions 108 however when the temperature reaches a certain value continuing to increase the temperature will accelerate the desorption process and affect the adsorption of heavy metal ions resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate 70 109 110 the adsorption capacity of fluoride ions by steel slag also increased with increasing temperature during the removal of fluoride ions by adsorption using modified steel slag the gibbs free energy Œ¥g0 was negative when the temperature varied in the range of 298 318 k indicating that this reaction process was spontaneous Œ¥g0 increased with increasing temperature and the spontaneity of the adsorption process enhanced with increasing temperature moreover the standard enthalpy of the process Œ¥h0 0 indicating that the adsorption of fluoride by modified slag is a heat absorbing process and that a higher temperature is favorable for the adsorption 30 52 however it has also been shown that increasing the adsorption temperature may lead to a decrease in adsorption capacity for instance increasing the adsorption temperature decreased the decolorization of ag27 and ar138 acid dyes by steel slag which may be related to the fact that this adsorption process is exothermic enthalpy change Œ¥h0 0 111 4 3 initial solution concentration the adsorption capacity of pollutants removed by steel slag adsorption depends greatly on concentration of the pollutants in the initial solution the effect of the concentration of the initial solution depends on the relationship between the solution concentration and the available adsorption sites on the steel slag surface on the one hand the removal rate of pollutants decreases with increasing initial solution concentration which may be due to the saturation of adsorption sites on the steel slag surface however it has been shown that at low initial solution concentrations there are a large number of binding active adsorption sites on the surface of the slag and metal ions are readily adsorbed and removed by the slag with increased adsorption efficiency with the increase of solution concentration the binding adsorption sites on the surface of steel slag are gradually occupied by metal ions to reach saturation such that the availability of adsorption binding sites on the surface of steel slag decreases stabilizing the adsorption efficiency of steel slag on metal ions 11 on the other hand the increase in initial solution concentration leads to an increase in adsorption capacity and then approaches a steady state this is due to the high diffusion driving force at high solution concentrations which facilitates the diffusion of pollutants on the steel slag surface and achieves the adsorption and removal of pollutants fig 8 shows the removal efficiency of several pollutants by different types of steel slag at different initial solution concentrations 4 4 adsorption time the adsorption time determines the contact time and reaction time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate which in turn determines the adsorption effect of the adsorbent on the adsorbate in the early stages of adsorption the pollutant removal rate increases with time but once the steel slag has fully adsorbed pollutants from water and approaches equilibrium the mass concentration of pollutants in the solution stabilizes such there is no significant increase in the adsorption rate with time related research shows that the contact time between steel slag and solution increases which facilitates the dissolution of cao and the precipitation of cap which improves the efficiency of phosphorus removal 14 24 however studies have also shown that the efficiency of phosphorus removal does not increase linearly with increasing reaction time and exceeding the optimal reaction time reduces the phosphorus removal rate and generates excess caco3 which clogs the steel slag filter 112 4 5 mixing rate the stirring rate determines the speed of contact between the steel slag and the pollutants in the solution which in turn has an impact on the adsorption rate increasing the stirring rate increases the diffusion coefficient and mass transfer coefficient in the solution thereby reducing the mass transfer resistance of pollutants in the solution which facilitates easier contact between pollutants and the surface of steel slag to improve the pollutant removal efficiency however when the stirring rate reaches a certain value the adsorption of pollutants does not change significantly when the stirring speed continues to increase 53 60 which is not conducive to the complete separation of the steel slag from the solution therefore adjusting the stirring speed to a suitable value is crucial for the adsorption of pollutants from steel slag 4 6 steel slag dosage the rate of pollutant adsorption by steel slag is related to the number of available adsorption sites on the steel slag surface when the amount of steel slag added is low the adsorption driving force of the adsorption sites on the steel slag surface for pollutants is not evident further gradually increasing the amount of adsorbent whose available adsorption sites on the steel slag surface have not reached saturation can enhance the adsorption capacity of steel slag for pollutants some studies have shown that increasing the amount of steel slag adsorbent can increase the specific surface area of steel slag improving the adsorption of no3 n however when the steel slag dosage exceeds 50 g the removal rate does not improve significantly 54 the adsorption driving force per unit mass of steel slag decreases when the slag dosage reaches a certain value and the adsorption driving force per unit mass of steel slag further decreases when the adsorption site reaches saturation resulting in a gradual decrease in the adsorption capacity per unit mass of steel slag for pollutants 4 7 steel slag characteristics steel slag characteristics mainly include specific surface area particle size pore volume and pore radius its specific surface area pore size distribution and pore volume is determined using brunauer emmett teller bet analysis while particle size is determined using a particle size analyzer when the steel slag particle size is reduced the active area of the slag surface is increased as such the slag can be finely ground or modified activated to improve its porosity increase its specific surface area and surface energy and stimulate its activity to enhance the performance of the slag to remove pollutants table 3 shows the surface properties of several types of steel slag before and after modification however while increasing the specific surface area of steel slag its economics should also be considered smaller particle sizes can lead to greater ca2 release for phosphorus precipitation thus improving phosphorus removal 28 as the particle size of steel slag decreases the specific surface area increases the external diffusion and pore diffusion mass transfer distance decrease and the adsorbate has a greater potential for contact with the adsorption sites on the surface of steel slag which increases the decolorization rate of organic dyes by steel slag 58 however if the particle size is too small although it has a large specific surface area and surface energy its microstructure is easily destroyed during the grinding process and the best adsorption effect is not achieved 4 8 modifiers the ratio of the modifier and the change of modification conditions can significantly affect steel slag adsorption for removing pollutants lanthanum iron composite oxide modifier can chemically react with phosphorus to form insoluble precipitates 113 and the phosphorus removal rate of modified steel slag ceramic pellets can be improved by adjusting the ratio of improved lanthanum and iron complex oxides to steel slag lanthanum iron composite oxide steel slag powder starch and montmorillonite powder were mixed in the mass ratio of 10 50 15 25 and roasted at 1000 c for 30 min to produce lanthanum iron composite oxide modified steel slag ceramics lfsc its surface was rough and porous with high mechanical strength and the removal rate of phosphorus reached 84 5 within 2 h continuing to increase the modifier ratio or prolong the calcination time easily damaged the pore structure of lfsc and the phosphorus removal rate was not significantly improved 45 al2o3 is an active substance that can be used as an adsorbent to adsorb nh4 po4 3 cd2 and other pollutants in wastewater steel slag was mixed with aluminum hydroxide modifier at a mass ratio of 4 3 and treated at 700 c the mass fraction of al2o3 in the modified slag was increased from 2 42 to 40 76 as compared to the original slag presenting significantly increased al2o3 content and number of active sites in the slag the specific surface area of the modified slag increased from 0 911 m2 g to 37 251 m2 g due to the opening of pore channels and the expansion of micropore and mesopore pore size which improved the performance of the slag in adsorption of cd2 nh4 and po4 3 26 46 reasonable adjustment of the mass ratio of modifier and steel slag to prepare a well performing modified steel slag adsorbent can greatly enhance the ability of steel slag to remove pollutants from water bodies 4 9 coexisting ions the presence of both anions and cations in the solution affects the performance of the steel slag in the adsorption and removal of pollutants thereby lowering the removal efficiency of the pollutants in steel slag phosphorus removal experiments the dissolution of steel slag in solution releases oh which induces the conversion of hco3 to co3 2 which forms precipitates with ca2 on the slag surface leaving fewer active sites on the slag surface to bind to po4 3 thus resulting in reduced phosphorus removal during adsorption 44 114 in the process of phosphorus removal as cap precipitates are formed the presence of p in solution hinders the continuous increase of ca2 concentration in the aqueous phase which also impacts phosphorus removal 28 therefore to improve the removal efficiency of different classes of pollutants it is necessary to exclude the interference of other coexisting ions in removing water pollutants using steel slag 5 environmental safety and economic assessment of steel slag application for water treatment 5 1 safety performance assessment as a solid waste steel slag contains traces of chromium cadmium lead zinc mercury barium manganese and other heavy metals hence its environmental safety should be evaluated prior to its discharge into the aquatic environment to prevent secondary pollution gwon et al 115 studied the trace element content and leaching potential of different steel slags and only ba and mn were found to exceed 1 mg l the remining trace metal elements did not exceed this limit the toxicity characterization leaching potential standard of 1 mg l has been set by the u s environmental protection agency usepa for determining whether steel slags are hazardous to the environment during water treatment owing to the presence of cao f cao and other active ingredients the steel slag causes the water ph to increase however the ph does not exceed 12 5 thereby meeting the index requirements specified in hazardous waste identification standards leaching toxicity identification gb 5085 3 2007 hence the toxic heavy metals contained in the leachate except for zinc arsenic cadmium and iron were not detected and the content of the remaining heavy metals did not exceed the maximum limit value specified by the surface water class i standard 14 although steel slag dissolves phosphorus in seawater increasing the concentration of active phosphate in seawater the phosphate index of seawater treated by steel slag is nevertheless in line with the second class of seawater quality standards gb 3097 1997 and the concentration of heavy metals in seawater is also reduced to varying degrees 70 which not only does not cause secondary pollution of water bodies but also reduces the phosphorus heavy metals and other pollutants content in water bodies therefore steel slag can be applied as a harmless by product for effectively removing pollutants from waters with low potential of environmental risk 5 2 economic benefit assessment thus far various studies using steel slag for water treatment have focused on the properties mechanisms and technical advantages of steel slag as an adsorbent for treating wastewater containing various pollutants in order to make steel slag available for large scale application in water pollution treatment projects its cost and availability also need to be evaluated steel slag as a misplaced resource used in water treatment projects for removing pollutants not only prevents secondary pollution but also results in reasonable disposal of waste and utilization for curing waste by turning it into treasure this will lead to significant social economic and environmental benefits the use of steel slag to remove pollutants from water bodies reduces the cost and hazards of steel slag stockpiling such that the treated slag can be recycled as raw material for cement production and as a backfill material for wetlands and seabed among other uses according to usgs mrp u s geological survey mineral resources program data prices per ton of steel slag in 2021 ranged from a few cents to about us 120 or more per ton 116 comparison with other commonly used adsorbents in water treatment such as coconut shell based activated carbon us 0 88 1 32 103 t 1 117 commercial activated carbon us 2 20 5 00 103 t 1 118 water lily mango seed shell us 4 43 103 t 1 119 activated alumina us 0 66 1 19 103 t 1 117 modified graphene oxide us 60 104 t 1 120 carbon nanotubes us 441 85 106 t 1 121 the cost of steel slag is much lower and has good application prospects as an adsorbent material for water treatment however in practical engineering applications the costs associated with steel slag transportation disposal and spreading and post maintenance operations need to be evaluated moreover to maximize the ability of steel slag to remove pollutants and improve its treatment performance and utilization cost effectively the cost of modified materials also needs to be evaluated kumari et al 30 evaluated the cost required for the removal of fluoride from wastewater by raw feaf slag and activated feaf slag the cost of treating 10 000 l of wastewater contaminated with 5 mg l fluorine using activated feaf slag consists of acid addition and electricity costs totaling 489 60 usd whereas for the original feaf slag without activation treatment only its procurement and transportation costs needed to be considered few studies related to the economic performance assessment of steel slag for removing pollutants in water have been conducted thus far in the future we need to strengthen the economic performance assessment of steel slag applied to water treatment and perform cost estimation and life cycle assessments 6 conclusions the mechanisms of pollutant removal from water by steel slag include physical adsorption and chemisorption physical adsorption mainly involves two mechanisms surface adsorption and electrostatic adsorption which rely on van der waals forces between steel slag and the ionic state of pollutants in solution for removing pollutants chemisorption relies on one or more of surface coordination cation exchange chemical precipitation and reduction mechanisms to achieve the adsorption precipitation and reduction of pollutants ultimately achieving pollutant removal water pollutant removal upon adsorption by steel slag is dominated by the chemical adsorption process and is often accompanied by a physical adsorption process the two work synergistically to efficiently remove water pollutants steel slag has a large specific surface area and porosity which is a solid waste with good adsorption properties solid waste application to water bodies to remove inorganic non metallic ions such as phosphorus nitrogen sulfide and fluoride heavy metal ions such as copper nickel lead cadmium and chromium radioactive elements such as uranium rare metal elements such as vanadium and organic compounds such as organic dyes and phenols has achieved better removal results in the application of steel slag to remove pollutants from water factors such as solution ph temperature initial solution concentration adsorption time mixing rate steel slag dosage slag properties modifiers and coexisting ions can all influence the removal efficiency of pollutants finally the application of steel slag in water does not produce secondary pollution realizes the reuse of waste and has a certain economic value 7 future perspectives the low activity of steel slag owing to its own physical properties and chemical composition limits its adsorption performance although some studies have modified steel slag and mixed it with other materials to prepare composite materials the effect of removal of different types of pollutants is not the same in the future steel slag and other low cost adsorbents such as activated alumina tailings agricultural waste dredged soil and other reconstituted composite functional materials should be explored not only to improve the adsorption performance of steel slag but also to enable the maximum utilization of various solid wastes and improve the utilization rate of solid waste resources the application of steel slag to remove pollutants from water bodies has promising applications however most studies have been conducted on a single pollutant in water bodies in actual polluted waters such as domestic wastewater industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation wastewater and enclosed seas the multiple pollutants therein may have competing effects during adsorption therefore the removal effect and mechanism of steel slag applied to actual polluted waters in the presence of multiple pollutants should be investigated in the future further the performance of steel slag in treating pollutants in different waters should be comprehensively evaluated to provide theoretical support for future large scale application of steel slag moreover most studies have focused on the removal of phosphorus nitrogen heavy metals organic dyes and other pollutants by steel slag conversely studies on the use of steel slag modified steel slag and steel slag composites to treat sulfide pollution in water bodies are limited further studies are required to investigate the removal mechanism involved and practical application performance steel slag contains many ionic elements that can promote the growth of algae and aquatic organisms and play an important role in the restoration of water ecosystems furthermore the steel slag used for the treatment of pollutants in water bodies can be recycled as backfill materials and road base construction materials among other uses the overall process of steel slag application in water treatment can be scientifically analyzed in terms of improvement of water ecosystem before and after application and steel slag materials can be reused to maximize the utilization value of steel slag resources therefore multiple dimensions of steel slag application in waters should be explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12989,due to ammonia toxicity in microalgal treatment systems wastewaters with excessive ammonia require pre treatment either dilution or chemical stripping but this can be costly alternatively the addition of organic carbon may help to alleviate toxicity this study investigated effects of glucose addition on toxicity in three microalgal species glucose reduced toxicity at ammonia concentrations from 50 to 1000 mg l 1 in all species growth rate cell count and biovolume significantly increased p 0 01 with glucose at all ammonia concentrations carbon to nitrogen ratio c n was important for maximising tolerance varying with species ammonia concentration and parameter measured for chlorella sorokiniana the highest total biovolume yield 2 3 104 1 3 103 Œºm 3 ml 1 was achieved at 25 mg l 1 and c n 5 for coelastrum sp 1 0 104 0 8 103 Œºm 3 ml 1 it was achieved at 750 mg l 1 and c n 9 and for desmodesmus communis 6 9 107 5 2 106 Œºm 3 ml 1 it was achieved at 1000 mg l 1 and c n 5 when grown on food waste centrate effective quantum yield light absorption growth rate biomass yield and nutrient removal were all inhibited at concentrations between 100 and 500 mg l 1 however the addition of glucose at c n 1 or 5 alleviated ammonia toxicity resulting in significantly higher p 0 01 biomass and nutrient removal the simple addition of glucose was effective at reducing ammonia toxicity and improving microalgal wastewater treatment in both defined medium and centrate at lab scale further research is needed to assess effectiveness at scale for improved wastewater treatment keywords wastewater treatment toxicity microalgal productivity nutrient removal microalgal treatment systems 1 introduction recent interest in the recovery of energy from organic wastes has seen an increase in the diversion of wastes such as green food and agricultural from landfill to waste to energy facilities 1 such diversion is recognised as being an environmentally and economically viable alternative to traditional disposal and gives rise to the circular bioeconomy through the reduction and reutilisation of waste 2 3 an example of this is the conversion of food waste via anaerobic digestion to biogas ch4 and some co2 which is captured and used to generate electricity and the nutrient rich sludge can be dried and used as a biofertiliser 2 however a by product of anaerobic digestion is nutrient enriched liquid centrate which can have a high total ammonia nh4 n nh3 concentration typically around 2000 g m 3 4 due to the potential toxic effect of high ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations on aquatic biota this centrate requires treatment before it can be discharged to the environment 5 microalgae have long been recognised for their ability to cost effectively treat a wide range of wastewaters including municipal agricultural and industrial through the assimilation of nutrients from the wastewater into their biomass 6 9 this biomass can then be utilised as a feedstock for the biorefinery of a range of novel products thus providing further opportunity to recover resources from waste in most wastewaters including those derived from anaerobic digestion of organic matter nitrogen is predominantly in the form of ammoniacal nitrogen which can be directly assimilated by the microalgae into amino acids for growth however high concentrations of ammonia can become toxic to the cells negatively affecting growth and function 10 ammonia toxicity can inhibit photosynthesis causing disruption to photosystem i and ii as well as the electron transport rate 12 inhibit chlorophyll production 13 disrupt intracellular ph balance destroy carbon to nitrogen balance deplete nutrients 14 and cause cell death 15 in aqueous solutions total ammonia is present as both the ammonium ion nh4 and unionised free ammonia nh3 11 nh3 is considered to be the most toxic form of ammoniacal nitrogen due to its lack of charge and its high lipid solubility meaning that it can readily diffuse through the cell membrane without the aid of transporters 15 the proportion of each chemical species is dependent on a number of physico chemical factors including temperature and ph as either temperature or ph increases ionisation decreases resulting in an increased proportion of nh3 and subsequently higher toxicity 11 at ph 9 25 total ammonia is theoretically comprised of 56 nh3 14 in microalgal wastewater treatment systems both temperature and ph fluctuate diurnally with the latter being a result of photosynthetic drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon by the dense microalgal culture and daytime ph regularly exceeds 9 in systems without ph control 16 this can be controlled by co2 addition which not only overcomes inorganic carbon limitation in microalgal treatment systems but also maintains ph 8 thus reducing the amount of nh3 in solution however at high total ammonia concentrations this may still not be sufficient to overcome ammonia toxicity 9 18 for example 1 7 mg of nh3 has been shown to be toxic to 200 marine microalgae 19 while 50 mg n l 1 has been shown to be toxic to chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus 12 20 at ph 8 and a total ammonia concentration of 100 and 1000 mg n l 1 theoretically it contains 5 mg and 50 mg of nh3 respectively one of the simplest approaches to overcoming ammonia toxicity is the dilution of highly concentrated ammonia wastewaters with either freshwater recycled effluent or in the case of marine based systems seawater however due to the demands on freshwater its use for dilution is not a viable option for wastewater treatment while dilution with recycled effluent or seawater can substantially increase the footprint and operating costs of the microalgal treatment system due to the increased volume of wastewater to treat similarly chemical ammonia stripping and nitrification by bacteria are considered unsustainable due to high cost and energy consumption 17 another approach to improving microalgal tolerance to high ammonia concentration is the addition of organic carbon organic carbon is considered essential for increased ammonia tolerance in higher plants and algae 21 and while the exact mechanism is unknown supplementary carbon is thought to alleviate ammonia toxicity by providing the necessary energy source and hydride donor critical to nh4 assimilation 22 the primary assimilation of nh4 into amino acids requires carbon skeletons in the form of keto acids as well as energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate 23 supplementary carbon may also provide the additional energy needed when photosynthesis becomes disrupted due to the effects of high ammonia concentrations while wastewaters particularly those derived from anaerobic digestion of organic matter contain large amounts of dissolved organic compounds most are not in a form that is readily available for microalgal use 24 microalgae can only use relatively simple molecules such as sugars organic and amino acids and several aromatic compounds 23 therefore supplementation with a simple organic carbon source may be needed to help facilitate increased ammonia tolerance and effective wastewater treatment in this study the effects of supplementing glucose on ammonia tolerance in three wastewater microalgae are investigated growth rates cell counts and biovolumes of the three microalgae were assessed along ammoniacal nitrogen and carbon nitrogen c n gradients in defined medium following this the ability of desmodesmus communis to bioremediation food water centrate at three ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations and three c n ratios was assessed with respect to growth rate nutrient removal and biomass production 2 methods 2 1 microalgae species and axenic cultures the three microalgal species used in this study had previously been isolated from the outdoor wastewater treatment system into mono algal cultures according to the methods of andersen kawachi 25 the microalgal species were identified to species level where possible based on the taxonomic descriptions of john et al 26 and associated literature the species were identified as chlorella sorokiniana shihira r w krauss coelastrum sp and desmodesmus communis e hegewald e hegewald all three species are classified as microalgae that are adapted to shallow eutrophic waterbodies 27 and are commonly associated with microalgal wastewater treatment systems 28 axenic lines of the microalgal species were established using antibiotic treatment according to andersen kawachi 25 the axenic cultures were maintained in 0

carbon in the form of glucose had a positive influence on the ability of three microalgal species to tolerate high ammonia concentrations the impacts of organic carbon addition on microalgal performance are discussed below along with the implications for the treatment of high ammonia wastewaters 4 1 growth rate cell count and biovolume all three microalgal species used in this study belong to the algal class chlorophyceae which is regarded as being generally more tolerant to high ammonium concentrations than other classes of microalgae 15 for all three species growth rate inhibition occurred at approximately the same ammoniacal nitrogen concentration and was within the range reported by dai et al 36 for chlorophytes from hypertrophic regions this was also reflected in the total cell count measured at the end of the growth curve with total counts rapidly decreasing with increasing ammonia concentration one of the direct effects of high ammonia concentration is cell lysis where the microalgal cells burst open either immediately or within a few hours of exposure 15 37 in the present study while daily cell counts were not conducted it is plausible to suggest that cell lysis occurred in treatments where ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations were 100 mg n l 1 without carbon supplementation as reflected in the decreased optical density compared to time zero which gave rise to the negative maximum growth rate positive responses in both the growth rate and total cell count to organic carbon supplementation at the toxic ammonia concentrations suggest that the microalgae were either capable of switching to heterotrophic metabolism or the exogenous carbon provided the necessary energy to allow rapid assimilation of nh4 into amino acids thus reducing toxic accumulation within the cell 23 based on the results of this study it is difficult to interpret which mechanism was the main driver for improved growth and total cell yield while the default interpretation would be heterotrophic growth in the presence of the organic carbon this may not have been the case in the present study the three microalgae strains used in this study had previously been used in an assessment of heterotrophy using a broad range of carbon compounds 38 d communis showed a high affinity to organic carbon metabolism and demonstrated strong positive heterotrophic growth with glucose supplementation whereas coelastrum sp and c sorokiniana showed poor affinity to organic carbon metabolism and constrained heterotrophic growth with glucose supplementation 38 despite these differences in heterotrophy in the present study all three species showed similar growth rate and total cell yield to carbon supplementation alternatively rather than accumulating in the cells ammonia may have been rapidly converted into the amino acids glutamine glutamate via glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities 39 and the presence of exogenous carbon may have helped facilitate this conversion by supplying the required energy green algae have higher glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities compared to other algae and this is thought to explain their higher ammonia tolerance 39 the toxic effect of ammonia depends on the internal carbon balance between photosynthesis and sucrose reserves that are needed to sustain ammonia assimilation its conversion to amino acids in eelgrasses 40 the authors noted that as ammonia concentration and assimilation increased the carbon pool became drained resulting in intracellular accumulation of ammonia and increased toxicity 40 a similar phenomenon is thought to occur in microalgae and optimising the carbon to nitrogen ratio has been regarded as an effective way to promote ammonia assimilation and conversion in microalgal cells 23 cell biovolume and growth rates in microalgae are intrinsically linked with cells undergoing faster growth and reproduction tending to be smaller than those cells that are slower to grow and reproduce it has long been recognised that growth conditions including nutrients play an important role in stimulating the relative rates of cell division and ultimately biovolume in microalgae 41 for example nitrogen depletion is often associated with increased cell size compared to nitrogen replete conditions suggesting decreased cell division 41 43 but little is known about the response of cell to excess nitrogen conditions in the present study increasing ammonia concentration had a variable effect on cell biovolume amongst the three species suggesting that the effect of ammonia concentration on cell biovolume as the proxy to cell division is not ubiquitous across green algae however these results need to be viewed with caution due to the effects of increasing toxicity had on cells as ammonia concentration increased as discussed above cell lysis occurs with high ammonia exposure and those cells remains may have undergone morphological and physiological changes in response to the exposure that may not necessarily translate into long term survivability in contrast the addition of glucose was more predictable with cell biovolume increasing for two of the species within a given ammonia concentration increased cell biovolume coincided with increased maximum growth rate for these two species this seems contradictory to smaller cell biovolume associated with faster growth rate but this may reflect physiological changes as a result of exogenous organic carbon supply physiological changes may have included increased amino acid production in the presence of high carbon and ammonia 39 increased storage products from improved metabolism 42 decreased respiratory losses 22 or a switch in metabolism from autotrophy to mixotrophy 29 or a combination of all these factors while part of the exogenous carbon is utilised by microalgae for ammonia assimilation and amino acid production the rest is used for fatty acids and polysaccharide synthesis 30 suggesting that multiple metabolic pathways were stimulated in the cultures when carbon was added to alleviate ammonia toxicity while the addition of glucose resulted in increased growth rate and total biovolume at all ammonia concentrations except 25 mg n l 1 for c sorokiniana the c n ratio that produced the maximum yield total biovolume varied between species and ammonia concentrations this demonstrates the importance of determining the c n ratio for a given ammonia concentration for a given species to ensure toxicity is not only alleviated but productivity is maximised the redfield ratio of 106 c 16 n 1 p has long been regarded as the average stoichiometric values for microalgal biomass and optimising nutrients according to this ratio was thought to maximise growth 31 however tissue nutrient ratios in microalgae can be highly variable with c n reported to range from 4 8 16 2 29 31 studies on high plants have shown that supplementary organic carbon at a ratio of c n 5 helped to alleviate ammonia toxicity 21 while lu et al 22 demonstrated increasing nutrient removal capacity when the c n ratio increased from 0 4 1 6 for chlorella sp grown in high ammonia concentrations based on the results of the present study it is plausible to suggest that differences in the c n ratio between the ammonia concentrations and the microalgal species reflected in part the different energy demands for ammonia assimilation studies assessing the c n ratio for microalgae treating wastewater have shown that biomass production increases as c n increases from 0 to 24 up to a limiting ratio typically around c n 30 43 45 while this is in partial agreement with the present study care must be taken when comparing this study to other wastewater studies that are not conducted under high ammonia loads and toxicity was not likely an issue higher carbon requirements at higher ammonia concentrations may determine the c n ratio needed to alleviate toxicity as carbon and ammonia metabolism are linked through shared energy pathways including from respiration of fixed or assimilated carbon the tca cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain 23 it is plausible to assume that as energy demands from ammonia assimilation into amino acids increases so too does the assimilation rate of organic carbon 4 2 biomass and nutrient removal in defined media the flask scale assay in defined media was used to ground truth the results from the well plate assays increased biomass yield across all three microalgae in response to glucose addition at 1000 mg n l 1 of ammonia demonstrated that at least at flask scale toxicity could be overcome with exogenous organic carbon supply the higher biomass yields with glucose addition may have been a result of decreased cell lysis 15 increased energy supply for the metabolism of ammonia to amino acids 23 a switch to heterotrophic growth as photosynthesis becomes disrupted 23 or a combination of all three the lower proportion of chl a to the organic biomass in the treatments without glucose indicates a degree of inhibition of chl a production chl a production can become inhibited at high ammonia concentrations due to the competitive binding of ammonia to the manganese complex 51 while the proportion of chl a significantly increased with the addition of glucose it was still considerably lower than values reported in literature of wastewater microalgae e g 18 28 suggesting a degree of ammonia inhibition of chl a production still persisted while the addition of glucose substantially increased the percentage removal of both nh4 and drp the nre was unaffected for all three species one of the challenges with assessing nre in an ammonia based system is losses due to ammonia volatilisation ammonia volatilisation occurs when culture ph and or temperature increases resulting in higher proportions of nh3 as the buffered media was adjusted to ph 9 25 to give rise to approximately 56 nh3 it is likely that there was a degree of volatilisation occurring in all treatments volatilisation was thought to be responsible for nitrogen losses in municipal wastewater treatment hraps when daytime ph exceeded 9 9 52 4 3 food waste centrate treatment the flask scale experiment demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of high ammonia concentration in the food waste centrate on d communis were readily mitigated with the simple addition of glucose growth rates biomass yield and nutrient removal rates all responded positively to the addition of glucose regardless of the c n ratio used in this experiment the increased biomass is consistent with the findings of zhong et al 53 who in a study assessing the effects of exogenous carbon supply on microalgal biomass and nutrient removal found that the addition of glycerol resulted in increased biomass production however unlike the present study the authors found that nutrient removal did not increase with glycerol addition and concluded that the glycerol negatively impacted the microbiome of the microalgae which led to reduced nutrient removal capabilities 53 in the present study higher nre in the treatments without glucose addition were most probably a reflection of the losses via ammonia volatilisation rather than microalgal uptake volatilisation would have also occurred in the flasks with glucose addition and most likely at a higher rate due to the higher culture ph leading to skewed nre results a complete nutrient budget of each treatment would help discern volatilisation and microalgal removal rates negative impacts of ammonia on effective quantum yield and light absorption capacity of the microalgae in centrate treatments without glucose is consistent with other studies assessing the toxic effect of ammonia on the photosystem for example chuka ogwude et al 54 found that yield decreased instantaneously within increasing ammonia concentrations for microalgae grown in food waste centrate the authors noted that the more tolerant species were able to improve yield and reach homeostasis after the fourth day of culture and concluded that a combination of acclimation and relief from the toxicity as ammonia concentrations declined 54 in the present study a slight improvement in yield values was obtained in the cultures around day 5 but did not affect the overall trend the lower chl a specific light absorption capacity in d communis cells grown in the centrate without glucose may reflect inhibition of chl a production by the ammonia 51 the decreased organic biomass to chl a ratio at c n 1 suggests that the addition of glucose provided some relief to the inhibition of chl a production at the higher glucose concentration the lack of increased chl a production per unit biomass may reflect more differences in metabolism of the microalgae i e increased heterotrophy which may result in down regulation of chl a production 55 4 4 implications for microalgal wastewater treatment systems this experiment has demonstrated that at lab scale the simple addition of glucose can alleviate the toxic effects of ammonia on microalgae resulting in improved biomass production and nutrient removal in food waste centrate treatment yet it is unknown how effective such a measure would be at pilot scale or full scale compared to the alternatives such as dilution or chemical stripping the addition of glucose is likely to be more cost effective and pragmatic due to its relatively low cost availability and does not need any specialised equipment this is especially true in situations where water for dilution is scarce the cost of building a larger treatment plant for diluted wastewater too high and or substantial penalties exist for poorly treated effluent however pilot scale and full scale treatment systems are not axenic with bacterial communities present associated with the wastewater or the microbiome of the microalgae themselves bacteria have been shown to have higher specific glucose uptake rates than microalgae meaning that they can successfully outcompete the microalgae for the glucose 50 this may result in shifts in the community from an autotrophic microalgal to heterotrophic bacterial system which would have implications for the overall treatment process however while the addition of glucose to the system may not be straight forward there may be practical operation steps that help improve the competitive ability of microalgae for the glucose for example kamjunke et al 50 showed that discontinuous glucose supply under high light 130 Œºmol photons m 2 s 1 coupled with a carbon to phosphorus ratio of 3 2 1 at this ratio the bacteria were considered to be organic carbon limited favoured glucose uptake by the microalgae and resulted in a decline in bacterial abundance by up to 45 further research at pilot scale is needed to assess the ability of microalgae to effectively utilise glucose or other alternative simple carbon sources that are cheaper than glucose for alleviating ammonia toxicity without becoming overwhelmed by bacteria several microalgal strains have been shown to possess a large number of putative sugar transporters meaning that they are capable of metabolising a range of organic carbons suggesting that alternatives to glucose may be possible examples of potential alternative organic carbon sources that can be utilised by microalgae include acetic acid 56 ethanol vinasse 57 sugarcane wastewater 58 acetate 59 molasses and d xylose 60 61 further investigations into the effectiveness of these alternative carbon sources in blunting ammonia toxicity are warranted particularly those that are cheaper or are considered themselves a waste product overall while this experiment demonstrated reduced ammonia toxicity at lab scale it is important to note that care must be taken when interpreting the results as stated above differences between the operating conditions in this study and those more representative of a treatment system will govern the success or failure of blunting ammonia toxicity at scale based on this study no techno economic assessment can be made as there are many factors that need further research to determine the likelihood of success at scale 5 conclusion this study has demonstrated that improved tolerance to high ammonia concentrations can be achieved through the addition of a simple organic carbon glucose under toxic concentrations of ammonia all three microalgae responded positively with respect to growth rate cell count total biovolume biomass production and nutrient removal when glucose was added to defined media the carbon to nitrogen ratio influenced the degree to which glucose improved tolerance to ammonia and varied according to total ammoniacal nitrogen concentration and species when applied to food waste centrate at three different ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations the addition of glucose at c n 1 and c n 5 improved biomass production and nutrient removal by the wastewater microalga d communis relative to the control at lab scale this experiment demonstrated that improved tolerance to ammonia could be achieved with the simple addition of glucose providing a pathway for the treatment of high ammonia wastewaters without the need for dilution or chemical stripping however it is unknown how effective such a measure would be at pilot scale or full scale in the presence of competing bacteria the next step required is to understand the effectiveness of glucose addition in xenic cultures at a range of scales and wastewaters the following is the supplementary data related to this article supplementary table 1 gradient of ammoniacal nitrogen and carbon to nitrogen ratio used for determining growth rates in all

12989,due to ammonia toxicity in microalgal treatment systems wastewaters with excessive ammonia require pre treatment either dilution or chemical stripping but this can be costly alternatively the addition of organic carbon may help to alleviate toxicity this study investigated effects of glucose addition on toxicity in three microalgal species glucose reduced toxicity at ammonia concentrations from 50 to 1000 mg l 1 in all species growth rate cell count and biovolume significantly increased p 0 01 with glucose at all ammonia concentrations carbon to nitrogen ratio c n was important for maximising tolerance varying with species ammonia concentration and parameter measured for chlorella sorokiniana the highest total biovolume yield 2 3 104 1 3 103 Œºm 3 ml 1 was achieved at 25 mg l 1 and c n 5 for coelastrum sp 1 0 104 0 8 103 Œºm 3 ml 1 it was achieved at 750 mg l 1 and c n 9 and for desmodesmus communis 6 9 107 5 2 106 Œºm 3 ml 1 it was achieved at 1000 mg l 1 and c n 5 when grown on food waste centrate effective quantum yield light absorption growth rate biomass yield and nutrient removal were all inhibited at concentrations between 100 and 500 mg l 1 however the addition of glucose at c n 1 or 5 alleviated ammonia toxicity resulting in significantly higher p 0 01 biomass and nutrient removal the simple addition of glucose was effective at reducing ammonia toxicity and improving microalgal wastewater treatment in both defined medium and centrate at lab scale further research is needed to assess effectiveness at scale for improved wastewater treatment keywords wastewater treatment toxicity microalgal productivity nutrient removal microalgal treatment systems 1 introduction recent interest in the recovery of energy from organic wastes has seen an increase in the diversion of wastes such as green food and agricultural from landfill to waste to energy facilities 1 such diversion is recognised as being an environmentally and economically viable alternative to traditional disposal and gives rise to the circular bioeconomy through the reduction and reutilisation of waste 2 3 an example of this is the conversion of food waste via anaerobic digestion to biogas ch4 and some co2 which is captured and used to generate electricity and the nutrient rich sludge can be dried and used as a biofertiliser 2 however a by product of anaerobic digestion is nutrient enriched liquid centrate which can have a high total ammonia nh4 n nh3 concentration typically around 2000 g m 3 4 due to the potential toxic effect of high ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations on aquatic biota this centrate requires treatment before it can be discharged to the environment 5 microalgae have long been recognised for their ability to cost effectively treat a wide range of wastewaters including municipal agricultural and industrial through the assimilation of nutrients from the wastewater into their biomass 6 9 this biomass can then be utilised as a feedstock for the biorefinery of a range of novel products thus providing further opportunity to recover resources from waste in most wastewaters including those derived from anaerobic digestion of organic matter nitrogen is predominantly in the form of ammoniacal nitrogen which can be directly assimilated by the microalgae into amino acids for growth however high concentrations of ammonia can become toxic to the cells negatively affecting growth and function 10 ammonia toxicity can inhibit photosynthesis causing disruption to photosystem i and ii as well as the electron transport rate 12 inhibit chlorophyll production 13 disrupt intracellular ph balance destroy carbon to nitrogen balance deplete nutrients 14 and cause cell death 15 in aqueous solutions total ammonia is present as both the ammonium ion nh4 and unionised free ammonia nh3 11 nh3 is considered to be the most toxic form of ammoniacal nitrogen due to its lack of charge and its high lipid solubility meaning that it can readily diffuse through the cell membrane without the aid of transporters 15 the proportion of each chemical species is dependent on a number of physico chemical factors including temperature and ph as either temperature or ph increases ionisation decreases resulting in an increased proportion of nh3 and subsequently higher toxicity 11 at ph 9 25 total ammonia is theoretically comprised of 56 nh3 14 in microalgal wastewater treatment systems both temperature and ph fluctuate diurnally with the latter being a result of photosynthetic drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon by the dense microalgal culture and daytime ph regularly exceeds 9 in systems without ph control 16 this can be controlled by co2 addition which not only overcomes inorganic carbon limitation in microalgal treatment systems but also maintains ph 8 thus reducing the amount of nh3 in solution however at high total ammonia concentrations this may still not be sufficient to overcome ammonia toxicity 9 18 for example 1 7 mg of nh3 has been shown to be toxic to 200 marine microalgae 19 while 50 mg n l 1 has been shown to be toxic to chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus 12 20 at ph 8 and a total ammonia concentration of 100 and 1000 mg n l 1 theoretically it contains 5 mg and 50 mg of nh3 respectively one of the simplest approaches to overcoming ammonia toxicity is the dilution of highly concentrated ammonia wastewaters with either freshwater recycled effluent or in the case of marine based systems seawater however due to the demands on freshwater its use for dilution is not a viable option for wastewater treatment while dilution with recycled effluent or seawater can substantially increase the footprint and operating costs of the microalgal treatment system due to the increased volume of wastewater to treat similarly chemical ammonia stripping and nitrification by bacteria are considered unsustainable due to high cost and energy consumption 17 another approach to improving microalgal tolerance to high ammonia concentration is the addition of organic carbon organic carbon is considered essential for increased ammonia tolerance in higher plants and algae 21 and while the exact mechanism is unknown supplementary carbon is thought to alleviate ammonia toxicity by providing the necessary energy source and hydride donor critical to nh4 assimilation 22 the primary assimilation of nh4 into amino acids requires carbon skeletons in the form of keto acids as well as energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate 23 supplementary carbon may also provide the additional energy needed when photosynthesis becomes disrupted due to the effects of high ammonia concentrations while wastewaters particularly those derived from anaerobic digestion of organic matter contain large amounts of dissolved organic compounds most are not in a form that is readily available for microalgal use 24 microalgae can only use relatively simple molecules such as sugars organic and amino acids and several aromatic compounds 23 therefore supplementation with a simple organic carbon source may be needed to help facilitate increased ammonia tolerance and effective wastewater treatment in this study the effects of supplementing glucose on ammonia tolerance in three wastewater microalgae are investigated growth rates cell counts and biovolumes of the three microalgae were assessed along ammoniacal nitrogen and carbon nitrogen c n gradients in defined medium following this the ability of desmodesmus communis to bioremediation food water centrate at three ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations and three c n ratios was assessed with respect to growth rate nutrient removal and biomass production 2 methods 2 1 microalgae species and axenic cultures the three microalgal species used in this study had previously been isolated from the outdoor wastewater treatment system into mono algal cultures according to the methods of andersen kawachi 25 the microalgal species were identified to species level where possible based on the taxonomic descriptions of john et al 26 and associated literature the species were identified as chlorella sorokiniana shihira r w krauss coelastrum sp and desmodesmus communis e hegewald e hegewald all three species are classified as microalgae that are adapted to shallow eutrophic waterbodies 27 and are commonly associated with microalgal wastewater treatment systems 28 axenic lines of the microalgal species were established using antibiotic treatment according to andersen kawachi 25 the axenic cultures were maintained in 0

on biomass production and nutrient removal in high ammonia food waste centrate based on the results of the well plate and flask assays d communis was selected for the centrate assay 2 4 1 food waste centrate and culture setup the centrate used in this study was derived from the anaerobic digestion of commercial food waste sourced from a commercially operated food waste to energy facility in sydney earthpower technologies sydney the physico chemical characteristics of the raw food waste centrate are presented in table 1 the centrate was 0 2 Œºm filter sterilized merck millipore massachusetts usa and diluted with autoclaved milliq water to give the desired treatment concentrations of 100 250 and 500 mg n l 1 while the highest ammoniacal nitrogen concentration in the well plate and flask assays were 1000 mg n l 1 using the defined media the high brown hue of the centrate resulted in high light attenuation at concentrations of 1000 mg n l 1 and thus proved unsuitable for this experimental setup glucose treatments were based on the c n ratios of 0 1 and 5 the axenic culture of d communis was inoculated into 250 ml capped erlenmeyer flasks for each of the nine

fig 2b however at concentrations of 500 and 750 mg n l 1 while Œº max was significantly higher p 0 01 at c n 5 compared to c n 1 further increasing the glucose concentration did not result in significantly higher Œº max fig 2b at an ammoniacal nitrogen concentration of 1000 mg n l 1 adding glucose in excess of c n 1 did not result in any further increase in Œº max with no significant difference between c n 1 and all other ratios higher than 1 fig 2b for d communis the addition of glucose resulted in increased Œº max for all ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations fig 2c in general Œº max increased with increasing c n ratio at all ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations at ammoniacal nitrogen concentration of 750 mg n l 1 the addition of glucose at a ratio of c n 27 resulted in

higher p 0 05 at 100 mg n l 1 and p 0 01 for 250 and 500 mg n l 1 in the treatments without glucose than with glucose table 5 4 discussion this experiment has demonstrated that the addition of organic carbon in the form of glucose had a positive influence on the ability of three microalgal species to tolerate high ammonia concentrations the impacts of organic carbon addition on microalgal performance are discussed below along with the implications for the treatment of high ammonia wastewaters 4 1 growth rate cell count and biovolume all three microalgal species used in this study belong to the algal class chlorophyceae which is regarded as being generally more tolerant to high ammonium concentrations than other classes of microalgae 15 for all three species growth rate inhibition occurred at approximately the same ammoniacal nitrogen concentration and was within the range reported by dai et al 36 for chlorophytes from hypertrophic regions this was also reflected in the total cell count measured at the end of the growth curve with total counts rapidly decreasing with increasing ammonia concentration one of the direct effects of high ammonia concentration is cell lysis where the microalgal cells burst open either immediately or within a few hours of exposure 15 37 in the present study while daily cell counts were not conducted it is plausible to suggest that cell lysis occurred in treatments where ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations were 100 mg n l 1 without carbon supplementation as reflected in the decreased optical density compared to time zero which gave rise to the negative maximum growth rate positive responses in both the growth rate and total cell count to organic carbon supplementation at the toxic ammonia concentrations suggest that the microalgae were either capable of switching to heterotrophic metabolism or the exogenous carbon provided the necessary energy to allow rapid assimilation of nh4 into amino acids thus reducing toxic accumulation within the cell 23 based on the results of this study it is difficult to interpret which mechanism was the main driver for improved growth and total cell yield while the default interpretation would be heterotrophic growth in the presence of the organic carbon this may not have been the case in the present study the three microalgae strains used in this study had previously been used in an assessment of heterotrophy using a broad range of carbon compounds 38 d communis showed a high affinity to organic carbon metabolism and demonstrated strong positive heterotrophic growth with glucose supplementation whereas coelastrum sp and c sorokiniana showed poor affinity to organic carbon metabolism and constrained heterotrophic growth with glucose supplementation 38 despite these differences in heterotrophy in the present study all three species showed similar growth rate and total cell yield to carbon supplementation alternatively rather than accumulating in the cells ammonia may have been rapidly converted into the amino acids glutamine glutamate via glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities 39 and the presence of exogenous carbon may have helped facilitate this conversion by supplying the required energy green algae have higher glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities compared to other algae and this is thought to explain their higher ammonia tolerance 39 the toxic effect of ammonia depends on the internal carbon balance between photosynthesis and sucrose reserves that are needed to sustain ammonia assimilation its conversion to amino acids in eelgrasses 40 the authors noted that as ammonia concentration and assimilation increased the carbon pool became drained resulting in intracellular accumulation of ammonia and increased toxicity 40 a similar phenomenon is thought to occur in microalgae and optimising the carbon to nitrogen ratio has been regarded as an effective way to promote ammonia assimilation and conversion in microalgal cells 23 cell biovolume and growth rates in microalgae are intrinsically linked with cells undergoing faster growth and reproduction tending to be smaller than those cells that are slower to grow and reproduce it has long been recognised that growth conditions including nutrients play an important role in stimulating the relative rates of cell division and ultimately biovolume in microalgae 41 for example nitrogen depletion is often associated with increased cell size compared to nitrogen replete conditions suggesting decreased cell division 41 43 but little is known about the response of cell to excess nitrogen conditions in the present study increasing ammonia concentration had a variable effect on cell biovolume amongst the three species suggesting that the effect of ammonia concentration on cell biovolume as the proxy to cell division is not ubiquitous across green algae however these results need to be viewed with caution due to the effects of increasing toxicity had on cells as ammonia concentration increased as discussed above cell lysis occurs with high ammonia exposure and those cells remains may have undergone morphological and physiological changes in response to the exposure that may not necessarily translate into long term survivability in contrast the addition of glucose was more predictable with cell biovolume increasing for two of the species within a given ammonia concentration increased cell biovolume coincided with increased maximum growth rate for these two species this seems contradictory to smaller cell biovolume associated with faster growth rate but this may reflect physiological changes as a result of exogenous organic carbon supply physiological changes may have included increased amino acid production in the presence of high carbon and ammonia 39 increased storage products from improved metabolism 42 decreased respiratory losses 22 or a switch in metabolism from autotrophy to mixotrophy 29 or a combination of all these factors while part of the exogenous carbon is utilised by microalgae for ammonia assimilation and amino acid production the rest is used for fatty acids and polysaccharide synthesis 30 suggesting that multiple metabolic pathways were stimulated in the cultures when carbon was added to alleviate ammonia toxicity while the addition of glucose resulted in increased growth rate and total biovolume at all ammonia concentrations except 25 mg n l 1 for c sorokiniana the c n ratio that produced the maximum yield total biovolume varied between species and ammonia concentrations this demonstrates the importance of determining the c n ratio for a given ammonia concentration for a given species to ensure toxicity is not only alleviated but productivity is maximised the redfield ratio of 106 c 16 n 1 p has long been regarded as the average stoichiometric values for microalgal biomass and optimising nutrients according to this ratio was thought to maximise growth 31 however tissue nutrient ratios in microalgae can be highly variable with c n reported to range from 4 8 16 2 29 31 studies on high plants have shown that supplementary organic carbon at a ratio of c n 5 helped to alleviate ammonia toxicity 21 while lu et al 22 demonstrated increasing nutrient removal capacity when the c n ratio increased from 0 4 1 6 for chlorella sp grown in high ammonia concentrations based on the results of the present study it is plausible to suggest that differences in the c n ratio between the ammonia concentrations and the microalgal species reflected in part the different energy demands for ammonia assimilation studies assessing the c n ratio for microalgae treating wastewater have shown that biomass production increases as c n increases from 0 to 24 up to a limiting ratio typically around c n 30 43 45 while this is in partial agreement with the present study care must be taken when comparing this study to other wastewater studies that are not conducted under high ammonia loads and toxicity was not likely an issue higher carbon requirements at higher ammonia concentrations may determine the c n ratio needed to alleviate toxicity as carbon and ammonia metabolism are linked through shared energy pathways including from respiration of fixed or assimilated carbon the tca cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain 23 it is plausible to assume that as energy demands from ammonia assimilation into amino acids increases so too does the assimilation rate of organic carbon 4 2 biomass and nutrient removal in defined media the flask scale assay in defined media was used to ground truth the results from the well plate assays increased biomass yield across all three microalgae in response to glucose addition at 1000 mg n l 1 of ammonia demonstrated that at least at flask scale toxicity could be overcome with exogenous organic carbon supply the higher biomass yields with glucose addition may have been a result of decreased cell lysis 15 increased energy supply for the metabolism of ammonia to amino acids 23 a switch to heterotrophic growth as photosynthesis becomes disrupted 23 or a combination of all three the lower proportion of chl a to the organic biomass in the treatments without glucose indicates a degree of inhibition of chl a production chl a production can become inhibited at high ammonia concentrations due to the competitive binding of ammonia to the manganese complex 51 while the proportion of chl a significantly increased with the addition of glucose it was still considerably lower than values reported in literature of wastewater microalgae e g 18 28 suggesting a degree of ammonia inhibition of chl a production still persisted while the addition of glucose substantially increased the percentage removal of both nh4 and drp the nre was unaffected for all three species one of the challenges with assessing nre in an ammonia based system is losses due to ammonia volatilisation ammonia volatilisation occurs when culture ph and or temperature increases resulting in higher proportions of nh3 as the buffered media was adjusted to ph 9 25 to give rise to approximately 56 nh3 it is likely that there was a degree of volatilisation occurring in all treatments volatilisation was thought to be responsible for nitrogen losses in municipal wastewater treatment hraps when daytime ph exceeded 9 9 52 4 3 food waste centrate treatment the flask scale experiment demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of high ammonia concentration in the food waste centrate on d communis were readily mitigated with the simple addition of glucose growth rates biomass yield and nutrient removal rates all responded positively to the addition of glucose regardless of the c n ratio used in this experiment the increased biomass is consistent with the findings of zhong et al 53 who in a study assessing the effects of exogenous carbon supply on microalgal biomass and nutrient removal found that the addition of glycerol resulted in increased biomass production however unlike the present study the authors found that nutrient removal did not increase with glycerol addition and concluded that the glycerol negatively impacted the microbiome of the microalgae which led to reduced nutrient removal capabilities 53 in the present study higher nre in the treatments without glucose addition were most probably a reflection of the losses via ammonia volatilisation rather than microalgal uptake volatilisation would have also occurred in the flasks with glucose addition and most likely at a higher rate due to the higher culture ph leading to skewed nre results a complete nutrient budget of each treatment would help discern volatilisation and microalgal removal rates negative impacts of ammonia on effective quantum yield and light absorption capacity of the microalgae in centrate treatments without glucose is consistent with other studies assessing the toxic effect of ammonia on the photosystem for example chuka ogwude et al 54 found that yield decreased instantaneously within increasing ammonia concentrations for microalgae grown in food waste centrate the authors noted that the more tolerant species were able to improve yield and reach homeostasis after the fourth day of culture and concluded that a combination of acclimation and relief from the toxicity as ammonia concentrations declined 54 in the present study a slight improvement in yield values was obtained in the cultures around day 5 but did not affect the overall trend the lower chl a specific light absorption capacity in d communis cells grown in the centrate without glucose may reflect inhibition of chl a production by the ammonia 51 the decreased organic biomass to chl a ratio at c n 1 suggests that the addition of glucose provided some relief to the inhibition of chl a production at the higher glucose concentration the lack of increased chl a production per unit biomass may reflect more differences in metabolism of the microalgae i e increased heterotrophy which may result in down regulation of chl a production 55 4 4 implications for microalgal wastewater treatment systems this experiment has demonstrated that at lab scale the simple addition of glucose can alleviate the toxic effects of ammonia on microalgae resulting in improved biomass production and nutrient removal in food waste centrate treatment yet it is unknown how effective such a measure would be at pilot scale or full scale compared to the alternatives such as dilution or chemical stripping the addition of glucose is likely to be more cost effective and pragmatic due to its relatively low cost availability and does not need any specialised equipment this is especially true in situations where water for dilution is scarce the cost of building a larger treatment plant for diluted wastewater too high and or substantial penalties exist for poorly treated effluent however pilot scale and full scale treatment systems are not axenic with bacterial communities present associated with the wastewater or the microbiome of the microalgae themselves bacteria have been shown to have higher specific glucose uptake rates than microalgae meaning that they can successfully outcompete the microalgae for the glucose 50 this may result in shifts in the community from an autotrophic microalgal to heterotrophic bacterial system which would have implications for the overall treatment process however while the addition of glucose to the system may not be straight forward there may be practical operation steps that help improve the competitive ability of microalgae for the glucose for example kamjunke et al 50 showed that discontinuous glucose supply under high light 130 Œºmol photons m 2 s 1 coupled with a carbon to phosphorus ratio of 3 2 1 at this ratio the bacteria were considered to be organic carbon limited favoured glucose uptake by the microalgae and resulted in a decline in bacterial abundance by up to 45 further research at pilot scale is needed to assess the ability of microalgae to effectively utilise glucose or other alternative simple carbon sources that are cheaper than glucose for alleviating ammonia toxicity without becoming overwhelmed by bacteria several microalgal strains have been shown to possess a large number of putative sugar transporters meaning that they are capable of metabolising a range of organic carbons suggesting that alternatives to glucose may be possible examples of potential alternative organic carbon sources that can be utilised by microalgae include acetic acid 56 ethanol vinasse 57 sugarcane wastewater 58 acetate 59 molasses and d xylose 60 61 further investigations into the effectiveness of these alternative carbon sources in blunting ammonia toxicity are warranted particularly those that are cheaper or are considered themselves a waste product overall while this experiment demonstrated reduced ammonia toxicity at lab scale it is important to note that care must be taken when interpreting the results as stated above differences between the operating conditions in this study and those more representative of a treatment system will govern the success or failure of blunting ammonia toxicity at scale based on this study no techno economic assessment can be made as there are many factors that need further research to determine the likelihood of success at scale 5 conclusion this study has demonstrated that improved tolerance to high ammonia concentrations can be achieved through the addition of a simple organic carbon glucose under toxic concentrations of ammonia all three microalgae responded positively with respect to growth rate cell count total biovolume biomass production and nutrient removal when glucose was added to defined media the carbon to nitrogen ratio influenced the degree to which glucose improved tolerance to ammonia and varied according to total ammoniacal nitrogen concentration and species when applied to food waste centrate at three different ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations the addition of glucose at c n 1 and c n 5 improved biomass production and nutrient removal by the wastewater microalga d communis relative to the control at lab scale this experiment demonstrated that improved tolerance to ammonia could be achieved with the simple addition of glucose providing a pathway for the treatment of high ammonia wastewaters without the need for dilution or chemical stripping however it is unknown how effective such a measure would be at pilot scale or full scale in the presence of competing bacteria the next step required is to understand the effectiveness of glucose addition in xenic cultures at a range of scales and wastewaters the following is the supplementary data related to this article supplementary table 1 gradient of ammoniacal nitrogen and carbon to nitrogen ratio used for determining growth rates in all
