25195,in this paper we aim to model the impact of human activities on the wildlife habitat in a general equilibrium framework by embedding the levins model 1969 of metapopulation dynamics into a ramsey model 1928 with a pollution externality in the long run as in levins 1969 two steady states coexist a zero one with mass extinction and another one with positive wildlife when the migration rate of the metapopulation exceeds the rate of extinction a green tax always increases the wildlife and lowers the consumption demand it is welfare improving if and only if agents overweight the wildlife in the short run we show that a sufficiently negative effect of wildlife habitat on consumption demand can lead to the emergence of a limit cycle near the positive steady state through a hopf bifurcation we show also that the negative pollution effect on wildlife habitat works as a destabilizing force in the economy by promoting limit cycles jel classification c61 e32 o44 keywords metapopulation dynamics pollution ramsey model hopf bifurcation 1 introduction in ecology a metapopulation represents a spatially fragmented population of the same species the concept of metapopulation was introduced in the cological literature in 1969 by levins and reconsidered by hanski and gilpin in 1991 in his seminal contribution levins represents the natural space as a partition of patches of the same size homogeneous inside that can be occupied or not by a metapopulation the share of occupied patches changes over time dynamics are driven by two exogenous forces the migration rate and the extinction rate according to levins 1969 formulation there are two steady states a zero share means a massive extinction while a positive share a preserved wildlife dynamics are quite simple the zero steady state is unstable while the positive one is stable and positive if and only if the migration rate exceeds the extinction rate since the emergence of life planet earth has experienced five mass extinctions a mass extinction is conventionally defined as a change where more than three quarters of species disappear in a geologically short interval of time barnosky et al 2011 following ceballos et al 2015 a sixth mass extinction is under way due to human activities because of deforestation and pollution that imply climate change evidence suggests that both the migration and the extinction rate in the levins model 1969 depend on the pollution coming from human activities 1 1 the reader interested in the impact of global warming on species migration and extinction is referred to chen et al 2011 loehle 2018 and rinnan 2018 today a plausible representation of metapopulation dynamics has to take in account the interplay between economic activities and pollution and the effects of pollution on both the extinction rate and the migration rate to the best of our knowledge such an integrated framework does not yet exist in the literature in this respect we aim to fill the gap between economics and ecology more simply and precisely we embed the levins model 1969 into the ramsey model 1928 augmented with a pollution externality resulting from production and affecting both the migration and the extinction rates evidence suggests also that the consumption behavior is influenced by environmental quality for instance the literature has pointed out that consumers have a higher willingness to pay for green products roe et al 2001 kim and han 2010 biswas 2016 even if to the best of our knowledge there is no empirical evidence on the effects of wildlife habitat on consumption demand the common sense suggests that a link exists if the household likes to consume in a pleasant environment a drop in wildlife entails a lower consumption conversely a decrease in wildlife implies a drop in utility to be compensated by the household with a higher consumption demand the ambiguous environmental effects on consumption demand have been already studied in the literature theorists have considered pollution or natural capital instead of wildlife in the utility function for instance bosi and desmarchelier 2018 have focused on the occurrence of limit cycles in a ramsey economy where an environmental kuznets curve ekc 2 2 the ekc is an inverted u shaped relation between income and pollution appears at the steady state 3 3 more precisely they have shown that a positive effect of pollution on consumption demand promotes the occurrence of a limit cycle through a hopf bifurcation when the steady state lies on the upward sloping branch of the ekc while along the downward sloping branch limit cycles arise if and only if pollution lowers consumption the present paper is not about the ekc but one can expect that the effect of wildlife habitat on consumption demand affects the transitional dynamics of the levins model 1969 in this paper we study a continuous time ramsey model where a pollution externality coming from production impacts the evolution of a metapopulation to simplify we assimilate wildlife to a single metapopulation and we assume that the fraction of occupied patches a measure of environmental health affects the marginal utility of consumption in addition a green tax is introduced and levied on production at the firm level in order to finance depollution according to a balanced budget rule as in levins 1969 two steady states coexist in the long run with and without wildlife wildlife is positive when the rate of migration exceeds the extinction rate from an economic point of view even if the green tax lowers both the capital intensity and the consumption demand at the steady state the green tax always increases the wildlife with an ambiguous effect on welfare the tax is welfare improving if households overweight wildlife with respect to consumption in the short run because of the pollution effects the interplay between the wildlife habitat and consumption demand leads to richer dynamics around the positive steady state than those observed by levins 1969 indeed a sufficiently large impact of wildlife on consumption demand can promote the emergence of a limit cycle near the steady state through a hopf bifurcation moreover the larger the negative impact of pollution on wildlife habitat the lower the effect of wildlife on consumption demand at the origin of the limit cycle in other terms the negative pollution effect on wildlife undoubtedly plays a destabilizing role in the spirit of the socio ecological model proposed by lafuite and loreau 2017 we consider the coupled evolution between economy and biodiversity in their paper lafuite and loreau 2017 observe the coevolution of human population dynamics and biodiversity they point out that convergence toward the steady state can be non monotonic because of biodiversity feedbacks on agricultural production in our model because of the possibility of limit cycles we arguably reach a similar conclusion however the consumers behavior are based on different assumptions in lafuite and loreau 2017 the consumer chooses the amounts of two consumption goods to maximizes a static utility function but biodiversity does not enter this utility function and so plays no direct role differently our consumer decides a consumption path to maximize her intertemporal utility function which depends also on biodiversity in other words biodiversity directly affects the marginal utility of consumption changing the consumption profile at the end while in lafuite and loreau 2017 the occurrence of cycles rests on the biodiversity feedbacks on production cycles arise in our framework because of the biodiversity effects on consumption demand in this respect non monotonic convergence to the steady state of a socio ecological system seems to be a pervasive feature once biodiversity feedbacks on the economy are considered the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the model sections 3 and 4 focus on the equilibrium system and its steady state section 5 studies the local dynamics an example with isoelastic preferences is considered in section 6 while a numerical illustration is provided in section 7 section 8 concludes all the proofs are gathered in appendix a 2 model we consider an economy with households firms and a government households work consume and enjoy the nature firms produce and pollutes the government taxes the firms to maintain the environment let us introduce the three ingredients of the model a metapopulation dynamics à la levins 1969 the economic fundamentals à la ramsey 1928 and a simple pollution process 2 1 metapopulation in ecology a metapopulation represents a spatially fragmented population of the same species to simplify the model we assimilate wildlife to a single metapopulation following levins 1969 we consider that space is represented by a partition of patches occupied or unoccupied by the metapopulation let q denotes the fraction of patches occupied at a given time as in levins 1969 the evolution of this share is simply given by 4 4 the reader interested in an economic model considering a non renewable resource is referred to dasgupta and heal 1974 or benchekroun and withagen 2011 among the others 1 q φ q 1 q β q at each time any occupied patch can become unoccupied at the extinction rate β the contribution to the change in the share of occupied patches is given by βq conversely any unoccupied patch can become occupied at the migration rate φ the migration pressure on the share 1 q of unoccupied patches is given by φq a simple analysis of 1 allow us to point out that there exist two distinct steady states q 0 0 and q 1 β φ it follows that q 0 leads to wildlife mass extinction while q represents an equilibrium where wildlife is positive interestingly q 0 if and only if the migration rate φ exceeds the extinction rate β human activities pollute and stress the wildlife habitat mainly through the climate change to put it in other way pollution accelerates the extinction rate we also consider that a degraded environment renders more difficult the wildlife migration in the sequel p will denote the aggregate stock of pollution assumption 1 pollution has a positive impact on the extinction rate and a negative impact on the migration rate 2 β β p and φ φ p such that β p 0 and φ p 0 assumption 1 captures the pressure put by humans on wildlife the role of pollution is summed up by the following elasticities and their difference definition 1 the colonization rate is the difference between the migration and the extinction rate s s p φ p β p we introduce also the pollution elasticities of migration and extinction ε φ p p φ p φ p and ε β p p β p β p and the pollution impact on colonization d p ε φ p ε β p 0 notice that the pollution impact on colonization is negative because according to assumption 1 ε φ p ε β p 2 2 firms firms behave competitively the firm j chooses the amount of capital k j and labor l j to maximize the profit in addition the government levies a proportional tax τ 0 1 on polluting production f k j l j of firm j to finance the maintenance of natural resource assumption 2 the production function f ℝ 2 ℝ is c 2strictly increasing and concave with constant returns to scale inada conditions hold 5 5 these properties quite standard in economics ensure the existence of a solution from an individual point of view and jointly with the assumptions on preferences the existence of an equilibrium from an aggregate point of view the assumption of constant returns to scale captures the divisibility of the productive system considering many firms or an aggregate one becomes equivalent and allows us to write in intensive terms the relevant variables and to represent the state of the economy in terms of capital intensity in addition the sum of smooth and non smooth technologies can be conveniently approximated at the aggregate level by a smooth production function let k j 1 j k j be the aggregate capital stock and l j 1 j l j be the aggregate labor demand k k l is the capital intensity in the economy the price of product is normalized to one r and w denote the real interest rate and the real wage these prices are taken as given by the firms proposition 2 firm the aggregate production is given by y f k l profit maximization yields 3 r 1 τ ρ k and w 1 τ ω k with ρ k f k and ω k f k kf k we introduce the capital share in total disposable income and the elasticity of capital labor substitution α k rk 1 τ f k kf k f k and σ k α k ω k k ω k in addition we determine the elasticities of factor prices k ρ k ρ k 1 α k σ k and k ω k ω k α k σ k 2 3 households the representative household earns a capital income rh where h denotes the individual wealth at time t and a labor income wl where l 1 inelastic labor supply thus the household consumes and saves her income according to the budget constraint 4 c h r δ h w where h denotes the time derivative of wealth the gross investment includes the capital depreciation at the rate δ we assume that wildlife habitat enters the household s utility function u c q with u q 0 we suppose that it affects the marginal utility of consumption u cq 0 indeed intuition suggests that wildlife plays a role in consumption demand if wildlife raises the consumption demand then wildlife and consumption are complement u cq 0 this happens when households like to consume in a pleasant environment in presence for instance of a large biodiversity conversely if wildlife lowers consumption demand then wildlife and consumption are substitutable u cq 0 in this case the household compensates the utility loss due to a lower wildlife by pushing her consumption demand assumption 3 preferences are rationalized by a non separable felicity function u c q first and second order restrictions hold on the sign of derivatives u c 0 u q 0 and u cc 0 jointly with the limit conditions lim c 0 u c and lim c u c 0 let us introduce the first and second order elasticities of felicity 5 ε c ε q cu c u qu q u and 6 ε cc ε cq ε qc ε qq cu cc u c qu cq u c cu qc u q qu qq uq 1 ε cc represents the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption while ε cq captures the effect of wildlife on the marginal utility of consumption typically if ε cq 0 0 then wildlife and consumption are complement substitute for households we observe that according to assumption 1 the utility function is indirectly affected by the pollution level through the wildlife level in a ramsey model the representative household maximizes an intertemporal utility functional 7 0 e θ t u c q dt under the budget constraint 4 where θ 0 denotes the rate of time preference let μ denote the multiplier associated to the budget constraint proposition 3 household the first order conditions of the consumer s program are given by the shadow price of consumption 8 μ u c c q the intertemporal consumption smoothing euler equation 9 μ μ θ δ r and the budget constraint 4 now binding 10 h r δ h w c jointly with the transversality condition lim t e θ t μ t h t 0 applying the implicit function theorem to the static relation μ u c c q we obtain the consumption demand c c μ q with elasticities 11 μ c dc d μ 1 ε cc 0 and q c dc dq ε cq ε cc 2 4 government the government uses all the tax revenues to finance the depollution expenditures m according to a balanced budget rule 12 m τ f k l 2 5 pollution the aggregate stock of pollution p is a pure externality coming from production y the government takes care of depollution through the abatement expenditures m the pollution accumulation follows a linear process 13 p ap by γ m a 0 b 0 and γ 0 capture respectively the natural rate of pollution absorption the environmental impact of production

good capital and labor clear the aggregate wealth is equal to the aggregate capital hl k hence h k without of loss of generality we normalize the population of workers l 1 proposition 4 equilibrium equilibrium dynamics are driven by four equations intertemporal consumption smoothing resource constraint pollution accumulation metapopulation dynamics 14 μ f 1 μ k p q μ θ δ 1 τ ρ k 15 k f 2 μ k p q

steady state q 0 0 in the absence of wildlife mankind disappears and our economic analysis loses its interest proposition 5 steady state the steady state with a positive wildlife is given by 18 ρ k θ δ 1 τ 19 c θ δ α k δ k 20 p θ δ a α k b γ τ 1 τ k 21 q 1 β p φ p 0 in order to avoid a negative pollution level in a neighborhood of the steady state we introduce the following restriction assumption 4 b γτ we observe that according to expression 20 assumption 4 ensures a positive pollution level around the steady state p proposition 6 uniqueness under assumption 4 there exists a unique steady state with positive wildlife β φ let us show how τ affects this positive steady state proposition 7 comparative statics the long run effects of taxation on the positive steady state are captured by the fiscal elasticities 22 τ k k τ τ 1 τ σ k 1 α k 0 τ c c τ τ 1 τ k c θ δ α k θ σ k 1 α k 0 23 τ p p τ γ τ b γ τ σ k τ 1 τ α k 1 α k 0 τ q q τ d p 1 q q τ p p τ 0 let us provide some intuition since the green tax is levied on the production level a higher green tax rate reduces the production level and the capital intensity in turn a drop in the production level entails also in the long run 1 a lower disposable income and thus a lower consumption and 2 a weaker pollution level according to the process 13 under assumption 1 the drop in pollution lowers the extinction rate and jointly increases the migration rate leading to a richer wildlife in the long run focus now on the impact of the green tax on welfare because of the assumption of representative agent all the households share the same fundamentals the welfare functional sums up to her utility functional w c q 0 e θ t u c q dt let us introduce a critical value for the social propensity to wildlife 24 e τ c c τ τ q q τ 0 proposition 8 welfare the green tax rate is welfare improving in the long run if and only if the relative preference for wildlife is sufficiently large that is ε q ε c e where the elasticities ε c and ε q are given by 5 let us provide some economic intuition about this result ε q ε c depends on the slope of the indifference curve in the c q plane and describes how the household weights wildlife with respect to consumption inequality ε q ε c e holds when households display ecological preference that is a higher ratio ε q ε c unsurprisingly a higher green tax rate has two opposite effects on utility 1 a lower consumption level inequality 22 which reduces the household s utility and 2 a richer wildlife habitat inequality 23 which increases her utility thus if the representative household overweights nature with respect to consumption the positive effect 2 dominates the negative effect 1 and the green tax turns out to be welfare improving according to chan et al 2007 human welfare and biological conservation are no longer mutually exclusive once ecosystem services to human population are taking into account compatibility between economic and ecological targets is reinterpreted through condition 24 indeed in the case of ecosystems including wildlife preservation the household can overweight the biodiversity with respect to consumption condition 24 in this case a higher green tax rate results in both an increase in the wildlife habitat a higher q in proposition 7 and a higher human welfare in proposition 8 as pointed out by chan et al 2007 biological conservation and human welfare becomes compatible corollary 9 welfare the critical value is explicitly given by 25 e s p β p d p θ 1 α k 1 σ k δ 1 α k θ δ 1 α k α k σ k 1 α k 1 τ τ γ τ b γ τ and in the case of a cobb douglas technology by 26 e s p β p d p α 1 α 1 τ τ γ τ b γ τ 1 5 local dynamics to study the multiplicity of equilibria local indeterminacy and the occurrence of local bifurcations around the unique positive steady state we focus on the dynamical system proposition 10 the jacobian matrix of system 14 17 is given by 27 j 0 μ k 1 α θ δ σ 0 0 k μ 1 ε cc θ 1 α δ α θ 0 k q ε cq ε cc θ 1 α δ α 0 b γ τ θ δ 1 τ a 0 0 0 β φ ds p s where α α k σ σ k ε cc ε cc c q ε cq ε cq c q β β p φ φ p d d p and μ k p and q are evaluated at the steady state for simplicity we focus on the cobb douglas technology in order to study the local dynamics local indeterminacy and local bifurcations we apply a methodology developed by bosi and desmarchelier 2017 and based on the sums of principal minors of the jacobian matrix lemma 11 in the case of a cobb douglas technology the trace the sum of principal minors of order two the sum of principal minors of order three and the determinant of the jacobian matrix 27 are given by 28 t θ a s 29 s 2 as θ a s d as 30 s 3 as θ d t θ as a β d θ δ 1 α ε cq ε cc 31 d a 1 α θ δ θ 1 α δ s α ε cc the following proposition shows that a unique equilibrium trajectory exists in a neighborhood of the positive steady state proposition 12 local determinacy the equilibrium is locally unique near the positive steady state focus now on local bifurcations from a mathematical point of view a transcritical bifurcation occurs when β φ we do not care about this case because from an economic point of view the trivial steady state q 0 0 and the case where β φ that is q 0 are meaningless in order to study the occurrence of limit cycles through a hopf bifurcation we consider the main economic variable that is the cross elasticity ε cq capturing the wildlife impact on preferences and consumption demand in this respect let 32 ε h ε cc t 2 s 2 s 2 2 4 d d t θ as as θ a β d θ 1 α δ as we will see in the case of isoelastic preferences the rhs of 32 does not depend on ε cq and it is well defined endogenous limit cycles arise when the discount rate exceeds the rate of natural absorption assumption 5 a θ assumption 5 simply means a strong inertia in the pollution process pollution persistence is empirically relevant indeed according to mélières and maréchal 2015 p 333 the atmosphere contains 800 gigatons of carbon gtc while nature lands and oceans absorbs between 2 and 3 gtc per year thereby according to quarterly data a 0 000625 0 0009375 while the usual quarterly value for θ is 0 01 proposition 13 hopf under assumption 5 a hopf bifurcation around the positive steady state generically occurs at ε cq ε h d 0 captures the negative impact of pollution on the wildlife habitat focus on the critical value 32 the larger the negative impact of pollution on wildlife diffusion the lower the bifurcation value ε h in other terms when d becomes higher endogenous limit cycles can take place since the number of stable eigenvalues is odd indeed d 0 if β φ and a θ then the dimension of the stable manifold goes from 3 to 1 or from 1 to 3 when the system undergoes a hopf bifurcation in the first case the bifurcation is supercritical and the limit cycle is stable while in the second case the bifurcation is subcritical and this cycle is unstable proposition 13 not only highlights the possibility of a non monotonic convergence to the steady state but even that of persistent cycles around these dynamics are closely related to those in lafuite and loreau 2017 however in their model cycles come from the environmental feedbacks on agricultural production while in our model they stem from environmental feedbacks on household s utility because of the different fundamentals involved in these fluctuations non monotonic convergence towards an attractor a steady state or a limit cycle appears to be a pervasive feature of socio ecological systems the following proposition rules out the class of saddle node bifurcations as well as any bifurcation of codimension two proposition 14 under assumption 5 around the positive steady state saddle node bogdanov takens gavrilov guckheimer or double hopf bifurcations are excluded 6 isoelastic preferences metapopulation is driven by the following explicit migration and extinction rates β p a β p ε β and φ p a φ p ε φ with constant elasticities ε φ 0 and ε β 0 in this case the colonization rate and the pollution impact on colonization are given by s a φ p ε φ a β p ε β and d ε φ ε β we consider also a cobb douglas technology f k ak α and isoelastic preferences u c q cq η 1 ε 1 ε η measures the propensity to wildlife while 1 ε the elasticity of intertemporal substitution of the composite good cq η straightforward computations give ε c 1 ε ε q η 1 ε ε cc ε and ε cq η 1 ε corollary 15 steady state the steady state is computed in terms of the fundamental parameters 33 k α a 1 τ θ δ 1 1 α c θ 1 α δ α k p θ δ a α b γ τ 1 τ k b γ τ a a α a 1 τ θ δ α 1 α q 1 a β a φ p d with μ c ε q η 1 ε η is the main parameter because it captures the peculiarity of the model that is the preference for wildlife corollary 16 welfare in the case of isoelastic preferences the green tax rate is welfare improving in the long run if and only if η e where now 34 e 1 ε φ ε β 1 a φ a β p ε φ ε β α 1 α 1 τ τ γ τ b γ τ and p is given by 33 we observe that neither p nor e depend on η thus e is an explicit and well defined critical value for η unsurprisingly if agents overweight wildlife with respect to consumption η e a higher green tax rate raises the social welfare in the isoelastic case even the right hand side of 32 does not depend on η corollary 17 hopf a limit cycle generically arises around the critical propensity to wildlife 35 η h ε 1 ε a θ s p d a t θ s p t 2 s 2 s 2 2 4 d a β ε φ ε β θ 1 α δ where 36 t θ a s p 37 s 2 a θ s p a θ d as p 38 d θ δ θ 1 α δ a ε 1 α α s p thus fixing the fundamental parameters according to expression 35 we are able to compute the numerical value of the preference for wildlife η h giving rise to endogenous cycles in the next section we calibrate and simulate the model and we find this value 7 simulations in order to illustrate the above theoretical results we calibrate the model and provide simulations of dynamics using the original nonlinear system 14 17 6 6 we use the matcont package for matlab we set the fundamental parameters as follows the parameters a a β a φ ε β and ε φ are normalized α is the usual value of capital share in total income θ and δ take their standard quarterly values τ represents the public air protection expenditures 12 implies τ m y according to the oecd environmental performance reviews for france 2016 p 149 the public air protection expenditures amount to less than 5 billion euros that is less than 0 25 of france gdp to be in accordance with these data we simply set τ 0 002 finally a b and γ are chosen to satisfy a θ assumption 5 and the positivity of the steady state k 28 385671 c 2 3010 p 0 90499041 and q 0 18099236 we observe that these steady state values do not depend on η moreover if s 0 positive steady state the bifurcation value η h 0 if and only if ε 1 that is iff ε cq 0 in other terms the existence of a limit cycle around the positive steady state is ensured when consumption and wildlife are substitutable goods to grasp this point let the economy be at the steady state today and assume an exogenous increase in the pollution level p under assumption 1 this implies a lower migration rate a higher extinction rate and a weaker wildlife habitat q in turn under assumption 3 the drop in q lowers the household s utility to compensate this loss because of her substitutable preferences the household increases the consumption while reducing her saving which lowers the capital stock tomorrow and the pollution level at the end thus when consumption and wildlife are sufficiently substitutable a higher pollution today entails a lower pollution tomorrow giving rise to endogenous cycles thus we fix the elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1 ε 1 2 1 to have limit cycles according to expression 35 and calibration in table 1 we find the bifurcation value of ecological preference η h 3 322 at η η h we obtain μ 55 238 and replacing in the jacobian matrix 27 we get the eigenvalues λ 1 0 205636 λ 2 0 0126424 and λ 3 0 0148104i λ 4 coherently we find two nonreal and conjugated eigenvalues with zero real part λ 3 and λ 4 that is the signature of the occurrence of a hopf bifurcation matcont computes also the first lyapunov coefficient at the hopf critical value l 1 1 278750 10 5 0 a positive lyapunov coefficient means that the hopf bifurcation is subcritical and the limit cycle is unstable matcont generates fig 1 directly from the original nonlinear system 14 17 using the current calibration and projecting a 4d cycle on the 3d subspace of quantities k p q a limit cycles arises around the positive steady state in order to study the green tax effect on the bifurcation value η h we reconsider the previous calibration without fixing τ see fig 2 and plotting η h as a function of τ fig 2 shows that η h rapidly increases with τ reaching less plausible values broadly speaking the endogenous cycles induced by a hopf bifurcation are less likely to occur under a higher green tax rate as seen above the green tax seems to reconcile biological conservation and human welfare in addition fig 2 shows that a higher green tax rate can stabilize the fluctuations in biodiversity q and economic variables k summing up we conclude in terms of comparative statics that when households overvalue wildlife with respect to consumption condition 24 a higher green tax rate turns out to have a triple benefit 1 reducing the pollution level while promoting biological conservation proposition 7 2 raising the human welfare proposition 8 and 3 making the endogenous cycles less likely fig 2 8 conclusion in this paper we have embedded the levins model 1969 of metapopulation dynamics into the ramsey model 1928 in order to capture the effects of economic activities on the wildlife habitat this interdisciplinary approach gives interesting results both concerning the long and the short run in the long run as in levins 1969 two steady states coexist a zero one with mass extinction and another one with positive wildlife when the migration rate of the metapopulation exceeds its extinction rate a simple exercise of comparative statics shows that even if the green tax lowers both the capital intensity and the consumption level at the steady state it improves the welfare if the representative household overweights wildlife with respect to consumption in the short run because of the role of pollution the interaction between wildlife and consumption leads to richer dynamics than those described by levins 1969 in particular we observe that a negative impact of wildlife on consumption demand can give rise to the emergence of a limit cycle through a hopf bifurcation near the positive steady state finally we have shown that the negative pollution effect on wildlife works as a destabilizing force in the economy the larger the negative impact of pollution on wildlife habitat the lower the effect of wildlife on consumption demand at the origin of limit cycles the government s rule in our paper is intendedly simple in order to obtain tractable dynamics further researches should study how the equilibrium is affected when the government finances depollution through the public debt or an endogenous tax rate reconsidering a more general pollution process where the parameters involved become functions of biological variables is also a promising research line appendix a proof of proposition 2 the profit maximization max k j n j f k j l

variables k p and q of system 14 17 are predetermined while one μ is a jump variable in this case local indeterminacy requires four stable eigenvalues thus d 0 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for local indeterminacy the existence of a positive steady state q 0 requires φ β which entails in turn d 0 this rules out the local indeterminacy proof of proposition 13 according to bosi

25195,in this paper we aim to model the impact of human activities on the wildlife habitat in a general equilibrium framework by embedding the levins model 1969 of metapopulation dynamics into a ramsey model 1928 with a pollution externality in the long run as in levins 1969 two steady states coexist a zero one with mass extinction and another one with positive wildlife when the migration rate of the metapopulation exceeds the rate of extinction a green tax always increases the wildlife and lowers the consumption demand it is welfare improving if and only if agents overweight the wildlife in the short run we show that a sufficiently negative effect of wildlife habitat on consumption demand can lead to the emergence of a limit cycle near the positive steady state through a hopf bifurcation we show also that the negative pollution effect on wildlife habitat works as a destabilizing force in the economy by promoting limit cycles jel classification c61 e32 o44 keywords metapopulation dynamics pollution ramsey model hopf bifurcation 1 introduction in ecology a metapopulation represents a spatially fragmented population of the same species the concept of metapopulation was introduced in the cological literature in 1969 by levins and reconsidered by hanski and gilpin in 1991 in his seminal contribution levins represents the natural space as a partition of patches of the same size homogeneous inside that can be occupied or not by a metapopulation the share of occupied patches changes over time dynamics are driven by two exogenous forces the migration rate and the extinction rate according to levins 1969 formulation there are two steady states a zero share means a massive extinction while a positive share a preserved wildlife dynamics are quite simple the zero steady state is unstable while the positive one is stable and positive if and only if the migration rate exceeds the extinction rate since the emergence of life planet earth has experienced five mass extinctions a mass extinction is conventionally defined as a change where more than three quarters of species disappear in a geologically short interval of time barnosky et al 2011 following ceballos et al 2015 a sixth mass extinction is under way due to human activities because of deforestation and pollution that imply climate change evidence suggests that both the migration and the extinction rate in the levins model 1969 depend on the pollution coming from human activities 1 1 the reader interested in the impact of global warming on species migration and extinction is referred to chen et al 2011 loehle 2018 and rinnan 2018 today a plausible representation of metapopulation dynamics has to take in account the interplay between economic activities and pollution and the effects of pollution on both the extinction rate and the migration rate to the best of our knowledge such an integrated framework does not yet exist in the literature in this respect we aim to fill the gap between economics and ecology more simply and precisely we embed the levins model 1969 into the ramsey model 1928 augmented with a pollution externality resulting from production and affecting both the migration and the extinction rates evidence suggests also that the consumption behavior is influenced by environmental quality for instance the literature has pointed out that consumers have a higher willingness to pay for green products roe et al 2001 kim and han 2010 biswas 2016 even if to the best of our knowledge there is no empirical evidence on the effects of wildlife habitat on consumption demand the common sense suggests that a link exists if the household likes to consume in a pleasant environment a drop in wildlife entails a lower consumption conversely a decrease in wildlife implies a drop in utility to be compensated by the household with a higher consumption demand the ambiguous environmental effects on consumption demand have been already studied in the literature theorists have considered pollution or natural capital instead of wildlife in the utility function for instance bosi and desmarchelier 2018 have focused on the occurrence of limit cycles in a ramsey economy where an environmental kuznets curve ekc 2 2 the ekc is an inverted u shaped relation between income and pollution appears at the steady state 3 3 more precisely they have shown that a positive effect of pollution on consumption demand promotes the occurrence of a limit cycle through a hopf bifurcation when the steady state lies on the upward sloping branch of the ekc while along the downward sloping branch limit cycles arise if and only if pollution lowers consumption the present paper is not about the ekc but one can expect that the effect of wildlife habitat on consumption demand affects the transitional dynamics of the levins model 1969 in this paper we study a continuous time ramsey model where a pollution externality coming from production impacts the evolution of a metapopulation to simplify we assimilate wildlife to a single metapopulation and we assume that the fraction of occupied patches a measure of environmental health affects the marginal utility of consumption in addition a green tax is introduced and levied on production at the firm level in order to finance depollution according to a balanced budget rule as in levins 1969 two steady states coexist in the long run with and without wildlife wildlife is positive when the rate of migration exceeds the extinction rate from an economic point of view even if the green tax lowers both the capital intensity and the consumption demand at the steady state the green tax always increases the wildlife with an ambiguous effect on welfare the tax is welfare improving if households overweight wildlife with respect to consumption in the short run because of the pollution effects the interplay between the wildlife habitat and consumption demand leads to richer dynamics around the positive steady state than those observed by levins 1969 indeed a sufficiently large impact of wildlife on consumption demand can promote the emergence of a limit cycle near the steady state through a hopf bifurcation moreover the larger the negative impact of pollution on wildlife habitat the lower the effect of wildlife on consumption demand at the origin of the limit cycle in other terms the negative pollution effect on wildlife undoubtedly plays a destabilizing role in the spirit of the socio ecological model proposed by lafuite and loreau 2017 we consider the coupled evolution between economy and biodiversity in their paper lafuite and loreau 2017 observe the coevolution of human population dynamics and biodiversity they point out that convergence toward the steady state can be non monotonic because of biodiversity feedbacks on agricultural production in our model because of the possibility of limit cycles we arguably reach a similar conclusion however the consumers behavior are based on different assumptions in lafuite and loreau 2017 the consumer chooses the amounts of two consumption goods to maximizes a static utility function but biodiversity does not enter this utility function and so plays no direct role differently our consumer decides a consumption path to maximize her intertemporal utility function which depends also on biodiversity in other words biodiversity directly affects the marginal utility of consumption changing the consumption profile at the end while in lafuite and loreau 2017 the occurrence of cycles rests on the biodiversity feedbacks on production cycles arise in our framework because of the biodiversity effects on consumption demand in this respect non monotonic convergence to the steady state of a socio ecological system seems to be a pervasive feature once biodiversity feedbacks on the economy are considered the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the model sections 3 and 4 focus on the equilibrium system and its steady state section 5 studies the local dynamics an example with isoelastic preferences is considered in section 6 while a numerical illustration is provided in section 7 section 8 concludes all the proofs are gathered in appendix a 2 model we consider an economy with households firms and a government households work consume and enjoy the nature firms produce and pollutes the government taxes the firms to maintain the environment let us introduce the three ingredients of the model a metapopulation dynamics à la levins 1969 the economic fundamentals à la ramsey 1928 and a simple pollution process 2 1 metapopulation in ecology a metapopulation represents a spatially fragmented population of the same species to simplify the model we assimilate wildlife to a single metapopulation following levins 1969 we consider that space is represented by a partition of patches occupied or unoccupied by the metapopulation let q denotes the fraction of patches occupied at a given time as in levins 1969 the evolution of this share is simply given by 4 4 the reader interested in an economic model considering a non renewable resource is referred to dasgupta and heal 1974 or benchekroun and withagen 2011 among the others 1 q φ q 1 q β q at each time any occupied patch can become unoccupied at the extinction rate β the contribution to the change in the share of occupied patches is given by βq conversely any unoccupied patch can become occupied at the migration rate φ the migration pressure on the share 1 q of unoccupied patches is given by φq a simple analysis of 1 allow us to point out that there exist two distinct steady states q 0 0 and q 1 β φ it follows that q 0 leads to wildlife mass extinction while q represents an equilibrium where wildlife is positive interestingly q 0 if and only if the migration rate φ exceeds the extinction rate β human activities pollute and stress the wildlife habitat mainly through the climate change to put it in other way pollution accelerates the extinction rate we also consider that a degraded environment renders more difficult the wildlife migration in the sequel p will denote the aggregate stock of pollution assumption 1 pollution has a positive impact on the extinction rate and a negative impact on the migration rate 2 β β p and φ φ p such that β p 0 and φ p 0 assumption 1 captures the pressure put by humans on wildlife the role of pollution is summed up by the following elasticities and their difference definition 1 the colonization rate is the difference between the migration and the extinction rate s s p φ p β p we introduce also the pollution elasticities of migration and extinction ε φ p p φ p φ p and ε β p p β p β p and the pollution impact on colonization d p ε φ p ε β p 0 notice that the pollution impact on colonization is negative because according to assumption 1 ε φ p ε β p 2 2 firms firms behave competitively the firm j chooses the amount of capital k j and labor l j to maximize the profit in addition the government levies a proportional tax τ 0 1 on polluting production f k j l j of firm j to finance the maintenance of natural resource assumption 2 the production function f ℝ 2 ℝ is c 2strictly increasing and concave with constant returns to scale inada conditions hold 5 5 these properties quite standard in economics ensure the existence of a solution from an individual point of view and jointly with the assumptions on preferences the existence of an equilibrium from an aggregate point of view the assumption of constant returns to scale captures the divisibility of the productive system considering many firms or an aggregate one becomes equivalent and allows us to write in intensive terms the relevant variables and to represent the state of the economy in terms of capital intensity in addition the sum of smooth and non smooth technologies can be conveniently approximated at the aggregate level by a smooth production function let k j 1 j k j be the aggregate capital stock and l j 1 j l j be the aggregate labor demand k k l is the capital intensity in the economy the price of product is normalized to one r and w denote the real interest rate and the real wage these prices are taken as given by the firms proposition 2 firm the aggregate production is given by y f k l profit maximization yields 3 r 1 τ ρ k and w 1 τ ω k with ρ k f k and ω k f k kf k we introduce the capital share in total disposable income and the elasticity of capital labor substitution α k rk 1 τ f k kf k f k and σ k α k ω k k ω k in addition we determine the elasticities of factor prices k ρ k ρ k 1 α k σ k and k ω k ω k α k σ k 2 3 households the representative household earns a capital income rh where h denotes the individual wealth at time t and a labor income wl where l 1 inelastic labor supply thus the household consumes and saves her income according to the budget constraint 4 c h r δ h w where h denotes the time derivative of wealth the gross investment includes the capital depreciation at the rate δ we assume that wildlife habitat enters the household s utility function u c q with u q 0 we suppose that it affects the marginal utility of consumption u cq 0 indeed intuition suggests that wildlife plays a role in consumption demand if wildlife raises the consumption demand then wildlife and consumption are complement u cq 0 this happens when households like to consume in a pleasant environment in presence for instance of a large biodiversity conversely if wildlife lowers consumption demand then wildlife and consumption are substitutable u cq 0 in this case the household compensates the utility loss due to a lower wildlife by pushing her consumption demand assumption 3 preferences are rationalized by a non separable felicity function u c q first and second order restrictions hold on the sign of derivatives u c 0 u q 0 and u cc 0 jointly with the limit conditions lim c 0 u c and lim c u c 0 let us introduce the first and second order elasticities of felicity 5 ε c ε q cu c u qu q u and 6 ε cc ε cq ε qc ε qq cu cc u c qu cq u c cu qc u q qu qq uq 1 ε cc represents the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption while ε cq captures the effect of wildlife on the marginal utility of consumption typically if ε cq 0 0 then wildlife and consumption are complement substitute for households we observe that according to assumption 1 the utility function is indirectly affected by the pollution level through the wildlife level in a ramsey model the representative household maximizes an intertemporal utility functional 7 0 e θ t u c q dt under the budget constraint 4 where θ 0 denotes the rate of time preference let μ denote the multiplier associated to the budget constraint proposition 3 household the first order conditions of the consumer s program are given by the shadow price of consumption 8 μ u c c q the intertemporal consumption smoothing euler equation 9 μ μ θ δ r and the budget constraint 4 now binding 10 h r δ h w c jointly with the transversality condition lim t e θ t μ t h t 0 applying the implicit function theorem to the static relation μ u c c q we obtain the consumption demand c c μ q with elasticities 11 μ c dc d μ 1 ε cc 0 and q c dc dq ε cq ε cc 2 4 government the government uses all the tax revenues to finance the depollution expenditures m according to a balanced budget rule 12 m τ f k l 2 5 pollution the aggregate stock of pollution p is a pure externality coming from production y the government takes care of depollution through the abatement

good capital and labor clear the aggregate wealth is equal to the aggregate capital hl k hence h k without of loss of generality we normalize the population of workers l 1 proposition 4 equilibrium

steady state q 0 0 in the absence of wildlife mankind disappears and our economic analysis loses its interest proposition 5 steady state the steady state with a positive wildlife is given by 18 ρ k θ

state with positive wildlife β φ let us show how τ affects this positive steady state proposition 7 comparative statics the long run effects of taxation on the positive steady state are captured by the fiscal elasticities 22 τ k k τ τ 1 τ σ k 1 α k 0 τ c c τ τ 1 τ k c θ δ α k θ σ k 1 α k 0 23 τ p p τ γ τ b γ τ σ k τ 1 τ α k 1 α k 0 τ q q τ d p 1 q q τ p p τ 0 let us provide some intuition since the green tax is levied on the production level a higher green tax rate reduces the production level and the capital intensity in turn a drop in the production level entails also in the long run 1 a lower disposable income and thus a lower consumption and 2 a weaker pollution level according to the process 13 under assumption 1 the drop in pollution lowers the extinction rate and jointly increases the migration rate leading to a richer wildlife in the long run focus now on the impact of the green tax on welfare because of the assumption of representative agent all the households share the same fundamentals the welfare functional sums up to her utility functional w c q 0 e θ t u c q dt let us introduce a critical value for the social propensity to wildlife 24 e τ c c τ τ q q τ 0 proposition 8 welfare the green tax rate is welfare improving in the long run if and only if the relative preference for wildlife is sufficiently large that is ε q ε c e where the elasticities ε c and ε q are given by 5 let us provide some economic intuition about this result ε q ε c depends on the slope of the indifference curve in the c q plane and describes how the household weights wildlife with respect to consumption inequality ε q ε c e holds when households display ecological preference that is a higher ratio ε q ε c unsurprisingly a higher green tax rate has two opposite effects on utility 1 a lower consumption level inequality 22 which reduces the household s utility and 2 a richer wildlife habitat inequality 23 which increases her utility thus if the representative household overweights nature with respect to consumption the positive effect 2 dominates the negative effect 1 and the green tax turns out to be welfare improving according to chan et al 2007 human welfare and biological conservation are no longer mutually exclusive once ecosystem services to human population are taking into account compatibility between economic and ecological targets is reinterpreted through condition 24 indeed in the case of ecosystems including wildlife preservation the household can overweight the biodiversity with respect to consumption condition 24 in this case a higher green tax rate results in both an increase in the wildlife habitat a higher q in proposition 7 and a higher human welfare in proposition 8 as pointed out by chan et al 2007 biological conservation and human welfare becomes compatible corollary 9 welfare the critical value is explicitly given by 25 e s p β p d p θ 1 α k 1 σ k δ 1 α k θ δ 1 α k α k σ k 1 α k 1 τ τ γ τ b γ τ and in the case of a cobb douglas technology by 26 e s p β p d p α 1 α 1 τ τ γ τ b γ τ 1 5 local dynamics to study the multiplicity of equilibria local indeterminacy and the occurrence of local bifurcations around the unique positive steady state we focus on the dynamical system proposition 10 the jacobian matrix of system 14 17 is given by 27 j 0 μ k 1 α θ δ σ 0 0 k μ 1 ε cc θ 1 α δ α θ 0 k q ε cq ε cc θ 1 α δ α 0 b γ τ θ δ 1 τ a 0 0 0 β φ ds p s where α α k σ σ k ε cc ε cc c q ε cq ε cq c q β β p φ φ p d d p and μ k p and q are evaluated at the steady state for simplicity we focus on the cobb douglas technology in order to study the local dynamics local indeterminacy and local bifurcations we apply a methodology developed by bosi and desmarchelier 2017 and based on the sums of principal minors of the jacobian matrix lemma 11 in the case of a cobb douglas technology the trace the sum of principal minors of order two the sum of principal minors of order three and the determinant of the jacobian matrix 27 are given by 28 t θ a s 29 s 2 as θ a s d as 30 s 3 as θ d t θ as a β d θ δ 1 α ε cq ε cc 31 d a 1 α θ δ θ 1 α δ s α ε cc the following proposition shows that a unique equilibrium trajectory exists in a neighborhood of the positive steady state proposition 12 local determinacy the equilibrium is locally unique near the positive steady state focus now on local bifurcations from a mathematical point of view a transcritical bifurcation occurs when β φ we do not care about this case because from an economic point of view the trivial steady state q 0 0 and the case where β φ that is q 0 are meaningless in order to study the occurrence of limit cycles through a hopf bifurcation we consider the main economic variable that is the cross elasticity ε cq capturing the wildlife impact on preferences and consumption demand in this respect let 32 ε h ε cc t 2 s 2 s 2 2 4 d d t θ as as θ a β d θ 1 α δ as we will see in the case of isoelastic preferences the rhs of 32 does not depend on ε cq and it is well defined endogenous limit cycles arise when the discount rate exceeds the rate of natural absorption assumption 5 a θ assumption 5 simply means a strong inertia in the pollution process pollution persistence is empirically relevant indeed according to mélières and maréchal 2015 p 333 the atmosphere contains 800 gigatons of carbon gtc while nature lands and oceans absorbs between 2 and 3 gtc per year thereby according to quarterly data a 0 000625 0 0009375 while the usual quarterly value for θ is 0 01 proposition 13 hopf under assumption 5 a hopf bifurcation around the positive steady state generically occurs at ε cq ε h d 0 captures the negative impact of pollution on the wildlife habitat focus on the critical value 32 the larger the negative impact of pollution on wildlife diffusion the lower the bifurcation value ε h in other terms when d becomes higher endogenous limit cycles can take place since the number of stable eigenvalues is odd indeed d 0 if β φ and a θ then the dimension of the stable manifold goes from 3 to 1 or from 1 to 3 when the system undergoes a hopf bifurcation in the first case the bifurcation is supercritical and the limit cycle is stable while in the second case the bifurcation is subcritical and this cycle is unstable proposition 13 not only highlights the possibility of a non monotonic convergence to the steady state but even that of persistent cycles around these dynamics are closely related to those in lafuite and loreau 2017 however in their model cycles come from the environmental feedbacks on agricultural production while in our model they stem from environmental feedbacks on household s utility because of the different fundamentals involved in these fluctuations non monotonic convergence towards an attractor a steady state or a limit cycle appears to be a pervasive feature of socio ecological systems the following proposition rules out the class of saddle node bifurcations as well as any bifurcation of codimension two proposition 14 under assumption 5 around the positive steady state saddle node bogdanov takens gavrilov guckheimer or double hopf bifurcations are excluded 6 isoelastic preferences metapopulation is driven by the following explicit migration and extinction rates β p a β p ε β and φ p a φ p ε φ with constant elasticities ε φ 0 and ε β 0 in this case the colonization rate and the pollution impact on colonization are given by s a φ p ε φ a β p ε β and d ε φ ε β we consider also a cobb douglas technology f k ak α and isoelastic preferences u c q cq η 1 ε 1 ε η measures the propensity to wildlife while 1 ε the elasticity of intertemporal substitution of the composite good cq η straightforward computations give ε c 1 ε ε q η 1 ε ε cc ε and ε cq η 1 ε corollary 15 steady state the steady state is computed in terms of the fundamental parameters 33 k α a 1 τ θ δ 1 1 α c θ 1 α δ α k p θ δ a α b γ τ 1 τ k b γ τ a a α a 1 τ θ δ α 1 α q 1 a β a φ p d with μ c ε q η 1 ε η is the main parameter because it captures the peculiarity of the model that is the preference for wildlife corollary 16 welfare in the case of isoelastic preferences the green tax rate is welfare improving in the long run if and only if η e where now 34 e 1 ε φ ε β 1 a φ a β p ε φ ε β α 1 α 1 τ τ γ τ b γ τ and p is given by 33 we observe that neither p nor e depend on η thus e is an explicit and well defined critical value for η unsurprisingly if agents overweight wildlife with respect to consumption η e a higher green tax rate raises the social welfare in the isoelastic case even the right hand side of 32 does not depend on η corollary 17 hopf a limit cycle generically arises around the critical propensity to wildlife 35 η h ε 1 ε a θ s p d a t θ s p t 2 s 2 s 2 2 4 d a β ε φ ε β θ 1 α δ where 36 t

wildlife η h giving rise to endogenous cycles in the next section we calibrate and simulate the model and we find this value 7 simulations in order to illustrate the above theoretical results we calibrate the model and provide simulations of dynamics using the original nonlinear system 14 17 6 6 we use the matcont package for matlab we set the fundamental parameters as follows the parameters a a β a φ ε β and ε φ are normalized α is the usual value of capital share in total income θ and δ take their standard quarterly values τ represents the public air protection expenditures 12 implies τ m y according to the oecd environmental performance reviews for france 2016 p 149 the public air protection expenditures amount to less than 5 billion euros that is less than 0 25 of france gdp to be in accordance with these data we simply set τ 0 002 finally a b and γ are chosen to satisfy a θ assumption 5 and the positivity of the steady state k 28 385671 c 2 3010 p 0 90499041 and q 0 18099236 we observe that these steady state values do not depend on η moreover if s 0 positive steady state the bifurcation value η h 0 if and only if ε 1 that is iff ε cq 0 in other terms the existence of a limit cycle around the positive steady state is ensured when consumption and wildlife are substitutable goods to grasp this point let the economy be at the steady state today and assume an exogenous increase in the pollution level p under assumption 1 this implies a lower migration rate a higher extinction rate and a weaker wildlife habitat q in turn under assumption 3 the drop in q lowers the household s utility to compensate this loss because of her substitutable preferences the household increases the consumption while reducing her saving which lowers the capital stock tomorrow and the pollution level at the end thus when consumption and wildlife are sufficiently substitutable a higher pollution today entails a lower pollution tomorrow giving rise to endogenous cycles thus we fix the elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1 ε 1 2 1 to have limit cycles according to expression 35 and calibration in table 1 we find the bifurcation value of ecological preference η h 3 322 at η η h we obtain μ 55 238 and replacing in the jacobian matrix 27 we get the eigenvalues λ 1 0 205636 λ 2 0 0126424 and λ 3 0 0148104i λ 4 coherently we find two nonreal and conjugated eigenvalues with zero real part λ 3 and λ 4 that is the signature of the occurrence of a hopf bifurcation matcont computes also the first lyapunov coefficient at the hopf critical value l 1 1 278750 10 5 0 a positive lyapunov coefficient means that the hopf bifurcation is subcritical and the limit cycle is unstable matcont generates fig 1 directly from the original nonlinear system 14 17 using the current calibration and projecting a 4d cycle on the 3d subspace of quantities k p q a limit cycles arises around the positive steady state in order to study the green tax effect on the bifurcation value η h we reconsider the previous calibration without fixing τ see fig 2 and plotting η h as a function of τ fig 2 shows that η h rapidly increases with τ reaching less plausible values broadly speaking the endogenous cycles induced by a hopf bifurcation are less likely to occur under a higher green tax rate as seen above the green tax seems to reconcile biological conservation and human welfare in addition fig 2 shows that a higher green tax rate can stabilize the fluctuations in biodiversity q and economic variables k summing up we conclude in terms of comparative statics that when households overvalue wildlife with respect to consumption condition 24 a higher green tax rate turns out to have a triple benefit 1 reducing the pollution level while promoting biological conservation proposition 7 2 raising the human welfare proposition 8 and 3 making the endogenous cycles less likely fig 2 8 conclusion in this paper we have embedded the levins model 1969 of metapopulation dynamics into the ramsey model 1928 in order to capture the effects of economic activities on the wildlife habitat this interdisciplinary approach gives interesting results both concerning the long and the short run in the long run as in levins 1969 two steady states coexist a zero one with mass extinction and another one with positive wildlife when the migration rate of the metapopulation exceeds its extinction rate a simple exercise of comparative statics shows that even if the green tax lowers both the capital intensity and the consumption level at the steady state it improves the welfare if the representative household overweights wildlife with respect to consumption in the short run because of the role of pollution the interaction between wildlife and consumption leads to richer dynamics than those described by levins 1969 in particular we observe that a negative impact of wildlife on consumption demand can give rise to the emergence of a limit cycle through a hopf bifurcation near the positive steady state finally we have shown that the negative pollution effect on wildlife works as a destabilizing force in the economy the larger the negative impact of pollution on wildlife habitat the lower the effect of wildlife on consumption demand at the origin of limit cycles the government s rule in our paper is intendedly simple in order to obtain tractable dynamics further researches should study how the equilibrium is affected when the government finances depollution through the public debt or an endogenous tax rate reconsidering a more general pollution process where the parameters involved become functions of biological variables is also a promising research line appendix a proof of proposition 2 the profit maximization max k j n j f k j l

variables k p and q of system 14 17 are predetermined while one μ is a jump variable in this case local indeterminacy requires four stable eigenvalues thus d 0 is a necessary but not sufficient

25196,determining habitat requirements for the persistence of a wildlife population is especially difficult for wide ranging opportunist species the american black bear ursus americanus is one such species that is re colonizing parts of its former range and colonizing new geographic regions we sought to predict the potential for further westward expansion of a population of black bears that has recently colonized a primarily agricultural 50 landscape with small fragmented islands of forest 17 at the edge of its range in northwestern minnesota we delineated critical aspects of bears spatial ecology by examining size and habitat composition of home ranges of gps collared individuals n 38 75 bear years 2007 2013 at both annual and weekly temporal scales we measured food production by

roads and higher percentage of non consumable agriculture and wetlands i e unused areas embedded in the home range caloric density had the strongest negative influence on whr size we predict males can expand farther westward by virtue of their adaptable sprawling home ranges that can encompass an array of resources and their inclination to tolerate and exploit landscapes with few other bears and patchy vegetative cover embedded with agriculture roads and people females are more limited to woodlots with natural foods and less apt to be located in open treeless expanses however we observed wide year to year variations in food production and found that during the most favorable conditions females could be enticed farther westward although it is unclear whether they would settle in an environment with even less tree cover than in the current extremity of their range keywords home range agriculture bears movement ecology caloric mapping range expansion 1 introduction understanding

range can yield important insights into the requisites for species persistence pe er et al 2014 it was previously assumed or reasoned that animals living at the periphery of their range i e at the edge of suitable habitat must suffer reduced fitness sexton et al 2009 however studies show that even where the margins of primary range recede into fragmented habitat patches individuals can thrive if habitat quality within the patches remains high mortelliti et al 2010 sexton et al 2009 but if resources are too spatially dispersed metabolic costs of travelling between patches of food could preclude animals from inhabiting the area thereby limiting the species geographic range ecologists have long grappled with understanding species distributional range limits mostly as a matter of scientific inquiry more recently with recognition that many species ranges are visibly shrinking or expanding in response to rapid alterations of habitat or changes in the animals abundance the understanding and forecasting of range limits has undergone a resurgence in interest on a more pragmatic level loarie et al 2009 sexton et al 2009 the american black bear ursus americanus hereinafter black bear represents a species whose geographic range has been rapidly expanding recolonizing many parts of their former range in the united states due to their increasing numbers and adaptability to various human modified e g agricultural or urban landscapes don carlos et al 2009 garshelis et al 2016 hiller et al 2015 karelus et al 2016 scheick and mccown 2014 sun et al 2017 however their expanding range has oftentimes led to increasing conflict with humans wilton et al 2014 thus their range expansion leads directly to management issues as such this species represents an interesting and practical subject for an investigation of species range limits the edge of a species range may be demarcated by a reduction in resource availability that is at some point along a gradient of resource availability a population can no longer be supported home range size may be one indicator of resource availability fieberg and börger 2012 mitchell and powell 2012 home range sizes of black bears vary dramatically across their north american range tri 2013 increasing at higher latitudes and decreasing in areas with higher vegetative diversity and caloric availability gompper and gittleman 1991 moyer et al 2007 smith and pelton 1990 indicating that this species may accommodate diminished resource availability through expansion of the home range within a population fluctuations in phenology and mast availability can have large effects on habitat use of bears and hence affect their home ranges at short time scales garshelis and pelton 1981 noyce and garshelis 2010 male bears have larger home ranges than females and males tend to exhibit a weaker relationship between home range size and habitat productivity koehler and pierce 2003 female bears with cubs of the year often have smaller home ranges than females without cubs in the same population despite their higher metabolic requirements likely due to the limited mobility of cubs and time spent caring for them alt et al 1980 blanchard and knight 1991 reynolds and beecham 1980 other behavioral differences between demographic groups may also affect home range size e g males are known to dominate areas of highly valued food resources garshelis and pelton 1981 powell et al 1997 and exhibit higher risk tolerance than females including more road crossings and foraging near people baruch mordo et al 2014 beckmann and berger 2003 hence in an expanding bear population males are more likely to first colonize new areas jerina and adamič 2008 for a population to expand individual bears must settle outside the current range meaning that these colonizing bears must establish home ranges where few or no other bears live in doing so they may find unexploited resources but if these resources are patchy and widely spaced bears may need to travel more expending more energy and entailing more risks such as crossing roads or encountering people beringer et al 1990 lewis et al 2011 morales et al 2005 lewis

minnesota nwmn provides an interesting case study of the interplay between anthropogenic foods and patchy natural bear habitat on space use patterns and colonization by black bears here the expansive forests of the upper midwestern united states fade into largely open areas of agricultural production interspersed with smaller and smaller woodlots this marks the current westward limit of the distribution of black bears in the eastern united states the great plains constitute a large gap between the black bears of the eastern and western u s scheick and mccown 2014 this gap was historically occupied by black bears at low density and primarily in wooded riparian corridors based on sightings by the lewis and clark expedition 1804 1806 laliberte and ripple 2003 recent harvest records and sightings indicate that bears in nwmn have been expanding westward especially during the past two decades minnesota department of natural resources unpublished data before the landscape became dominated by agriculture black bears were reportedly common in this area bailey 1926 but for many decades they were considered rare expansion into this region was unanticipated as the habitat is atypical of the forested areas occupied by bears elsewhere in minnesota our principal objective was to better understand the suitability of habitat for bears in this region and to predict the westward limit of this expansion to predict future range expansion we examined the habitat needs of bears within home ranges near the current edge of the range and then compared this to habitat availability west range 40 70 km of the current distributional edge past records of bear expansion in minnesota indicated that males inhabited areas first later followed by females because males are more exploratory and wide ranging we measured caloric density of foods on the landscape and assumed that some threshold existed below which bears would not be attracted to the area or could not exist there long term as a second related objective of the study we tested the hypothesis that as gaps between patches of food and cover increased bears would use increasingly larger areas we predicted that eventually the average density of calories would become too low and or the distances between food patches too great to support a bear because it would need to expend too much energy to travel between patches we used information gleaned from the movement patterns of gps collared bears coupled with gis habitat analysis and field assessments of habitat specific food availability to model and map habitat suitability under yearly varying food conditions for bears across the nwmn landscape we examined the degree to which the nutritional landscape explains patterns of habitation by bears at the current edge of their distribution identified factors that influence the edge of habitable landscape and assessed the ecological and geographical limits of this expanding population 2 materials and

bear foods in both forest types included soft mast some ripening in early july including juneberry amelanchier humilis chokecherry prunus virginiana and gray and red osier dogwood cornus racemosa cornus sericea and hard mast including american and beaked hazel corylus americana corylus cornuta aspen parklands also commonly contained raspberry rubus strigosus arrowwood viburnum dentatum and sarsaparilla aralia nudicaulis in the herbaceous layer bur oak forests also provided abundant forage from hawthorn crataegus spp wild plum prunus americana and acorns starting in early september other natural non forested habitats included lowland deciduous shrub llds 11 5 areal coverage wetlands 11 2 and grasslands 7 4 llds was composed mainly of willow salix spp and alder alnus spp primary

bears such as sedges cyperaceae and horsetail equisetem grasslands were a mix of conservation reserve program land temporarily fallow fields or remnant prairie estimates of areal coverage for non crop layers were derived from the us geological survey us geological survey 2011 and crop coverage estimates were obtained through the usda s national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 prior to the mid 1990s the minnesota department of natural resources considered the primary study area secondary bear range due to the lack of bear habitat and low bear density compared to the more forested parts of the state in 1995 bear abundance in the region increased dramatically when bears moved into the area while seeking alternative foods during a statewide natural food failure since this initial influx nwmn has supported a significant and growing bear population garshelis et al 2010 2 2 study design we employed a modelling approach to combine data on bear movements habitat composition within home ranges food availability by habitat and year to year variation in food abundance to create a series of maps of habitat suitability by season we interpreted the far western edge of suitable habitat to be the distributional range limit we captured a sample of bears near the current western range limit and used gps collars to delineate weekly home ranges whr and the proportions of different habitats within these whrs we surveyed bear foods on plots in different habitats near the current western range limit to estimate seasonal and habitat specific caloric availability and from that derived average caloric density kcal m2 across the landscape we created a model to investigate how caloric density and other factors were related to whr size we used a moving window equal in size to the median seasonal whr to examine the sex specific suitability of habitat across the landscape in parcels of the size that bears would require for a week we then mapped suitability both within the range currently occupied by both males and breeding females and farther west where only a few collared males have dispersed and a limited number of bears have been observed scheick and mccown 2014 to gauge the prospects for and limits on future expansion 2 3 bear capture and collaring from may to july 2007 2011 we captured black bears using baited barrel traps we set traps in the most western patches of forest that appeared large enough to attract a bear captured bears were immobilized with a combination of ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine or premixed tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam telazol elkins sinn cherry hill nj usa we fit all adult bears with either gps store on board collars telemetry solutions concord ca usa lotek wireless inc newmarket ontario canada advanced telemetry systems isanti mn usa or gps iridium satellite collars vectronic aerospace berlin germany we programmed gps collars to attempt fixes once every 1 6 h during the non denning seasons dependent on the collar type and battery life we programmed low intensity fix schedules every 6 h to save battery life in late fall or early spring when pre or post denning bears were relatively sedentary we increased the sampling rate during fall on some collars to capture agricultural foraging at a finer scale we assigned each bear a unique identification number bearid and attached numbered plastic ear tags we downloaded gps data each winter december march 2007 2013 after anesthetizing collared bears in winter dens using telazol we classified females as being with cubs typically born in january if cubs were present in the den in march all animal handling was approved by the university of minnesota s institutional animal care and use committees permit no 1002a77516 2 4 home range estimates to delineate weekly home ranges whr we assigned each location to a week of the year and excluded locations that were associated with weeks 1 during which the bear was denning 2 occurring before may 1 or after dec 1 3 that did not include fixes covering at least 6 of the 7 days or 4 with 21 successful fixes 3 fixes per day we delineated whr areas using kernel density estimators with the rule based approach and the ad hoc method for selecting a bandwith as suggested by kie 2013 the ad hoc method iteratively uses decreasing scaling values 1 0 0 95 0 9 decreasing by 0 1 thereafter multiplied by the estimated href value a smoothing parameter for the kernel density estimator determined by the reference bandwidth method the home range is taken to be the area of the isopleth having the lowest scaling value that did not cause the calculated polygon to fracture into non contiguous polygons if the home range fractured during the first iteration in our analysis it occurred in 50 of annual home ranges we used a scaling value of 1 0 which is equal to the reference bandwidth method thirty percent of whrs fractured into multiple polygons in the first iteration when using a scaling value of 1 0 for h we were primarily interested in quantifying changes in home range size or composition over time assuming that any bias from the estimator remains the same across time these comparisons are typically more robust to estimator choice than absolute estimates of home range size signer et al 2015 for our modeling purposes we used a 90 isopleth because börger et al 2006 found it resulted in greater precision and statistical power than a 95 isopleth for comparing home range sizes among individuals or within individuals across time additionally we used kernel density estimators with the reference bandwidth to facilitate comparisons with other studies and reported the 50 and 95 area estimates we estimated annual home range size of each bear for each calendar year in which we obtained gps data points for that bear on at least 120 days during may november when bears were not hibernating we estimated annual home range size by first removing gps locations that were less than 4 h from each previous fix starting with the second fix from each bear year 2 5 landscape covariates for each whr we calculated the proportion of area comprising each of the following eight composite cover types asp aspen dominated forest white birch black ash fraxinus nigra oak bur oak upland shrub wet aquatic and marsh shrub lowland deciduous and coniferous shrubs con conifer forest pine spruce cedar tamarack grass grassland dev developed or agfield agricultural lands excluding those consumed by bears in the region these were derived by grouping major habitat types classified in a gis land cover layer created by the usgs upper midwest gap analysis program us geological survey 2011 using geospatial modeling environment beyer 2012 we added a ninth cover type to represent the cumulative percentage of agricultural crops consumed by bears in this region crop e g corn sunflowers oats barley see ditmer et al 2016 within each home range using annual cover maps created by the usda national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 the raster resolution for all cover type maps was 30 m 30 m which hereafter is called a cell we calculated road density km of road km2 within each whr using a gis shapefile created by the minnesota department of transportation minnesota department of transportation 2013 a second road layer provided vehicle count data for the mean traffic volume of road segments roads that did not have an assigned traffic volume appeared to be secondary roads e g minimal maintenance farm and forestry roads so we assigned them the minimum value recorded for all other road segments 5 vehicles per hour we created a covariate road by multiplying the length of each road segment within each home range by the associated average traffic volume of the road segment 2 6 weather and temporal conditions we calculated weekly averages for ambient temperature cº temp and wind speed mph wind which may influence a bear s ability to smell and access more distant food resources and precipitation cm prec using weather underground http www wunderground com weather station data from a site near the center of the study area gatzke agassiz national wildlife refuge station we created a covariate for day length daylen using package geosphere hijmans 2017 in program r r core team 2018 we used the latitude for middle river in this function and provided the julian date of the first day of each week for the temporal requirement of the calculation we created a categorical covariate for season seas for use in testing seasonal interactions with other covariates we classified weeks 18 25 as spring may 1 july 1 26 36 as summer july 1 sept 1 and 37 49 sep 1 dec 1 as fall 2 7 demographic classification bear age age was estimated from annuli in the root of a first upper premolar coy and garshelis 1992 or was known for bears first observed as cubs we created a categorical variable for sex sex and a binary variable to distinguish females with cubs of the year coy

foods fruits and nuts supplementary table s1 we conducted 253 food surveys mean 51 per year range 28 75 on temporary plots within 125 unique forest stands of four forest types 62 aspen ash birch 29 oak 5 llds 4 coniferous approximately reflecting their relative composition of the forested portion of the landscape using gis we selected survey locations by identifying patches of each cover type that were large enough to fit our 30 m 60 m sample grid see below we spread out the sampled areas from a pool of all habitat patches that were large enough to accommodate our sampling methodology to maximize the spatial coverage across the study area each survey comprised 15 sample plots of 3 m diameter spaced at 15 m intervals five plots were along the open edges of habitat stands along roadways or clearings five were 15 m deep into the stand and five were 30 m into the stand the first point along the edge was chosen prior to arriving at the site using gis software the remaining four edge points were placed at 15 m intervals from there and interior points were perpendicular to each of these in each plot we visually estimated the percent cover of each type of food fruit producing plant and then converted this to area m2 we assigned a subjective fruit production score 0 4 0 no fruit or nuts 4 highest production of fruit to each fruiting species in the plot we converted these production scores to biomass by collecting counting and weighing fruits from smaller subplots 0 25 1 m2 we obtained year specific relationships between fruit production scores and biomass for sets of years with different observers 3 different primary observers over the 5 year sampling period we multiplied estimates of productivity by areal coverage to obtain an estimate of biomass g of each food per area in each survey acorns were sampled differently from other wild bear foods as they were the only bear food in the tree canopy all other fruits were on ground level bushes or small trees we sampled oak stands 9 22 stands per years using plots as in our other fruit sampling surveys but the plots were only 1 m2 within plots we counted all fallen acorns and empty caps and reconstructed the number of acorns that had fallen there we multiplied this by average acorn weight 2 5 g tecklin and mccreary 1991 to obtain biomass per unit area we used bomb calorimetry to estimate caloric content of 13 common species of wild fruits and nuts and the 2 agricultural crops corn and sunflowers most commonly consumed by bears in the region ditmer et al 2016 supplementary table s1 we did not measure the caloric content of 4 less common wild fruits so we assigned them caloric values of similar species supplementary table s1 we estimated the percentage of refuse i e indigestible matter per species sample by weighing samples before and after removing stems cupules shells and sizeable pits we removed moisture by freeze drying or baking at 100 c for at least 24 h supplementary table s1 we crushed the dried samples and used a parr calorimetric thermometer model 1672 parr instrument company moline illinois usa to obtain caloric content per gram dry weight supplementary table s1 we typically ran two replicates of each sample and calculated the standard deviation to ensure samples did not produce significantly different caloric values to estimate a seasonal caloric availability score by habitat we first calculated caloric density calories m2 for each bear food species including acorns in each survey stand by multiplying estimated biomass g m2 by the mean measured calories per gram for that species we separately summed caloric density values for summer and fall species supplementary table s1 to derive season specific total caloric density in each stand different fruits ripened and decayed in different time windows and each survey captured availability at a point in time since surveys were conducted throughout the fruiting period we assumed they represented average available biomass for each species through the season we then calculated the season and year specific mean caloric density for each habitat by separately averaging summer and fall values across survey stands of each type asp oak con llds for each year of the study 2007 2011 we did not sample conifer and llds in all years so we used an average value from the sampled years for those not sampled we did not systematically sample wetlands grasslands or developed areas because we found little or no bear foods in these cover types based on our extensive experience in the region we assigned these habitats zero caloric availability to calculate caloric density for agricultural crops we converted yields reported for nwmn for each crop type during 2011 and 2012 usda 2014 supplementary table s2 to grams per m2 we converted this to calories per m2 using our calorimetry data for corn and sunflowers and values provided by the usda s national nutrient database for standard reference http ndb nal usda gov for barley and oats supplementary table s2 we had no evidence of bears eating substantial amounts of other crops so assigned them a caloric value of zero we calculated a total caloric availability score within each whr by multiplying the percent of each habitat and crop type within the whr times the mean caloric density for the corresponding habitat crop type season and year we divided the total caloric availability within each whr by the size of the whr area to obtain our estimate of average caloric availability per m2 we log transformed the values to create logcal because the distribution was highly right skewed estimates were only available during years that we measured natural caloric availability 2007 2011 of wild foods and could thus assign the appropriate year specific values for each cover type we acknowledge that our sampling methodologies may contain some error that is propagated through to our caloric availability score but we believe the methods enable separation of large differences categories in caloric availability among habitat types without bias 2 9 modeling bear home range size we used linear mixed models with function lme in package nlme of program r pinheiro et al 2017 r core team 2018 to relate the log of whr area to covariates while allowing for repeated measures and within individual temporal autocorrelation specifically we included random intercepts for each unique bear year combination and specified an auto regressive model structure with first order correlation i e ar 1 based on the week number of the year we scaled and centered all numeric covariates schielzeth 2010 but present graphs in original scales we excluded the covariate asp to reduce the collinearity associated with all proportions of habitat types adding up to one within each whr we also removed con because it was uncommon in the region and dev because it was rare within whrs removal of these three landcover types resulted in removing an average of 25 of the areal landcover found within whrs we checked for collinearity among the included covariates using variance inflation factors all covariates 10 we included main effects associated with road density traffic volume road bear age age day length day wind speed wind precipitation precip ambient temperature temp the proportions of each whr that contained agricultural fields with non consumed crop types agfield commonly consumed crop types crop lowland deciduous shrubs llds and wetlands wet we included interactions between the sex of the bear sex and crop and seas with whether the bear was with cubs of the year coy oak and crop each separately we fit a single global model that included all possible factors aside from caloric density that might influence the size of whrs based on our priori hypotheses and evaluated the significance of each covariate and interaction within the model using confidence intervals and p values giudice et al 2012 harrell 2015 we considered p values 0 05 to be significant we quantified effect sizes by generating model based predictions of whr area and 95 confidence intervals based on the range of possible values from a single covariate or interaction while holding all other covariates at their mean values using the effects package in program r fox 2003 r core team 2018 we fit a second model using the same linear mixed effect model structure and functions to quantify the relationship between whr size and caloric density in this model we only included logcal scaled and centered and not habitat variables since logcal was highly dependent on habitat type we tested support for an interaction between logcal and seas using p values and considered the interaction significant at α 0 05 a significant interaction would indicate that the relationship between whr and logcal is significantly different between seasons each model s residuals were checked for normality 2 10 mapping habitat suitability and potential range expansion we created a series of maps in which we assigned a value for relative habitat suitability to each map cell we assumed that bears require a minimum of two components in any landscape to persist for an extended period of time a natural vegetative cover for safety and rest and 2 food resources overall our suitability value was based on a mix of natural cover availability road traffic density more road density and greater traffic volumes reduce natural cover availability and caloric density which combined gis map delineations natural cover and crop availability with our bear food sampling efforts and calorimetry values see supplemental tables s1 and s2 we determined the value of each cell based on the surrounding circular area moving window that was equal in area to that of the median seasonal whr and then used raster math to determine the overall habitat suitability value which we classified based on the distribution of all cell values we developed separate seasonal maps for males and females using values calculated from areas with whrs modeled whr results and well established differences in sex specific behavior females are more risk averse and require more natural cover use of the landscape and caloric needs an overview of the process through which we assigned habit suitability values and geographic range delineation can be found in fig 1 we describe the stepwise process here 2 10 1 step 1 smoothing base maps the suitability of habitat for large mammals cannot be judged at the scale of an individual raster cell on a map rather it reflects the composite make up of a broader landscape thus to create maps where raster values reflected overall habitat suitability for bears we had to consider the landscape composition in a larger area around each cell that was likely to be used by a bear we used the focal statistics tool in arcgis to smooth the data in various map layers such that derived values assigned to each cell raster in the newly created map layers represented the composition of a circular moving window the size of the median season specific whr w h r i i 1 2 n bears males and females separately reasoning that the median whr best reflected the typical area influencing a bear s movements feeding and landscape use over a week long period the first step in building habitat suitability maps was to create smoothed gis layers as described above representing a natural cover and b road density for a the natural cover layer we calculated the percentage of raster cells within the moving window that were considered natural habitat cover all cover types except dev agfield crop we then assigned that value to the focal cell for b the smoothed road density layer we first added spatial buffers around all roads on the gis road layer which reflected traffic volume buffer width m 0 5 the average count of vehicles per day except for roads with no measured traffic volume e g north dakota roads and minimally used roads in nwmn these we buffered to 15 m roads not only have strong influences on bear behaviors machutchon and proctor 2015 and ranges ceia hasse et al 2017 they can also impact the surrounding environment for bears ditmer et al 2018 found bears elicit physiological responses to roads well beyond the immediate roadway which may act to reduce the perceived safety cover of the surrounding habitat the spillover effects of roads e g sights sounds smells into the surrounding environment are likely driven by the traffic volume of a given road segment our whr models also supported this relationship we found a strong positive association between bear home range size and road density traffic volume road see results to incorporate road density and vehicular traffic we used the following procedure as a means of creating a road buffer that essentially reduced the amount of natural vegetative cover available to bears we calculated the percentage of cells in the moving window that contained a road buffer binary 0 cell without road buffer or 1 road buffer present and assigned that value to the focal cell we subtracted this percentage from the percentage of natural habitat cover assigned to that same cell to arrive at a final adjusted cover percent value for the cell in doing so we assumed that areas within road buffers reduced suitable available natural cover for bears but did not necessarily result in an uninhabitable cell 2 10 2 step 2 assigning habitat suitability values to cells spring the next step was to delineate season and sex specific areas of lowest suitability for bears for an area to be considered minimally suitable it had to meet thresholds for both the availability of natural habitat cover and forage within the moving window these thresholds were based on the sex and season specific distributions of values we observed in actual bear whrs we chose the 5th percentile as the cutoff point for suitable habitat because it represented the proportion of cover and caloric availability above which most bears were supported on a weekly basis lower values represented more extreme cases of low food or cover places where a bear might live for a week but that likely would not support a bear for an extended period accordingly cells that fell below the 5th percentile in availability of natural cover adjusted for road traffic buffers were classified as unsuitable quality and considered marginal for bears when creating maps of habitat suitability for the spring season natural cover percent was the only criterion used for assigning habitat quality scores at that time of year bears fed mostly in natural habitats i e not at anthropogenic food sources on foods that we were not able to quantify e g green vegetation ants deer fawns odocoileus virginianus habitat suitability in spring maps was estimated as natural cover within moving window minus of cells in moving window containing the road buffer for j 1 2 n raster cells each raster cell was then assigned as follows 5th percentile for natural cover unsuitable 5th 25th percentile low 25th 50th medium 50th 75th high and 75th 100th very high supplementary table s3 2 10 3 step 3 assigning habitat suitability values to cells summer and fall when creating maps of habitat suitability for summer and fall cells were classified based on natural cover and estimated caloric density as for spring maps each summer and fall map cell first had to meet the season and sex specific requirement for a minimal amount of natural habitat cells initially classified as unsuitable based on natural habitat availability retained that value and were not considered further remaining cells with suitable cover were then assigned a habitat suitability value based on the estimated caloric density of the surrounding area to do this we applied habitat and summer or fall specific caloric density values estimated from our fruit sampling to the appropriate natural cover types on our land cover base map we used the gis crop cover layer from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 to determine the combined areal coverage of corn sunflowers oats and barley and assigned an average caloric value for fall maps to each raster cell associated with a crop field supplementary table s2 we then smoothed the map again using a moving window the size of the median sex and season specific whr cell values for the smoothed caloric layer were derived by summing the total calories associated with all cells within the moving window to each focal cell we assigned a habitat suitability score in summer and fall by first calculating the same score as for spring considering only natural cover and roads if a cell was considered suitable habitat based on these criteria 5th percentile we assessed caloric availability we used the same moving window and again partitioned the data into percentile groupings any cell with caloric density values below the 5th percentile was considered unsuitable and added to those already in this category due to inadequate natural cover based on the requirement for summer and fall supplementary table s3 all other suitability categories were based strictly on calories to capture the wide range of natural variability in foods available to bears from year to year we derived multiple maps of caloric density for each of summer and fall these depicted estimated caloric density under three theoretical scenarios of food availability low medium and high and were based on variation across years that we documented in both wild foods and crops for each respective cover type we assigned values equaling the minimum mean or maximum cover type specific caloric density that we documented during our five years of food sampling table 1 includes estimates of variability among patches for con we used the estimates from the only year of sampling for all theoretical scenarios and used the min max and average of the two years of sampling for llds cover for crops we used the gis crop cover layer from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 to determine the minimum median and maximum combined areal coverage of corn sunflowers oats and barley for any year sampled 2007 2013 min 1 4 med 1 8 max 3 9 and assigned an average caloric value to each raster cell associated with a crop field in those years supplementary table s2 we assumed the spatial configuration of crop fields to be the same as it was in the year of data collection we combined the natural calorie layers with the corresponding crop calorie layers e g highest natural calorie year combined with highest crop areal coverage year etc and mapped the total caloric availability score of bear foods under different scenarios in creating separate habitat suitability maps for each season each sex and three levels of caloric availability summer and fall only we could see how suitable habitat distribution varied for males and females and how it changed with forage availability we overlaid gps locations of gps collared bears by season on seasonal habitat suitability maps to see how closely they conformed to our map projections of habitable landscape we included the greater study area in habitat suitability maps in order to include areas beyond range 40 70 km the current edge of the range of nwmn black bear population this provided a tool for postulating if and where habitat configuration might favor further colonization by bears both under current conditions or with future changes in habitat and or climate 3 results 3 1 home range size we used 42 552 locations to delineate annual home ranges for 60 bear years n 33 female 27 male of 29 individual bears 14 female 15 male male home ranges were nine times larger than those of females for both the 50 estimates x 95

males had annual home ranges 250 km2 min 174 km2 whereas three had home ranges 1600 km2 max 2760 km2 five females had home ranges 30 km2 min 17 km2 whereas three exceeded 200 km2 max 620 km2 all minimum and maximum values were from different individuals not different bear years from the same individual s see supplementary table s4 for annual home range estimates using different estimators we used 80 441 locations from 38 individual animals 17 female 21 male over 75 bear years n 37 female 38 male to delineate 1453 whrs the mean male whr size average whr size across individuals by week and sex was 129 18 0 se km2 with the maximum in mid august week 33 x 221 5 83 2 km2 and minimum in november week 45 x 41 5 24 1 km2 fig 2 a the mean weekly female whr size was 23 5 4 0 km2 with the maximum during mid june week 24 x 46 5 10 1 km2 and minimum at the end of september week 38 x 8 39 1 6 km2 fig 2b male average whr exceeded female whr for all weeks by an average of 105 5 17 2 km2 the maximum difference between male and female whr size occurred in spring when whrs of males were more than seven times larger than those of females median 86 km2 vs 12 km2 the 95 confidence intervals of male whr size only overlapped those from female whrs as bears prepared to hibernate and restricted their movements to small areas fig 2 during summer and fall sizes of whrs of both female and male bears were negatively associated with the availability of consumable crops fig 3 b c e f but in spring these crops were not ripe so they created a void that caused bears to increase the size of their home range fig 3a d in all seasons whrs increased with increasing cover of non consumable crops agfield table 2 among natural cover types wet had a strong positive association with whr size llds had a negative association and oak had a positive association in spring and a negative association in summer and fall table 2 supplementary fig s1 for females the presence of cubs coy was associated with smaller whr size during spring when the cubs were very young than in summer and fall table 2 increases in road densities and traffic volumes road were associated with increases in whr size table 2 as were periods with higher average ambient temperatures temp and longer day length day table 2 whr size during summer and fall n 645 was negatively associated with caloric density logcal of wild foods and crops table 1 and supplementary tables s1 and s2 β 1 00 se 0 07 t value 14 8 p 0 001 suggesting that bears moved around less each week when there was abundant food the relationship between whr and caloric density did not differ between summer and fall logcal season summer β 0 08 se 0 13 t value 0 62 p 0 54 although logcal was the only covariate in this model the estimated β was larger than any regression parameter in the first model 3 2 habitat suitability and potential distribution in spring the 5th percentile value for percent natural cover in whrs was 5 for males and 10 for females suggesting that males tolerated a more open landscape than females supplementary table 3 we used these values as thresholds below which habitat was considered unsuitable that is fewer than 5 of bears chose to inhabit such areas based solely on this criterion to derive separate habitat quality maps for males and females we found that 46 of the greater study area was considered the least habitable category for males 46 of cells were classified as very poor because there was 5 natural cover present in a surrounding circle the size of the median male whr and 54 were in this category for females fig 4 and supplementary fig s2 because habitat quality classifications in spring were directly related only to natural habitat cover the proportion of the landscape that was classified as high suitability 50th 75th quantile or very high above the 75th quantile was similar for males and females 27 for both fig 4 despite the large difference in male and female whr size in summer and fall habitat suitability reflected the caloric density of bear foods present both in natural habitats and crop fields year to year variation in nut berry and crop production captured in our analysis by preparing habitat quality maps for multiple food abundance scenarios had a larger impact on females in terms of the proportion of the landscape that was mapped as suitable than it did on males figs 5 and 6 all summer and fall scenarios for males resulted in 60 of the greater study area being classified as suitable poor very good fig 4 in contrast for females the proportion classified as suitable ranged from 35 to 51 across the different scenarios figs 5 and 6 however the proportion of habitat classified as either high or very high quality fluctuated similarly for males 2 49 and females 1 30 fig 4 the difference between the seasonal responses of the sexes was due in part to an increase in the median whr for females between spring 12 km2 and summer 17 km2 i e a larger moving window with which to classify the suitability of the landscape for summer than for spring and a decrease in whr size for males 86 km2 in spring vs 64 km2 in summer supplementary table 3 overall male bears required relatively more calories for an area to be considered habitable during summer 5th quantile in supplementary table 3 but their larger ranges and corresponding larger moving window coupled with the lower threshold for minimal natural cover supplementary table 3 met the caloric and natural cover requirements more consistently as a result the areas deemed habitable for males varied less across caloric scenarios relative to females fig 4 while the overall habitable area during fall was similar to summer for males the area expanded for females especially during the high calorie scenario fig 4 again females exhibited more variability in habitable areas with varying food resource availability range 49 56 compared to males range 59 61 figs 4 and 6 during good fall food conditions the highest ranked habitat suitability categories high and very high increased in area by 20 30 relative to poor food years for both males and females figs 4 and 6 bears caloric needs are greatest during fall and caloric density on the landscape was also greatest supplementary table 3 largely due to the availability of crops and nuts especially in asp and oak habitats table 1 accordingly both sexes had the smallest whrs in fall fig 2 and supplementary table 3 the extensive use of crop fields by males resulted in their lowest natural cover requirement of the year creating usable habitat in significant portions of far western minnesota within the red river valley marking the border with north dakota and even several locations in north dakota with adequate sized patches of natural cover near consumable crops fig 6 supplementary fig s3 caloric scenario maps suggested that crop availability mitigates years of poor natural food forage even when natural foods failed high and medium quality habitat quality remained as long as crops were available however they decreased or vanished in the western portions of the greater study area when crop availability was low figs 5a and d and 6 a and d bears were located in areas designated as suitable habitat in 96 9 of all gps locations n 80 230 this varied little in spring and summer during fall only 29 of 16 016 0 02 locations of female bears were located in the unsuitable habitat designation whereas males were found there more often 5 2 of 15 712 locations however 51 of fall male locations that occurred outside of suitable habitat were those of a single 2 year old individual that spent a large percentage of time in a crop field along the mn nd border male bears not only used the western portions of the landscape where there was little natural cover for foraging they also on occasion made use of tiny fragments of natural vegetation and open fields for hibernation fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effects of habitat on home range black bears in nwmn responded to the fragmented and agricultural landscape as we predicted agricultural areas that were not used for forage by bears were perceived as gaps that increased the space between patches of usable resources by examining home ranges at a weekly time scale we determined which attributes were associated with an increase e g agricultural land and roads or decrease e g care of cubs availability of crops eaten by bears oak habitat in space use bears in nwmn moved across a matrix of agricultural land in search of patches of natural habitat throughout the spring but many of them mainly males then sought out crop fields which began to mature in late summer and fall these extensive movements in search of crop fields resulted in the largest annual home range sizes for male american black bears ever reported annual home range estimates for female bears were also some of the largest recorded for the species more due to the fragmented nature of natural forest patches than to the allure of crop fields ditmer et al 2016 only three previous studies of this species from a compilation of 187 studies tri 2013 reported average home range sizes 500 km2 carter et al 2010 hechtel 1991 unger 2007 the second largest estimate was reported in the lower peninsula of michigan 606 km2 carter et al 2010 which was also a habitat fragmented by agriculture areal coverage 15 our study area was even more agricultural 52 5 and using a comparable home range estimator nwmn home ranges were 38 larger h ref although we recognize some effects of different sampling intensities as well no previous study that we are aware of measured home ranges of resident bears in a region where the ratio of agriculture to forest was as large as in nwmn 52 17 3 1 as in nearly all home range studies of bears tri 2013 we documented a marked dichotomy in home range size between males and females not only on an annual basis but also at the weekly time scale this is presumably related in part to their polygynous mating system and to their sexual dimorphism and therefore higher caloric requirements male black bears also are known to disperse from natal ranges at 1 3 years old whereas females typically settle near their natal range this propensity to use very large ranges as subadults may equip males with knowledge of the social and physical landscape beyond their eventual breeding ranges and help guide their late summer forays to rich food patches these long distance travels are common for males in northern minnesota and many other black bear populations noyce and garshelis 2014 some of the variation that we observed in this study in whr size and certainly in annual home range that cannot be linked to caloric density is likely explained by year to year and individual differences in whether and how far bears travelled on these distinct seasonal forays outside their typical summer ranges the difference between sexes in range size may be exacerbated in strongly human influenced landscapes male bears in this study appeared to be more risk tolerant than females and thus more likely to exploit human related food sources and travel across open gaps between patches of food and cover males have been shown to traverse and forage at the edges of geographic ranges kojola and heikkinen 2006 kovach and powell 2003 swenson et al 1998 urban areas baruch mordo et al 2014 beckmann and berger 2003 agricultural fields ditmer et al 2016 maddrey and pelton 1995 and near roadways mccown et al 2004 more often than females and may be more innately inclined to test novel food sources ditmer et al 2015a black bears are known to be energy maximizers exploiting concentrations of natural forage and seeking out calorically dense consumable crops as soon as they are available these crop fields offer a greatly condensed source of calories during pre denning hyperphagia when bears are attempting to rapidly gain mass crop fields in our study area were often adjacent to small woodlots and were typically far from high levels of human activity once settled in a cropfield weekly home ranges of bears in this study sharply contracted as both food and cover requirements were satisfied within a very small area using implanted heart monitors to gauge the physiological response of bears in this region we previously found that many male bears showed little indication of being stressed or at heightened alertness when they were feeding on crops ditmer et al 2015b in essence male bears appeared to be high grading the landscape selecting for the most abundant and spatially condensed food sources just as they apparently do when feeding within the smaller scale of a berry patch welch et al 1997 females are known to similarly seek abundant and condensed food sources noyce and garshelis 2010 but we found that in this region they were less likely than males to make use of agricultural crops ditmer et al 2016 female home ranges were generally smaller more connected to natural habitat and had less dense but also less spatially variable food resources elsewhere mitchell and powell 2007 reported that female black bear home ranges in north carolina contained higher average food availability than areas immediately adjacent but were not configured to maximize forage availability possibly due to social exclusion from the most calorie rich food sources by males crop fields in our study area were often used by multiple bears a situation that females often avoid especially if adult males are present we found that there is not a simple relationship between home range size and habitat quality at least not at long temporal scales i e large annual home ranges did not have lower caloric availability at short temporal scales some studies have linked home range size with habitat quality or caloric availability dahle and swenson 2003 koehler and pierce 2003 moyer et al 2007 samson and huot 1998 but without gps collars they could only view the ranges annually or seasonally our ability to examine home ranges on a weekly scale enabled us to perceive how bears honed in on areas of high caloric availability thus reducing space use requirements on short time scales however because these patches of high caloric abundance were spread out across a landscape with embedded areas of very poor habitat home range sizes of bears ballooned dramatically when viewed over longer periods of time bear home range size exhibited strong seasonal associations with habitats that varied in forage availability through the year for example whereas a good acorn crop in the fall enabled bears with access to oak habitat to focus on relatively small areas the springtime ranges of these bears were relatively large due to a lack of food in oak forests at that time of year we had not anticipated the strong negative association between whrs and lowland deciduous shrubs our food surveys indicated that these areas were highly variable in terms of bear food production i e some shrub areas had a great abundance of food while others had none so it appears that bears employed their keen sense of smell to efficiently find dense patch level resources when they ripened 4 2 potential for geographic range expansion we used these data on home range characteristics to surmise the seasonal habitat requirements of bears and thereby generate maps of suitable habitat these maps delineated the ecological and geographical limits for this population and illustrated the seasonality of the habitability of areas to the west of current bear range in this region although habitat suitability declines precipitously to the west of the current distribution suggesting that the potential for expansion is limited we found that during optimal food conditions bears of both sexes could be enticed into the red river valley at the border of mn and nd and from there farther west into nd figs 5 and 6 such expansion could be supported by periodic immigration during years or seasons with favorable food conditions although during unfavorable times these bears might leave or switch to mainly human related sources of food the natural foods on which bears in minnesota rely are remarkably variable from month to month and year to year noyce and coy 1990 this variability creates an environment that is ever changing and uncertain different combinations and concentrations of fruit are available at any given time and the location of highest resource availability is constantly shifting within a bear s home range black bears exploit this variability through a diverse and adaptable diet so they are not too reliant on any one food type garshelis and noyce 2007 anthropogenic food sources in an agricultural landscape provide a hedge against the variability of wild foods and the periodic food failures that can occur on one hand government agencies have made efforts to reduce bears access to human related foods in order to reduce human bear conflicts baruch mordo et al 2011 hopkins et al 2014 conversely recent changes in agricultural technology coupled with climate change have enabled farmers to plant corn at higher latitudes coinciding with more abundant bear populations malcolm et al 2012 stowell and willging 1991 associated an expansion in the wisconsin bear range with the arrival of corn to areas of the state where it had previously not been climatically or economically suited our results showed that anthropogenic food sources altered bear space use enhanced habitat suitability and increased the extent of suitable habitat along the current periphery of the geographic range importantly though we found that even without crops this area had sufficient natural foods to support a bear population this finding based on our habitat modeling is consistent with our observations that females in this area had the highest reproductive rate in mn garshelis et al 2011 even if they did not consume crops indeed the majority of bears in this region had diets comprised of 30 crops ditmer et al 2016 the fragmented forests and shrublands in this region are clearly productive in terms of natural bear foods ironically productivity was likely enhanced by agricultural fragmentation of this landscape as it resulted in forest blocks with a high proportion of edge edge habitats receive more sunlight than stand interiors and thereby tend to produce higher fruit yields in soft mast producing species e g chokecherries and raspberries brodeur et al 2008 our habitat modeling suggests that the edge of suitable bear range for males in nwmn expands westward from spring to summer to fall commensurate with seasonally increasing food availability the extent of suitable habitat for female bears was closely linked to changes in natural fruit availability females also appeared to be more constrained to forested areas males have a much farther potential westward expansion because they more readily utilize crops and also more readily travel across non forested expanses or within narrow riparian corridors of forest so narrow so as to be coded as unsuitable habitat based on our gis layers scheick and mccown 2014 see fig 2 indeed recently the minnesota department of natural resources 2018 citizen science bear sighting website unpublished data compiled several bear sightings along the red river and into nd https dnr state mn us hunting bear bear sightings html presently there is little natural summer food for bears in this region so even if drawn there by fall foods fig 6 most might not stay transient bears who visit this area are likely to be young male bears who exhibit a greater willingness for risk taking nellemann et al 2007 and dietary flexibility ditmer et al 2016 and may use the most marginal habitats because they have been excluded elsewhere by larger bears klenner 1987 the amount of natural cover is unlikely to increase in the intensively farmed regions along the western portion of our study area therefore the likelihood of female expansion is low because they rarely use areas with 10 natural cover it is possible some females might be enticed westward by favorable seasonal food conditions but it is unclear whether any would settle there however we expect males to more regularly explore these highly atypical bear habitats especially if bear density to the east increases and corn production continues to increase while this far western edge may never represent breeding range for the population locations where only males move are still pertinent to note from a management perspective for a number of reasons especially bear human conflicts studies of re colonizing black bears in missouri u s a hiller et al 2015 and new york u s a sun et al 2017 also found that bears were able to utilize diverse heterogenous landscapes and thrive in areas that were once considered unlikely to support a bear population due to a lack of natural habitat and a high degree of human presence 5 conclusions we used remotely sensed data and combined it with biological information to understand how bears are able to thrive in a region that was once considered secondary or poor bear habitat gps collar technology allowed us to sample the locations of bears at high enough frequency to discern the compositional requirements of short term home ranges this in turn provided the basis for grading habitat suitability which enabled us to demarcate the western edge of the eastern population of american black bears under different resource availability scenarios given the changing nature of today s climate and landscape understanding how why and how much a species range may expand or contract is important for both management and conservation planning one caveat important to note is that our projections were necessarily based on the habits of bears living within the current range those bears already had much larger home ranges than bears living in continuously forested environments and we suppose given the evident adaptability of this species that some bears could find new ways of living in the unoccupied landscape that today seems only marginally suitable contributions dg and kn designed the study

25196,determining habitat requirements for the persistence of a wildlife population is especially difficult for wide ranging opportunist species the american black bear ursus americanus is one such species that is re colonizing parts of its former range and colonizing new geographic regions we sought to predict the potential for further westward expansion of a population of black bears that has recently colonized a primarily agricultural 50 landscape with small fragmented islands of forest 17 at the edge of its range in northwestern minnesota we delineated critical aspects of bears spatial ecology by examining size and habitat composition of home ranges of gps collared individuals n 38 75 bear years 2007 2013 at both annual and weekly temporal scales we measured food production by habitat type and used a moving window equivalent to a weekly home range whr to quantify and map habitat suitability across the region considering temporal variations in observed natural forage

home ranges 95 kde h ref x 91 km2 95 ci 55 128 km2 summer and fall whrs contracted when they included higher percentages of oak forest or crop cover key foods and expanded with a higher density of roads and higher percentage of non consumable agriculture and wetlands i e unused areas embedded in the home range caloric density had the strongest negative influence on whr size we predict males can expand farther westward by virtue of their adaptable sprawling home ranges that can encompass an array of resources and their inclination to tolerate and exploit landscapes with few other bears and patchy vegetative cover embedded with agriculture roads and people females are more limited to woodlots with natural foods and less apt to be located in open treeless expanses however we observed wide year to year variations in food production and found that during the most favorable conditions females could be enticed farther westward although it is unclear whether they would settle in an environment with even less tree cover than in the current extremity of their range keywords home range agriculture bears movement ecology caloric mapping range expansion 1 introduction understanding species range limits is critical for wildlife management and conservation planning range limits are fluid gaston 2003 and may expand or contract with changes in demography swenson et al 1998 behavior holt and barfield 2009 weather and climate parmesan 2006 human tolerance oakleaf et al 2006 mobility tinner and lotter 2006 and habitat quality proctor et al 2005 animals living at the edge of their range can yield important insights into the requisites for species persistence pe er et al 2014 it was previously assumed or reasoned that animals living at the periphery of their range i e at the edge of suitable habitat must suffer reduced fitness sexton et al 2009 however studies show that even where the margins of primary range recede into fragmented habitat patches individuals can thrive if habitat quality within the patches remains high mortelliti et al 2010 sexton et al 2009 but if resources are too spatially dispersed metabolic costs of travelling between patches of food could preclude animals from inhabiting the area thereby limiting the species geographic range ecologists have long grappled with understanding species distributional range limits mostly as a matter of scientific inquiry more recently with recognition that many species ranges are visibly shrinking or expanding in response to rapid alterations of habitat or changes in the animals abundance the understanding and forecasting of range limits has undergone a resurgence in interest on a more pragmatic level loarie et al 2009 sexton et al 2009 the american black bear ursus americanus hereinafter black bear represents a species whose geographic range has been rapidly expanding recolonizing many parts of their former range in the united states due to their increasing numbers and adaptability to various human modified e g agricultural or urban landscapes don carlos et al 2009 garshelis et al 2016 hiller et al 2015 karelus et al 2016 scheick and mccown 2014 sun et al 2017 however their expanding range has oftentimes led to increasing conflict with humans wilton et al 2014 thus their range expansion leads directly to management issues as such this species represents an interesting and practical subject for an investigation of species range limits the edge of a species range may be demarcated by a reduction in resource availability that is at some point along a gradient of resource availability a population can no longer be supported home range size may be one indicator of resource availability fieberg and börger 2012 mitchell and powell 2012 home range sizes of black bears vary dramatically across their north american range tri 2013 increasing at higher latitudes and decreasing in areas with higher vegetative diversity and caloric availability gompper and gittleman 1991 moyer et al 2007 smith and pelton 1990 indicating that this species may accommodate diminished resource availability through expansion of the home range within a population fluctuations in phenology and mast availability can have large effects on habitat use of bears and hence affect their home ranges at short time scales garshelis and pelton 1981 noyce and garshelis 2010 male bears have larger home ranges than females and males tend to exhibit a weaker relationship between home range size and habitat productivity koehler and pierce 2003 female bears with cubs of the year often have smaller home ranges than females without cubs in the same population despite their higher metabolic requirements likely due to the limited mobility of cubs and time spent caring for them alt et al 1980 blanchard and knight 1991 reynolds and beecham 1980 other behavioral differences between demographic groups may also affect home range size e g males are known to dominate areas of highly valued food resources garshelis and pelton 1981 powell et al 1997 and exhibit higher risk tolerance than females including more road crossings and foraging near people baruch mordo et al 2014 beckmann and berger 2003 hence in an expanding bear population males are more likely to first colonize new areas jerina and adamič 2008 for a population to expand individual bears must settle outside the current range meaning that these colonizing bears must establish home ranges where few or no other bears live in doing so they may find unexploited resources but if these resources are patchy and widely spaced bears may need to travel more expending more energy and entailing more risks such as crossing roads or encountering people beringer et al 1990 lewis et al 2011 morales et al 2005 lewis et al 2011 van manen et al 2012 resulting in higher rates of mortality baruch mordo et al 2008 evans et al 2014 yet these same human modified landscapes may also offer the allure of highly concentrated foods in the forms of rich berry patches associated with habitat edges created by fragmentation hellgren et al 1991 romain 1996 as well as human related sources of food such as garbage

minnesota nwmn provides an interesting case study of the interplay between anthropogenic foods and patchy natural bear habitat on space use patterns and colonization by black bears here the expansive forests of the upper midwestern united states fade into largely open areas of agricultural production interspersed with smaller and smaller woodlots this marks the current westward limit of the distribution of black bears in the eastern united states the great plains constitute a large gap between the black bears of the eastern and western u s scheick and mccown 2014 this gap was historically occupied by black bears at low density and primarily in wooded riparian corridors based on sightings by the lewis and clark expedition 1804 1806 laliberte and ripple 2003 recent harvest records and sightings indicate that bears in nwmn have been expanding westward especially during the past two decades minnesota department of natural resources unpublished data before the landscape became dominated by agriculture black bears were reportedly common in this area bailey 1926 but for many decades they were considered rare expansion into this region was unanticipated as the habitat is atypical of the forested areas occupied by bears elsewhere in minnesota our principal objective was to better understand the suitability of habitat for bears in this region and to predict the westward limit of this expansion to predict future range expansion we examined the habitat needs of bears within home ranges near the current edge of the range and then compared this to habitat availability west range 40 70 km of the current distributional edge past records of bear expansion in minnesota indicated that males inhabited areas first later followed by females because males are more exploratory and wide ranging we measured caloric density of foods on the landscape and assumed that some threshold existed below which bears would not be attracted to the area or could not exist there long term as a second related objective of the study we tested the hypothesis that as gaps between patches of food and cover increased bears would use increasingly larger areas we predicted that eventually the average density of calories would become too low and or the distances between food patches too great to support a bear because it would need to expend too much energy to travel between patches we used information gleaned from the movement patterns of gps collared bears coupled with gis habitat analysis and field assessments of habitat specific food availability to model and map habitat suitability under yearly varying food conditions for bears across the nwmn landscape we examined the degree to which the nutritional landscape explains patterns of habitation by bears at the current edge of their distribution identified factors that influence the edge of habitable landscape and assessed the ecological and geographical limits of this expanding population 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our primary study area centered near the town of middle river 48 43 n 96 16 w minnesota included marshall kittson roseau polk beltrami red lake and pennington counties approximately 10 000 km2 this area includes the current westward distribution of bears in minnesota we included additional areas outside the primary study area for forecasting future bear range

uncommon throughout the region 4 of the landscape was classified as developed road density averaged 0 6 km per km2 but most roads were secondary unpaved roads used for agriculture forest cover 17 of the study area was dominated by aspen parklands typically aspen white birch populus tremuloides betula papyrifera areal coverage 12 9 and bur oak forests quercus macrocarpa 3 6 areal coverage common bear foods in both forest types included soft mast some ripening in early july including juneberry amelanchier humilis chokecherry prunus virginiana and gray and red osier dogwood cornus racemosa cornus sericea and hard mast including american and beaked hazel corylus americana corylus cornuta aspen parklands also commonly contained raspberry rubus strigosus arrowwood viburnum dentatum and sarsaparilla aralia nudicaulis in the herbaceous layer bur oak forests also provided abundant forage from hawthorn crataegus spp wild plum prunus americana and acorns starting in early september other natural non forested habitats included lowland deciduous shrub llds 11 5 areal coverage wetlands 11 2 and grasslands 7 4 llds was composed mainly of willow salix spp and alder alnus spp primary fruiting species included red osier dogwood cornus sericea high bush cranberry viburnum trilobum and alder leaved buckthorn rhamnus alnifolia wetlands contained some spring vegetation consumed by bears such as sedges cyperaceae and horsetail equisetem grasslands were a mix of conservation reserve program land temporarily fallow fields or remnant prairie estimates of areal coverage for non crop layers were derived from the us geological survey us geological survey 2011 and crop coverage estimates were obtained through the usda s national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 prior to the mid 1990s the minnesota department of natural resources considered the primary study area secondary bear range due to the lack of bear habitat and low bear density compared to the more forested parts of the state in 1995 bear abundance in the region increased dramatically when bears moved into the area while seeking alternative foods during a statewide natural food failure since this initial influx nwmn has supported a significant and growing bear population garshelis et al 2010 2 2 study design we employed a modelling approach to combine data on bear movements habitat composition within home ranges food availability by habitat and year to year variation in food abundance to create a series of maps of habitat suitability by season we interpreted the far western edge of suitable habitat to be the distributional range limit we captured a sample of bears near the current western range limit and used gps collars to delineate weekly home ranges whr and the proportions of different habitats within these whrs we surveyed bear foods on plots in different habitats near the current western range limit to estimate seasonal and habitat specific caloric availability and from that derived average caloric density kcal m2 across the landscape we created a model to investigate how caloric density and other factors were related to whr size we used a moving window equal in size to the median seasonal whr to examine the sex specific suitability of habitat across the landscape in parcels of the size that bears would require for a week we then mapped suitability both within the range currently occupied by both males and breeding females and farther west where only a few collared males have dispersed and a limited number of bears have been observed scheick and mccown 2014 to gauge the prospects for and limits on future expansion 2 3 bear capture and collaring from may to july 2007 2011 we captured black bears using baited barrel traps we set traps in the most western patches of forest that appeared large enough to attract a bear captured bears were immobilized with a combination of ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine or premixed tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam telazol elkins sinn cherry hill nj usa we fit all adult bears with either gps store on board collars telemetry solutions concord ca usa lotek wireless inc newmarket ontario canada advanced telemetry systems isanti mn usa or gps iridium satellite collars vectronic aerospace berlin germany we programmed gps collars to attempt fixes once every 1 6 h during the non denning seasons dependent on the collar type and battery life we programmed low intensity fix schedules every 6 h to save battery life in late fall or early spring when pre or post denning bears were relatively sedentary we increased the sampling rate during fall on some collars to capture agricultural foraging at a finer scale we assigned each bear a unique identification number bearid and attached numbered plastic ear tags we downloaded gps data each winter december march 2007 2013 after anesthetizing collared bears in winter dens using telazol we classified females as being with cubs typically born in january if cubs were present in the den in march all animal handling was approved by the university of minnesota s institutional animal care and use committees permit no 1002a77516 2 4 home range estimates to delineate weekly home ranges whr we assigned each location to a week of the year and excluded locations that were associated with weeks 1 during which the bear was denning 2 occurring before may 1 or after dec 1 3 that did not include fixes covering at least 6 of the 7 days or 4 with 21 successful fixes 3 fixes per day we delineated whr areas using kernel density estimators with the rule based approach and the ad hoc method for selecting a bandwith as suggested by kie 2013 the ad hoc method iteratively uses decreasing scaling values 1 0 0 95 0 9 decreasing by 0 1 thereafter multiplied by the estimated href value a smoothing parameter for the kernel density estimator determined by the reference bandwidth method the home range is taken to be the area of the isopleth having the lowest scaling value that did not cause the calculated polygon to fracture into non contiguous polygons if the home range fractured during the first iteration in our analysis it occurred in 50 of annual home ranges we used a scaling value of 1 0 which is equal to the reference bandwidth method thirty percent of whrs fractured into multiple polygons in the first iteration when using a scaling value of 1 0 for h we were primarily interested in quantifying changes in home range size or composition over time assuming that any bias from the estimator remains the same across time these comparisons are typically more robust to estimator choice than absolute estimates of home range size signer et al 2015 for our modeling purposes we used a 90 isopleth because börger et al 2006 found it resulted in greater precision and statistical power than a 95 isopleth for comparing home range sizes among individuals or within individuals across time additionally we used kernel density estimators with the reference bandwidth to facilitate comparisons with other studies and reported the 50 and 95 area estimates we estimated annual home range size of each bear for each calendar year in which we obtained gps data points for that bear on at least 120 days during may november when bears were not hibernating we estimated annual home range size by first removing gps locations that were less than 4 h from each previous fix starting with the second fix from each bear year 2 5 landscape covariates for each whr we calculated the proportion of area comprising each of the following eight composite cover types asp aspen dominated forest white birch black ash fraxinus nigra oak bur oak upland shrub wet aquatic and marsh shrub lowland deciduous and coniferous shrubs con conifer forest pine spruce cedar tamarack grass grassland dev developed or agfield agricultural lands excluding those consumed by bears in the region these were derived by grouping major habitat types classified in a gis land cover layer created by the usgs upper midwest gap analysis program us geological survey 2011 using geospatial modeling environment beyer 2012 we added a ninth cover type to represent the cumulative percentage of agricultural crops consumed by bears in this region crop e g corn sunflowers oats barley see ditmer et al 2016 within each home range using annual cover maps created by the usda national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 the raster resolution for all cover type maps was 30 m 30 m which hereafter is called a cell we calculated road density km of road km2 within each whr using a gis shapefile created by the minnesota department of transportation minnesota department of transportation 2013 a second road layer provided vehicle count data for the mean traffic volume of road segments roads that did not have an assigned traffic volume appeared to be secondary roads e g minimal maintenance farm and forestry roads so we assigned them the minimum value recorded for all other road segments 5 vehicles per hour we created a covariate road by multiplying the length of each road segment within each home range by the associated average traffic volume of the road segment 2 6 weather and temporal conditions we calculated weekly averages for ambient temperature cº temp and wind speed mph wind which may influence a bear s ability to smell and access more distant food resources and precipitation cm prec using weather underground http www wunderground com weather station data from a site near the center of the study area gatzke agassiz national wildlife refuge station we created a covariate for day length daylen using package geosphere hijmans 2017 in program r r core team 2018 we used the latitude for middle river in this function and provided the julian date of the first day of each week for the temporal requirement of the calculation we created a categorical covariate for season seas for use in testing seasonal interactions with other covariates we classified weeks 18 25 as spring may 1 july 1 26 36 as summer july 1 sept 1 and 37 49 sep 1 dec 1 as fall 2 7 demographic classification bear age age was estimated from annuli in the root of a first upper premolar coy and garshelis 1992 or was known for bears first observed as cubs we created a categorical variable for sex sex and a binary variable to distinguish females with cubs of the year coy 1 from those with yearlings or no offspring coy 0 2 8 seasonal availability and caloric density of bear foods by habitat during 2007 2011 we measured abundance of the principal summer and fall bear foods fruits and nuts supplementary table s1 we conducted 253 food surveys mean 51 per year range 28 75 on temporary plots within 125 unique forest stands of four forest types 62 aspen ash birch 29 oak 5 llds 4 coniferous approximately reflecting their relative composition of the forested portion of the landscape using gis we selected survey locations by identifying patches of each cover type that were large enough to fit our 30 m 60 m sample grid see below we spread out the sampled areas from a pool of all habitat patches that were large enough to accommodate our sampling methodology to maximize the spatial coverage across the study area each survey comprised 15 sample plots of 3 m diameter spaced at 15 m intervals five plots were along the open edges of habitat stands along roadways or clearings five were 15 m deep into the stand and five were 30 m into the stand the first point along the edge was chosen prior to arriving at the site using gis software the remaining four edge points were placed at 15 m intervals from there and interior points were perpendicular to each of these in each plot we visually estimated the percent cover of each type of food fruit producing plant and then converted this to area m2 we assigned a subjective fruit production score 0 4 0 no fruit or nuts 4 highest production of fruit to each fruiting species in the plot we converted these production scores to biomass by collecting counting and weighing fruits from smaller subplots 0 25 1 m2 we obtained year specific relationships between fruit production scores and biomass for sets of years with different observers 3 different primary observers over the 5 year sampling period we multiplied estimates of productivity by areal coverage to obtain an estimate of biomass g of each food per area in each survey acorns were sampled differently from other wild bear foods as they were the only bear food in the tree canopy all other fruits were on ground level bushes or small trees we sampled oak stands 9 22 stands per years using plots as in our other fruit sampling surveys but the plots were only 1 m2 within plots we counted all fallen acorns and empty caps and reconstructed the number of acorns that had fallen there we multiplied this by average acorn weight 2 5 g tecklin and mccreary 1991 to obtain biomass per unit area we used bomb calorimetry to estimate caloric content of 13 common species of wild fruits and nuts and the 2 agricultural crops corn and sunflowers most commonly consumed by bears in the region ditmer et al 2016 supplementary table s1 we did not measure the caloric content of 4 less common wild fruits so we assigned them caloric values of similar species supplementary table s1 we estimated the percentage of refuse i e indigestible matter per species sample by weighing samples before and after removing stems cupules shells and sizeable pits we removed moisture by freeze drying or baking at 100 c for at least 24 h supplementary table s1 we crushed the dried samples and used a parr calorimetric thermometer model 1672 parr instrument company moline illinois usa to obtain caloric content per gram dry weight supplementary table s1 we typically ran two replicates of each sample and calculated the standard deviation to ensure samples did not produce significantly different caloric values to estimate a seasonal caloric availability score by habitat we first calculated caloric density calories m2 for each bear food species including acorns in each survey stand by multiplying estimated biomass g m2 by the mean measured calories per gram for that species we separately summed caloric density values for summer and fall species supplementary table s1 to derive season specific total caloric density in each stand different fruits ripened and decayed in different time windows and each survey captured availability at a point in time since surveys were conducted throughout the fruiting period we assumed they represented average available biomass for each species through the season we then calculated the season and year specific mean caloric density for each habitat by separately averaging summer and fall values across survey stands of each type asp oak con llds for each year of the study 2007 2011 we did not sample conifer and llds in all years so we used an average value from the sampled years for those not sampled we did not systematically sample wetlands grasslands or developed areas because we found little or no bear foods in these cover types based on our extensive experience in the region we assigned these habitats zero caloric availability to calculate caloric density for agricultural crops we converted yields reported for nwmn for each crop type during 2011 and 2012 usda 2014 supplementary table s2 to grams per m2 we converted this to calories per m2 using our calorimetry data for corn and sunflowers and values provided by the usda s national nutrient database for standard reference http ndb nal usda gov for barley and oats supplementary table s2 we had no evidence of bears eating substantial amounts of other crops so assigned them a caloric value of zero we calculated a total caloric availability score within each whr by multiplying the percent of each habitat and crop type within the whr times the mean caloric density for the corresponding habitat crop type season and year we divided the total caloric availability within each whr by the size of the whr area to obtain our estimate of average caloric availability per m2 we log transformed the values to create logcal because the distribution was highly right skewed estimates were only available during years that we measured natural caloric availability 2007 2011 of wild foods and could thus assign the appropriate year specific values for each cover type we acknowledge that our sampling methodologies may contain some error that is propagated through to our caloric availability score but we believe the methods enable separation of large differences categories in caloric availability among habitat types without bias 2 9 modeling bear home range size we used linear mixed models with function lme in package nlme of program r pinheiro et al 2017 r core team 2018 to relate the log of whr area to covariates while allowing for repeated measures and within individual temporal autocorrelation specifically we included random intercepts for each unique bear year combination and specified an auto regressive model structure with first order correlation i e ar 1 based on the week number of the year we scaled and centered all numeric covariates schielzeth 2010 but present graphs in original scales we excluded the covariate asp to reduce the collinearity associated with all proportions of habitat types adding up to one within each whr we also removed con because it was uncommon in the region and dev because it was rare within whrs removal of these three landcover types resulted in removing an average of 25 of the areal landcover found within whrs we checked for collinearity among the included covariates using variance inflation factors all covariates 10 we included main effects associated with road density traffic volume road bear age age day length day wind speed wind precipitation precip ambient temperature temp the proportions of each whr that contained agricultural fields with non consumed crop types agfield commonly consumed crop types crop lowland deciduous shrubs llds and wetlands wet we included interactions between the sex of the bear sex and crop and seas with whether the bear was with cubs of the year coy oak and crop each separately we fit a single global model that included all possible factors aside from caloric density that might influence the size of whrs based on our priori hypotheses and evaluated the significance of each covariate and interaction within the model using confidence intervals and p values giudice et al 2012 harrell 2015 we considered p values 0 05 to be significant we quantified effect sizes by generating model based predictions of whr area and 95 confidence intervals based on the range of possible values from a single covariate or interaction while holding all other covariates at their mean values using the effects package in program r fox 2003 r core team 2018 we fit a second model using the same linear mixed effect model structure and functions to quantify the relationship between whr size and caloric density in this model we only included logcal scaled and centered and not habitat variables since logcal was highly dependent on habitat type we tested support for an interaction between logcal and seas using p values and considered the interaction significant at α 0 05 a significant interaction would indicate that the relationship between whr and logcal is significantly different between seasons each model s residuals were checked for normality 2 10 mapping habitat suitability and potential range expansion we created a series of maps in which we assigned a value for relative habitat suitability to each map cell we assumed that bears require a minimum of two components in any landscape to persist for an extended period of time a natural vegetative cover for safety and rest and 2 food resources overall our suitability value was based on a mix of natural cover availability road traffic density more road density and greater traffic volumes reduce natural cover availability and caloric density which combined gis map delineations natural cover and crop availability with our bear food sampling efforts and calorimetry values see supplemental tables s1 and s2 we determined the value of each cell based on the surrounding circular area moving window that was equal in area to that of the median seasonal whr and then used raster math to determine the overall habitat suitability value which we classified based on the distribution of all cell values we developed separate seasonal maps for males and females using values calculated from areas with whrs modeled whr results and well established differences in sex specific behavior females are more risk averse and require more natural cover use of the landscape and caloric needs an overview of the process through which we assigned habit suitability values and geographic range delineation can be found in fig 1 we describe the stepwise process here 2 10 1 step 1 smoothing base maps the suitability of habitat for large mammals cannot be judged at the scale of an individual raster cell on a map rather it reflects the composite make up of a broader landscape thus to create maps where raster values reflected overall habitat suitability for bears we had to consider the landscape composition in a larger area around each cell that was likely to be used by a bear we used the focal statistics tool in arcgis to smooth the data in various map layers such that derived values assigned to each cell raster in the newly created map layers represented the composition of a circular moving window the size of the median season specific whr w h r i i 1 2 n bears males and females separately reasoning that the median whr best reflected the typical area influencing a bear s movements feeding and landscape use over a week long period the first step in building habitat suitability maps was to create smoothed gis layers as described above representing a natural cover and b road density for a the natural cover layer we calculated the percentage of raster cells within the moving window that were considered natural habitat cover all cover types except dev agfield crop we then assigned that value to the focal cell for b the smoothed road density layer we first added spatial buffers around all roads on the gis road layer which reflected traffic volume buffer width m 0 5 the average count of vehicles per day except for roads with no measured traffic volume e g north dakota roads and minimally used roads in nwmn these we buffered to 15 m roads not only have strong influences on bear behaviors machutchon and proctor 2015 and ranges ceia hasse et al 2017 they can also impact the surrounding environment for bears ditmer et al 2018 found bears elicit physiological responses to roads well beyond the immediate roadway which may act to reduce the perceived safety cover of the surrounding habitat the spillover effects of roads e g sights sounds smells into the surrounding environment are likely driven by the traffic volume of a given road segment our whr models also supported this relationship we found a strong positive association between bear home range size and road density traffic volume road see results to incorporate road density and vehicular traffic we used the following procedure as a means of creating a road buffer that essentially reduced the amount of natural vegetative cover available to bears we calculated the percentage of cells in the moving window that contained a road buffer binary 0 cell without road buffer or 1 road buffer present and assigned that value to the focal cell we subtracted this percentage from the percentage of natural habitat cover assigned to that same cell to arrive at a final adjusted cover percent value for the cell in doing so we assumed that areas within road buffers reduced suitable available natural cover for bears but did not necessarily result in an uninhabitable cell 2 10 2 step 2 assigning habitat suitability values to cells spring the next step was to delineate season and sex specific areas of lowest suitability for bears for an area to be considered minimally suitable it had to meet thresholds for both the availability of natural habitat cover and forage within the moving window these thresholds were based on the sex and season specific distributions of values we observed in actual bear whrs we chose the 5th percentile as the cutoff point for suitable habitat because it represented the proportion of cover and caloric availability above which most bears were supported on a weekly basis lower values represented more extreme cases of low food or cover places where a bear might live for a week but that likely would not support a bear for an extended period accordingly cells that fell below the 5th percentile in availability of natural cover adjusted for road traffic buffers were classified as unsuitable quality and considered marginal for bears when creating maps of habitat suitability for the spring season natural cover percent was the only criterion used for assigning habitat quality scores at that time of year bears fed mostly in natural habitats i e not at anthropogenic food sources on foods that we were not able to quantify e g green vegetation ants deer fawns odocoileus virginianus habitat suitability in spring maps was estimated as natural cover within moving window minus of cells in moving window containing the road buffer for j 1 2 n raster cells each raster cell was then assigned as follows 5th percentile for natural cover unsuitable 5th 25th percentile low 25th 50th medium 50th 75th high and 75th 100th very high supplementary table s3 2 10 3 step 3 assigning habitat suitability values to cells summer and fall when creating maps of habitat suitability for summer and fall cells were classified based on natural cover and estimated caloric density as for spring maps each summer and fall map cell first had to meet the season and sex specific requirement for a minimal amount of natural habitat cells initially classified as unsuitable based on natural habitat availability retained that value and were not considered further remaining cells with suitable cover were then assigned a habitat suitability value based on the estimated caloric density of the surrounding area to do this we applied habitat and summer or fall specific caloric density values estimated from our fruit sampling to the appropriate natural cover types on our land cover base map we used the gis crop cover layer from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 to determine the combined areal coverage of corn sunflowers oats and barley and assigned an average caloric value for fall maps to each raster cell associated with a crop field supplementary table s2 we then smoothed the map again using a moving window the size of the median sex and season specific whr cell values for the smoothed caloric layer were derived by summing the total calories associated with all cells within the moving window to each focal cell we assigned a habitat suitability score in summer and fall by first calculating the same score as for spring considering only natural cover and roads if a cell was considered suitable habitat based on these criteria 5th percentile we assessed caloric availability we used the same moving window and again partitioned the data into percentile groupings any cell with caloric density values below the 5th percentile was considered unsuitable and added to those already in this category due to inadequate natural cover based on the requirement for summer and fall supplementary table s3 all other suitability categories were based strictly on calories to capture the wide range of natural variability in foods available to bears from year to year we derived multiple maps of caloric density for each of summer and fall these depicted estimated caloric density under three theoretical scenarios of food availability low medium and high and were based on variation across years that we documented in both wild foods and crops for each respective cover type we assigned values equaling the minimum mean or maximum cover type specific caloric density that we documented during our five years of food sampling table 1 includes estimates of variability among patches for con we used the estimates from the only year of sampling for all theoretical scenarios and used the min max and average of the two years of sampling for llds cover for crops we used the gis crop cover layer from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda 2014 to determine the minimum median and maximum combined areal coverage of corn sunflowers oats and barley for any year sampled 2007 2013 min 1 4 med 1 8 max 3 9 and assigned an average caloric value to each raster cell associated with a crop field in those years supplementary table s2 we assumed the spatial configuration of crop fields to be the same as it was in the year of data collection we combined the natural calorie layers with the corresponding crop calorie layers e g highest natural calorie year combined with highest crop areal coverage year etc and mapped the total caloric availability score of bear foods under different scenarios in creating separate habitat suitability maps for each season each sex and three levels of caloric availability summer and fall only we could see how suitable habitat distribution varied for males and females and how it changed with forage availability we overlaid gps locations of gps collared bears by season on seasonal habitat suitability maps to see how closely they conformed to our map projections of habitable landscape we included the greater study area in habitat suitability maps in order to include areas beyond range 40 70 km the current edge of the range of nwmn black bear population this provided a tool for postulating if and where habitat configuration might favor further colonization by bears both under current conditions or with future changes in habitat and or climate 3 results 3 1 home range size we used 42 552 locations to delineate annual home ranges for 60 bear years n 33 female 27 male of 29 individual bears 14 female 15 male male home ranges were nine times larger than those of females for both the 50 estimates x 95

minimum and maximum values were from different individuals not different bear years from the same individual s see supplementary table s4 for annual home range estimates using different estimators we used 80 441 locations from 38 individual animals 17 female 21 male over 75 bear years n 37 female 38 male to delineate 1453 whrs the mean male whr size average whr size across individuals by week and sex was 129 18 0 se km2 with the maximum in mid august week 33 x 221 5 83 2 km2 and minimum in november week 45 x 41 5 24 1 km2 fig 2 a the mean weekly female whr size was 23 5 4 0 km2 with the maximum during mid june week 24 x 46 5 10 1 km2 and minimum at the end of september week 38 x 8 39 1 6 km2 fig 2b male average whr exceeded female whr for all weeks by an average of 105 5 17 2 km2 the maximum difference between male and female whr size occurred in spring when whrs of males were more than seven times larger than those of females median 86 km2 vs 12 km2 the 95 confidence intervals of male whr size only overlapped those from female whrs as bears prepared to hibernate and restricted their movements to small areas fig 2 during summer and fall sizes of whrs of both female and male bears were negatively associated with the availability of consumable crops fig 3 b c e f but in spring these crops were not ripe so they created a void that caused bears to increase the size of their home range fig 3a d in all seasons whrs increased with increasing cover of non consumable crops agfield table 2 among natural cover types wet had a strong positive association with whr size llds had a negative association and oak had a positive association in spring and a negative association in summer and fall table 2 supplementary fig s1 for females the presence of cubs coy was associated with smaller whr size during spring when the cubs were very young than in summer and fall table 2 increases in road densities and traffic volumes road were associated with increases in whr size table 2 as were periods with higher average ambient temperatures temp and longer day length day table 2 whr size during summer and fall n 645 was negatively associated with caloric density logcal of wild foods and crops table 1 and supplementary tables s1 and s2 β 1 00 se 0 07 t value 14 8 p 0 001 suggesting that bears moved around less each week when there was abundant food the relationship between whr and caloric density did not differ between summer and fall logcal season summer β 0 08 se 0 13 t value 0 62 p 0 54 although logcal was the only covariate in this model the estimated β was larger than any regression parameter in the first model 3 2 habitat suitability and potential distribution in spring the 5th percentile value for percent natural cover in whrs was 5 for males and 10 for females suggesting that males tolerated a more open landscape than females supplementary table 3 we used these values as thresholds below which habitat was considered unsuitable that is fewer than 5 of bears chose to inhabit such areas based solely on this criterion to derive separate habitat quality maps for males and females we found that 46 of the greater study area was considered the least habitable category for males 46 of cells were classified as very poor because there was 5 natural cover present in a surrounding circle the size of the median male whr and 54 were in this category for females fig 4 and supplementary fig s2 because habitat quality classifications in spring were directly related only to natural habitat cover the proportion of the landscape that was classified as high suitability 50th 75th quantile or very high above the 75th quantile was similar for males and females 27 for both fig 4 despite the large difference in male and female whr size in summer and fall habitat suitability reflected the caloric density of bear foods present both in natural habitats and crop fields year to year variation in nut berry and crop production captured in our analysis by preparing habitat quality maps for multiple food abundance scenarios had a larger impact on females in terms of the proportion of the landscape that was mapped as suitable than it did on males figs 5 and 6 all summer and fall scenarios for males resulted in 60 of the greater study area being classified as suitable poor very good fig 4 in contrast for females the proportion classified as suitable ranged from 35 to 51 across the different scenarios figs 5 and 6 however the proportion of habitat classified as either high or very high quality fluctuated similarly for males 2 49 and females 1 30 fig 4 the difference between the seasonal responses of the sexes was due in part to an increase in the median whr for females between spring 12 km2 and summer 17 km2 i e a larger moving window with which to classify the suitability of the landscape for summer than for spring and a decrease in whr size for males 86 km2 in spring vs 64 km2 in summer supplementary table 3 overall male bears required relatively more calories for an area to be considered habitable during summer 5th quantile in supplementary table 3 but their larger ranges and corresponding larger moving window coupled with the lower threshold for minimal natural cover supplementary table 3 met the caloric and natural cover requirements more consistently as a result the areas deemed habitable for males varied less across caloric scenarios relative to females fig 4 while the overall habitable area during fall was similar to summer for males the area expanded for females especially during the high calorie scenario fig 4 again females exhibited more variability in habitable areas with varying food resource availability range 49 56 compared to males range 59 61 figs 4 and 6 during good fall food conditions the highest ranked habitat suitability categories high and very high increased in area by 20 30 relative to poor food years for both males and females figs 4 and 6 bears caloric needs are greatest during fall and caloric density on the landscape was also greatest supplementary table 3 largely due to the availability of crops and nuts especially in asp and oak habitats table 1 accordingly both sexes had the smallest whrs in fall fig 2 and supplementary table 3 the extensive use of crop fields by males resulted in their lowest natural cover requirement of the year creating usable habitat in significant portions of far western minnesota within the red river valley marking the border with north dakota and even several locations in north dakota with adequate sized patches of natural cover near consumable crops fig 6 supplementary fig s3 caloric scenario maps suggested that crop availability mitigates years of poor natural food forage even when natural foods failed high and medium quality habitat quality remained as long as crops were available however they decreased or vanished in the western portions of the greater study area when crop availability was low figs 5a and d and 6 a and d bears were located in areas designated as suitable habitat in 96 9 of all gps locations n 80 230 this varied little in spring and summer during fall only 29 of 16 016 0 02 locations of female bears were located in the unsuitable habitat designation whereas males were found there more often 5 2 of 15 712 locations however 51 of fall male locations that occurred outside of suitable habitat were those of a single 2 year old individual that spent a large percentage of time in a crop field along the mn nd border male bears not only used the western portions of the landscape where there was little natural cover for foraging they also on occasion made use of tiny fragments of natural vegetation and open fields for hibernation fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effects of habitat on home range black bears in nwmn responded to the fragmented and agricultural landscape as we predicted agricultural areas that were not used for forage by bears were perceived as gaps that increased the space between patches of usable resources by examining home ranges at a weekly time scale we determined which attributes were associated with an increase e g agricultural land and roads or decrease e g care of cubs availability of crops eaten by bears oak habitat in space use bears in nwmn moved across a matrix of agricultural land in search of patches of natural habitat throughout the spring but many of them mainly males then sought out crop fields which began to mature in late summer and fall these extensive movements in search of crop fields resulted in the largest annual home range sizes for male american black bears ever reported annual home range estimates for female bears were also some of the largest recorded for the species more due to the fragmented nature of natural forest patches than to the allure of crop fields ditmer et al 2016 only three previous studies of this species from a compilation of 187 studies tri 2013 reported average home range sizes 500 km2 carter et al 2010 hechtel 1991 unger 2007 the second largest estimate was reported in the lower peninsula of michigan 606 km2 carter et al 2010 which was also a habitat fragmented by agriculture areal coverage 15 our study area was even more agricultural 52 5 and using a comparable home range estimator nwmn home ranges were 38 larger h ref although we recognize some effects of different sampling intensities as well no previous study that we are aware of measured home ranges of resident bears in a region where the ratio of agriculture to forest was as large as in nwmn 52 17 3 1 as in nearly all home range studies of bears tri 2013 we documented a marked dichotomy in home range size between males and females not only on an annual basis but also at the weekly time scale this is presumably related in part to their polygynous mating system and to their sexual dimorphism and therefore higher caloric requirements male black bears also are known to disperse from natal ranges at 1 3 years old whereas females typically settle near their natal range this propensity to use very large ranges as subadults may equip males with knowledge of the social and physical landscape beyond their eventual breeding ranges and help guide their late summer forays to rich food patches these long distance travels are common for males in northern minnesota and many other black bear populations noyce and garshelis 2014 some of the variation that we observed in this study in whr size and certainly in annual home range that cannot be linked to caloric density is likely explained by year to year and individual differences in whether and how far bears travelled on these distinct seasonal forays outside their typical summer ranges the difference between sexes in range size may be exacerbated in strongly human influenced landscapes male bears in this study appeared to be more risk tolerant than females and thus more likely to exploit human related food sources and travel across open gaps between patches of food and cover males have been shown to traverse and forage at the edges of geographic ranges kojola and heikkinen 2006 kovach and powell 2003 swenson et al 1998 urban areas baruch mordo et al 2014 beckmann and berger 2003 agricultural fields ditmer et al 2016 maddrey and pelton 1995 and near roadways mccown et al 2004 more often than females and may be more innately inclined to test novel food sources ditmer et al 2015a black bears are known to be energy maximizers exploiting concentrations of natural forage and seeking out calorically dense consumable crops as soon as they are available these crop fields offer a greatly condensed source of calories during pre denning hyperphagia when bears are attempting to rapidly gain mass crop fields in our study area were often adjacent to small woodlots and were typically far from high levels of human activity once settled in a cropfield weekly home ranges of bears in this study sharply contracted as both food and cover requirements were satisfied within a very small area using implanted heart monitors to gauge the physiological response of bears in this region we previously found that many male bears showed little indication of being stressed or at heightened alertness when they were feeding on crops ditmer et al 2015b in essence male bears appeared to be high grading the landscape selecting for the most abundant and spatially condensed food sources just as they apparently do when feeding within the smaller scale of a berry patch welch et al 1997 females are known to similarly seek abundant and condensed food sources noyce and garshelis 2010 but we found that in this region they were less likely than males to make use of agricultural crops ditmer et al 2016 female home ranges were generally smaller more connected to natural habitat and had less dense but also less spatially variable food resources elsewhere mitchell and powell 2007 reported that female black bear home ranges in north carolina contained higher average food availability than areas immediately adjacent but were not configured to maximize forage availability possibly due to social exclusion from the most calorie rich food sources by males crop fields in our study area were often used by multiple bears a situation that females often avoid especially if adult males are present we found that there is not a simple relationship between home range size and habitat quality at least not at long temporal scales i e large annual home ranges did not have lower caloric availability at short temporal scales some studies have linked home range size with habitat quality or caloric availability dahle and swenson 2003 koehler and pierce 2003 moyer et al 2007 samson and huot 1998 but without gps collars they could only view the ranges annually or seasonally our ability to examine home ranges on a weekly scale enabled us to perceive how bears honed in on areas of high caloric availability thus reducing space use requirements on short time scales however because these patches of high caloric abundance were spread out across a landscape with embedded areas of very poor habitat home range sizes of bears ballooned dramatically when viewed over longer periods of time bear home range size exhibited strong seasonal associations with habitats that varied in forage availability through the year for example whereas a good acorn crop in the fall enabled bears with access to oak habitat to focus on relatively small areas the springtime ranges of these bears were relatively large due to a lack of food in oak forests at that time of year we had not anticipated the strong negative association between whrs and lowland deciduous shrubs our food surveys indicated that these areas were highly variable in terms of bear food production i e some shrub areas had a great abundance of food while others had none so it appears that bears employed their keen sense of smell to efficiently find dense patch level resources when they ripened 4 2 potential for geographic range expansion we used these data on home range characteristics to surmise the seasonal habitat requirements of bears and thereby generate maps of suitable habitat these maps delineated the ecological and geographical limits for this population and illustrated the seasonality of the habitability of areas to the west of current bear range in this region although habitat suitability declines precipitously to the west of the current distribution suggesting that the potential for expansion is limited we found that during optimal food conditions bears of both sexes could be enticed into the red river valley at the border of mn and nd and from there farther west into nd figs 5 and 6 such expansion could be supported by periodic immigration during years or seasons with favorable food conditions although during unfavorable times these bears might leave or switch to mainly human related sources of food the natural foods on which bears in minnesota rely are remarkably variable from month to month and year to year noyce and coy 1990 this variability creates an environment that is ever changing and uncertain different combinations and concentrations of fruit are available at any given time and the location of highest resource availability is constantly shifting within a bear s home range black bears exploit this variability through a diverse and adaptable diet so they are not too reliant on any one food type garshelis and noyce 2007 anthropogenic food sources in an agricultural landscape provide a hedge against the variability of wild foods and the periodic food failures that can occur on one hand government agencies have made efforts to reduce bears access to human related foods in order to reduce human bear conflicts baruch mordo et al 2011 hopkins et al 2014 conversely recent changes in agricultural technology coupled with climate change have enabled farmers to plant corn at higher latitudes coinciding with more abundant bear populations malcolm et al 2012 stowell and willging 1991 associated an expansion in the wisconsin bear range with the arrival of corn to areas of the state where it had previously not been climatically or economically suited our results showed that anthropogenic food sources altered bear space use enhanced habitat suitability and increased the extent of suitable habitat along the current periphery of the geographic range importantly though we found that even without crops this area had sufficient natural foods to support a bear population this finding based on our habitat modeling is consistent with our observations that females in this area had the highest reproductive rate in mn garshelis et al 2011 even if they did not consume crops indeed the majority of bears in this region had diets comprised of 30 crops ditmer et al 2016 the fragmented forests and shrublands in this region are clearly productive in terms of natural bear foods ironically productivity was likely enhanced by agricultural fragmentation of this landscape as it resulted in forest blocks with a high proportion of edge edge habitats receive more sunlight than stand interiors and thereby tend to produce higher fruit yields in soft mast producing species e g chokecherries and raspberries brodeur et al 2008 our habitat modeling suggests that the edge of suitable bear range for males in nwmn expands westward from spring to summer to fall commensurate with seasonally increasing food availability the extent of suitable habitat for female bears was closely linked to changes in natural fruit availability females also appeared to be more constrained to forested areas males have a much farther potential westward expansion because they more readily utilize crops and also more readily travel across non forested expanses or within narrow riparian corridors of forest so narrow so as to be coded as unsuitable habitat based on our gis layers scheick and mccown 2014 see fig 2 indeed recently the minnesota department of natural resources 2018 citizen science bear sighting website unpublished data compiled several bear sightings along the red river and into nd https dnr state mn us hunting bear bear sightings html presently there is little natural summer food for bears in this region so even if drawn there by fall foods fig 6 most might not stay transient bears who visit this area are likely to be young male bears who exhibit a greater willingness for risk taking nellemann et al 2007 and dietary flexibility ditmer et al 2016 and may use the most marginal habitats because they have been excluded elsewhere by larger bears klenner 1987 the amount of natural cover is unlikely to increase in the intensively farmed regions along the western portion of our study area therefore the likelihood of female expansion is low because they rarely use areas with 10 natural cover it is possible some females might be enticed westward by favorable seasonal food conditions but it is unclear whether any would settle there however we expect males to more regularly explore these highly atypical bear habitats especially if bear density to the east increases and corn production continues to increase while this far western edge may never represent breeding range for the population locations where only males move are still pertinent to note from a management perspective for a number of reasons especially bear human conflicts studies of re colonizing black bears in missouri u s a hiller et al 2015 and new york u s a sun et al 2017 also found that bears were able to utilize diverse heterogenous landscapes and thrive in areas that were once considered unlikely to support a bear population due to a lack of natural habitat and a high degree of human presence 5 conclusions we used remotely sensed data and combined it with biological information to understand how bears are able to thrive in a region that was once considered secondary or poor bear habitat gps collar technology allowed us to sample the locations of bears at high enough frequency to discern the compositional requirements of short term home ranges this in turn provided the basis for grading habitat suitability which enabled us to demarcate the western edge of the eastern population of american black bears under different resource availability scenarios given the changing nature of today s climate and landscape understanding how why and how much a species range may expand or contract is important for both management and conservation planning one caveat important to note is that our projections were necessarily based on the habits of bears living within the current range those bears already had much larger home ranges than bears living in continuously forested environments and we suppose given the evident adaptability of this species that some bears could find new ways of living in the unoccupied landscape that today seems only marginally suitable contributions dg and kn designed the study

25197,this study i presents a coupled vegetation soil model adapted to perennial c4 seasonally flooded semi arid grasslands and ii applies the model to evaluate changes in the annual productivity of the grasslands of the tana river delta kenya under changing flooding conditions main plant growth processes are modelled within coupled plant carbon balance and soil water budget modules photosynthesis allocation of photosynthates respiration translocation of root phytomass to aerial phytomass senescence and litter production aerial phytomass can also be subtracted from the system to simulate grazing or cutting new features concern the inclusion of effects of floods on energy conversion efficiency photosynthate allocation senescence and litter production the vegetation model composed of four phytomass compartments leaves stems roots aerial dead matter simulates three main growth phases related to flooding floods a post flood phase and a non flooded phase it was designed to be used with limited climatic data data collected during a 14 month experiment 2010 2012 in the tana river delta kenya in which different irrigation and cutting treatments and flood events were recorded were used for calibration and validation purposes fourteen parameters selected through a sensitivity analysis were calibrated on half of these treatments uncertainty in parameter estimation was expressed through a stochastic ensemble of simulations the remaining independent data were used for model validation overall the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data this model can be used to assess the impact of rain variability grazing or flooding patterns on the annual primary productivity of sub saharan floodplain grasslands composed mainly of echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv in particular simulations for the tana river delta suggest that past changes in the hydrological regime of the river as well as future changes due to the construction of hydroelectric infrastructure have led and will certainly lead to an important decrease of the floodplain grassland productivity as local and regional livestock keeping activities rely heavily on the dry seasons grazing resources available within the wetland future development plans should seriously consider the negative effects of these changes on local activities and livelihoods keywords echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv tana river delta kenya plant growth model 1 introduction 1 1 floodplain grasslands echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv commonly called burgu grass in west africa is a poaceae found in the floodplains of many rivers in sub saharan africa such as the inner delta of the niger river the chad lake the sudd marshes or the delta of the tana river in kenya this species has adapted to alternating floods and harsh dry conditions in areas where potential evaporation can exceed 2200 mm year 1 at malindi kenya woodhead 1968 through physiological modifications this species thrives in floods which can exceed four meters in height and last over six months hiernaux and diarra 1986 françois et al 1989 under such conditions e stagnina has been shown to have extremely high productivities of up to 250 kg ha 1 day 1 hiernaux and diarra 1986 the alternating flooded and non flooded conditions make these floodplain grasslands important ecosystems in the sub saharan context on the one hand they form important spawning zones for freshwater fish during the flooded season thus supporting small holder fishing activities along the rivers on the other hand these same grasslands constitute important grazing zones in the dry season after flood recession compared to the surrounding semi arid grasslands these productive services rendered to local populations are intimately linked to the prevailing hydrological conditions in the context of a renewed interest for large hydroelectric infrastructures in this region of the world where large perennial rivers are seen as untapped resources downstream impacts of such constructions need to be accounted for in particular for the diverse wetland systems many wetland ecosystems have been or are threatened by the modification of the flood regime yet quantifying the direct link between floods and growth rates of the floodplain grasslands using a process based approach has not yet been undertaken the tana river delta trd located in kenya is listed as a wetland of international importance under the ramsar convention since 2012 constituting the second most important deltaic system in eastern africa it has productive and functionally interconnected ecosystems comprising a variety of freshwater floodplain estuarine and coastal habitats although literature is starting to appear concerning its ecosystems and biodiversity hamerlynck et al 2010 2012 uses leauthaud et al 2013b hydrology leauthaud et al 2013a and current development issues duvail et al 2010 2012 there has been no study focusing on its floodplain grasslands yet they constitute important grazing zones as well as habitat to large flocks of migratory birds the trd is also under threat from past maingi and marsh 2002 and future dam constructions on the tana river that have and will further modify the flooding patterns understanding the growth characteristics and productivity of this specific ecosystem is therefore essential to improve its management and conservation 1 2 plant growth models for floodplain grasslands models are important tools for the management of ecosystems concerning floodplain grasslands they constitute an interesting alternative or complementary approach to estimate key variables compared to both in situ long term monitoring and remote sensing techniques firstly because many of these grasslands are located in remote and possibly conflict zones within the sahelian belt second sampling phytomass submerged in several meters of water is challenging finally the use of remote sensing techniques presents at least two drawbacks i estimating phytomass proxies such as leaf area index lai is difficult in mixed water vegetation pixels and ii widely used relationships relating these proxies to standing phytomass do not apply in flooded conditions due to submerged phytomass a growth model of natural vegetation can provide estimates of these variables and quantitative assessments of annual productivity useful for decision makers development of growth models for natural vegetation was brought on by the blooming of crop modelling research which flourished in the 1960s and 1970s at wageningen university van ittersum et al 2003 specific models describing the main ecophysiological processes were developed for different ecosystems and climatic contexts but few if any were devoted to flooded vegetation yet floodplain grasslands show numerous adaptations to floods notably the modification of the allocation of photosynthates piedade et al 1991 plant nutrient status piedade et al 1994 development of aerenchyma voesenek et al 2006 enhancement of shoot elongation kende et al 1998 voesenek et al 2006 and high energy conversion efficiencies piedade et al 1991 which in turn lead to high growth rates and productivity junk et al 1989 existing models which do not take into account these ecophysiological responses are hence inappropriate to simulate floodplain grasslands especially during flood events 1 3 objectives and content the objectives of this paper are therefore twofold i construct a plant model capable of estimating above ground annual phytomass productivity adapted to perennial c4 and semi arid floodplain grasslands ii evaluate changes in above ground phytomass productivity in the case of the tana river delta under different flood scenarios following this introduction section 2 1 describes the floodplain grasslands of the trd in situ vegetation monitoring and the tested flood scenarios section 2 2 describes the model structure with a particular attention given to flood related equations as well as to the approaches taken to estimate model parameters the description of all other equations rather typical for growth models can be found in appendix a results focus first on model evaluation second on model mechanisms concerning the productivity and the water budget at the experimental site and third on the analysis of the flood scenarios section 4 discusses the potentials and limits of the model and the consequences of changing hydrological regimes in the trd kenya 2 materials and methods 2 1 the floodplain grasslands of the tana river delta 2 1 1 the tana river delta the trd extends roughly over 1300 km2 its landscape is formed by a mosaic of grasslands bushland forest farmed land and mangrove according to micro topography and the flood regime of the tana river the latter can overflow twice a year during the long and short rainy seasons apr jul and nov dec respectively its floods are highly beneficial for the deltaic ecosystems and contribute to providing numerous ecosystem services to the local communities including food production through flood recession farming livestock rearing and fishing in addition to the economical and human value of the trd and its floods its complex landscape mosaic forms a biodiversity hotspot hamerlynck et al 2012 butynski and hamerlynck 2015 however the construction of hydroelectric dams between 1968 and 1981 led to a decrease of extent frequency and duration of floods maingi and marsh 2002 a direct consequence of these hydrological changes was a shift in agricultural activities leauthaud et al 2013a which indirectly suggests a change in the productivity of the farmed and managed ecosystems the floodplain grasslands of the trd fig 1 a and b cover approximately 200 km2 within the flat and nearly treeless central floodplains on its outskirts the grassland intertwines with patchy stands of trees and shrubs extending in total over approximately 400 km2 echinochloa stagnina is the dominant species followed by the perennials vossia cuspidata roxb griff and the watercrown grass paspalidium obtusifolium delile n d simpson a thorough description of species can be found in leauthaud et al submitted for publication these grasslands constitute important grazing zones for livestock cattle sheep and goats of the orma and other pastoralist communities and for wild herbivores mostly the african buffalo syncerus caffer and hippopotamus hippopotamus amphibius e stagnina is highly valued by the pastoralists who distinguish its non flooded oba lesa and flooded forms oba kawisa the floodplain alternates between a flooded state during which the entire floodplain can be covered by over 2 m of water during several weeks and a non flooded state in the absence of floods rainfall wets the soil and initiates vegetation growth but is evaporated at a high rate during the dry season the vegetation progressively dries under the semi arid conditions and the soil a deep dark brown and cracking vertisols shrinks as cracks as deep as 2 m appear dominant species of the grassland including e stagnina have a phenological cycle adapted to alternating flooded and non flooded periods growth of e stagnina starts at the beginning of the rainy seasons with the arrival of the floods new internods are produced from the apical meristem and stems elongate echinochloa stagnina can cope with 4 5 cm of daily water increases françois et al 1989 by investing most of its photosynthates into stems the leaves connected to the submerged part of the plant rapidly die off but leaf growth continues above the water surface when undisturbed the leaf canopy thickens in two to three weeks until it completely covers the water surface at the end of the flood stems and leaves fall on the ground and nodal roots develop at this stage livestock enter the floodplains to graze and favour plant rooting by stamping this vegetative regrowth phase lasts until the soil dries up and the aerial part of the plant wilts 2 1 2 in situ vegetation and climate monitoring in semi controlled conditions an experimental site was set up to monitor the growth of the floodplain grasslands in semi controlled conditions the objective was to obtain estimates of above ground dry phytomass adp and other key characteristics of this grassland in contrasted situations in order to estimate model parameters and validate the plant growth model contrasted situations regarding water availability included dry and rainy seasons non flooded flooded and post flood conditions as well as an additional supply of water through irrigation finally cuttings were undertaken at three different intervals to capture the effects of plant canopy dynamics and grazing frequency the experimental site fig 1 b and c 2 18 51 08 s 40 12 39 84 e consisted in a 13 6 m by 17 2 m exclosure that excluded domestic and wild grazers for the whole duration of the experiment the vegetation a typical mix of e stagnina p obtusifolium and v cuspidata was homogeneous within and surrounding the site throughout the experiment within this exclosure three blocks respectively i 0 i 1 and i 2 received different water inputs all received rainfall while i 1 and i 2 received all year round an additional 20 mm or 60 mm of irrigated water every eight days respectively given the climatic conditions a maximum evapotranspiration of about 7 mm day 1 woodhead 1968 the latter corresponded to a non stressed situation within each block three sub blocks with four 1 m2 quadrats each were monitored these sub blocks were cut at three different frequencies noted respectively c 1 c 2 and c 3 nine different irrigation and cutting treatments table 1 were hence applied to 36 quadrats from the 4th of december 2010 to the 1st of march 2012 resulting in a total of 504 adp samples of these 36 and 84 were sampled respectively the day following flood recession 27 12 2011 and during the post flood phase initial root phytomass was also measured by removal of whole plants in addition to adp 20 hemispherical photos were taken throughout the monitoring on contrasting quadrats to estimate corresponding lai a thorough description of the experimental protocol can be found in leauthaud et al submitted for publication the main climate features rainfall at 1 m above ground level and flood occurrence were measured on a daily basis at the experimental site additional daily meteorological data were measured 5 5 km away 2 16 22 07 s 40 11 00 55 e from the 18th of august 2011 onward using a campbell scientific ltd automatic weather station instruments sbs500 hmp155a cs300 apogee pyr p pyranometer meteorological data included rainfall noted r maximum and minimum air temperature t max t min relative humidity rh max rh min and radiation i rainfall and other meteorological variables were recorded respectively at 44 cm and 2 m above ground level total rainfall recorded at the experimental site throughout the 14 month period was 554 mm including events 5 mm temperature oscillated between a mean daily maximum and minimum of 33 8 c and 21 5 c respectively while maximum and minimum measured daily relative humidity were 95 5 and 46 6 respectively mean daily radiation was 20 5 mj two floods occurred at the experimental site during the short rainy season of 2011 lasting 2 and 37 days 5 6 11 2011 and 21 11 2011 27 12 2011 the latter attained a height of 50 cm fig 2 shows all measured variables at the weather station a c or at the experimental site d alongside weather data available at proximate sites for comparison purposes to solve unavoidable missing data issues non existent data points for temperature humidity and wind and radiation were filled in by that of the same julian date from the available record then a 10 day moving average of these variables were calculated to smooth out day to day large variations a minimum daily radiation was set to 15 mj day 1 only 26 days concerned daily rainfall between the experimental site and the meteorological station site were not well correlated cor 0 37 but the daily floating averages over 30 days were well correlated cor 0 82 the latter downscaled to daily values were therefore used to fill in missing rainfall data at the experimental site 2 1 3 flood scenarios the flowing pattern of the tana river is bi modal with peak flows occurring during the long and short rainy seasons five major reservoirs built in the upper basin between 1968 and 1981 significantly modified the hydrological regime of the river with a 20 decrease in the peak flows of may maingi and marsh 2002 with a current mean discharge at the delta inlet of 3 3 km3 year 1 calculated over the period 2002 2011 the discharge of the tana river accounts for over 95 of total water input into the delta leauthaud et al 2013b due to high variability of rainfall in the upper catchment and reservoir operation flooding in the deltaic floodplains is relatively unpredictable no floods can occur in dry years while one to two major floods can be observed during rainy years estimations of current flood extents and duration are provided leauthaud et al 2013a in non extreme years and for the current topography of the delta flood extent can exceed 300 km2 furthermore floods over 200 km2 occurred on average once a year with a mean duration of 18 days in the past floods most certainly lasted longer and were more frequent leauthaud et al 2013a in link with higher discharges ten annual climatic and flood scenarios were therefore simulated to assess the impact of changing hydrological conditions on floodplain grassland growth scenarios sc1 sc3 represent years with no floods for respectively a dry 30 rainfall with respect to a normal year normal simulated 554 mm rainfall or wet year 30 rainfall with respect to a normal year scenarios sc4 sc7 represent years with one flood either during the long or short rainy season and different extents and duration finally sc8 sc10 represent years in which two floods a year occur with different extents and duration these scenarios represent the range of non exceptional floods and climate in the trd simulated flood characteristics are summarized in table 2 2 2 model description 2 2 1 general model structure the model fig 3 simulates the growth of a c4 perennial floodplain grassland at a daily time step using the forcing variables reported in table 3 vegetation is represented by four compartments which interact with each other a leaf compartment b l where photosynthesis takes place a stem compartment b s required to reproduce the rapid growth observed during floods a root compartment b r where storage occurs allowing inter annual variations in phytomass for perennial grasses and finally an above ground attached dead matter b ad compartment main processes for plant growth are modelled photosynthesis allocation of photosynthates respiration translocation of root phytomass to aerial phytomass senescence and litter production aerial phytomass can also be subtracted from the system to simulate grazing or cutting model development was widely inspired by available semi arid grassland models mougin et al 1995 cayrol et al 2000 nouvellon et al 2000 no temperature nor nitrogen effects on growth processes are explicitly represented for this c4 floodplain grassland new features concern the inclusion of specific effects of floods on growth processes variable energy conversion efficiency photosynthate allocation senescence and litter production the model was constructed to be used with scarce climatic data these data if not inexistent are rare in the regions where these type of c4 floodplain grasslands prevail as such the model is a rather simplified representation of vegetation but still provides a realistic description of the grassland production as the main biophysical processes are taken into account the model was coded in r version 2 1 12 r development core team 2008 and is available upon demand symbols for variables parameters and constants are specified respectively in tables 4 6 the main equations describing the different processes are found in table 7 and described in detail in appendix a the next paragraph and equations described in table 8 focus specifically on the flood related processes 2 2 2 flood related processes 2 2 2 1 representation of water in the model the model simulates three main growth phases related to floods a non flooded a flooded and a post flooded phase noted respectively nf f and pf all water related changes are represented in three manners intrinsically connected to the water contents θ h m3 m 3 of the two soil horizons h1 h2 i a binary presence absence switch which signals the flooded phase ii equations describing growth processes including θ h as an explanatory variable and iii different parameter values for the three flood status variables and parameters differenciated by the subscript i for the different plant compartments are hence further distinguished by subscripts j and h respectively representing the flood status and soil horizons in the nf phase considered typical of a non flooded semi arid grass cover growth is strongly related to soil water availability thus the plant carbon module is explicitly connected to a soil water module which simulates the impact of water stress on plant growth processes when floods occurred the binary switch was set to flooded conditions and θ h automatically set to their saturated value in each horizon θ h sat post flooded conditions during which growth can be important is not explicitly represented but relies on θ h variations in time it was considered that the pf phase occurred when soil water content within h2 was higher than its field capacity θ 2 fc processes impacted by floods are detailed in the following sections while the typical water bucket module equations can be found in table 7 and are described in appendix a 2 2 2 2 photosynthesis photosynthesis depends on the solar radiation reaching the plant and the latter s ability to capture and use this solar energy gross photosynthesis p g can be expressed as in eq 5

floodplains exhibits high net primary production under flooded conditions with a mean rate of dry matter production per unit of solar radiation intercepted close to the considered maximum for c4 species piedade et al 1991 piedade et al 1994 even postulate that internal co 2 diffusion from the co2 rich waters to the leaves could occur under flooded conditions boosting even more photosynthesis under dry conditions factors like water nutrient and temperature influence the rate of co2 intake of the plant water stress reduces co2 diffusion through stomatal closure high temperatures can also induce stomatal closure however the latter is limited for e stagnina due to the specific c4 pathway especially in the range of climate conditions considered here the nitrogen status of the plant also affects photosynthesis rates but in a less extent for c4 species in this model we therefore assumed that the conversion coefficient efficiency in non flooded conditions depended solely on soil water content ε e eq 32 table 8 was maximum ε emax f when the grassland was flooded then decreased linearly until the soil water content reached its field capacity θ fc at this point and until θ α θ fc the soil held enough water for the plant not to be stressed and ε e stayed constant at its maximum level for non flooded conditions noted ε emax nf at lower soil water contents ε e decreased linearly to reach zero at the wilting point θ wp the conversion efficiency ε e was expressed as the maximum of its value calculated for each soil horizon eq 31 assuming the plant s ability to capture resources where available within the soil 2 2 2 3 allocation of photosynthates photosynthates were allocated within the plant according to the flooded status as well as rules related to ratios regulating phytomass distribution between the leaf shoot and root compartments in non flooded and post flood conditions priority was given to the roots to insure there were enough roots to sustain aerial phytomass then the remaining photosynthates was divided between the stem and leaf compartments for non flooded vegetation root to aerial ratios noted r r a range from 0 7 1 to 4 1 and generally between 0 8 1 and 1 5 1 gould and shaw 1983 it could however be lower for e stagnina as its root system is not very developed hiernaux unpublished data in the model allocation to roots noted a r was considered nil if the root to aerial ratio of the day was higher than r r a eq 33 table 8 if not the translocation from leaves to root noted t l r required to attain r r a was calculated on a daily basis as eq 34 photosynthates were allocated to roots as long as the required amount did not exceed gross photosynthesis eq 33 remaining photosynthates were then shared between the stems and the leaves in the same manner the translocation from leaf to stem noted t l s required to attain the stem to aboveground phytomass ratio noted r s a was calculated as in eq 37 r s a was distinguished for non flooded nf and flooded f conditions as e stagnina exhibited different leaf to aerial ratios for non flooded and flooded conditions photosynthates were allocated to the stem compartment as long as the required amount did not exceed remaining photosynthates p g t l r eq 36 the allocation coefficient to leaves was then calculated in eq 38 in flooded conditions the plant needs to produce above water leaf phytomass and develop stem phytomass to keep up with the rising water roots could be less necessary as adventitious roots can uptake nutrients in the nutrient rich water piedade et al 1991 estimated on average that 30 7 and 5 5 of photosynthates were allocated to the leaves and roots the rest going to stem growth in flooded conditions root allocation was set to a constant value to insure rapid growth rates for leaves at the beginning of the flood indeed the canopy of e stagnina thickens rapidly at the beginning of a flood photosynthates were as a priority allocated to the leaf compartment to favour photosynthesis corresponding to a maximal leaf allocation a lmax rate and to a minimum stem allocation rate allowing the plant to stay above water when leaf growth was high enough to intercept all the incoming light corresponding to a theoretical leaf phytomass noted b l laimax eq 7 photosynthates were progressively allocated to the stem compartment until reaching a maximal stem allocation value and a minimal leaf allocation value a lmin at a leaf phytomass of γ a b l laimax in eq 39 the allocation coefficient to stems was then calculated using eq 41 2 2 2 4 senescence senescence occurs within each compartment of a plant and is related to plant age and environmental conditions under dry conditions senescence of c4 perennial grasses depends firstly on soil water availability for grasses under dry conditions nouvellon et al 2000 suggest that senescence rates vary from 0 0074 to 0 14 and cayrol et al 2000 note similar values in the present model daily senescence for non flooded conditions and for the two aerial compartments noted s l nf and s s nf depended on a senescent coefficient s i gdm gdm 1 day 1 on the phytomass of each compartment and a water stress effect f s θ eq 43 which can double senescence rates f s θ was the water stress effect within the horizon with the highest water content senescence rates can be much higher in flooded conditions especially for the leaves as the latter die with rising water piedade et al 1991 report a leaf turnover rate of 34 days for e polystachya h b k hitchcock a first estimation of the leaf senescent rate is thus the solution of a differential equation assuming 1 of original phytomass was left after 34 days of flooding the daily senescent rate of the stems under flooded conditions was taken as 5 of this initial value senescence rate of roots was set to a constant value for all flood status 2 2 2 5 litter production and decomposition of senescent matter dead material can decompose directly on the plant or fall to the ground as litter these two processes depend primarily on the composition of senescent matter silver and miya 2001 de neiff et al 2006 bontti et al 2009 on the microbial environment singhal et al 1992 gamage and asaeda 2005 and on the physical environment such as climate grazing events singhal et al 1992 or flooded conditions junk and furch 1991 found that loss of dry weight was lower in terrestrial conditions compared to aquatic conditions with respectively a 30 and 75 decrease of dry weight for sphenoclea zeylanica in two weeks considering this main difference in flooded and terrestrial conditions removal of dead mass from the plant system was calculated as eq 44 table 8 a decomposition rate of 20 in one week was found for e polystachya h b k hitchcock under flooded conditions furch and junk 1992 considering this representative of both litter formation and dead material decomposition in tropical floodplain grasslands a first estimation of l f was calculated with the same type of differential equation as for the senescence coefficient while l nf was taken as 10 of this initial value 2 2 3 parameter estimation the experimental dataset composed of nine distinct treatments within the exclosure was split into two independent groups for the calibration and validation procedures using in each phase contrasted series respectively i 0 c 2 i 1 c 1 i 1 c 3 i 2 c 2 and i 0 c 1 i 0 c 3 i 1 c 2 i 2 c 1 i 2 c 3 the model was composed of over 45 equations and comprised 50 parameters the latter were estimated in three distinct manners fifteen soil and vegetation parameters were calculated from available experimental data a sensitivity analysis was then undertaken on the remaining 35 parameters to identify those inducing strong variations of aboveground cut phytomass an ensemblist approach was used for these sensitive parameters to select an ensemble of equifinal parameter sets remaining parameters were set to values found in the literature parameters used and their final range of values are reported in table 5 2 2 3 1 in situ determination of key soil and vegetation parameters the soil at the experimental site characterized by a high clay content table 9 was of the vertisol type bulk dry density was low 0 95 1 08 due to the swelling of the clays at measurement time during the rainy season and a high concentration of organic matter 6 11 soil field capacity and permanent wilting point were calculated using the richard s method on soil aggregates initial soil water content for the different layers was determined by sampling and drying in an oven at 105 c for 24 h because of the similar hydrological characteristics of the second and third horizons the soil was modelled as a superposition of two horizons noted h h1 0 5 cm and h2 5 65 cm as the root system was restricted to the first 65 cm of soil all water draining through the second horizon at 65 cm was considered lost to the soil plant atmosphere system five vegetation parameters were estimated from field data specific leaf area sla eq 7 table 7 two leaf phytomass adp allometry parameters allowing to calculate the shoot to aerial ratio r s a an extinction coefficient k 2 eq 20 table 7 and initial root phytomass calculation of sla was undertaken in two phases as concomitant b l and lai values required to solve eq 7 were not available leaf phytomass was first estimated using a linear regression and available b l and adp data not exceeding 200 g p value 1 r 2 0 99 fig 4 a 1 then sla was calculated through a linear regression between lai and the estimated values of b l p value 1 r 2 0 87 fig 4a the two leaf allometry parameters linking b l to adp for flooded and non flooded conditions β nf β f respectively eq 35 were determined by linear regression p value 1 r 2 0 95 r 2 0 98 respectively fig 4b the fourth vegetation parameter k 2 was estimated from a set of hemispherical photos taken for contrasted adp processed using caneye 6 3 these photos provided estimates of lai and f g k 2 was determined from the resulting lai f vg exponential relationship using a linear model p value 1 r 2 0 93 fig 4c finally measured per plant root phytomass was 0 51 0 22 g considering a 20 loss due to the extraction process and a mean plant density of 42 10 within the quadrats led to an initial root phytomass estimated at 25 g m 2 all analyses were performed using the r software and packages 2 2 3 2 selection of parameters to estimate through a sensitivity analysis the aim of the sensitivity analysis was to screen for the most influential parameters on the output variables among a large number of parameters the morris method was chosen morris 1991 it consisted in defining the elementary effect of each parameter characterized by a mean μ and variance σ the range over which the parameters were analyzed was defined by available literature in the case where only one reference was found its value was modified by 20 high mean μ or variance σ indicated a strong influence of the parameter on the model s outputs or strong interactions with other parameters respectively so that parameters with high μ or σ were retained for calibration six sensitivity analyses comprising contrasted irrigation cutting and flooded conditions using i 0 c 1 and i 1 c 2 for non flooded flooded and post flood conditions were undertaken to investigate the sensitivity of total cut phytomass to parameter values one month of climatic data was used for the analyses of the whole 50 parameters of the model 15 appeared to either strongly influence total cut phytomass or have strong interactions with other parameters in at least one of the six sensitivity analyses fig 5 leaf phytomass remaining after cutting b lmin i0 b lmin i1 blmin i 2 was sensitive in all tests directly related to lai eq 7 this parameter influenced photosynthesis dynamics respiration related parameters m gs eqs 8 and 9 were sensitive variables for four tests in the same way as initial phytomasses these parameters strongly influenced the amount of photosynthates arriving in the plant system initial leaf phytomass b l initial sensitive because the short simulated period enhanced its relative contribution to total cut phytomass was fixed to a minimal value hereafter four parameters used to calculate efficiency factors ε i e max f α ε emax nf and ε e k 1 as well as two parameters related to allocation decisions between the different compartments r r a b smin also appeared in the sensitivity tests finally three parameters describing growth dynamics in flooded conditions al max s lf llit f additionally appeared in the tests where these conditions were simulated fourteen parameters in relation to major processes occurring mostly photosynthesis respiration and allocation were hence calibrated in the next step estimation of sensitive parameters by an ensemblist approach in the bayesian approach parameters and hence output variables are probability distribution functions which are used to estimate the uncertainty linked to parameter estimation the prior probability distribution is updated using observed data using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 method parameters ranges were estimated in a five step approach first random and independent sets of parameters were generated all parameters were given a uniform prior distribution using the same range as the sensitivity analyses see table 5 for values second the likelihood measure to select the acceptable parameter sets was defined as the root mean squared error rmse 45 rmse 1 n adp obs adp sim 2 where adp obs and adp sim are the observed and simulated aboveground total dry phytomasses and n the number of data points used the threshold of acceptability in retaining a parameter set was defined as rmse 100 gdm m 2 third the plant model was ran with each parameter set 20 000 sets and the sets with an rmse value under the threshold of acceptability were retained during this calibration phase four of the nine treatments i 0 c 2 i 1 c 1 i 1 c 3 i 2 c 2 were used fourth the combined model parameter sets were validated using the remaining treatments i 0 c 1 i 0 c 3 i 1 c 2 i 2 c 1 i 2 c 3 for which validation rmse noted rmse v was calculated in a fifth and final step the uncertainty ranges of the output variables were calculated as the 10th and 90th percentiles obtained from the likelihood weighted simulations using the retained parameter sets a group of 84 sets of parameters was selected during the glue procedure rmse for the calibration phase ranged between 91 and 99 gdm m 2 rmse v for the validation phase was slightly higher ranging between 95 and 107 gdm m 2 these parameter sets are equifinal and were used to define the uncertainty range due to parameter estimation all remaining parameters were set to a fixed value by referring to literature 2 2 4 quality assessment of the final model the quality of the estimations of adp using the combined model parameter sets was assessed using four indicators the absolute maximum error ame q the mean absolute error mae q the model efficiency eff q and root mean square error rmse q table 10 observed and simulated variables were ranges of values due to the existence of replicates and multiple parameter sets respectively to take these uncertainty ranges into account the relative error adp obs adp sim was defined as the difference between the envelope boundaries for the observed and simulated values defined by the standard deviation and the 10th to 90th percentiles respectively when the envelope boundaries superposed relative error was set to zero see leauthaud et al 2013a for similar method 3 results 3 1 model evaluation simulated variables using the model and the selected 84 parameter sets were compared to available measured variables namely adp and lai fig 6 comparisons were undertaken for a wide range of measured adp values ranging from 2 to 835 gdm m 2 although data were more dispersed at higher values simulated and measured adp compare relatively well for all treatments interestingly estimated uncertainty due to parameter calibration was of the same order of magnitude as measured variability calculated from the repetitions for each treatment concerning lai despite the large range of measurements model prediction for the non flooded canopy was in relatively good agreement with the experimental data simulated lai for flooded situations is slightly underestimated at higher values lai 5 simulated adp and root phytomass are shown for all nine treatments of the experimental site fig 7 simulated adp was close to observed values for most occurrences the rapid growth rates during the flooded events were reproduced resulting in maximal observed and simulated adp at the end of the flood except for i 2 c 3 however taking into account growth duration 16 32 and 64 for c 1 c 2 and c 3 respectively and 37 days for the flooded period standing phytomass per growth day was maximal for the flooded phase in all treatments rmse q for the combined model 84 sets of parameters was 7 8 gdm m 2 and the mae q was 0 60 gdm m 2 the efficiency eff q of the model was 0 95 while ame q was 322 gdm m 2 for a measured average of 187 35 gdm m 2 3 2 mechanisms of the model 3 2 1 effect of floods irrigation and cutting treatments mean daily growth rates are depicted for observed and simulated phytomass as a function of flood status cutting and irrigation treatments fig 8 the goal here was not to undertake statistical tests to estimate the effects of the various treatments but rather to compare the observed and simulated growth rates under contrasted situations observed and simulated datasets showed the same trends when analyzing the effect of floods and irrigation comforting the validity of the model concerning these aspects concerning the flooded status mean growth rates were maximal during the flooded phase 11 9 12 2 gdm m 2 day 1 respectively for observed and simulated average and high mean growth rates were maintained after the floods 7 8 8 2 gdm m 2 day 1 idem compared to the non flooded situation 5 1 6 8 gdm m 2 day 1 idem the high variability observed in flooded conditions fig 8 a can be attributed to the different irrigation and cutting treatments during the non flooded phase water inputs through irrigation had a clear effect on growth rates the latter were lowest when no irrigation occurred modality i 0 1 2 2 5 gdm m 2 day 1 compared to modalities i 1 and i 2 5 8 7 1 gdm m 2 day 1 6 5 8 3 gdm m 2 day 1 on the contrary growth rates for modalities i 1 and i 2 were of the same order of magnitude suggesting that maximum water use efficiency was achieved for modality i 1 mean observed and simulated data were of the same order of magnitude for all cutting treatments 3 2 2 soil water dynamics and budget measured soil moisture values were not available for this study instead modelled soil water dynamics were visually checked to ensure their coherence and are illustrated here for two treatments and one parameter set fig 9 water inputs by rainfall irrigation or floods induced rapid responses in water outflows soil water outflows logically increased with irrigation fig 9 from left to right peak soil evaporation highly variable due to soil water availability and changing lai occurred just after rainfall or irrigation events and rapidly declined as the first soil horizon dried up maximum simulated soil evaporation was 6 7 mm day 1 transpiration declined abruptly at each cutting event then gradually increased with plant development to reach a maximum value of 7 8 mm day 1 when fully irrigated both values were of the same order of magnitude as estimated potential evapotranspiration 6 9 mm day 1 woodhead 1968 water was lost to the soil plant system after important water inflows concerning the soil water budget total water inputs to the plant soil system varied between 715 mm and 3869 mm during the whole duration of the experiment table 11 representing a wide range of situations when irrigated the latter represented the major water input into the soil water system 55 83 floods were the smallest input into the system 1 33 but represented the only inflow during the flooded phase contributing between 1 9 and 7 5 mm day 1 to the water budget water outflows were represented by plant transpiration t soil evaporation e drainage d from the second horizon and runoff deep water drainage rn see appendix a except for the highly irrigated situation i 2 transpiration was the major component of the budget for the different treatments the latter increased with irrigation and higher vegetation cover c 3 modality the second main component was evaporation the latter remained relatively stable when non irrigated 239 308 mm in irrigated situations however evaporation decreased with increased vegetation cover c 3 modality to the advantage of transpiration drainage of the second horizon and runoff deep water drainage rn were negligible for all treatments 39 79 mm except for irrigation modality i 2 in this case a large part of water inputs was lost to the soil plant system by runoff deep water drainage 1697 1867 mm compared to 3683 3869 mm of water inputs for irrigation treatment i 2 this is concordant with estimated potential evapotranspiration for the region 2200 mm year 1 woodhead 1968 which limits the amount of water transferred to the atmosphere however as no cracks were observed for this irrigation modality rn was probably overestimated to the detriment of drainage d which suggests that water dynamics and distribution for irrigation modality i 2 could be less well simulated in the model compared to modalities i 0 and i 1 3 3 analysis of flood scenarios annual growth per hectare more than tripled between the different simulated scenarios ranging for the average value fig 10 a between 9 5 t ha 1 sc 1 and 30 t ha 1 sc 10 growth per hectare was lowest for the non flooded dry scenario sc 1 7 6 12 1 t ha 1 and highest for the year with two long floods sc 10 26 9 33 9 t ha 1 growth per hectare was generally higher when two floods a year occurred compared to one flood a year compared to no floods climate scenarios simulated for the non flooded situations sc 1 sc 3 had an impact on growth with annual mean production increasing by 70 to attain 16 4 t ha 1 14 4 19 1 t ha 1 growth in non flooded but rainy years was of the same order of magnitude as the lowest annual production for a simulation with one flood 16 5 t ha 1 14 6 19 0 t ha 1 finally comparison between flooding scenarios of the long and short rainy seasons e g sc4 sc6 sc5 sc7 suggest that floods during the long rainy season could induce better growth than floods that occurred during the short rainy season this could be due to different climatic conditions although a multi annual analysis would be required to investigate this matter annual grass growth for the entire 200 km2 floodplain fig 10 b ranged from 1 9 105 tons 1 5 2 4 105 t to 6 105 tons 5 4 6 8 105 t total production was highly dependent on flood extent within the 200 km2 grassland comparing with a year with the same climate small floods of 50 km2 did not produce a significant increase of total floodplain production sc 5 and sc 7 compared to sc 2 on the contrary longer and larger floods of 200 km2 during 40 days induced large increases 4 1 and 3 7 5 t for sc4 and sc6 respectively to be compared to 2 3 105 tons for sc 2 highest total annual production was attained for two long floods in a year corresponding to scenario sc 10 6 105 t 5 4 6 8 105 t 4 discussion 4 1 originality of the study and possible further developments this study constitutes to our knowledge the first attempt to model the beneficial effects of floods on the primary productivity of a semi arid c4 floodplain grassland the model is suitable to simulate the annual productivity of these grasslands under different flood regimes by making explicit the link between production and floods compared to previous grassland models the present one expands three processes to incorporate these effects specific allocation rules for flooded conditions and increased senescence and litter decomposition during the flooded period despite large variability in measured values the model is able to reproduce the general trends observed in the experimental dataset concerning especially the effect of floods and irrigation furthermore maximal estimated and observed growth rates at the experimental site were 107 150 kg ha 1 day 1 10th to 90th percentiles and 190 35 kg ha 1 day 1 which are of the same order of magnitude as other estimates available for e stagnina grasslands 60 120 kg ha 1 day 1 hiernaux and diarra 1986 and 200 250 kg ha 1 day 1 françois et al 1989 all recorded after a flooded phase conceptually the model was constructed as a simplified but realistic representation of the floodplain grasslands to be used with scarce climatic data other than the limited physiological knowledge for this species this choice was in accordance with the fact that the model could be calibrated only on aboveground phytomass data however the model is mostly based on widely acknowledged growth mechanisms grounding its roots in the multi decadal developments in this domain in the same way of thinking calibration was undertaken for a large variety of conditions to obtain a generic model capable of simulating a wide range of situations special attention was also given to estimating an uncertainty range for the calibration of the sensitive yet unknown model parameters finally the model was calibrated and validated using a valuable diverse and large dataset of over 500 samples from an on site experimental field which is rare for this type of vegetation future developments could focus on analysing different flood regimes and their representation within the model radically different floods height and duration would indeed be out of the reasonable simulation range of the model speed of water increase could be an important variable to incorporate when simulation of sudden deaths due to rapidly increasing floods is sought after long term floristic and regeneration processes may not be sufficiently taken into account for pluriannual simulations as dams decreased the frequency of the floods in the trd maingi and marsh 2002 the model was calibrated during a period in which floods were less frequent compared to past situations so that the calibrated model could lead to an under estimation of the primary productivity for regularly flooded situations developing further these aspects would require more observations especially of soil water content and vegetation characteristics during and after diverse flood events finally estimations of key parameters concerning photosynthesis respiration and senescence rates for leaves stems and roots would be precious in all cases a combination of observations and modeling exercises is required to further improve our knowledge on these type of grasslands 4 2 fate of the highly productive tana river delta grasslands and insight on the impact on ecosystem services the tana river delta is formed by an intertwinement of different dry and wet ecosystems notwithstanding these extremely productive and diverse ecosystems it is also one of the poorest locations in the country the deltaic ecosystems and local communities are under severe pressure through decreasing land and water availability leauthaud et al 2013b resulting in lethal clashes over local resources kirchner 2013 contrasting views on development potentials and pathways for this wetland co exist on the one hand large scale agro investments promise increased economic returns and on the other hand environmental non governmental organizations voice alternative development pathways and promote local development based on communities traditional livelihoods arevalo et al 2014 in both cases local participation and active involvement in decision making as well as sharing pertinent and accurate information with the different stakeholders are key to achieve long term success of any development plan yet these are rarely taken into account this paper reveals high growth rates for the floodplain grasslands of the trd what benefits arise from such high productivities omengo et al 2016 rule out the long term c sink potential within this floodplain and hence its role in climate change mitigation nevertheless floodplain grasslands provide shelter for fish thus contributing to high reproduction rates favourable for fishing activities second these grasslands are both foraging grounds for large flocks of numerous species of migratory birds of international importance and the main pastureland for the large community of hippopotamus residing in its centre hence sustaining part of the high biodiversity established in the trd last but not the least these grasslands form drought grazing areas for the local and regional livestock keepers nunow 2013 estimated that the delta hosted over 3 million head of livestock during the drought year 2009 this study confirms the strong link between floods and pastoral resources as flooding conditions are themselves dependent on river discharge leauthaud et al 2013b it is reasonable to assert that changes in the hydrological regime of the tana river have and will induce impact grassland productivity although simulated scenarios should be taken with precaution and further work is needed to better understand post flood growth it is highly probable that past changes in the hydrological regime of the tana river due to the construction of hydroelectric infrastructure maingi and marsh 2002 had a negative effect on pastoral activities in the region considering sc 5 and sc 10 representative of the current and pre dam situation a 35 decrease of annual grass production has been estimated with the further construction of the grand falls dam grass production will further decrease accentuated during the dry years 50 estimated decrease compared to pre dam conditions these grasslands constitute a highly palatable forage françois et al 1989 musco et al 2016 sanou et al 2016 and are vital for livestock keepers at key moments in a drought cycle as land and water resources are excised to establish plantations and settle landless households from the more densely populated areas of the country nunow 2013 with few or no regards of the significance of these areas for the pastoral systems and livelihoods the dwindling grasslands value increases combined land grabbing land fragmentation restriction on mobility and restriction to decreasing water related resources are particularly damaging to a majority of pastoralists quantitative analyses as undertaken in this study can and should be undertaken for the other major services arising from the grasslands fishing biodiversity from the other deltaic ecosystems and at the basin scale they will help better inform decision makers and local stakeholders on the consequences of development plans they will also contribute to a better evaluation of the wide array of ecosystem services provided by the tana river hurford and harou 2014 botzen et al 2015 for which alternative scenarios to national water master plan 2030 flagship project of the high grand falls dam would be better appreciated one promising option is an alternative management of upstream hydroelectic infrastructures enabling flood releases that could ensure the provision of downstream ecosystem services while optimizing the production of renewable energy the water food energy nexus is very relevant to river basin management and this case in particular quantitative analyses of ecosystem services combined with local participation in decision making could lead to new transformation pathways and hence a step towards achieving the objectives of sustainable development especially on food security water management and biodiversity 5 conclusions this study presents a coupled plant carbon balance and soil water budget model adapted to seasonally flooded c4 semi arid grasslands this model can be used to understand the impact of floods and management patterns on the annual productivity of sub saharan floodplain grasslands composed mostly of echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv it was described and calibrated using data collected in the tana river delta kenya during a 14 month experiment during which different irrigation and cutting treatments and flood events were recorded sensitivity analyses showed that a limited number of parameters strongly affected annual productivity during the calibration process fourteen parameters were calibrated on half the experimental data and the model validated on the remaining data overall the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data simulations for the tana river delta suggest that past changes in the hydrological regime of the river as well as future changes due to the construction of the high grand falls dam have led and will lead to an important decrease of the floodplain grassland productivity as local and regional livestock keeping activities rely heavily on the dry season grazing resources available within the wetland and therefore on flood occurrences future development plans should seriously consider the negative effects of this project on local activities and livelihoods this study could help define alternative management scenarios such as artificial flood releases required to maintain downstream ecosystem services in particular fodder production acknowledgements this project was financed by the french ministry of environment in the framework of the project eaux et territoires by the research institute for development ird and by the lisah laboratory a special thanks to k otoi and the villagers of onkolde as well as to q luke for his botanical expertise appendix a plant growth model a 1 vegetation module a 1 1 vegetation dynamics vegetation was represented by four compartments which interact with each other live leaves b l stems b s roots b r and finally aboveground attached dead matter b ad total vegetation phytomass is the sum of aerial live and attached dead phytomass b l b s b ad and root live phytomass b r daily variations of vegetation phytomass were estimated using a daily carbon budget in which gains and losses of matter to the vegetation system were represented phytomass input to the system was provided by gross photosynthesis photosynthates were first produced within the leaves then allocated to the different compartments using leaf stem and root allocation rates a l a s a r respectively phytomass can then be further respired by the plant senesce or be lost to the plant system above ground senescent matter attached to the live phytomass was lost by litter formation within the plant translocation of reserves from roots to leaves was represented root senescent matter itself was directly lost to the system the daily variation of phytomass in the different compartments was thus expressed as the phytomass arriving at each time step within the compartment minus the phytomass lost to the compartment during the same period eqs 1 4 table 7 a 1 2 photosynthesis and respiration gross photosynthesis p g was expressed as in eq 5 table 7 ε c was fixed at 0 47 szeicz 1974 assuming similar leaf geometry for the flooded and non flooded phases ε i was expressed as a function of leaf area index lai m leaves 2 m ground 2 in eq 6 lai was related to aboveground dry phytomass and computed through a linear relation with leaf phytomass using the sla parameter eq 7 through respiration a large portion of photosynthates are transformed back to co 2 respiration to gross photosynthesis ratios range from 0 35 to 0 8 amthor 2000 indicating that respiration is not negligible and needs to be modelled two respiration processes are usually distinguished in c4 plants for which photorespiration is negligible mccree 1970 growth respiration which occurs as new phytomass is formed and maintenance respiration which includes processes that maintain cellular structures or allow phenotypic adjustments to environmental conditions penning de vries 1975 following early models of respiration thornley 1970 mccree 1970 respiration can be expressed as eqs 8 and 9 maintenance rates can be higher in roots compared to shoots and leaves amthor 1989 leaf respiratory rates were found to be identical in flooded and non flooded conditions for e polystachya piedade et al 1994 because of scarce values in literature g s and m were fixed although they could also be considered as internal variables a 1 3 translocation from roots to aboveground phytomass in perennial grasses root phytomass is not only important for water and nutrient uptake but also enables regrowth at the beginning of the rainy season or after severe grazing events indeed translocation from the roots to the aboveground phytomass occurs mainly at the end of the dry season when growth re initiates or when a critical amount of phytomass has been removed by grazing cutting etc environmental conditions also need to be favorable for growth such as sufficient soil water in this model when a critical amount of root phytomass to sustain the aboveground live phytomass was attained and water for the plant was available in at least one of the soil horizons translocation t r l occurred following eq 10 we assumed that root reserves were only translocated to the leaves so that the plant can photosynthesize immediately no translocation was simulated during a flood event a 1 4 removal of dry matter direct removal of aerial dry matter occurs through cutting events it was assumed that at each removal the aerial phytomass was reduced to a minimum value for each aerial compartment b l min b s min and b ad min following eq 11 a 2 soil tipping bucket water model for non flooded conditions in a non flooded situation water penetrated the first layer during rain or irrigation events or was lost to the plant soil system through drainage dr runoff or direct deep drainage through cracks jointly estimated and noted rn then consecutively filled each layer no rise of the water table into the root zone is considered here considering the depth of the water table in the studied zone when maximum soil water holding capacity for one layer was reached the remaining water drained to the next layer water was also lost through evapotranspiration the daily variation in soil water content in the two horizons were expressed in eqs 12 and 13 daily rainfall and irrigation were input variables canopy transpiration t and surface soil evaporation e s were calculated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 eqs 14 and 17 the fraction of soil covered by vegetation and soil respectively f vg and f s were calculated using eqs 19 and 20 transpiration t was distributed within each soil horizon t h according to eq 15 where ϑ r h was the ratio of root phytomass found within the considered horizon h to the total root phytomass knowing eq 16 transpiration from one horizon therefore increased when roots were well distributed within the horizon if transpiration from one horizon was higher than its maximum potential value i e the quantity of water available within the horizon transpiration was set to this maximum value and the remaining transpiration distributed into the other horizon evaporation e was the sum of surface evaporation es and evaporation emanating from the vertisol cracks when the soil was dry e was set to a minimal value e min to represent crack evaporation ritchie and adams 1974 estimated evaporation from cracks between 0 5 mm and 0 74 mm per day evaporation then was distributed between the different layers of the soil profile following an extinction coefficient which depended on soil water content thickness and depth of each layer rambal and cornet 1982 drainage dr occurred as water percolated from one horizon to the next following the ceres model gabrielle et al 1995 following eq 18 drainage was constrained so that it could not reduce soil water content under its field capacity value and the soil water content of the horizon receiving the drainage could not exceed its saturated value ponding was allowed to fill the first horizon entirely with water runoff deep water drainage rn was calculated as the excess of incoming water after all these processes occurred excess compared to θ 1 sat a 3 climate and resistance models a 3 1 climate variables the climate variables necessary to calculate evapotranspiration are summarized in table 7 and followed the fao recommendations allen et al 1998 a 3 2 resistance models the canopy resistance to water vapor diffusion r sc was calculated from the stomatal resistance r s assuming an inversely proportional relation to lai eq 26 lai active was taken as half of the lai value r s was calculated using the jarvis model jarvis 1976 where the resistance increased with a water stress factor eq 27 the stress factor was calculated for each horizon eq 28 and the minimal value for the two layers was taken as the global stress factor for the soil stress was nil when there was a flood or when at least one horizon had a water content exceeding its field capacity r as and r ac eqs 14 and 17 were set to constants the soil surface resistance r

the grasslands of the tana river delta kenya under changing flooding conditions main plant growth processes are modelled within coupled plant carbon balance and soil water budget modules photosynthesis allocation of photosynthates respiration translocation of root phytomass to aerial phytomass senescence and litter production aerial phytomass can also be subtracted from the system to simulate grazing or cutting new features concern the inclusion of effects of floods on energy conversion efficiency photosynthate allocation senescence and litter production the vegetation model composed of four phytomass compartments leaves stems roots aerial dead matter simulates three main growth phases related to flooding floods a post flood phase and a non flooded phase it was designed to be used with limited climatic data data collected during a 14 month experiment 2010 2012 in the tana river delta kenya in which different irrigation and cutting treatments and flood events were recorded were used for calibration and validation purposes fourteen parameters selected through a sensitivity analysis were calibrated on half of these treatments uncertainty in parameter estimation was expressed through a stochastic ensemble of simulations the remaining independent data were used for model validation overall the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data this model can be used to assess the impact of rain variability grazing or flooding patterns on the annual primary productivity of sub saharan floodplain grasslands composed mainly of echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv in particular simulations for the tana river delta suggest that past changes in the hydrological regime of the river as well as future changes due to the construction of hydroelectric infrastructure have led and will certainly lead to an important decrease of the floodplain grassland productivity as local and regional livestock keeping activities rely heavily on the dry seasons grazing resources available within the wetland future development plans should seriously consider the negative effects of these changes on local activities and livelihoods keywords echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv tana river delta kenya plant growth model 1 introduction 1 1 floodplain grasslands echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv commonly called burgu grass in west africa is a poaceae found in the floodplains of many rivers in sub saharan africa such as the inner delta of the niger river the chad lake the sudd marshes or the delta of the tana river in kenya this species has adapted to alternating floods and harsh dry conditions in areas where potential evaporation can exceed 2200 mm year 1 at malindi kenya woodhead 1968 through physiological modifications this species thrives in floods which can exceed four meters in height and last over six months hiernaux and diarra 1986 françois et al 1989 under such conditions e stagnina has been shown to have extremely high productivities of up to 250 kg ha 1 day 1 hiernaux and diarra 1986 the alternating flooded and non flooded conditions make these floodplain grasslands important ecosystems in the sub saharan context on the one hand they form important spawning zones for freshwater fish during the flooded season thus supporting small holder fishing activities along the rivers on the other hand these same grasslands constitute important grazing zones in the dry season after flood recession compared to the surrounding semi arid grasslands these productive services rendered to local populations are intimately linked to the prevailing hydrological conditions in the context of a renewed interest for large hydroelectric infrastructures in this region of the world where large perennial rivers are seen as untapped resources downstream impacts of such constructions need to be accounted for in particular for the diverse wetland systems many wetland ecosystems have been or are threatened by the modification of the flood regime yet quantifying the direct link between floods and growth rates of the floodplain grasslands using a process based approach has not yet been undertaken the tana river delta trd located in kenya is listed as a wetland of international importance under the ramsar convention since 2012 constituting the second most important deltaic system in eastern africa it has productive and functionally interconnected ecosystems comprising a variety of freshwater floodplain estuarine and coastal habitats although literature is starting to appear concerning its ecosystems and biodiversity hamerlynck et al 2010 2012 uses leauthaud et al 2013b hydrology leauthaud et al 2013a and current development issues duvail et al 2010 2012 there has been no study focusing on its floodplain grasslands yet they constitute important grazing zones as well as habitat to large flocks of migratory birds the trd is also under threat from past maingi and marsh 2002 and future dam constructions on the tana river that have and will further modify the flooding patterns understanding the growth characteristics and productivity of this specific ecosystem is therefore essential to improve its management and conservation 1 2 plant growth models for floodplain grasslands models are important tools for the management of ecosystems concerning floodplain grasslands they constitute an interesting alternative or complementary approach to estimate key variables compared to both in situ long term monitoring and remote sensing techniques firstly because many of these grasslands are located in remote and possibly conflict zones within the sahelian belt second sampling phytomass submerged in several meters of water is challenging finally the use of remote sensing techniques presents at least two drawbacks i estimating phytomass proxies such as leaf area index lai is difficult in mixed water vegetation pixels and ii widely used relationships relating these proxies to standing phytomass do not apply in flooded conditions due to submerged phytomass a growth model of natural vegetation can provide estimates of these variables and quantitative assessments of annual productivity useful for decision makers development of growth models for natural vegetation was brought on by the blooming of crop modelling research which flourished in the 1960s and 1970s at wageningen university van ittersum et al 2003 specific models describing the main ecophysiological processes were developed for different ecosystems and climatic contexts but few if any were devoted to flooded vegetation yet floodplain grasslands show numerous adaptations to floods notably the modification of the allocation of photosynthates piedade et al 1991 plant nutrient status piedade et al 1994 development of aerenchyma voesenek et al 2006 enhancement of shoot elongation kende et al 1998 voesenek et al 2006 and high energy conversion efficiencies piedade et al 1991 which in turn lead to high growth rates and productivity junk et al 1989 existing models which do not take into account these ecophysiological responses are hence inappropriate to simulate floodplain grasslands especially during flood events 1 3 objectives and content the objectives of this paper are therefore twofold i construct a plant model capable of estimating above ground annual phytomass productivity adapted to perennial c4 and semi arid floodplain grasslands ii evaluate changes in above ground phytomass productivity in the case of the tana river delta under different flood scenarios following this introduction section 2 1 describes the floodplain grasslands of the trd in situ vegetation monitoring and the tested flood scenarios section 2 2 describes the model structure with a particular attention given to flood related equations as well as to the approaches taken to estimate model parameters the description of all other equations rather typical for growth models can be found in appendix a results focus first on model evaluation second on model mechanisms concerning the productivity and the water budget at the experimental site and third on the analysis of the flood scenarios section 4 discusses the potentials and limits of the model and the consequences of changing hydrological regimes in the trd kenya 2 materials and methods 2 1 the floodplain grasslands of the tana river delta 2 1 1 the tana river delta the trd extends roughly over 1300 km2 its landscape is formed by a mosaic of grasslands bushland forest farmed land and mangrove according to micro topography and the flood regime of the tana river the latter can overflow twice a year during the long and short rainy seasons apr jul and nov dec respectively its floods are highly beneficial for the deltaic ecosystems and contribute to providing numerous ecosystem services to the local communities including food production through flood recession farming livestock rearing and fishing in addition to the economical and human value of the trd and its floods its complex landscape mosaic forms a biodiversity hotspot hamerlynck et al 2012 butynski and hamerlynck 2015 however the construction of hydroelectric dams between 1968 and 1981 led to a decrease of extent frequency and duration of floods maingi and marsh 2002 a direct consequence of these hydrological changes was a shift in agricultural activities leauthaud et al 2013a which indirectly suggests a change in the productivity of the farmed and managed ecosystems the floodplain grasslands of the trd fig 1 a and b cover approximately 200 km2 within the flat and nearly treeless central floodplains on its outskirts the grassland intertwines with patchy stands of trees and shrubs extending in total over approximately 400 km2 echinochloa stagnina is the dominant species followed by the perennials vossia cuspidata roxb griff and the watercrown grass paspalidium obtusifolium delile n d simpson a thorough description of species can be found in leauthaud et al submitted for publication these grasslands constitute important grazing zones for livestock cattle sheep and goats of the orma and other pastoralist communities and for wild herbivores mostly the african buffalo syncerus caffer and hippopotamus hippopotamus amphibius e stagnina is highly valued by the pastoralists who distinguish its non flooded oba lesa and flooded forms oba kawisa the floodplain alternates between a flooded state during which the entire floodplain can be covered by over 2 m of water during several weeks and a non flooded state in the absence of floods rainfall wets the soil and initiates vegetation growth but is evaporated at a high rate during the dry season the vegetation progressively dries under the semi arid conditions and the soil a deep dark brown and cracking vertisols shrinks as cracks as deep as 2 m appear dominant species of the grassland including e stagnina have a phenological cycle adapted to alternating flooded and non flooded periods growth of e stagnina starts at the beginning of the rainy seasons with the arrival of the floods new internods are produced from the apical meristem and stems elongate echinochloa stagnina can cope with 4 5 cm of daily water increases françois et al 1989 by investing most of its photosynthates into stems the leaves connected to the submerged part of the plant rapidly die off but leaf growth continues above the water surface when undisturbed the leaf canopy thickens in two to three weeks until it completely covers the water surface at the end of the flood stems and leaves fall on the ground and nodal roots develop at this stage livestock enter the floodplains to graze and favour plant rooting by stamping this vegetative regrowth phase lasts until the soil dries up and the aerial part of the plant wilts 2 1 2 in situ vegetation and climate monitoring in semi controlled conditions an experimental site was set up to monitor the growth of the floodplain grasslands in semi controlled conditions the objective was to obtain estimates of above ground dry phytomass adp and other key characteristics of this grassland in contrasted situations in order to estimate model parameters and validate the plant growth model contrasted situations regarding water availability included dry and rainy seasons non flooded flooded and post flood conditions as well as an additional supply of water through irrigation finally cuttings were undertaken at three different intervals to capture the effects of plant canopy dynamics and grazing frequency the experimental site fig 1 b and c 2 18 51 08 s 40 12 39 84 e consisted in a 13 6 m by 17 2 m exclosure that excluded domestic and wild grazers for the whole duration of the experiment the vegetation a typical mix of e stagnina p obtusifolium and v cuspidata was homogeneous within and surrounding the site throughout the experiment within this exclosure three blocks respectively i 0 i 1 and i 2 received different water inputs all received rainfall while i 1 and i 2 received all year round an additional 20 mm or 60 mm of irrigated water every eight days respectively given the climatic conditions a maximum evapotranspiration of about 7 mm day 1 woodhead 1968 the latter corresponded to a non stressed situation within each block three sub blocks with four 1 m2 quadrats each were monitored these sub blocks were cut at three different frequencies noted respectively c 1 c 2 and c 3 nine different irrigation and cutting treatments table 1 were hence applied to 36 quadrats from the 4th of december 2010 to the 1st of march 2012 resulting in a total of 504 adp samples of these 36 and 84 were sampled respectively the day following flood recession 27 12 2011 and during the post flood phase initial root phytomass was also measured by removal of whole plants in addition to adp 20 hemispherical photos were taken throughout the monitoring on contrasting quadrats to estimate corresponding lai a thorough description of the experimental protocol can be found in leauthaud et al submitted for publication the main climate features rainfall at 1 m above ground level and flood occurrence were measured on a daily basis at the experimental site additional daily meteorological data were measured 5 5 km away 2 16 22 07 s 40 11 00 55 e from the 18th of august 2011 onward using a campbell scientific ltd automatic weather station instruments sbs500 hmp155a cs300 apogee pyr p pyranometer meteorological data included rainfall noted r maximum and minimum air temperature t max t min relative humidity rh max rh min and radiation i rainfall and other meteorological variables were recorded respectively at 44 cm and 2 m above ground level total rainfall recorded at the experimental site throughout the 14 month period was 554 mm including events 5 mm temperature oscillated between a mean daily maximum and minimum of 33 8 c and 21 5 c respectively while maximum and minimum measured daily relative humidity were 95 5 and 46 6 respectively mean daily radiation was 20 5 mj two floods occurred at the experimental site during the short rainy season of 2011 lasting 2 and 37 days 5 6 11 2011 and 21 11 2011 27 12 2011 the latter attained a height of 50 cm fig 2 shows all measured variables at the weather station a c or at the experimental site d alongside weather data available at proximate sites for comparison purposes to solve unavoidable missing data issues non existent data points for temperature humidity and wind and radiation were filled in by that of the same julian date from the available record then a 10 day moving average of these variables were calculated to smooth out day to day large variations a minimum daily radiation was set to 15 mj day 1 only 26 days concerned daily rainfall between the experimental site and the meteorological station site were not well correlated cor 0 37 but the daily floating averages over 30 days were well correlated cor 0 82 the latter downscaled to daily values were therefore used to fill in missing rainfall data at the experimental site 2 1 3 flood scenarios the flowing pattern of the tana river is bi modal with peak flows occurring during the long and short rainy seasons five major reservoirs built in the upper basin between 1968 and 1981 significantly modified the hydrological regime of the river with a 20 decrease in the peak flows of may maingi and marsh 2002 with a current mean discharge at the delta inlet of 3 3 km3 year 1 calculated over the period 2002 2011 the discharge of the tana river accounts for over 95 of total water input into the delta leauthaud et al 2013b due to high variability of rainfall in the upper catchment and reservoir operation flooding in the deltaic floodplains is relatively unpredictable no floods can occur in dry years while one to two major floods can be observed during rainy years estimations of current flood extents and duration are provided leauthaud et al 2013a in non extreme years and for the current topography of the delta flood extent can exceed 300 km2 furthermore floods over 200 km2 occurred on average once a year with a mean duration of 18 days in the past floods most certainly lasted longer and were more frequent leauthaud et al 2013a in link with higher discharges ten annual climatic and flood scenarios were therefore simulated to assess the impact of changing hydrological conditions on floodplain grassland growth scenarios sc1 sc3 represent years with no floods for respectively a dry 30 rainfall with respect to a normal year normal simulated 554 mm rainfall or wet year 30 rainfall with respect to a normal year scenarios sc4 sc7 represent years with one flood either during the long or short rainy season and different extents and duration finally sc8 sc10 represent years in which two floods a year occur with different extents and duration these scenarios represent the range of non exceptional floods and climate in the trd simulated flood characteristics are summarized in table 2 2 2 model description 2 2 1 general model structure the model fig 3 simulates the growth of a c4 perennial floodplain grassland at a daily time step using the forcing variables reported in table 3 vegetation is represented by four compartments which interact with each other a leaf compartment b l where photosynthesis takes place a stem compartment b s required to reproduce the rapid growth observed during floods a root compartment b r where storage occurs allowing inter annual variations in phytomass for perennial grasses and finally an above ground attached dead matter b ad compartment main processes for plant growth are modelled photosynthesis allocation of photosynthates respiration translocation of root phytomass to aerial phytomass senescence and litter production aerial phytomass can also be subtracted from the system to simulate grazing or cutting model development was widely inspired by available semi arid grassland models mougin et al 1995 cayrol et al 2000 nouvellon et al 2000 no temperature nor nitrogen effects on growth processes are explicitly represented for this c4 floodplain grassland new features concern the inclusion of specific effects of floods on growth processes variable energy conversion efficiency photosynthate allocation senescence and litter production the model was constructed to be used with scarce climatic data these data if not inexistent are rare in the regions where these type of c4 floodplain grasslands prevail as such the model is a rather simplified representation of vegetation but still provides a realistic description of the grassland production as the main biophysical processes are taken into account the model was coded in r version 2 1 12 r development core team 2008 and is available upon demand symbols for variables parameters and constants are specified respectively in tables 4 6 the main equations describing the different processes are found in table 7 and described in detail in appendix a the next paragraph and equations described in table 8 focus specifically on the flood related processes 2 2 2 flood related processes 2 2 2 1 representation of water in the model the model simulates three main growth phases related to floods a non flooded a flooded and a post flooded phase noted respectively nf f and pf all water related changes are represented in three manners intrinsically connected to the water contents θ h m3 m 3 of the two soil horizons h1 h2 i a binary presence absence switch which signals the flooded phase ii equations describing growth processes including θ h as an explanatory variable and iii different parameter values for the three flood status variables and parameters differenciated by the subscript i for the different plant compartments are hence further distinguished by subscripts j and h respectively representing the flood status and soil horizons in the nf phase considered typical of a non flooded semi arid grass cover growth is strongly related to soil water availability thus the plant carbon module is explicitly connected to a soil water module which simulates the impact of water stress on plant growth processes when floods occurred the binary switch was set to flooded conditions and θ h automatically set to their saturated value in each horizon θ h sat post flooded conditions during which growth can be important is not explicitly represented but relies on θ h variations in time it was considered that the pf phase occurred when soil water content within h2 was higher than its field capacity θ 2 fc processes impacted by floods are detailed in the following sections while the typical water bucket module equations can be found in table 7 and are described in appendix a 2 2 2 2 photosynthesis photosynthesis depends on the solar radiation reaching the plant and the latter s ability to capture and use this solar energy gross photosynthesis p g can be expressed as in eq 5 table 7 using the climatic interception and conversion efficiency coefficients respectively ε c mj mj 1 ε i and ε e gdm mj 1 echinochloa polystachya h b k hitchcock a grass found in the amazon floodplains exhibits high net primary production under flooded conditions with a mean rate of dry matter production per unit of solar radiation intercepted close to the considered maximum for c4 species piedade et al 1991 piedade et al 1994 even postulate that internal co 2 diffusion from the co2 rich waters to the leaves could occur under flooded conditions boosting even more photosynthesis under dry conditions factors like water nutrient and temperature influence the rate of co2 intake of the plant water stress reduces co2 diffusion through stomatal closure high temperatures can also induce stomatal closure however the latter is limited for e stagnina due to the specific c4 pathway especially in the range of climate conditions considered here the nitrogen status of the plant also affects photosynthesis rates but in a less extent for c4 species in this model we therefore assumed that the conversion coefficient efficiency in non flooded conditions depended solely on soil water content ε e eq 32 table 8 was maximum ε emax f when the grassland was flooded then decreased linearly until the soil water content reached its field capacity θ fc at this point and until θ α θ fc the soil held enough water for the plant not to be stressed and ε e stayed constant at its maximum level for non flooded conditions noted ε emax nf at lower soil water contents ε e decreased linearly to reach zero at the wilting point θ wp the conversion efficiency ε e was expressed as the maximum of its value calculated for each soil horizon eq 31 assuming the plant s ability to capture resources where available within the soil 2 2 2 3 allocation of photosynthates photosynthates were allocated within the plant according to the flooded status as well as rules related to ratios regulating phytomass distribution between the leaf shoot and root compartments in non flooded and post flood conditions priority was given to the roots to insure there were enough roots to sustain aerial phytomass then the remaining photosynthates was divided between the stem and leaf compartments for non flooded vegetation root to aerial ratios noted r r a range from 0 7 1 to 4 1 and generally between 0 8 1 and 1 5 1 gould and shaw 1983 it could however be lower for e stagnina as its root system is not very developed hiernaux unpublished data in the model allocation to roots noted a r was considered nil if the root to aerial ratio of the day was higher than r r a eq 33 table 8 if not the translocation from leaves to root noted t l r required to attain r r a was calculated on a daily basis as eq 34 photosynthates were allocated to roots as long as the required amount did not exceed gross photosynthesis eq 33 remaining photosynthates were then shared between the stems and the leaves in the same manner the translocation from leaf to stem noted t l s required to attain the stem to aboveground phytomass ratio noted r s a was calculated as in eq 37 r s a was distinguished for non flooded nf and flooded f conditions as e stagnina exhibited different leaf to aerial ratios for non flooded and flooded conditions photosynthates were allocated to the stem compartment as long as the required amount did not exceed remaining photosynthates p g t l r eq 36 the allocation coefficient to leaves was then calculated in eq 38 in flooded conditions the plant needs to produce above water leaf phytomass and develop stem phytomass to keep up with the rising water roots could be less necessary as adventitious roots can uptake nutrients in the nutrient rich water piedade et al 1991 estimated on average that 30 7 and 5 5 of photosynthates were allocated to the leaves and roots the rest going to stem growth in flooded conditions root allocation was set to a constant value to insure rapid growth rates for leaves at the beginning of the flood indeed the canopy of e stagnina thickens rapidly at the beginning of a flood photosynthates were as a priority allocated to the leaf compartment to favour photosynthesis corresponding to a maximal leaf allocation a lmax rate and to a minimum stem allocation rate allowing the plant to stay above water when leaf growth was high enough to intercept all the incoming light corresponding to a theoretical leaf phytomass noted b l laimax eq 7 photosynthates were progressively allocated to the stem compartment until reaching a maximal stem allocation value and a minimal leaf allocation value a lmin at a leaf phytomass of γ a b l laimax in eq 39 the allocation coefficient to stems was then calculated using eq 41 2 2 2 4 senescence senescence occurs within each compartment of a plant and is related to plant age and environmental conditions under dry conditions senescence of c4 perennial grasses depends firstly on soil water availability for grasses under dry conditions nouvellon et al 2000 suggest that senescence rates vary from 0 0074 to 0 14 and cayrol et al 2000 note similar values in the present model daily senescence for non flooded conditions and for the two aerial compartments noted s l nf and s s nf depended on a senescent coefficient s i gdm gdm 1 day 1 on the phytomass of each compartment and a water stress effect f s θ eq 43 which can double senescence rates f s θ was the water stress effect within the horizon with the highest water content senescence rates can be much higher in flooded conditions especially for the leaves as the latter die with rising water piedade et al 1991 report a leaf turnover rate of 34 days for e polystachya h b k hitchcock a first estimation of the leaf senescent rate is thus the solution of a differential equation assuming 1 of original phytomass was left after 34 days of flooding the daily senescent rate of the stems under flooded conditions was taken as 5 of this initial value senescence rate of roots was set to a constant value for all flood status 2 2 2 5 litter production and decomposition of senescent matter dead material can decompose directly on the plant or fall to the ground as litter these two processes depend primarily on the composition of senescent matter silver and miya 2001 de neiff et al 2006 bontti et al 2009 on the microbial environment singhal et al 1992 gamage and asaeda 2005 and on the physical environment such as climate grazing events singhal et al 1992 or flooded conditions junk and furch 1991 found that loss of dry weight was lower in terrestrial conditions compared to aquatic conditions with respectively a 30 and 75 decrease of dry weight for sphenoclea zeylanica in two weeks considering this main difference in flooded and terrestrial conditions removal of dead mass from the plant system was calculated as eq 44 table 8 a decomposition rate of 20 in one week was found for e polystachya h b k hitchcock under flooded conditions furch and junk 1992 considering this representative of both litter formation and dead material decomposition in tropical floodplain grasslands a first estimation of l f was calculated with the same type of differential equation as for the senescence coefficient while l nf was taken as 10 of this initial value 2 2 3 parameter estimation the experimental dataset composed of nine distinct treatments within the exclosure was split into two independent groups for the calibration and validation procedures using in each phase contrasted series respectively i 0 c 2 i 1 c 1 i 1 c 3 i 2 c 2 and i 0 c 1 i 0 c 3 i 1 c 2 i 2 c 1 i 2 c 3 the model was composed of over 45 equations and comprised 50 parameters the latter were estimated in three distinct manners fifteen soil and vegetation parameters were calculated from available experimental data a sensitivity analysis was then undertaken on the remaining 35 parameters to identify those inducing strong variations of aboveground cut phytomass an ensemblist approach was used for these sensitive parameters to select an ensemble of equifinal parameter sets remaining parameters were set to values found in the literature parameters used and their final range of values are reported in table 5 2 2 3 1 in situ determination of key soil and vegetation parameters the soil at the experimental site characterized by a high clay content table 9 was of the vertisol type bulk dry density was low 0 95 1 08 due to the swelling of the clays at measurement time during the rainy season and a high concentration of organic matter 6 11 soil field capacity and permanent wilting point were calculated using the richard s method on soil aggregates initial soil water content for the different layers was determined by sampling and drying in an oven at 105 c for 24 h because of the similar hydrological characteristics of the second and third horizons the soil was modelled as a superposition of two horizons noted h h1 0 5 cm and h2 5 65 cm as the root system was restricted to the first 65 cm of soil all water draining through the second horizon at 65 cm was considered lost to the soil plant atmosphere system five vegetation parameters were estimated from field data specific leaf area sla eq 7 table 7 two leaf phytomass adp allometry parameters allowing to calculate the shoot to aerial ratio r s a an extinction coefficient k 2 eq 20 table 7 and initial root phytomass calculation of sla was undertaken in two phases as concomitant b l and lai values required to solve eq 7 were not available leaf phytomass was first estimated using a linear regression and available b l and adp data not exceeding 200 g p value 1 r 2 0 99 fig 4 a 1 then sla was calculated through a linear regression between lai and the estimated values of b l p value 1 r 2 0 87 fig 4a the two leaf allometry parameters linking b l to adp for flooded and non flooded conditions β nf β f respectively eq 35 were determined by linear regression p value 1 r 2 0 95 r 2 0 98 respectively fig 4b the fourth vegetation parameter k 2 was estimated from a set of hemispherical photos taken for contrasted adp processed using caneye 6 3 these photos provided estimates of lai and f g k 2 was determined from the resulting lai f vg exponential relationship using a linear model p value 1 r 2 0 93 fig 4c finally measured per plant root phytomass was 0 51 0 22 g considering a 20 loss due to the extraction process and a mean plant density of 42 10 within the quadrats led to an initial root phytomass estimated at 25 g m 2 all analyses were performed using the r software and packages 2 2 3 2 selection of parameters to estimate through a sensitivity analysis the aim of the sensitivity analysis was to screen for the most influential parameters on the output variables among a large number of parameters the morris method was chosen morris 1991 it consisted in defining the elementary effect of each parameter characterized by a mean μ and variance σ the range over which the parameters were analyzed was defined by available literature in the case where only one reference was found its value was modified by 20 high mean μ or variance σ indicated a strong influence of the parameter on the model s outputs or strong interactions with other parameters respectively so that parameters with high μ or σ were retained for calibration six sensitivity analyses comprising contrasted irrigation cutting and flooded conditions using i 0 c 1 and i 1 c 2 for non flooded flooded and post flood conditions were undertaken to investigate the sensitivity of total cut phytomass to parameter values one month of climatic data was used for the analyses of the whole 50 parameters of the model 15 appeared to either strongly influence total cut phytomass or have strong interactions with other parameters in at least one of the six sensitivity analyses fig 5 leaf phytomass remaining after cutting b lmin i0 b lmin i1 blmin i 2 was sensitive in all tests directly related to lai eq 7 this parameter influenced photosynthesis dynamics respiration related parameters m gs eqs 8 and 9 were sensitive variables for four tests in the same way as initial phytomasses these parameters strongly influenced the amount of photosynthates arriving in the plant system initial leaf phytomass b l initial sensitive because the short simulated period enhanced its relative contribution to total cut phytomass was fixed to a minimal value hereafter four parameters used to calculate efficiency factors ε i e max f α ε emax nf and ε e k 1 as well as two parameters related to allocation decisions between the different compartments r r a b smin also appeared in the sensitivity tests finally three parameters describing growth dynamics in flooded conditions al max s lf llit f additionally appeared in the tests where these conditions were simulated fourteen parameters in relation to major processes occurring mostly photosynthesis respiration and allocation were hence calibrated in the next step estimation of sensitive parameters by an ensemblist approach in the bayesian approach parameters and hence output variables are probability distribution functions which are used to estimate the uncertainty linked to parameter estimation the prior probability distribution is updated using observed data using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 method parameters ranges were estimated in a five step approach first random and independent sets of parameters were generated all parameters were given a uniform prior distribution using the same range as the sensitivity analyses see table 5 for values second the likelihood measure to select the acceptable parameter sets was defined as the root mean squared error rmse 45 rmse 1 n adp obs adp sim 2 where adp obs and adp sim are the observed and simulated aboveground total dry phytomasses and n the number of data points used the threshold of acceptability in retaining a parameter set was defined as rmse 100 gdm m 2 third the plant model was ran with each parameter set 20 000 sets and the sets with an rmse value under the threshold of acceptability were retained during this calibration phase four of the nine treatments i 0 c 2 i 1 c 1 i 1 c 3 i 2 c 2 were used fourth the combined model parameter sets were validated using the remaining treatments i 0 c 1 i 0 c 3 i 1 c 2 i 2 c 1 i 2 c 3 for which validation rmse noted rmse v was calculated in a fifth and final step the uncertainty ranges of the output variables were calculated as the 10th and 90th percentiles obtained from the likelihood weighted simulations using the retained parameter sets a group of 84 sets of parameters was selected during the glue procedure rmse for the calibration phase ranged between 91 and 99 gdm m 2 rmse v for the validation phase was slightly higher ranging between 95 and 107 gdm m 2 these parameter sets are equifinal and were used to define the uncertainty range due to parameter estimation all remaining parameters were set to a fixed value by referring to literature 2 2 4 quality assessment of the final model the quality of the estimations of adp using the combined model parameter sets was assessed using four indicators the absolute maximum error ame q the mean absolute error mae q the model efficiency eff q and root mean square error rmse q table 10 observed and simulated variables were ranges of values due to the existence of replicates and multiple parameter sets respectively to take these uncertainty ranges into account the relative error adp obs adp sim was defined as the difference between the envelope boundaries for the observed and simulated values defined by the standard deviation and the 10th to 90th percentiles respectively when the envelope boundaries superposed relative error was set to zero see leauthaud et al 2013a for similar method 3 results 3 1 model evaluation simulated variables using the model and the selected 84 parameter sets were compared to available measured variables namely adp and lai fig 6 comparisons were undertaken for a wide range of measured adp values ranging from 2 to 835 gdm m 2 although data were more dispersed at higher values simulated and measured adp compare relatively well for all treatments interestingly estimated uncertainty due to parameter calibration was of the same order of magnitude as measured variability calculated from the repetitions for each treatment concerning lai despite the large range of measurements model prediction for the non flooded canopy was in relatively good agreement with the experimental data simulated lai for flooded situations is slightly underestimated at higher values lai 5 simulated adp and root phytomass are shown for all nine treatments of the experimental site fig 7 simulated adp was close to observed values for most occurrences the rapid growth rates during the flooded events were reproduced resulting in maximal observed and simulated adp at the end of the flood except for i 2 c 3 however taking into account growth duration 16 32 and 64 for c 1 c 2 and c 3 respectively and 37 days for the flooded period standing phytomass per growth day was maximal for the flooded phase in all treatments rmse q for the combined model 84 sets of parameters was 7 8 gdm m 2 and the mae q was 0 60 gdm m 2 the efficiency eff q of the model was 0 95 while ame q was 322 gdm m 2 for a measured average of 187 35 gdm m 2 3 2 mechanisms of the model 3 2 1 effect of floods irrigation and cutting treatments mean daily growth rates are depicted for observed and simulated phytomass as a function of flood status cutting and irrigation treatments fig 8 the goal here was not to undertake statistical tests to estimate the effects of the various treatments but rather to compare the observed and simulated growth rates under contrasted situations observed and simulated datasets showed the same trends when analyzing the effect of floods and irrigation comforting the validity of the model concerning these aspects concerning the flooded status mean growth rates were maximal during the flooded phase 11 9 12 2 gdm m 2 day 1 respectively for observed and simulated average and high mean growth rates were maintained after the floods 7 8 8 2 gdm m 2 day 1 idem compared to the non flooded situation 5 1 6 8 gdm m 2 day 1 idem the high variability observed in flooded conditions fig 8 a can be attributed to the different irrigation and cutting treatments during the non flooded phase water inputs through irrigation had a clear effect on growth rates the latter were lowest when no irrigation occurred modality i 0 1 2 2 5 gdm m 2 day 1 compared to modalities i 1 and i 2 5 8 7 1 gdm m 2 day 1 6 5 8 3 gdm m 2 day 1 on the contrary growth rates for modalities i 1 and i 2 were of the same order of magnitude suggesting that maximum water use efficiency was achieved for modality i 1 mean observed and simulated data were of the same order of magnitude for all cutting treatments 3 2 2 soil water dynamics and budget measured soil moisture values were not available for this study instead modelled soil water dynamics were visually checked to ensure their coherence and are illustrated here for two treatments and one parameter set fig 9 water inputs by rainfall irrigation or floods induced rapid responses in water outflows soil water outflows logically increased with irrigation fig 9 from left to right peak soil evaporation highly variable due to soil water availability and changing lai occurred just after rainfall or irrigation events and rapidly declined as the first soil horizon dried up maximum simulated soil evaporation was 6 7 mm day 1 transpiration declined abruptly at each cutting event then gradually increased with plant development to reach a maximum value of 7 8 mm day 1 when fully irrigated both values were of the same order of magnitude as estimated potential evapotranspiration 6 9 mm day 1 woodhead 1968 water was lost to the soil plant system after important water inflows concerning the soil water budget total water inputs to the plant soil system varied between 715 mm and 3869 mm during the whole duration of the experiment table 11 representing a wide range of situations when irrigated the latter represented the major water input into the soil water system 55 83 floods were the smallest input into the system 1 33 but represented the only inflow during the flooded phase contributing between 1 9 and 7 5 mm day 1 to the water budget water outflows were represented by plant transpiration t soil evaporation e drainage d from the second horizon and runoff deep water drainage rn see appendix a except for the highly irrigated situation i 2 transpiration was the major component of the budget for the different treatments the latter increased with irrigation and higher vegetation cover c 3 modality the second main component was evaporation the latter remained relatively stable when non irrigated 239 308 mm in irrigated situations however evaporation decreased with increased vegetation cover c 3 modality to the advantage of transpiration drainage of the second horizon and runoff deep water drainage rn were negligible for all treatments 39 79 mm except for irrigation modality i 2 in this case a large part of water inputs was lost to the soil plant system by runoff deep water drainage 1697 1867 mm compared to 3683 3869 mm of water inputs for irrigation treatment i 2 this is concordant with estimated potential evapotranspiration for the region 2200 mm year 1 woodhead 1968 which limits the amount of water transferred to the atmosphere however as no cracks were observed for this irrigation modality rn was probably overestimated to the detriment of drainage d which suggests that water dynamics and distribution for irrigation modality i 2 could be less well simulated in the model compared to modalities i 0 and i 1 3 3 analysis of flood scenarios annual growth per hectare more than tripled between the different simulated scenarios ranging for the average value fig 10 a between 9 5 t ha 1 sc 1 and 30 t ha 1 sc 10 growth per hectare was lowest for the non flooded dry scenario sc 1 7 6 12 1 t ha 1 and highest for the year with two long floods sc 10 26 9 33 9 t ha 1 growth per hectare was generally higher when two floods a year occurred compared to one flood a year compared to no floods climate scenarios simulated for the non flooded situations sc 1 sc 3 had an impact on growth with annual mean production increasing by 70 to attain 16 4 t ha 1 14 4 19 1 t ha 1 growth in non flooded but rainy years was of the same order of magnitude as the lowest annual production for a simulation with one flood 16 5 t ha 1 14 6 19 0 t ha 1 finally comparison between flooding scenarios of the long and short rainy seasons e g sc4 sc6 sc5 sc7 suggest that floods during the long rainy season could induce better growth than floods that occurred during the short rainy season this could be due to different climatic conditions although a multi annual analysis would be required to investigate this matter annual grass growth for the entire 200 km2 floodplain fig 10 b ranged from 1 9 105 tons 1 5 2 4 105 t to 6 105 tons 5 4 6 8 105 t total production was highly dependent on flood extent within the 200 km2 grassland comparing with a year with the same climate small floods of 50 km2 did not produce a significant increase of total floodplain production sc 5 and sc 7 compared to sc 2 on the contrary longer and larger floods of 200 km2 during 40 days induced large increases 4 1 and 3 7 5 t for sc4 and sc6 respectively to be compared to 2 3 105 tons for sc 2 highest total annual production was attained for two long floods in a year corresponding to scenario sc 10 6 105 t 5 4 6 8 105 t 4 discussion 4 1 originality of the study and possible further developments this study constitutes to our knowledge the first attempt to model the beneficial effects of floods on the primary productivity of a semi arid c4 floodplain grassland the model is suitable to simulate the annual productivity of these grasslands under different flood regimes by making explicit the link between production and floods compared to previous grassland models the present one expands three processes to incorporate these effects specific allocation rules for flooded conditions and increased senescence and litter decomposition during the flooded period despite large variability in measured values the model is able to reproduce the general trends observed in the experimental dataset concerning especially the effect of floods and irrigation furthermore maximal estimated and observed growth rates at the experimental site were 107 150 kg ha 1 day 1 10th to 90th percentiles and 190 35 kg ha 1 day 1 which are of the same order of magnitude as other estimates available for e stagnina grasslands 60 120 kg ha 1 day 1 hiernaux and diarra 1986 and 200 250 kg ha 1 day 1 françois et al 1989 all recorded after a flooded phase conceptually the model was constructed as a simplified but realistic representation of the floodplain grasslands to be used with scarce climatic data other than the limited physiological knowledge for this species this choice was in accordance with the fact that the model could be calibrated only on aboveground phytomass data however the model is mostly based on widely acknowledged growth mechanisms grounding its roots in the multi decadal developments in this domain in the same way of thinking calibration was undertaken for a large variety of conditions to obtain a generic model capable of simulating a wide range of situations special attention was also given to estimating an uncertainty range for the calibration of the sensitive yet unknown model parameters finally the model was calibrated and validated using a valuable diverse and large dataset of over 500 samples from an on site experimental field which is rare for this type of vegetation future developments could focus on analysing different flood regimes and their representation within the model radically different floods height and duration would indeed be out of the reasonable simulation range of the model speed of water increase could be an important variable to incorporate when simulation of sudden deaths due to rapidly increasing floods is sought after long term floristic and regeneration processes may not be sufficiently taken into account for pluriannual simulations as dams decreased the frequency of the floods in the trd maingi and marsh 2002 the model was calibrated during a period in which floods were less frequent compared to past situations so that the calibrated model could lead to an under estimation of the primary productivity for regularly flooded situations developing further these aspects would require more observations especially of soil water content and vegetation characteristics during and after diverse flood events finally estimations of key parameters concerning photosynthesis respiration and senescence rates for leaves stems and roots would be precious in all cases a combination of observations and modeling exercises is required to further improve our knowledge on these type of grasslands 4 2 fate of the highly productive tana river delta grasslands and insight on the impact on ecosystem services the tana river delta is formed by an intertwinement of different dry and wet ecosystems notwithstanding these extremely productive and diverse ecosystems it is also one of the poorest locations in the country the deltaic ecosystems and local communities are under severe pressure through decreasing land and water availability leauthaud et al 2013b resulting in lethal clashes over local resources kirchner 2013 contrasting views on development potentials and pathways for this wetland co exist on the one hand large scale agro investments promise increased economic returns and on the other hand environmental non governmental organizations voice alternative development pathways and promote local development based on communities traditional livelihoods arevalo et al 2014 in both cases local participation and active involvement in decision making as well as sharing pertinent and accurate information with the different stakeholders are key to achieve long term success of any development plan yet these are rarely taken into account this paper reveals high growth rates for the floodplain grasslands of the trd what benefits arise from such high productivities omengo et al 2016 rule out the long term c sink potential within this floodplain and hence its role in climate change mitigation nevertheless floodplain grasslands provide shelter for fish thus contributing to high reproduction rates favourable for fishing activities second these grasslands are both foraging grounds for large flocks of numerous species of migratory birds of international importance and the main pastureland for the large community of hippopotamus residing in its centre hence sustaining part of the high biodiversity established in the trd last but not the least these grasslands form drought grazing areas for the local and regional livestock keepers nunow 2013 estimated that the delta hosted over 3 million head of livestock during the drought year 2009 this study confirms the strong link between floods and pastoral resources as flooding conditions are themselves dependent on river discharge leauthaud et al 2013b it is reasonable to assert that changes in the hydrological regime of the tana river have and will induce impact grassland productivity although simulated scenarios should be taken with precaution and further work is needed to better understand post flood growth it is highly probable that past changes in the hydrological regime of the tana river due to the construction of hydroelectric infrastructure maingi and marsh 2002 had a negative effect on pastoral activities in the region considering sc 5 and sc 10 representative of the current and pre dam situation a 35 decrease of annual grass production has been estimated with the further construction of the grand falls dam grass production will further decrease accentuated during the dry years 50 estimated decrease compared to pre dam conditions these grasslands constitute a highly palatable forage françois et al 1989 musco et al 2016 sanou et al 2016 and are vital for livestock keepers at key moments in a drought cycle as land and water resources are excised to establish plantations and settle landless households from the more densely populated areas of the country nunow 2013 with few or no regards of the significance of these areas for the pastoral systems and livelihoods the dwindling grasslands value increases combined land grabbing land fragmentation restriction on mobility and restriction to decreasing water related resources are particularly damaging to a majority of pastoralists quantitative analyses as undertaken in this study can and should be undertaken for the other major services arising from the grasslands fishing biodiversity from the other deltaic ecosystems and at the basin scale they will help better inform decision makers and local stakeholders on the consequences of development plans they will also contribute to a better evaluation of the wide array of ecosystem services provided by the tana river hurford and harou 2014 botzen et al 2015 for which alternative scenarios to national water master plan 2030 flagship project of the high grand falls dam would be better appreciated one promising option is an alternative management of upstream hydroelectic infrastructures enabling flood releases that could ensure the provision of downstream ecosystem services while optimizing the production of renewable energy the water food energy nexus is very relevant to river basin management and this case in particular quantitative analyses of ecosystem services combined with local participation in decision making could lead to new transformation pathways and hence a step towards achieving the objectives of sustainable development especially on food security water management and biodiversity 5 conclusions this study presents a coupled plant carbon balance and soil water budget model adapted to seasonally flooded c4 semi arid grasslands this model can be used to understand the impact of floods and management patterns on the annual productivity of sub saharan floodplain grasslands composed mostly of echinochloa stagnina retz p beauv it was described and calibrated using data collected in the tana river delta kenya during a 14 month experiment during which different irrigation and cutting treatments and flood events were recorded sensitivity analyses showed that a limited number of parameters strongly affected annual productivity during the calibration process fourteen parameters were calibrated on half the experimental data and the model validated on the remaining data overall the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data simulations for the tana river delta suggest that past changes in the hydrological regime of the river as well as future changes due to the construction of the high grand falls dam have led and will lead to an important decrease of the floodplain grassland productivity as local and regional livestock keeping activities rely heavily on the dry season grazing resources available within the wetland and therefore on flood occurrences future development plans should seriously consider the negative effects of this project on local activities and livelihoods this study could help define alternative management scenarios such as artificial flood releases required to maintain downstream ecosystem services in particular fodder production acknowledgements this

thanks to k otoi and the villagers of onkolde as well as to q luke for his botanical expertise appendix a plant growth model a 1 vegetation module a 1 1 vegetation dynamics vegetation was represented by four compartments which interact with each other live leaves b l stems b s roots b r and finally aboveground attached dead matter b ad total vegetation phytomass is the sum of aerial live and attached dead phytomass b l b s b ad and root live phytomass b r daily variations of vegetation phytomass were estimated using a daily carbon budget in which gains and losses of matter to the vegetation system were represented phytomass input to the system was provided by gross photosynthesis photosynthates were first produced within the leaves then allocated to the different compartments using leaf stem and root allocation rates a l a s a r respectively phytomass can then be further respired by the plant senesce or be lost to the plant system above ground senescent matter attached to the live phytomass was lost by litter formation within the plant translocation of reserves from roots to leaves was represented root senescent matter itself was directly lost to the system the daily variation of phytomass in the different compartments was thus expressed as the phytomass arriving at each time step within the compartment minus the phytomass lost to the compartment during the same period eqs 1 4 table 7 a 1 2 photosynthesis and respiration gross photosynthesis p g was expressed as in eq 5 table 7 ε c was fixed at 0 47 szeicz 1974 assuming similar leaf geometry for the flooded and non flooded phases ε i was expressed as a function of leaf area index lai m leaves 2 m ground 2 in eq 6 lai was related to aboveground dry phytomass and computed through a linear relation with leaf phytomass using the sla parameter eq 7 through respiration a large portion of photosynthates are transformed back to co 2 respiration to gross photosynthesis ratios range from 0 35 to 0 8 amthor 2000 indicating that respiration is not negligible and needs to be modelled two respiration processes are usually distinguished in c4 plants for which photorespiration is negligible mccree 1970 growth respiration which occurs as new phytomass is formed and maintenance respiration which includes processes that maintain cellular structures or allow phenotypic adjustments to environmental conditions penning de vries 1975 following early models of respiration thornley 1970 mccree 1970 respiration can be expressed as eqs 8 and 9 maintenance rates can be higher in roots compared to shoots and leaves amthor 1989 leaf respiratory rates were found to be identical in flooded and non flooded conditions for e polystachya piedade et al 1994 because of scarce values in literature g s and m were fixed although they could also be considered as internal variables a 1 3 translocation from roots to aboveground phytomass in perennial grasses root phytomass is not only important for water and nutrient uptake but also enables regrowth at the beginning of the rainy season or after severe grazing events indeed translocation from the roots to the aboveground phytomass occurs mainly at the end of the dry season when growth re initiates or when a critical amount of phytomass has been removed by grazing cutting etc environmental conditions also need to be favorable for growth such as sufficient soil water in this model when a critical amount of root phytomass to sustain the aboveground live phytomass was attained and water for the plant was available in at least one of the soil horizons translocation t r l occurred following eq 10 we assumed that root reserves were only translocated to the leaves so that the plant can photosynthesize immediately no translocation was simulated during a flood event a 1 4 removal of dry matter direct removal of aerial dry matter occurs through cutting events it was assumed that at each removal the aerial phytomass was reduced to a minimum value for each aerial compartment b l min b s min and b ad min following eq 11 a 2 soil tipping bucket water model for non flooded conditions in a non flooded situation water penetrated the first layer during rain or irrigation events or was lost to the plant soil system through drainage dr runoff or direct deep drainage through cracks jointly estimated and noted rn then consecutively filled each layer no rise of the water table into the root zone is considered here considering the depth of the water table in the studied zone when maximum soil water holding capacity for one layer was reached the remaining water drained to the next layer water was also lost through evapotranspiration the daily variation in soil water content in the two horizons were expressed in eqs 12 and 13 daily rainfall and irrigation were input variables canopy transpiration t and surface soil evaporation e s were calculated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 eqs 14 and 17 the fraction of soil covered by vegetation and soil respectively f vg and f s were calculated using eqs 19 and 20 transpiration t was distributed within each soil horizon t h according to eq 15 where ϑ r h was the ratio of root phytomass found within the considered horizon h to the total root phytomass knowing eq 16 transpiration from one horizon therefore increased when roots were well distributed within the horizon if transpiration from one horizon was higher than its maximum potential value i e the quantity of water available within the horizon transpiration was set to this maximum value and the remaining transpiration distributed into the other horizon evaporation e was the sum of surface evaporation es and evaporation emanating from the vertisol cracks when the soil was dry e was set to a minimal value e min to represent crack evaporation ritchie and adams 1974 estimated evaporation from cracks between 0 5 mm and 0 74 mm per day evaporation then was distributed between the different layers of the soil profile following an extinction coefficient which depended on soil water content thickness and depth of each layer rambal and cornet 1982 drainage dr occurred as water percolated from one horizon to the next following the ceres model gabrielle et al 1995 following eq 18 drainage was constrained so that it could not reduce soil water content under its field capacity value and the soil water content of the horizon receiving the drainage could not exceed its saturated value ponding was allowed to fill the first horizon entirely with water runoff deep water drainage rn was calculated as the excess of incoming water after all these processes occurred excess compared to θ 1 sat a 3 climate and resistance models a 3 1 climate variables the climate variables necessary to calculate evapotranspiration are summarized in table 7 and followed the fao recommendations allen et al 1998 a 3 2 resistance models the canopy resistance to water vapor diffusion r sc was calculated from the stomatal resistance r s assuming an inversely proportional relation to lai eq 26 lai active was taken as half of the lai value r s was calculated using the jarvis model jarvis 1976 where the resistance increased with a water stress factor eq 27 the stress factor was calculated for each horizon eq 28 and the minimal value for the two layers was taken as the global stress factor for the soil stress was nil when there was a flood or when at least one horizon had a water content exceeding its field capacity r as and r ac eqs 14 and 17 were set to constants the soil surface resistance r ss depended on the soil water content of the first layer camillo and gurney 1986 as in eq 30

stormwater to reduce the risk of flooding we define urban gi as all the pervious green spaces within the urban study area on both private and public properties first we introduce the method for mapping the supply of flood reduction services from existing urban gi a high resolution urban digital model was used to distinguish between permeable and impermeable areas at fine scale with a precision of 25 cm next we classified the pervious areas based on their soils vegetation construction materials and land cover coverage utilizing the scs soil conservation service curve number cn method usda soil conservation service 1972 to quantify runoff generation at the catchment scale regions generating more runoff are assumed to generate greater flood risk because the analysis is carried out at the catchment and not the watershed scale watershed slopes are ignored flood reduction capacity is evaluated using two indices i the amount of runoff reduced by green spaces δv zhang et al 2012 and ii the runoff reduction coefficient cr secondly we analyzed the demand for flooding reduction through the computation of a vulnerability index vi which represents the vulnerability of local population and buildings to urban flooding the method was applied to the historical urban center of dolo a highly urbanized area in northern italy the analysis was replicated for 24 scenarios of rain events emerging from the combination of three factors i precipitation depth ii antecedent moisture condition of soils and iii conditions of initial abstraction finally we matched the flooding reduction capacity of urban gi with the respective demand for such service in order to identify priority areas of intervention where to urgently mitigate potential flooding events 2 methods 2 1 study

high intensity short duration rainfall events generated runoff in excess of the conveyance capacity of the local drainage infrastructure generating extreme flood damage municipality of dolo 2012 2 2 high resolution urban digital model a high resolution urban digital model of all of the pervious and impervious elements both public and private within the historical urban center of dolo and their relative heights was generated from a variety of data sets soil maps were generated by processing spatial data obtained from lidar light detention and ranging survey using arcgis 10 3 esri an aerial survey commissioned by the metropolitan city of venice administration in 2014 produced 4000 high resolution images then a 3d digital model of the area was created with the dense image matching technique hirschmüller 2008 raster images dsm digital surface model and dtm digital terrain model were generated with a precision of 25 cm pixel 0 25 m the dsm reports the altimetric data of all natural and anthropogenic elements namely impervious in a specific area while the dtm reports the morphology of the territory without anthropogenic elements and vegetation maragno et al 2015 finally a digital atlas was created to distinguish between permeable and impermeable areas in grid squares of 25 25 cm the atlas also reports the elevation of each element allowing the three dimensional volumes of all natural e g bushes and trees and anthropogenic e g buildings elements to be computed 2 3 gi and ground coverage classification since the remote sensing surveys provided three dimensional datasets the urban vegetation could have classified according to the height tall vegetation 1 5 m and short vegetation 1 5 m a field survey was performed in order to improve the digital atlas and correct bias due to the presence of ornamental plants in terraces or roofs the areas classified as tall vegetation i e urban trees were detailed depending on the ground coverage beneath them this correction was necessary because soil physical properties are determinant factors affecting urban flooding and runoff holman dodds et al 2003 the impervious surfaces were further classified by the material type for their capacity to retain water and promote infiltration through field survey descriptions for each ground coverage type are presented in table 1 the analysis was carried out at both the lot and section scales firstly the study area was classified in private and public properties subsequently private properties were subdivided into lots using polygons drawn around individual property units public areas were subdivided into zone destinations using the procedures of panduro and veie 2013 urban sections boundaries were derived from the italian national institute of statistic istat and represent the minimum territorial units inside municipalities where census records are collected 2 4 runoff calculation the generation of urban runoff was modeled using the scs curve number cn method usda soil conservation service 1972 this model estimates rainfall runoff i e urban flooding generated by rainfall based on ground coverage soil type and precipitation the model calculation is computed on three parameters precipitation depth initial abstraction and potential maximum storage of soil and it is based on the following equations 1 q p i a 2 p i a s p i a 0 p i a 2 s 25400 c n 254 3 i a λ s where q is the rainfall runoff depth mm p is the precipitation depth mm s is the potential maximum water storage in soil mm cn is the tabulated value of curve number dimensionless ranging from 0 to 100 ia is the initial abstraction of rainfall mm and λ is the initial abstraction coefficient constant the cn values were derived from hawkins et al 2009 and mainly depends on corresponding soil coverage type described in section 2 3 hydrological soil group hsg and antecedent moisture condition amc the higher is the cn value the higher is the runoff generated by a ground surface in a rain event the contribution of urban pervious and impervious areas to runoff generation and reduction was calculated at both property and urban section levels at the property level the overall cn for each unit was calculated as weighted average of values for respective areas as follow 4 c n p i c n i a i i a i where the cnp is the weighted curve number of the property p cni and ai are the curve number and the area of the i soil coverage type respectively at urban section level the total runoff depth was computed considering the values of each polygon 5 q s q p a p a s where qs and qp are the runoff depth mm and as and ap are the areas of the s urban section and of p property respectively 2 5 mapping runoff flooding reduction capacity in order to estimate the contribution of each spatial unit to runoff reduction two indexes were calculated the amount of runoff reduced by green spaces δv in m3 zhang et al 2012 and the runoff reduction coefficient cr yao et al 2015 these indexes express the reduction of surface runoff provided by the presence of urban green spaces and pervious surfaces and therefore are proposed in this analysis as a proxy for the capacity to deliver the es of urban flood reduction δv quantifies the general benefit provided by green spaces in terms of runoff volume reduction calculated as follow 6 δ v i 0 001 q b q i a i where δv is the runoff reduction m3 qb is the runoff depth mm generated by a hypothetical scenario in which all existing green spaces are replaced by 100 impervious surfaces cn 98 qi is the runoff depth mm generated by the spatial unit given its actual configuration of green spaces and ai is the area of each spatial unit inside the computation area cr represent the efficiency in runoff reduction the index was calculated as follow 7 c r δ v 0 001 p a 1 where cr is runoff reduction coefficient adimensional ranging between 0 and 1 δv is the runoff reduction m3 p is the daily rainfall depth mm and a the area m2 of each urban section this index expresses the capacity of pervious surfaces of each area i e section to avoid flooding events and therefore can be considered as an indicator for this es a higher δv means greater potential hydrologic benefits provided by existing urban green space whereas a higher cr indicates less need to improve future urban water flow management in a specific urban section 2 6 scenario analysis the flood reduction capacity was evaluated for different scenarios which simulate the potential conditions of rainfall and flood generation depending on three factors i rainfall depth pi four precipitation values ii the antecedent moisture condition amc and iii the ia values the four precipitation depths considered in the analysis were 10 45 90 and 160 mm table 2 these values were chosen according to their relevance on planning decisions in fact the 10 mm and 45 mm precipitation depths correspond to the mean and high average daily values respectively a three hourly precipitation depth of 90 mm was calculated by the municipal water plan municipality of dolo 2012 as the capacity threshold of the urban drainage network finally the daily rainfall depth of 160 mm was the most extreme event recorded 2009 by the regional agency for environmental protection arpav nrcs classifies three amc classes representing the relative moisture before the rainfall event dry amc i moderate normal amc ii and wet amc iii conditions since soil absorption capacity is lower in wet soils cn values attributed to a specific soil coverage with a specific hsg should be corrected for the antecedent conditions cn for amc iii amc ii amc i the initial abstraction coefficient λ is usually defined equal to 0 2 usda soil conservation service 1972 however some studies proposed different values particularly for urban areas lim et al 2006 ling and yusop 2014 therefore we built the scenarios considering two values of ia 0 2 and 0 05 accordingly the analysis of δv and cr was performed for the 24 scenarios deriving from the combination of the three factors pi amc ia 2 7 assessing flooding reduction demand since the flow of ess is defined as the intersection between the supply capacity described in this study by the eq 7 and the demand burkhard et al 2012 the latter is fundamental to inform urban planning the demand for the flood reduction service was calculated as a function of people and buildings vulnerability derkzen et al 2017 8 v i i x 1 i x 2 i x n i where vii is vulnerability index of the i section xni are the single vulnerability for each of the n parameter adjusted for 0 to 1 of the i section describing local population and buildings vulnerability see supplementary materials the index is based on the expectation that some population e g children elderly people and foreigners and building categories e g buildings with poor or bad status conditions are more susceptible to the consequences of urban flooding all the parameters computed in eq 9 are assumed to have the same importance i e weight the vi was calculated per each urban section with the statistical data from the national census source istat 2 8 priority areas of intervention in order to orient urban planning to implement mitigation actions a ranking of the priority areas of intervention i e section ranking was provided through a priority index pri as follows 9 p r i v i 1 q s 1 c r where vi is the vulnerability index qs is the generated runoff depth mm and cr is the reduction coefficient under the hypothesis of the most pessimistic scenario i e amc iii and ia 0 05 all the parameters were calculated at urban section level we assume that i the lower is the cr es supply the higher is the potential benefit that could be reached by the inclusion of new gi in the related urban section ii the higher are the vulnerability of local population and buildings es demand and the urban runoff q the higher is priority for intervention hence the priority of intervention will be attributed to urban sections where i the mismatch between es demand and supply is higher and ii the runoff is larger 3 results 3 1 spatial analysis of green infrastructures the spatial analysis reveals that gi is unevenly distributed in the historical urban center of dolo and that the existing gi is fragmented and scattered fig 1 pervious areas cover 43 6 of the total study area small patches of tall vegetation mainly characterize the pervious areas within dolo urban center except for an urban park at the east side of the study area with tallest vegetation up to 29 m table 3 shows the ground cover distribution for the study area subdivided into public and private properties 3 2 flooding reduction supply capacity fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the runoff depth generated under the 24 different scenarios considering the combinations of amc ia and precipitations the results at section levels are presented in table 4 the relative contributions of public and private areas to the total runoff roughly follow those of the respective total areas the capacity of urban green spaces to mitigate runoff e g cr values under different values of amc and ia are shown in fig 3 public and private surfaces contribute differently to the total runoff and showed different performances of flooding reduction in eight urban sections out of nine private properties generate more runoff than public ones under the worst scenario conditions table 4 the same trend can be observed also for runoff depth and for cr i e the contribution of gi to reduce rainfall runoff with higher es performances for public areas than private proprieties since cr depends on precipitation as well as on soil conditions and initial abstractions the index was modeled under a rainfall gradient for the different amc and ia values fig 4 a b this analysis allows identifying the optimal precipitation value to which the es provision capacity of the study area is maximum the maximum cr values range within 0 345 and 0 389 observed at the rainfall values of 13 and 103 mm respectively according to the different combinations of biophysical factors 3 3 flooding reduction demand the vulnerability indices vi for all the urban sections of the municipality of dolo are shown in fig 5 a and table 5 the highest vi values were computed for no 5 which lies in the northeastern part of the study area this ranking is due principally to population and to a lesser extent buildings conditions the center population is densely inhabited by more vulnerable categories of people such as children and elderly the sections with a higher demand of the flooding reduction service are those with the larger percentages of public properties sections 5 and 9 table 5 3 4 priority rank of intervention table 5 shows the pri values calculated for the four rainfall depths considered in the scenarios considering with amc iii and ia 0 05 fig 5b shows the pri computed considering runoff and cr at the rainfall depth of 90 mm corresponding to the critical threshold for drainage network according to the municipality water plan municipality of dolo 2012 with amc iii and ia 0 05 these values for antecedent moisture condition and initial abstraction were chosen for the priority rank calculation according a conservative approach in fact they represent the worst possible conditions for runoff mitigation the values for pri as well as for the single components vi runoff and cr are shown in table 5 according to the results the urgency of interventions for improving the green infrastructures in the study area should be focused on sections 8 and 3 these sections show higher values of generated runoff and the lower for cr despite section 5 has the highest vi value its low ranking is due to a good level of cr performed meaning that even though this area is vulnerable the urban green spaces can mitigate flooding events sections 1 and 7 are those with the lower ranking score meaning lowest priority of intervention 4 discussion the study proposes a new methodology to incorporate a consideration of the runoff capture flood mitigation capacity of urban gi into urban climate change planning the model spatially analyses the supply and demand of water regulation es in an attempt to fill the gap between es theory and practice in urban areas specifically with respect to flooding the analysis of es provision capacity maps the potential of urban gi to mitigate urban flooding problems associated with runoff the cr and runoff depth values were combined with vulnerability index to obtain the priority rank of intervention pri for urban sections the results clearly show several urban priority areas sections 8 and 3 are those with higher pri values high pri scores for these sections are due to the lowest cr and high runoff values rather than to high levels of vulnerability this means that interventions in these zones should be aimed to increase the extension and quality of green spaces lower pri scores were obtained for sections 1 and 7 section 1 showed a lower level of vulnerability and a higher performance of cr suggesting that the conservation of current level of es may be obtained by the maintenance of current gi in section 7 a lower priority was mainly due to the lower runoff values specific attention should be payed to section 5 observed as the most vulnerable in fact even though the analysis did not highlight high priority of intervention for this section the higher observed level of vulnerability suggests monitoring this area with particularly attention in case of intense rainfall events since the higher runoff amount is generated by private surfaces an incentive based mechanism for private owners may be effective in promoting the increase of green spaces and pervious surfaces in the study area in general and in urban areas more prone to runoff generation for example the biotope area factor baf bauen and becker 1990 is an urban greening policy tools designed to improve the ecosystem s functionality and improve the development of biotopes in city centers measures can be applied also to public areas to improve their contribution to urban runoff mitigation the installation of rain gardens is demonstrated to increase water infiltration and absorption by collecting water from parking roofs and other pervious surfaces davis et al 2009 the increase and maintenance of green spaces would also lead to multiple benefits provided by urban vegetation as air depuration from chemical and particulate pollution grote et al 2016 microclimate regulation by mitigating heat waves gillner et al 2015 carbon storage fares et al 2017 and amelioration of urban landscape aesthetic southon et al 2017 in addition efforts for increasing people awareness to the role of green infrastructures to support human well being may be effective to orient citizens choices in their private proprieties due to the extreme heterogeneity of build up areas high resolution data are needed to capture different components of urban green spaces at fine scale maragno 2016 such as urban vegetation of trees grass and bushes which are providers of different ecological functions davies et al 2011 jim and chen 2008 the use of lidar derived information allowed the mapping of vegetation structure at fine scale when these data are modeled and integrated with information concerning local es demand the analysis can inform urban planning by prioritizing measures and actions at urban section scale where flooding reduction is more urgently needed as resulting from the es demand and supply analyses in general the use of remote sensing technics to map ess is a key challenge for the es science dawson et al 2016 many studies process images derived by passive sensors e g satellite scenes to obtain land cover maps of vegetation indexes used to model es in space and time de araujo barbosa et al 2015 the use of products derived by the use of active sensors lefsky et al 2002 such as lidar allows the access of three dimensional information on vegetation and for this reason has greater potential in mapping vegetation structure at finer scale detecting spatial variation of vegetation structure is fundamental for mapping ess in urban ecosystems lehmann et al 2014 in this study information on vegetation height was used to discriminate areas covered by tall vegetation from grass and bushes grouped as short vegetation however field surveys were necessary to avoid erroneous interpretations for tall vegetation due for example by the presence of single trees growing on small flowerbeds surrounded by impervious surfaces rather than by permeable soil e g grass some limitations related to the scs method for runoff modelling should be considered for example specific values for cn and initial abstraction should be calibrated on measured data in the study area to obtain reliable results since no empirical data were available for the study area the uncertainties related to the amc and ia parameters were managed by combining all the possible values in the 24 scenarios to obtain a final range of values amc varies according to the previous climatic conditions and can be adjusted to describe the moisture conditions according to ward and trimble 2004 furthermore values for initial abstraction ia can differ largely as well the soil conservation service defines ia equal to 0 02 nonetheless some studies highlighted that this value could not be reliable when applied to urban landscapes lim et al 2006 ling and yusop 2014 showed that the most adopted value for this parameter in urban contexts is 0 05 because of the above mentioned uncertainties the analysis was performed accounting a set of the combinations of amc amc i ii iii and ia values 0 02 and 0 005 additional limitations concern the intrinsic simplification of the model for instance slope and pipes and other hydraulic features were not considered hydrological behavior of impervious surfaces is complex to predict as preferential runoff paths are the result of interactions with drainage systems as well as presence of temporary and permanent barriers fletcher et al 2013 in this study the scs model was applied on the urban historical center of dolo which represents only a portion of the urban catchment area in this case the runoff depends only on the excess of rainfall in the area and not to the contribution of rainfall coming from other areas of the catchment as for dolo the model did not consider the interaction among areas i e among proprieties as well as among urban sections the approach is focused on the individual contribution of each area in order to understand potential priority areas of intervention to control and manage the total water flows in the urban area moreover urban soils are difficult to be studied and sampled because they are usually severely disturbed and show highly variable infiltration rates pitt et al 1999 our method overcomes the difficulties in sampling disturbed urban soils by considering pervious and impervious surface which influence runoff formation yang et al 2015 in any case the output of the proposed method provides a qualitative ranking of the different zones i e urban sections for priority of intervention rather than a quantitative assessment for drainage infrastructure calculation moreover the use of normalized values as in the case of pri computation can mitigate the bias due to the use of indirect measures in es studies e g gaglio et al 2017 the elaboration of the results obtained from the analysis performed at private property scale leads to issues related to the use and publication of data concerning private properties for this reason the outcomes of this analysis should be strictly managed by public bodies under protocols dealing with confidentiality and privacy regulation in order to guarantee the correct use as well as the privacy of citizens data it has to be mentioned that the pri considers all the parameters as equally important see eq 9 however the index can be corrected according stakeholder perception and or local conditions through attributing different weight at the single component finally the cr response along a rainfall gradient was studied under the different combinations of amc and ia fig 4a and b since climate change are expected to increase the frequency and the magnitude of rainfall extreme events the response of cr along a precipitation gradient can be used to project the response of runoff mitigation service to future climate change fig 4a and b suggest that the capacity of green infrastructures of the study area to regulate extreme events will decrease as a consequence of climate change in fact cr values tend to decrease together with the increase of rainfall depth the effects of amc seem more sensible to the rainfall variation while those due to ia values are more relevant for determining the maximum value of cr for this reason direct measures of both soil condition and initial abstraction are important for the accuracy of runoff mitigation maximum cr values correspond to the breaking point of the curve after which the cr performance declines fig 4a and b the saturation of water retention capacity of urban green spaces during severe rainfall events and the consequent release of the excess surface water more quickly mainly causes this decrease yao et al 2015 information on the rainfall depths corresponding to the maximum cr values represent the threshold over which the es declines these thresholds may be used to activate specific early warning measures to protect the most vulnerable population from flooding the different performances of rainwater retention capacity under the three different soil moisture conditions suggest that es provision depends on the climatic conditions occurring before the extreme event practically urban planning decisions should carefully consider precipitation pattern variations within the context of climate change in order to improve adaptation strategies 5 conclusions climate change forces decision makers to adaptation governance measures to mitigate risks related to the increased frequency of extreme events transferring es assessment from theory to practice has great potential to support and inform such decisions especially in urban areas the development of tools that integrate es supply and demand is a key challenge for the future planning and management of the most vulnerable areas such urban ecosystems this study elaborated a method for the identification of priority areas of intervention for the management of urban green infrastructures which could be applied even without the availability of runoff field measurements the qualitative approach can assist in the identification of cost effective measures to prioritize the need for gi management in different zones the analysis also provides the estimation of es demand under climate change the projected increase of precipitation intensity is likely to overcome the gi capacities to mitigate rainfall runoff information on es responses to climate change are fundamental to inform environmental managers towards more sustainable governance remote sensing techniques have a great potential in supporting es supply mapping in urban centers by providing high resolution maps and

impact the quality of life and human safety hammond et al 2015 because it was typically designed to convey historical design storms conventional urban drainage infrastructure is often ineffective at

2015 an increasing number of studies have described the es that can potentially be delivered by urban gi endreny et al 2017 pappalardo et al 2017 pulighe et al 2016 wang et al 2014 but very few tools have been put forth to enable their incorporation in urban decision making processes e g kabisch 2015 nikodinoska et al 2018 a joint analysis of es supply and demand could be used to inform decision making processes around es delivery burkhard et al 2012 gissi and garramone 2018 the supply of es is defined as the capacity of a particular planning area or ecosystem to provide es burkhard et al 2012 while the demand for es is defined as those es that are recognized or desired by beneficiaries or end users in the study area wolff et al 2015 such an approach would help to transfer the es

direct use or consumption of goods and services among these the need for risk reduction can be used for assess demand of flood mitigation liquete et al 2013 nedkov and burkhard 2012 by identifying priority areas for es management and protection es can be incorporated into a wide range of local efforts to adapt to climate change for example snäll et al 2016 demonstrated that spatial conservation prioritization could represent a suitable tool for gi design allowing cost effective allocation of conservation efforts verhagen et al 2017 mapped capacity and demand for five es at european level they found that ignoring es demand led to the siting of interventions in remote regions where the es benefits to society were small this paper presents a new planning tool that utilizes remote sensing and census data to model the supply and demand for urban flood reduction services through gi the study focuses on flood reduction es provided by gi defined as the capacity of urban gi to absorb urban stormwater to reduce the risk of flooding we define urban gi as all the pervious green spaces within the urban study area on both private and public properties first we introduce the method for mapping the supply of flood reduction services from existing urban gi a high resolution urban digital model was used to distinguish between permeable and impermeable areas at fine scale with a precision of 25 cm next we classified the pervious areas based on their soils vegetation construction materials and land cover coverage utilizing the scs soil conservation service curve number cn method usda soil conservation service 1972 to quantify runoff generation at the catchment scale regions generating more runoff are assumed to generate greater flood risk because the analysis is carried out at the catchment and not the watershed scale watershed slopes are ignored flood reduction capacity is evaluated using two indices i the amount of runoff reduced by green spaces δv zhang et al 2012 and ii the runoff reduction coefficient cr secondly we analyzed the demand for flooding reduction through the computation of a vulnerability index vi which represents the vulnerability of local population and buildings to urban flooding the method was applied to the historical urban center of dolo a highly urbanized area in northern italy the analysis was replicated for 24 scenarios of rain events emerging from the combination of three factors i precipitation depth ii antecedent moisture condition of soils and iii conditions of initial abstraction finally we matched the flooding reduction capacity of urban gi with the respective demand for such service in order to identify priority areas of intervention where to urgently mitigate potential flooding events 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area comprises the historical urban center of the municipality of dolo coordinates 45 25 29 57 n 12 04 32 92 e located inside the metropolitan area of venice italy the municipality of dolo covers 24 8 km2 and has a total population of approximately 15 000 inhabitants of which 4226 live inside the historical urban center 1 67 km2 it is located within the watershed of the venice lagoon the climate of the study area is classified as b1 humid according to the thornthwaite classification feddema 2005 with an average temperature is 13 2 c mean rainfall ranges from 600 and 1100 mm yr 1 with an annual average of 912 mm the mean annual reference evapotranspiration is 730 mm aschonitis et al 2017 historically the wettest month is may 94 4 mm while the driest is january 49 9 mm the hydraulic soil group of this area is classified as b type according to the usda nrcs classification nrcs 1986 soils belonging to this category typically have between 10 and 20 clay and 50 to 90 sand with a loamy sand or sandy loam texture usda 2009 the historical urban center of dolo is frequently subjected to urban flooding events because of an inadequately sized urban drainage system and large amount of impervious surfaces municipality of dolo 2012 evidence of the effects of climate change has been detected and studied by bixio 2009 a 60 year analysis 1956 2010 of precipitation patterns in the venice lagoon drainage basin where dolo is situated reveals an intensification of events rainfall accompanied by simultaneous reduction in annual precipitation totals in september 2007 several high intensity short duration rainfall events generated runoff in excess of the conveyance capacity of the local drainage infrastructure generating extreme flood damage municipality of dolo 2012 2 2 high resolution urban digital model a high resolution urban digital model of all of the pervious and impervious elements both public and private within the historical urban center of dolo and their relative heights was generated from a variety of data sets soil maps were generated by processing spatial data obtained from lidar light detention and ranging survey using arcgis 10 3 esri an aerial survey commissioned by the metropolitan city of venice administration in 2014 produced 4000 high resolution images then a 3d digital model of the area was created with the dense image matching technique hirschmüller 2008 raster images dsm digital surface model and dtm digital terrain model were generated with a precision of 25 cm pixel 0 25 m the dsm reports the altimetric data of all natural and anthropogenic elements namely impervious in a specific area while the dtm reports the morphology of the territory without anthropogenic elements and vegetation maragno et al 2015 finally a digital atlas was created to distinguish between permeable and impermeable areas in grid squares of 25 25 cm the atlas also reports the elevation of each element allowing the three dimensional volumes of all natural e g bushes and trees and anthropogenic e g buildings elements to be computed 2 3 gi and ground coverage classification since the remote sensing surveys provided three dimensional datasets the urban vegetation could have classified according to the height tall vegetation 1 5 m and short vegetation 1 5 m a field survey was performed in order to improve the digital atlas and correct bias due to the presence of ornamental plants in terraces or roofs the areas classified as tall vegetation i e urban trees were detailed depending on the ground coverage beneath them this correction was necessary because soil physical properties are determinant factors affecting urban flooding and runoff holman dodds et al 2003 the impervious surfaces were further classified by the material type for their capacity to retain water and promote infiltration through field survey descriptions for each ground coverage type are presented in table 1 the analysis was carried out at both the lot and section scales firstly the study area was classified in private and public properties subsequently private properties were subdivided into lots using polygons drawn around individual property units public areas were subdivided into zone destinations using the procedures of panduro and veie 2013 urban sections boundaries were derived from the italian national institute of statistic istat and represent the minimum territorial units inside municipalities where census records are collected 2 4 runoff calculation the generation of urban runoff was modeled using the scs curve number cn method usda soil conservation service 1972 this model estimates rainfall runoff i e urban flooding generated by rainfall based on ground coverage soil type and precipitation the model calculation is computed on three parameters precipitation depth initial abstraction and potential maximum storage of soil and it is based on the following equations 1 q p i a 2 p i a s p i a 0 p i a 2 s 25400 c n 254 3 i a λ s where q is the rainfall runoff depth mm p is the precipitation depth mm s is the potential maximum water storage in soil mm cn is the tabulated value of curve number dimensionless ranging from 0 to 100 ia is the initial abstraction of rainfall mm and λ is the initial abstraction coefficient constant the cn values were derived from hawkins et al 2009 and mainly depends on corresponding soil coverage type described in section 2 3 hydrological soil group hsg and antecedent moisture condition amc the higher is the cn value the higher is the runoff generated by a ground surface in a rain event the contribution of urban pervious and impervious areas to runoff generation and reduction was calculated at both property and urban section levels at the property level the overall cn for each unit was calculated as weighted average of values for respective areas as follow 4 c n p i c n i a i i a i where the cnp is the weighted curve number of the property p cni and ai are the curve number and the area of the i soil coverage type respectively at urban section level the total runoff depth was computed considering the values of each polygon 5 q s q p a p a s where qs and qp are the runoff depth mm and as and ap are the areas of the s urban section and of p property respectively 2 5 mapping runoff flooding reduction capacity in order to estimate the contribution of each spatial unit to runoff reduction two indexes were calculated the amount of runoff reduced by green spaces δv in m3 zhang et al 2012 and the runoff reduction coefficient cr yao et al 2015 these indexes express the reduction of surface runoff provided by the presence of urban green spaces and pervious surfaces and therefore are proposed in this analysis as a proxy for the capacity to deliver the es of urban flood reduction δv quantifies the general benefit provided by green spaces in terms of runoff volume reduction calculated as follow 6 δ v i 0 001 q b q i a i where δv is the runoff reduction m3 qb is the runoff depth mm generated by a hypothetical scenario in which all existing green spaces are replaced by 100 impervious surfaces cn 98 qi is the runoff depth mm generated by the spatial unit given its actual configuration of green spaces and ai is the area of each spatial unit inside the computation area cr represent the efficiency in runoff reduction the index was calculated as follow 7 c r δ v 0 001 p a 1 where cr is runoff reduction coefficient adimensional ranging between 0 and 1 δv is the runoff reduction m3 p is the daily rainfall depth mm and a the area m2 of each urban section this index expresses the capacity of pervious surfaces of each area i e section to avoid flooding events and therefore can be considered as an indicator for this es a higher δv means greater potential hydrologic benefits provided by existing urban green space whereas a higher cr indicates less need to improve future urban water flow management in a specific urban section 2 6 scenario analysis the flood reduction capacity was evaluated for different scenarios which simulate the potential conditions of rainfall and flood generation depending on three factors i rainfall depth pi four precipitation values ii the antecedent moisture condition amc and iii the ia values the four precipitation depths considered in the analysis were 10 45 90 and 160 mm table 2 these values were chosen according to their relevance on planning decisions in fact the 10 mm and 45 mm precipitation depths correspond to the mean and high average daily values respectively a three hourly precipitation depth of 90 mm was calculated by the municipal water plan municipality of dolo 2012 as the capacity threshold of the urban drainage network finally the daily rainfall depth of 160 mm was the most extreme event recorded 2009 by the regional agency for environmental protection arpav nrcs classifies three amc classes representing the relative moisture before the rainfall event dry amc i moderate normal amc ii and wet amc iii conditions since soil absorption capacity is lower in wet soils cn values attributed to a specific soil coverage with a specific hsg should be corrected for the antecedent conditions cn for amc iii amc ii amc i the initial abstraction coefficient λ is usually defined equal to 0 2 usda soil conservation service 1972 however some studies proposed different values particularly for urban areas lim et al 2006 ling and yusop 2014 therefore we built the scenarios considering two values of ia 0 2 and 0 05 accordingly the analysis of δv and cr was performed for the 24 scenarios deriving from the combination of the three factors pi amc ia 2 7 assessing flooding reduction demand since the flow of ess is defined as the intersection between the supply capacity described in this study by the eq 7 and the demand burkhard et al 2012 the latter is fundamental to inform urban planning the demand for the flood reduction service was calculated as a function of people and buildings vulnerability derkzen et al 2017 8 v i i x 1 i x 2 i x n i where vii is vulnerability index of the i section xni are the single vulnerability for each of the n parameter adjusted for 0 to 1 of the i section describing local population and buildings vulnerability see supplementary materials the index is based on the expectation that some population e g children elderly people and foreigners and building categories e g buildings with poor or bad status conditions are more susceptible to the consequences of urban flooding all the parameters computed in eq 9 are assumed to have the same importance i e weight the vi was calculated per each urban section with the statistical data from the national census source istat 2 8 priority areas of intervention in order to orient urban planning to implement mitigation actions a ranking of the priority areas of intervention i e section ranking was provided through a priority index pri as follows 9 p r i v i 1 q s 1 c r where vi is the vulnerability index qs is the generated runoff depth mm and cr is the reduction coefficient under the hypothesis of the most pessimistic scenario i e amc iii and ia 0 05 all the parameters were calculated at urban section level we assume that i the lower is the cr es supply the higher is the potential benefit that could be reached by the inclusion of new gi in the related urban section ii the higher are the vulnerability of local population and buildings es demand and the urban runoff q the higher is priority for intervention hence the priority of intervention will be attributed to urban sections where i the mismatch between es demand and supply is higher and ii the runoff is larger 3 results 3 1 spatial analysis of green infrastructures the spatial analysis reveals that gi is unevenly distributed in the historical urban center of dolo and that the existing gi is fragmented and scattered fig 1 pervious areas cover 43 6 of the total study area small patches of tall vegetation mainly characterize the pervious areas within dolo urban center except for an urban park at the east side of the study area with tallest vegetation up to 29 m table 3 shows the ground cover distribution for the study area subdivided into public and private properties 3 2 flooding reduction supply capacity fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the runoff depth generated under the 24 different scenarios considering the combinations of amc ia and precipitations the results at section levels are presented in table 4 the relative contributions of public and private areas to the total runoff roughly follow those of the respective total areas the capacity of urban green spaces to mitigate runoff e g cr values under different values of amc and ia are shown in fig 3 public and private surfaces contribute differently to the total runoff and showed different performances of flooding reduction in eight urban sections out of nine private properties generate more runoff than public ones under the worst scenario conditions table 4 the same trend can be observed also for runoff depth and for cr i e the contribution of gi to reduce rainfall runoff with higher es performances for public areas than private proprieties since cr depends on precipitation as well as on soil conditions and initial abstractions the index was modeled under a rainfall gradient for the different amc and ia values fig 4 a b this analysis allows identifying the optimal precipitation value to which the es provision capacity of the study area is maximum the maximum cr values range within 0 345 and 0 389 observed at the rainfall values of 13 and 103 mm respectively according to the different combinations of biophysical factors 3 3 flooding reduction demand the vulnerability indices vi for all the urban sections of the municipality of dolo are shown in fig 5 a and table 5 the highest vi values were computed for no 5 which lies in the northeastern part of the study area this ranking is due principally to population and to a lesser extent buildings conditions the center population is densely inhabited by more vulnerable categories of people such as children and elderly the sections with a higher demand of the flooding reduction service are those with the larger percentages of public properties sections 5 and 9 table 5 3 4 priority rank of intervention table 5 shows the pri values calculated for the four rainfall depths considered in the scenarios considering with amc iii and ia 0 05 fig 5b shows the pri computed considering runoff and cr at the rainfall depth of 90 mm corresponding to the critical threshold for drainage network according to the municipality water plan municipality of dolo 2012 with amc iii and ia 0 05 these values for antecedent moisture condition and initial abstraction were chosen for the priority rank calculation according a conservative approach in fact they represent the worst possible conditions for runoff mitigation the values for pri as well as for the single components vi runoff and cr are shown in table 5 according to the results the urgency of interventions for improving the green infrastructures in the study area should be focused on sections 8 and 3 these sections show higher values of generated runoff and the lower for cr despite section 5 has the highest vi value its low ranking is due to a good level of cr performed meaning that even though this area is vulnerable the urban green spaces can mitigate flooding events sections 1 and 7 are those with the lower ranking score meaning lowest priority of intervention 4 discussion the study proposes a new methodology to incorporate a consideration of the runoff capture flood mitigation capacity of urban gi into urban climate change planning the model spatially analyses the supply and demand of water regulation es in an attempt to fill the gap between es theory and practice in urban areas specifically with respect to flooding the analysis of es provision capacity maps the potential of urban gi to mitigate urban flooding problems associated with runoff the cr and runoff depth values were combined with vulnerability index to obtain the priority rank of intervention pri for urban sections the results clearly show several urban priority areas sections 8 and 3 are those with higher pri values high pri scores for these sections are due to the lowest cr and high runoff values rather than to high levels of vulnerability this means that interventions in these zones should be aimed to increase the extension and quality of green spaces lower pri scores were obtained for sections 1 and 7 section 1 showed a lower level of vulnerability and a higher performance of cr suggesting that the conservation of current level of es may be obtained by the maintenance of current gi in section 7 a lower priority was mainly due to the lower runoff values specific attention should be payed to section 5 observed as the most vulnerable in fact even though the analysis did not highlight high priority of intervention for this section the higher observed level of vulnerability suggests monitoring this area with particularly attention in case of intense rainfall events since the higher runoff amount is generated by private surfaces an incentive based mechanism for private owners may be effective in promoting the increase of green spaces and pervious surfaces in the study area in general and in urban areas more prone to runoff generation for example the biotope area factor baf bauen and becker 1990 is an urban greening policy tools designed to improve the ecosystem s functionality and improve the development of biotopes in city centers measures can be applied also to public areas to improve their contribution to urban runoff mitigation the installation of rain gardens is demonstrated to increase water infiltration and absorption by collecting water from parking roofs and other pervious surfaces davis et al 2009 the increase and maintenance of green spaces would also lead to multiple benefits provided by urban vegetation as air depuration from chemical and particulate pollution grote et al 2016 microclimate regulation by mitigating heat waves gillner et al 2015 carbon storage fares et al 2017 and amelioration of urban landscape aesthetic southon et al 2017 in addition efforts for increasing people awareness to the role of green infrastructures to support human well being may be effective to orient citizens choices in their private proprieties due to the extreme heterogeneity of build up areas high resolution data are needed to capture different components of urban green spaces at fine scale maragno 2016 such as urban vegetation of trees grass and bushes which are providers of different ecological functions davies et al 2011 jim and chen 2008 the use of lidar derived information allowed the mapping of vegetation structure at fine scale when these data are modeled and integrated with information concerning local es demand the analysis can inform urban planning by prioritizing measures and actions at urban section scale where flooding reduction is more urgently needed as resulting from the es demand and supply analyses in general the use of remote sensing technics to map ess is a key challenge for the es science dawson et al 2016 many studies process images derived by passive sensors e g satellite scenes to obtain land cover maps of vegetation indexes used to model es in space and time de araujo barbosa et al 2015 the use of products derived by the use of active sensors lefsky et al 2002 such as lidar allows the access of three dimensional information on vegetation and for this reason has greater potential in mapping vegetation structure at finer scale detecting spatial variation of vegetation structure is fundamental for mapping ess in urban ecosystems lehmann et al 2014 in this study information on vegetation height was used to discriminate areas covered by tall vegetation from grass and bushes grouped as short vegetation however field surveys were necessary to avoid erroneous interpretations for tall vegetation due for example by the presence of single trees growing on small flowerbeds surrounded by impervious surfaces rather than by permeable soil e g grass some limitations related to the scs method for runoff modelling should be considered for example specific values for cn and initial abstraction should be calibrated on measured data in the study area to obtain reliable results since no empirical data were available for the study area the uncertainties related to the amc and ia parameters were managed by combining all the possible values in the 24 scenarios to obtain a final range of values amc varies according to the previous climatic conditions and can be adjusted to describe the moisture conditions according to ward and trimble 2004 furthermore values for initial abstraction ia can differ largely as well the soil conservation service defines ia equal to 0 02 nonetheless some studies highlighted that this value could not be reliable when applied to urban landscapes lim et al 2006 ling and yusop 2014 showed that the most adopted value for this parameter in urban contexts is 0 05 because of the above mentioned uncertainties the analysis was performed accounting a set of the combinations of amc amc i ii iii and ia values 0 02 and 0 005 additional limitations concern the intrinsic simplification of the model for instance slope and pipes and other hydraulic features were not considered hydrological behavior of impervious surfaces is complex to predict as preferential runoff paths are the result of interactions with drainage systems as well as presence of temporary and permanent barriers fletcher et al 2013 in this study the scs model was applied on the urban historical center of dolo which represents only a portion of the urban catchment area in this case the runoff depends only on the excess of rainfall in the area and not to the contribution of rainfall coming from other areas of the catchment as for dolo the model did not consider the interaction among areas i e among proprieties as well as among urban sections the approach is focused on the individual contribution of each area in order to understand potential priority areas of intervention to control and manage the total water flows in the urban area moreover urban soils are difficult to be studied and sampled because they are usually severely disturbed and show highly variable infiltration rates pitt et al 1999 our method overcomes the difficulties in sampling disturbed urban soils by considering pervious and impervious surface which influence runoff formation yang et al 2015 in any case the output of the proposed method provides a qualitative ranking of the different zones i e urban sections for priority of intervention rather than a quantitative assessment for drainage infrastructure calculation moreover the use of normalized values as in the case of pri computation can mitigate the bias due to the use of indirect measures in es studies e g gaglio et al 2017 the elaboration of the results obtained from the analysis performed at private property scale leads to issues related to the use and publication of data concerning private properties for this reason the outcomes of this analysis should be strictly managed by public bodies under protocols dealing with confidentiality and privacy regulation in order to guarantee the correct use as well as the privacy of citizens data it has to be mentioned that the pri considers all the parameters as equally important see eq 9 however the index can be corrected according stakeholder perception and or local conditions through attributing different weight at the single component finally the cr response along a rainfall gradient was studied under the different combinations of amc and ia fig 4a and b since climate change are expected to increase the frequency and the magnitude of rainfall extreme events the response of cr along a precipitation gradient can be used to project the response of runoff mitigation service to future climate change fig 4a and b suggest that the capacity of green infrastructures of the study area to regulate extreme events will decrease as a consequence of climate change in fact cr values tend to decrease together with the increase of rainfall depth the effects of amc seem more sensible to the rainfall variation while those due to ia values are more relevant for determining the maximum value of cr for this reason direct measures of both soil condition and initial abstraction are important for the accuracy of runoff mitigation maximum cr values correspond to the breaking point of the curve after which the cr performance declines fig 4a and b the saturation of water retention capacity of urban green spaces during severe rainfall events and the consequent release of the excess surface water more quickly mainly causes this decrease yao et al 2015 information on the rainfall depths corresponding to the maximum cr values represent the threshold over which the es declines these thresholds may be used to activate specific early warning measures to protect the most vulnerable population from flooding the different performances of rainwater retention capacity under the three different soil moisture conditions suggest that es provision depends on the climatic conditions occurring before the extreme event practically urban planning decisions should carefully consider precipitation pattern variations within the context of climate change in order to improve adaptation strategies 5 conclusions climate change forces decision makers to adaptation governance measures to mitigate risks related to the increased frequency of extreme events transferring es assessment from theory to practice has great potential to support and inform such decisions especially in urban areas the development of tools that integrate es supply and demand is a key challenge for the future planning and management of the most vulnerable areas such urban ecosystems this study elaborated a method for the identification of priority areas of intervention for the management of urban green infrastructures which could be applied even without the availability of runoff field measurements the qualitative approach can assist in the identification of cost effective measures to prioritize the need for gi management in different zones the analysis also provides the estimation of es demand under climate change the projected increase of precipitation intensity is likely to overcome the gi capacities to mitigate rainfall runoff information on es responses to climate change are fundamental to inform environmental managers towards more sustainable governance remote sensing techniques have a great potential in supporting es supply mapping in urban centers by providing high resolution maps and

25199,biological control is considered as an environmentally and effective means of reducing or mitigating harmful algal blooms by biological remediation approach addition of predators or competitors it may alter the ecological relationships between the dominant algae and their associated populations in ecosystems however it cannot quantify the indirect effects of this approach and the long term and system level ecological consequences are hard to assess here we focus on the bloom areas of the ulansuhai lake in inner mongolia based on historic data field monitoring and experimental data we constructed a quantitative phosphorus cycle network model using ecological network analysis ena we evaluated how indirect flow influences dominant algal species and alters network control and utility relationships results indicate that 1 indirect flows have strong influence on the mutual and control relationships between blooming algae and its related functional groups in the ulansuhai lake 2 some opposite interspecific relationships between the blooming algae and other functional components have been found by ena 3 key populations controlling the blooming algae are observed from the intuitive zooplankton and detritus to network based microorganisms zoobenthos zooplankton and detritus water the research results indicate the importance of including indirect relationship into the control of lake algae bloom the application of ena was good at revealing indirect effects for ecological restoration of eutrophic lakes keywords algal bloom control analysis utility analysis ecological network analysis ulansuhai lake 1 introduction algal blooms severely reduce marine and fresh water quality seriously harm aquatic organisms threaten human health and weaken aquatic ecosystem services with serious ecological consequences carpenter et al 1996 postel and carpenter 1997 smith et al 2006 brooks et al 2016 biological control method is considered an environmentally friendly economical and efficient way of reducing or mitigating algal blooms through both bottom up competition for nutrients and top down increased predation on algae carpenter et al 1995 taking advantage of biological and biochemical functions and food chain control biological methods degrade and transform excessive nutrient salts in lakes inhibit algae growth and purify the water sharipo et al 1975 at present biological control methods mainly include planting vascular plants microbial purification food chain control technology etc from or through predation competition for nutrients mutual benefit and other ecological relationships that directly or indirectly control algae growth quiros 1998 waajen et al 2016 sun et al 2018 the relationship between bloom forming algae and other aquatic components has received great attention because they are reported to closely interact olrik et al 1984 elser et al 2000 different aquatic organisms interact through the transfer of matter and energy contributing to ecological networks with complex relationships such as predation competition symbiosis and so on schindler 2006 the current biological control technologies tend to inhibit algae growth by targeting directly related organisms leading to the function of other related communities and the entire aquatic biological network being overlooked d alelio et al 2016 in fact any organism at any trophic level may be affected by other organisms through predation competition or mutually beneficial effects lima mendez et al 2015 during the biological control of lake bloom all algae related biological communities should be taken into account in application carpenter et al 1996 first system level ecological network relations should be examined so one can take appropriate measures to inhibit algae growth with respect to the network integrity and sustainability šulčius et al 2017 one of the current difficulties is in identifying the ecological relationship between dominant algae and related species networks are one tool that we can use to examine these ecological relationships ecological network analysis ena was derived from economic input output analysis leontief 1966 it is assumed that the system is a network composed of a series of nodes also called subdivisions or units and connecting arcs a specific analytical method such as control or utility analysis is used to study the direct and indirect effects of matter and energy flow in ecosystems and to analyze the ecological relationships among different organisms and depict all of the characteristics of these ecosystems ulanowicz 1997 fath and patten 1999 one of the characteristics of this method is that it can include direct and indirect ecological processes in the system and provide a quantitative analysis and judgment on ecological relations among the system nodes fath and borrett 2006 ena has been applied in many fields such as ecology society and economy and has led to abundant research achievements such as distributed control in ecosystems global virtual water trade system urban water metabolism and so on schramski et al 2006 zhang et al 2010 mao and yang 2011 yang et al 2012a zhang et al 2016 haak et al 2017 borrett et al 2018 based on the findings of ena we can comprehensively consider the direct and indirect ecological processes among populations interpret and judge the ecological relations in ecosystems and provide more complete and accurate information for ecosystem restoration and management this study focused on the bloom prone area in the ulansuhai lake inner mongolia based on dynamic field monitoring and laboratory experiments in the field a network model based on phosphorous nutrient cycling was constructed and quantified the ena was used to determine which population s directly or indirectly affected algal growth and to analyze the quantitative ecological relationships between the algae and related populations network based biological control measures were proposed for the lake based on these results 2 the research area ulansuhai china s eighth largest lake is situated in the urad qianqi bayannao er city inner mongolia n40 36 41 03 e108 43 108 57 see fig 1 it is a typical shallow lake covering an area 293 km2 with an average depth of 0 8 1 5 m it is in a typical temperate continental monsoon climate zone with 200 mm of annual rainfall and 2300 mm of annual evaporation freshwater lakes in dry grasslands and deserts such as ulansuhai lake are rare the lake provides important ecosystem services e g fish supply water and soil conservation habitats to the local region zhang et al 2017 as it is downstream of the hetao irrigation district the lake receives a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus from farmland irrigation return water discharged from nearly 10 upstream channels each year the ecosystem structure and function are continuously being degraded by nutrient inputs that exceed the water environmental capacity of the lake resulting in algal bloom under appropriate conditions due to the relatively closed topology and low flow velocity of water bodies a bloom prone area is forming in the xidayang region in ulansuhai that covers about 10km2 the surface of the region is covered by aquatic plants the two dominant species being phragmites communis and potamogeton pectinatus l the average depth of the region is 1 2 m and water flow velocity is 0 0 7 m s 3 network model construction and analysis 3 1 network model construction long term monitoring results indicate that phosphorus is a limiting factor for algal bloom in this region cui 2013 a network model containing 11 components was constructed based on the phosphorus cycle see fig 2 the dominant algal genus in the lake is chaetoceros and it is accompanied by other filamentous green algae including spirogyra zygnema and mougeotiarotunda filamentous algae attach to submerged macrophytes and the sediment surface during the primary growth stage with increasing biomass it aggregates and floats up to the water surface with the aid of bubbles produced by photosynthesis based on the whole growth process of algae we included microbes zooplankton zoobenthos fish water birds detritus sediments submerged and emergent plants in the ecological network model the ecological relationships resulting from the physical chemical and biological processes are depicted in supplementary material 3 2 data sources model data and key parameters came from on site monitoring and laboratory analysis may october from 2015 to 2017 published literature and historical data from local fisheries and the ulansuhai bird management station the ecopath model is used for network construction and verification of the mass balance model on the lake ecosystem christensen et al 2005 the model requires balancing to achieve steady state within a certain tolerance of 0 05 of throughflow at each node steady state model data are shown in table 1 where z is the boundary input of phosphorus

sources can be found in supplementary material 3 3 ecological network analysis derived from economic input output analysis ena is used to analyze the direct and indirect relationships the interdependence of different organisms and the holistic attributes of ecosystems fath and patten 1999 schramski et al 2011 borrett and matthew 2014 a number of important branches of analysis such as embodied energy analysis ascendency theory and network environ analysis nea have developed since ena was introduced patten 1978 ulanowicz 1980 herendeen 1981 nea is widely used to determine the relations among system nodes and calculate the basic network properties of ecosystems here we introduce nea to investigate how different ecosystem components influence the algal populations in direct and indirect ways and provide novel insights into the control of algal blooms in lake ulansuhai the network analyses were performed using the matlab function developed by fath and borrett 2006 3 3 1

respectively g and g could be called direct flow intensity matrices they are used to calculate the dimensionless integral output and input flow matrices n nij and n n ij which are can be computed as

mutual relationships between different functional groups of the lake ecosystem each component in the ecosystem consists of two environs one receiving flows e g phosphorus in the current case and one generating flows the receiving flows are the terminus of all the interactions leading up to the component and the generating flows from the component are the source of new interactions fath and patten 1998 the flow of matter and energy between different components can be understood as utility in economics this transfer of utility forms various ecological relations among components in the nur direct utility considers the direct interactions between compartments while integral utility assesses the integral relationships that encompass both direct and indirect effects direct intercompartmental flow utilities du are given by duij fij fji ti where fij is a flow e g p flow from compartment j to compartment i ti is the sum off lows into or out of the i th compartment when the system is at steady state when the network indirect influence caused by indirect flows with longer pathways the dimensionless integral utility intensity iu matrix is given by matrix u which is computed as eq 9 fath and borrett 2006 9 iu uij i d1 d2 d3 dm i g 1 where i is the identity matrix and u accounts for interflows overall pathways in the system of lengths 1 2 m δu σiu σdu is a matrix that describes net utility value of each component in the network δui is sum of ith i 1 11 column elements of matrix δu which reflects net output utility of component i δu j is sum of jth j 1 11 row elements of matrix δu which reflects net input utility of component j if we designate the sign of any element in du and iu as sd and si respectively for example the subscripts si12 and si21 represent the flow of utility from microorganism to phytoplankton and from phytoplankton to microorganism respectively and this lets us understand network utility relationship between the two compartments for example si12 si21 stands for mutual benefit si12 si21 stands for competition for predation and 0 0 for neutrality between component 1 and component 2 3 3 3 network control relationship ncr each component of the system will input and output of matter energy at the same time patten 1978 this simultaneous input and output process will exert influence on other components and form the control relationship between components

expressed as a control matrix cn cnij the cn is calculated by the ratio of integral flow from compartment j to i to the integral flow from i to j compartment j is said to dominate i if its output

cn some important network control indices have been utilized for interpretation and understanding of system flows schramski et al 2006 yang et al 2012a chen et al 2011 2015 chen and chen 2012 inspired by their control measures a holistic control intensity indicator ci was developed to explore how much a functional group influences by or on algae in the lake the input control intensity c i i i n and output control intensity c i i o u t are formulated by eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 c i i i n c n i 1 i 1 n cn i 1 11 c i j o u t c n 1 j j 1 n cn 1 j where i 1 n cn i 1 i 1 n is the integration of 1 st row elements in matrix cn and j 1 n cn 1 j j 1 n is the integration of 1st column elements in matrix cn the above two formulations reflect the total import oriented control and the total export oriented control of component one algae respectively index c i i i n reflects how much an individual component influences the lake algae through importing phosphorus and index c i i o u t reflects how much an individual component influences the lake algae through exporting phosphorus 3 3 4 unit environ analysis uea to distinguish the system boundaries from the boundaries of components patten 1978

se k k 1 11 was used to summarize integral interflows intensity of component i i 1 11 generated by a unit phosphorus output of component k k 5 6 7 9 3 3 5 uncertainty analysis there is unavoidable uncertainty in model flows and storages uncertainty analysis is important since it can show how variability inherent in model parameters affects model outcomes in recent years a number of valuable examples have conducted to ecological network models such as comparative coefficient of variation cv borrett and osidele 2007 kaufman and borrett 2010 linear inverse modelling lim guesnet et al 2015 hines et al 2015 2016 2018 which continues to mature for ena use in informing decisions here we conducted uncertainty analysis through two comparative network models these two comparative models m1 and m2 were constructed by the mean flow value sd m1 mean flow value sd m2 mean flow value sd indirect flows are key focus in the current case study we focused on ci ifi and δu indicators that capture the indirect flows and indirect influences by comparing these indicators of three models one base model m0 and two comparative models m1 and m2 we try to detect much uncertainty brings to model results 4 research results 4 1 changed system flow intensity the direct and integral flow intensity based on network analysis is shown in table 2 considering direct and indirect relations in the system the algae is a strongly connected component in the network and all nodes are reachable from all other nodes in the integral matrix all components were involved in the growth of component one algae and had a direct or indirect impact on lake bloom t test was utilized to test significant difference between ifi and dfi results indicate the ifi ifi of system component was significantly higher than the dif p 0 01 in input direction the average dfi is 0 09 and the average ifi is 0 83 component 1 2 3 7 8 10 and 11 appeared same level of flow intensity in dfi while the ifi revealed that component 2 7 and 11 have the strongest flow intensity in the system in output direction the average dfi is 0 09 while the average ifi is 0 78 component 7 and 8 appeared the highest flow intensity in dfi while the ifi revealed that component 7 and 9 ranged the highest flow intensity in the system besides bfi and bif indicate external inputs and outputs exert important influences on eutrophication in the lake especially the boundary phosphorus output 4 2 switching roles for network control the network control matrix is shown in table 4 the integral control results show that no component has absolute control in algae in either direction in relation to input algae are controlled by components 3 4 5 6 and 8 indicating that algae are major sources of phosphorus for zooplankton zoobenthos fish and even birds the input control intensity ci on component one algae is ranged as ci5 28 1 ci6 25 2 ci3 17 ci4 16 5 ci8 13 2 in relation to output components 2 7 9 10 and 11 is controlled by algae indicating that microorganisms debris water bodies sediments emergent and sub emergent plants are important phosphorus sources of algae the output control intensity ci on component one algae is ranged as ci 10 31 4 ci 11 28 7 ci 9 20 6 ci 7 10 2 ci 2 9 1 the input or output control of other function groups is also multi targeted for example fish not only exert output oriented control on algae but also exert varying degrees of control over all components except birds it is noteworthy that emergent plants sub emergent plants detritus and sediments are the most important output oriented controllers and they are important providers of phosphorus to algae benthic animals fish and birds are the most important input directed controllers of algae as they store large quantities of phosphorus through predation 4 3 changed flow utility and ecological relationships a comparison of direct utility and overall utility intensity is shown in table 3 from the change in net utility δu σiu σdu the overall utility of the system increased from σdu 0 152 direct utility to σiu 0 343 integral utility indicating that the lake system presented a mutually beneficial universal relationship i e the system components were mutually supportive certainly this mutual benefit may also promote algae growth and bloom in view of δu and δu component 7 and component 2 are the largest utility net output component δu7 0 161 and net input component δu 2 0 052 respectively with respect to net utility variation the algae components 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 and 11 showed increased import utility from algae while components 2 and 8 showed decreased import utility from algae the algae decreased their integral output utility to components 2 3 4 and 8 and increased their integral output utility to components 5 6 7 9 10 and 11 there are 62 components with increased integral utility and 48 components with reduced integral utility depending on the extent to which utility varies the pair wise ecological relations between algae and it related groups can be divided into three categories 1 changed from 0 0 to indicating that the relationship changed from a neutral ecological relationship to a network competition relationship for example the relation between component 1 algae and component 2 microbes changed from neutral sd12 sd21 0 0 to si12 si21 2 changed from 0 0 to indicating that there is no direct relationship between the two components but in fact the two components are mutually beneficial for example the relationship between components 1 and 10 changed from neutral sd1 10 sd10 1 0 0 to si1 10 si10 1 mutual benefit due to the decay of emergent plants a large amount of phosphorus was re released into the water body which provided a source of phosphorus to the algae cui 2013 3 changed from 0 0 to 0 for example the relationship between components 4 zoobenthos and 10 submerged plants changed from neutral sd1 11 sd11 1 0 0 to si1 11 si11 1 0 to amensalism 4 4 integral interflows intensity generated by unit boundary flows the addition or removal of one unit of phosphorus at the boundary caused a much greater change in integral interflow intensity as shown in fig 3 on the whole one unit of boundary phosphorus input drove an average of 7 8 1 37 units of phosphorus interflow intensity while one unit boundary phosphorus output drove an average of 8 03 1 86 units of phosphorus interflow intensity in generally components 7 presents higher sensitive to both unit boundary input and unit boundary output one unit of boundary input into component 1 5 6 and 7 will result in 2 26 0 45 1 28 0 22 1 32 0 25 and 3 04 0 66 respectively units of integral interflow intensity in component 7 respectively one unit of boundary output from component 5 6 7 and 9 will result in 2 6 0 55 2 10 0 18 3 04 0 58 and 0 91 0 15 respectively unit of integral interflow intensity in component 7 the integral interflow intensity of other component depends on specified boundary input or output components for example component 5 is more sensitive to boundary input and component 9 is robust to boundary output focusing on the algae it was found that one unit of boundary input on algae will generate 8 68 2 25 units of phosphorus interflows in the system the largest interflows as mentioned above are 2 26 0 45 units of component 7 one unit of boundary output from component 5 6 7 and 9 will result in 0 77 0 15 0 70 0 14 0 64 0 11 and 0 24 0 05 respectively unit of integral interflow intensity in component 1 these results indicate that input or output of phosphorus at the boundary is not the only factor controlling algal bloom endogenous phosphorus is also a key factor 4 5 uncertainty analysis in general a certain degree of uncertainty appeared in analysis results due to uncertainty of model data or parameters the average values δfi ci and δu with their standard deviation of three models are shown in fig 4 the ifi is obviously larger than dfi in both input direction and output direction fig 4 a and b variation intensity was changed due to model uncertainty but the variation trend remains unchanged the average values of input oriented and output oriented flow intensity variation of three models are 0 59 0 15和0 50 0 15 respectively dominant control components remain unchanged in uncertainty analysis fig 4 c and d component 5 6 4 3 8 and 11 10 9 7 2 are respectively input oriented and output oriented controllers of blooming algae however there are different orders in ci values of three models for example component 5 and component 10 are respectively the strongest input oriented and output oriented controllers of algae in w1 however component 6 and 11 are respectively the biggest input oriented and output oriented controllers in w2 a similar trend can be found in δu and δu depicted in fig 4 e and f the integral utility is greater than direct utility in three models the net utility variations of three models are 0 19 0 44 and 0 99 respectively when variation intensity of each component is considered we found the maximum net utility output is changed from component 7 in ws1 to component 6 in ws2 and ws3 a system component e g component 2 4 10 and 11 with small throughflow is susceptible to model uncertainty for example the ecological relationship between component 2 and 11 is changed from in ws1 to in ws3 component 11 has the lowest throughflow low in three systems 5 discussion network analytics has become an increasingly important support for ecosystem management yang et al 2017 in this study we applied throughflow analysis utility analysis control analysis and unit environ analysis to study the process of phosphorus flux and reveal the relationships between algae and their related populations in the ulansuhai lake network analysis results show that there are obvious differences between the results of direct observation and network analysis this difference reminds us that it is very important to implement ena to ecological management at a system wide and holistic level in the specific case analyzed the overall flow intensity matrix showed that all components were involved in algal metabolism and exerted direct or indirect effects on algal blooms thus not only directly related species but also indirectly related components should be considered in the processes of biological control of algal bloom schindler 2006 for example algae fish zooplankton is generally added to control algal growth but microbes are in fact a significant competitor of algae microbes population has a significant positive correlation with phosphorus in water which acts as a nutrient competitor of algae similarly there is no direct relationship between algae and wetland plants and they are mutual competitors for nutrition however network utility analysis results showed that they are mutual benefactors it is likely that the decay of wetland plants releases a significant amount of phosphorus into the water providing a large degree of endogenous phosphorus sources to algae zhao et al 2017 therefore improper biological control techniques such as planting wetland plants without harvesting them may increase the risk of algal bloom in addition merely controlling the input of exogenous nutrients may not be decisive for algal bloom management david et al 2008 the algae exerted output oriented control of zooplankton zoobenthos fish and even birds sediments emergent and sleeping plants were important sources input oriented algal control the results of unit environ analysis demonstrated that boundary input and output effect the flow and circulation of phosphorus in the system however system storage itself will also participate in the phosphorus cycle and have an important impact on the algal bloom therefore to control algal bloom in the lake algae control and salt reduction should be carried out based on ecological relationships and phosphorus storage in the system for example submerged plants may have accumulated over many years forming an important sediment phosphorus pool for aquatic organisms wei et al 2016 a large amount of phosphorus is released from sentiments disturbed by strong winds the phosphorus and other nutrients released readily diffuse to the surface in shallow water and stimulate the rapid growth of algae fu et al 2013 in summary the key species controlling harmful algae are not only fish and zooplankton but also phosphorus containing bacteria and benthic animals zoobenthos plays an especially important role in controlling the early biomass of harmful algae lindegaard 1994 when nutrient control is being planned sediment phosphorus bird excretion and wetland plant decay processes should be considered as they are important sources of nutrients for algae the ena incorporate both input dominated and out dominated influence that reveals both top down and bottom up ecology of course there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the results of the current model the complexity of the ecological network means that the interactions between the components evolve over time for example an algal bloom may produce negative effects on the diversity and community composition of water microbes yang et al 2012b berry et al 2017 the structure and function of the system with and without algal bloom also vary dynamically turner and chislock 2010 d alelio et al 2016 in addition algae blooms are affected water temperature flow rate wind speed ph value light intensity and even atmospheric deposition paerl 1997 xie and xie 2002 a combination of the physical and chemical characteristics of water and uncertainty analysis based ena results should be carried out in future research aiming to better control algal blooms 6 conclusions to inform management of the algal blooming ulansuhai lake china we constructed a phosphorous food web model for algal communities based on field monitoring data and literature information ena was applied to detect how much indirect flows influence alters network control and utility relationships between dominant algal species and its related species main conclusions are as follows 1 the integral flow intensity is obviously larger than direct flow intensity p 0 01 indicating indirect flows dominated the model flow configuration of the ulansuhai lake 2 no component has absolute control on algae in system fish and submerged plants are found to be respectively the largest input and output oriented controllers on blooming algae species 3 competition mutually beneficial and amensalism appeared in the network relationships between algae and its related components which are different from direct perceived observation that only direct flows are considered integral flow configuration in ecosystems may differ from empirical observation when important and even dominant indirect flows are involved ena can capture the indirect flows and it is important to incorporate ena into management decisions there is still much work to be done to highlight the application of ena to the biological control of the algal blooming in eutrophic lake such as dynamic assessment and unbalance condition assessment

25199,biological control is considered as an environmentally and effective means of reducing or mitigating harmful algal blooms by biological remediation approach addition of predators or competitors it may alter the ecological relationships between the dominant algae and their associated populations in ecosystems however it cannot quantify the indirect effects of this approach and the long term and system level ecological consequences are hard to assess here we focus on the bloom areas of the ulansuhai lake in inner mongolia based on historic data field monitoring and experimental data we constructed a quantitative phosphorus cycle network model using ecological network analysis ena we evaluated how indirect flow influences dominant algal species and alters network control and utility relationships results indicate that 1 indirect flows have strong influence on the mutual and control relationships between blooming algae and its related functional groups in the ulansuhai lake 2 some opposite interspecific relationships between the blooming algae and other functional components have been found by ena 3 key populations controlling the blooming algae are observed from the intuitive zooplankton and detritus to network based microorganisms zoobenthos zooplankton and detritus water the research results indicate the importance of including indirect relationship into the control of lake algae bloom the application of ena was good at revealing indirect effects for ecological restoration of eutrophic lakes keywords algal bloom control analysis utility analysis ecological network analysis ulansuhai lake 1 introduction algal blooms severely reduce marine and fresh water quality seriously harm aquatic organisms threaten human health and weaken aquatic ecosystem services with serious ecological consequences carpenter et al 1996 postel and carpenter 1997 smith et al 2006 brooks et al 2016 biological control method is considered an environmentally friendly economical and efficient way of reducing or mitigating algal blooms through both bottom up competition for nutrients and top down increased predation on algae carpenter et al 1995 taking advantage of biological and biochemical functions and food chain control biological methods degrade and transform excessive nutrient salts in lakes inhibit algae growth and purify the water sharipo et al 1975 at present biological control methods mainly include planting vascular plants microbial purification food chain control technology etc from or through predation competition for nutrients mutual benefit and other ecological relationships that directly or indirectly control algae growth quiros 1998 waajen et al 2016 sun et al 2018 the relationship between bloom forming algae and other aquatic components has received great attention because they are reported to closely interact olrik et al 1984 elser et al 2000 different aquatic organisms interact through the transfer of matter and energy contributing to ecological networks with complex relationships such as predation competition symbiosis and so on schindler 2006 the current biological control technologies tend to inhibit algae growth by targeting directly related organisms leading to the function of other related communities and the entire aquatic biological network being overlooked d alelio et al 2016 in fact any organism at any trophic level may be affected by other organisms through predation competition or mutually beneficial effects lima mendez et al 2015 during the biological control of lake bloom all algae related biological communities should be taken into account in application carpenter et al 1996 first system level ecological network relations should be examined so one can take appropriate measures to inhibit algae growth with respect to the network integrity and sustainability šulčius et al 2017 one of the current difficulties is in identifying the ecological relationship between dominant algae and related species networks are one tool that we can use to examine these ecological relationships ecological network analysis ena was derived from economic input output analysis leontief 1966 it is assumed that the system is a network composed of a series of nodes also called subdivisions or units and connecting arcs a specific analytical method such as control or utility analysis is used to study the direct and indirect effects of matter and energy flow in ecosystems and to analyze the ecological relationships among different organisms and depict all of the characteristics of these ecosystems ulanowicz 1997 fath and patten 1999 one of the characteristics of this method is that it can include direct and indirect ecological processes in the system and provide a quantitative analysis and judgment on ecological relations among the system nodes fath and borrett 2006 ena has been applied in many fields such as ecology society and economy and has led to abundant research achievements such as distributed control in ecosystems global virtual water trade system urban water metabolism and so on schramski et al 2006 zhang et al 2010 mao and yang 2011 yang et al 2012a zhang et al 2016 haak et al 2017 borrett et al 2018 based on the findings of ena we can comprehensively consider the direct and indirect ecological processes among populations interpret and judge the ecological relations in ecosystems and provide more complete and accurate information for ecosystem restoration and management this study focused on the bloom prone area in the ulansuhai lake inner mongolia based on dynamic field monitoring and laboratory experiments in the field a network model based on phosphorous nutrient cycling was constructed and quantified the ena was used to determine which population s directly or indirectly affected algal growth and to analyze the quantitative ecological relationships between the algae and related populations network based biological control measures were proposed for the lake based on these results 2 the research area ulansuhai china s eighth largest lake is situated in the urad qianqi bayannao er city inner mongolia n40 36 41 03 e108 43 108 57 see fig 1 it is a typical shallow lake covering an area 293 km2 with an average depth of 0 8 1 5 m it is in a typical temperate continental monsoon climate zone with 200 mm of annual rainfall and 2300 mm of annual evaporation freshwater lakes in dry grasslands and deserts such as ulansuhai lake are rare the lake provides important ecosystem services e g fish supply water and soil conservation habitats to the local region zhang et al 2017 as it is downstream of the hetao irrigation district the lake receives a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus from farmland irrigation return water discharged from nearly 10 upstream channels each year the ecosystem structure and function are continuously being degraded by nutrient inputs that exceed the water environmental capacity of the lake resulting in algal bloom under appropriate conditions due to the relatively closed topology and low flow velocity of water bodies a bloom prone area is forming in the xidayang region in ulansuhai that covers about 10km2 the surface of the region is covered by aquatic plants the two dominant species being phragmites communis and potamogeton pectinatus l the average depth of the region is 1 2 m and water flow velocity is 0 0 7 m s 3 network model construction and analysis 3 1 network model construction long term monitoring results indicate that phosphorus is a limiting factor for algal bloom in this region cui 2013 a network model containing 11 components was constructed based on the phosphorus cycle see fig 2 the dominant algal genus in the lake is chaetoceros and it is accompanied by other filamentous green algae including spirogyra zygnema and mougeotiarotunda filamentous algae attach to submerged macrophytes and the sediment surface during the primary growth stage with increasing biomass it aggregates and floats up to the water surface with the aid of bubbles produced by photosynthesis based on the whole growth process of algae we included microbes zooplankton zoobenthos fish water birds detritus sediments submerged and emergent plants in the ecological network model the ecological relationships resulting from the physical chemical and biological processes are depicted in supplementary material 3 2 data sources model data and key parameters came from on site monitoring and laboratory analysis may october from 2015 to 2017 published literature and historical data from local fisheries and the ulansuhai bird management station the ecopath model is used for network construction and verification of the mass balance model on the lake ecosystem christensen et al 2005 the model requires balancing to achieve steady state within a certain tolerance of 0 05 of throughflow at each node steady state model data are shown in table 1 where z is the boundary input of phosphorus mgp m2day 1 y is the boundary input of phosphorus mgp m2day 1 f represents phosphorus exchanges between the subsystems mgp m2day 1 and s is phosphorus storage mgp m2 the main data parameters and their sources can be found in supplementary material 3 3 ecological network analysis derived from economic input output analysis ena is used to analyze the direct and indirect relationships the interdependence of different organisms and the holistic attributes of ecosystems fath and patten 1999 schramski et al 2011 borrett and matthew 2014 a number of important branches of analysis such as embodied energy analysis ascendency theory and network environ analysis nea have developed since ena was introduced patten 1978 ulanowicz 1980 herendeen 1981 nea is widely used to determine the relations among system nodes and calculate the basic network properties of ecosystems here we introduce nea to investigate how different ecosystem components influence the algal populations in direct and indirect ways and provide novel insights into the control of algal blooms in lake ulansuhai the network analyses were performed using the matlab function developed by fath and borrett 2006 3 3 1 the network flow intensity the lake ecosystem can be represented as a network of nodes components and connections between them the network can be further quantified by matrix boundary input z zj boundary output y yi interflow f fij an observed flow from compartment j to compartment i and storage x xi the sum of flows into or out of the i th compartment is throughflow t i i n j 1 n f i j z i and t i o u t j 1 n f j i y i t i i n t i o u t at steady sate nondimensional output oriented and input oriented intercompartmental flows g gij and g g ij are given by fij t i i n and fij t i o u t respectively g and g could be called direct flow intensity matrices they are used to calculate the dimensionless integral output and input flow matrices n nij and n n ij which are can be computed as the convergent power series formulated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively n and n reflects the integral flow intensity of the network fath and borrett 2006 1 n int e g r a l i in i t i a l g d i r e c t g 2

ecological network input oriented and output oriented boundary flow intensity bfi and bfi direct network flow intensity dfi and dfi formulated by eqs 3 4 and 5 6 input oriented and output oriented

ifi the δfi ifi dfi and δfi ifi dfi reveal the strength of indirect flows i e flows for which m 1 contributing to algal blooms 3 3 2 network utility relationship nur nur is utilized to reveal the mutual relationships between different functional groups of the lake ecosystem each component in the ecosystem consists of two environs one receiving flows e g phosphorus in the current case and one generating flows the receiving flows are the terminus of all the interactions leading up to the component and the generating flows from the component are the source of new interactions fath and patten 1998 the flow of matter and energy between different components can be understood as utility in economics this transfer of utility forms various ecological relations among components in the nur direct utility considers the direct interactions between compartments while integral utility assesses the integral relationships that encompass both direct and indirect effects direct intercompartmental flow utilities du are given by duij fij fji ti where fij is a flow e g p flow from compartment j to compartment i ti is the sum off lows into or out of the i th compartment when the system is at steady state when the network indirect influence caused by indirect flows with longer pathways the dimensionless integral utility intensity iu matrix is given by matrix u which is computed as eq 9 fath and borrett 2006 9 iu uij i d1 d2 d3 dm i g 1 where i is the identity matrix and u accounts for interflows overall pathways in the system of lengths 1 2 m δu σiu σdu is a matrix that describes net utility value of each component in the network δui is sum of ith i 1 11 column elements of matrix δu which reflects net output utility of component i δu j is sum of jth j 1 11 row elements of matrix δu which reflects net input utility of component j if we designate the sign of any element in du and iu as sd and si respectively for example the subscripts si12 and si21 represent the flow of utility from microorganism to phytoplankton and from phytoplankton to microorganism respectively and this lets us understand network utility relationship between the two compartments for example si12 si21 stands for mutual benefit si12 si21 stands for competition for predation and 0 0 for neutrality between component 1 and component 2 3 3 3 network control relationship ncr each component of the system will input and output of matter energy at the same time patten 1978 this simultaneous input and output process will exert influence on other components and form the control relationship between components in an ecosystem one way to consider internal control relationship in an ecosystem is measuring the control or dominance of one compartment over another via their input output environ the ncr can be expressed as a control matrix cn cnij the cn is calculated by the ratio of integral flow from compartment j to i to the integral flow from i to j compartment j is said to dominate i if its output effect on i is larger than is input effect on j cnij nij nji 1 this control relationship was further modified such that when cnij nij nji 1 cnij 1 nij nji otherwise cnij 0 fath 2004 based the matrix cn some important network control indices have been utilized for interpretation and understanding of system flows schramski et al 2006 yang et al 2012a chen et al 2011 2015 chen and chen 2012 inspired by their control measures a holistic control intensity indicator ci was developed to explore how much a functional group influences by or on algae in the lake the input control intensity c i i i n and output control intensity c i i o u t are formulated by eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 c i i i n c n i 1 i 1 n cn i 1 11 c i j o u t c n 1 j j 1 n cn 1 j where i 1 n cn i 1 i 1 n is the integration of 1 st row elements in matrix cn and j 1 n cn 1 j j 1 n is the integration of 1st column elements in matrix cn the above two formulations reflect the total import oriented control and the total export oriented control of component one algae respectively index c i i i n reflects how much an individual component influences the lake algae through importing phosphorus and index c i i o u t reflects how much an individual component influences the lake algae through exporting phosphorus 3 3 4 unit environ analysis uea to distinguish the system boundaries from the boundaries of components patten 1978 considered each component is composed of both input and output environs generating by system boundary input or output each component establishes the internal connection through the input oriented environ flows and the output oriented environ flows unit environ analysis in nea can depict the internal phosphorus flows and the boundary output input flow caused by one unit dimensionless boundary

se k k 1 11 was used to summarize integral interflows intensity of component i i 1 11 generated by a unit phosphorus output of component k k 5 6 7 9 3 3 5 uncertainty analysis there is unavoidable uncertainty in model flows and storages uncertainty analysis is important since it can show how variability inherent in model parameters affects model outcomes in recent years a number of valuable examples have conducted to ecological network models such as comparative coefficient of variation cv borrett and osidele 2007 kaufman and borrett 2010 linear inverse modelling lim guesnet et al 2015 hines et al 2015 2016 2018 which continues to mature for ena use in informing decisions here we conducted uncertainty analysis through two comparative network models these two comparative models m1 and m2 were constructed by the mean flow value sd m1 mean flow value sd m2 mean flow value sd indirect flows are key focus in the current case study we focused on ci ifi and δu indicators that capture the indirect flows and indirect influences by comparing these indicators of three models one base model m0 and two comparative models m1 and m2 we try to detect much uncertainty brings to model results 4 research results 4 1 changed system flow intensity the direct and integral flow intensity based on network analysis is shown in table 2 considering direct and indirect relations in the system the algae is a strongly connected component in the network and all nodes are reachable from all other nodes in the integral matrix all components were involved in the growth of component one algae and had a direct or indirect impact on lake bloom t test was utilized to test significant difference between ifi and dfi results indicate the ifi ifi of system component was significantly higher than the dif p 0 01 in input direction the average dfi is 0 09 and the average ifi is 0 83 component 1 2 3 7 8 10 and 11 appeared same level of flow intensity in dfi while the ifi revealed that component 2 7 and 11 have the strongest flow intensity in the system in output direction the average dfi is 0 09 while the average ifi is 0 78 component 7 and 8 appeared the highest flow intensity in dfi while the ifi revealed that component 7 and 9 ranged the highest flow intensity in the system besides bfi and bif indicate external inputs and outputs exert important influences on eutrophication in the lake especially the boundary phosphorus output 4 2 switching roles for network control the network control matrix is shown in table 4 the integral control results show that no component has absolute control in algae in either direction in relation to input algae are controlled by components 3 4 5 6 and 8 indicating that algae are major sources of phosphorus for zooplankton zoobenthos fish and even birds the input control intensity ci on component one algae is ranged as ci5 28 1 ci6 25 2 ci3 17 ci4 16 5 ci8 13 2 in relation to output components 2 7 9 10 and 11 is controlled by algae indicating that microorganisms debris water bodies sediments emergent and sub emergent plants are important phosphorus sources of algae the output control intensity ci on component one algae is ranged as ci 10 31 4 ci 11 28 7 ci 9 20 6 ci 7 10 2 ci 2 9 1 the input or output control of other function groups is also multi targeted for example fish not only exert output oriented control on algae but also exert varying degrees of control over all components except birds it is noteworthy that emergent plants sub emergent plants detritus and sediments are the most important output oriented controllers and they are important providers of phosphorus to algae benthic animals fish and birds are the most important input directed controllers of algae as they store large quantities of phosphorus through predation 4 3 changed flow utility and ecological relationships a comparison of direct utility and overall utility intensity is shown in table 3 from the change in net utility δu σiu σdu the overall utility of the system increased from σdu 0 152 direct utility to σiu 0 343 integral utility indicating that the lake system presented a mutually beneficial universal relationship i e the system components were mutually supportive certainly this mutual benefit may also promote algae growth and bloom in view of δu and δu component 7 and component 2 are the largest utility net output component δu7 0 161 and net input component δu 2 0 052 respectively with respect to net utility variation the algae components 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 and 11 showed increased import utility from algae while components 2 and 8 showed decreased import utility from algae the algae decreased their integral output utility to components 2 3 4 and 8 and increased their integral output utility to components 5 6 7 9 10 and 11 there are 62 components with increased integral utility and 48 components with reduced integral utility depending on the extent to which utility varies the pair wise ecological relations between algae and it related groups can be divided into three categories 1 changed from 0 0 to indicating that the relationship changed from a neutral ecological relationship to a network competition relationship for example the relation between component 1 algae and component 2 microbes changed from neutral sd12 sd21 0 0 to si12 si21 2 changed from 0 0 to indicating that there is no direct relationship between the two components but in fact the two components are mutually beneficial for example the relationship between components 1 and 10 changed from neutral sd1 10 sd10 1 0 0 to si1 10 si10 1 mutual benefit due to the decay of emergent plants a large amount of phosphorus was re released into the water body which provided a source of phosphorus to the algae cui 2013 3 changed from 0 0 to 0 for example the relationship between components 4 zoobenthos and 10 submerged plants changed from neutral sd1 11 sd11 1 0 0 to si1 11 si11 1 0 to amensalism 4 4 integral interflows intensity generated by unit boundary flows the addition or removal of one unit of phosphorus at the boundary caused a much greater change in integral interflow intensity as shown in fig 3 on the whole one unit of boundary phosphorus input drove an average of 7 8 1 37 units of phosphorus interflow intensity while one unit boundary phosphorus output drove an average of 8 03 1 86 units of phosphorus interflow intensity in generally components 7 presents higher sensitive to both unit boundary input and unit boundary output one unit of boundary input into component 1 5 6 and 7 will result in 2 26 0 45 1 28 0 22 1 32 0 25 and 3 04 0 66 respectively units of integral interflow intensity in component 7 respectively one unit of boundary output from component 5 6 7 and 9 will result in 2 6 0 55 2 10 0 18 3 04 0 58 and 0 91 0 15 respectively unit of integral interflow intensity in component 7 the integral interflow intensity of other component depends on specified boundary input or output components for example component 5 is more sensitive to boundary input and component 9 is robust to boundary output focusing on the algae it was found that one unit of boundary input on algae will generate 8 68 2 25 units of phosphorus interflows in the system the largest interflows as mentioned above are 2 26 0 45 units of component 7 one unit of boundary output from component 5 6 7 and 9 will result in 0 77 0 15 0 70 0 14 0 64 0 11 and 0 24 0 05 respectively unit of integral interflow intensity in component 1 these results indicate that input or output of phosphorus at the boundary is not the only factor controlling algal bloom endogenous phosphorus is also a key factor 4 5 uncertainty analysis in general a certain degree of uncertainty appeared in analysis results due to uncertainty of model data or parameters the average values δfi ci and δu with their standard deviation of three models are shown in fig 4 the ifi is obviously larger than dfi in both input direction and output direction fig 4 a and b variation intensity was changed due to model uncertainty but the variation trend remains unchanged the average values of input oriented and output oriented flow intensity variation of three models are 0 59 0 15和0 50 0 15 respectively dominant control components remain unchanged in uncertainty analysis fig 4 c and d component 5 6 4 3 8 and 11 10 9 7 2 are respectively input oriented and output oriented controllers of blooming algae however there are different orders in ci values of three models for example component 5 and component 10 are respectively the strongest input oriented and output oriented controllers of algae in w1 however component 6 and 11 are respectively the biggest input oriented and output oriented controllers in w2 a similar trend can be found in δu and δu depicted in fig 4 e and f the integral utility is greater than direct utility in three models the net utility variations of three models are 0 19 0 44 and 0 99 respectively when variation intensity of each component is considered we found the maximum net utility output is changed from component 7 in ws1 to component 6 in ws2 and ws3 a system component e g component 2 4 10 and 11 with small throughflow is susceptible to model uncertainty for example the ecological relationship between component 2 and 11 is changed from in ws1 to in ws3 component 11 has the lowest throughflow low in three systems 5 discussion network analytics has become an increasingly important support for ecosystem management yang et al 2017 in this study we applied throughflow analysis utility analysis control analysis and unit environ analysis to study the process of phosphorus flux and reveal the relationships between algae and their related populations in the ulansuhai lake network analysis results show that there are obvious differences between the results of direct observation and network analysis this difference reminds us that it is very important to implement ena to ecological management at a system wide and holistic level in the specific case analyzed the overall flow intensity matrix showed that all components were involved in algal metabolism and exerted direct or indirect effects on algal blooms thus not only directly related species but also indirectly related components should be considered in the processes of biological control of algal bloom schindler 2006 for example algae fish zooplankton is generally added to control algal growth but microbes are in fact a significant competitor of algae microbes population has a significant positive correlation with phosphorus in water which acts as a nutrient competitor of algae similarly there is no direct relationship between algae and wetland plants and they are mutual competitors for nutrition however network utility analysis results showed that they are mutual benefactors it is likely that the decay of wetland plants releases a significant amount of phosphorus into the water providing a large degree of endogenous phosphorus sources to algae zhao et al 2017 therefore improper biological control techniques such as planting wetland plants without harvesting them may increase the risk of algal bloom in addition merely controlling the input of exogenous nutrients may not be decisive for algal bloom management david et al 2008 the algae exerted output oriented control of zooplankton zoobenthos fish and even birds sediments emergent and sleeping plants were important sources input oriented algal control the results of unit environ analysis demonstrated that boundary input and output effect the flow and circulation of phosphorus in the system however system storage itself will also participate in the phosphorus cycle and have an important impact on the algal bloom therefore to control algal bloom in the lake algae control and salt reduction should be carried out based on ecological relationships and phosphorus storage in the system for example submerged plants may have accumulated over many years forming an important sediment phosphorus pool for aquatic organisms wei et al 2016 a large amount of phosphorus is released from sentiments disturbed by strong winds the phosphorus and other nutrients released readily diffuse to the surface in shallow water and stimulate the rapid growth of algae fu et al 2013 in summary the key species controlling harmful algae are not only fish and zooplankton but also phosphorus containing bacteria and benthic animals zoobenthos plays an especially important role in controlling the early biomass of harmful algae lindegaard 1994 when nutrient control is being planned sediment phosphorus bird excretion and wetland plant decay processes should be considered as they are important sources of nutrients for algae the ena incorporate both input dominated and out dominated influence that reveals both top down and bottom up ecology of course there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the results of the current model the complexity of the ecological network means that the interactions between the components evolve over time for example an algal bloom may produce negative effects on the diversity and community composition of water microbes yang et al 2012b berry et al 2017 the structure and function of the system with and without algal bloom also vary dynamically turner and chislock 2010 d alelio et al 2016 in addition algae blooms are affected water temperature flow rate wind speed ph value light intensity and even atmospheric deposition paerl 1997 xie and xie 2002 a combination of the physical and chemical characteristics of water and uncertainty analysis based ena results should be carried out in future research aiming to better control algal blooms 6 conclusions to inform management of the algal blooming ulansuhai lake china we constructed a phosphorous food web model for algal communities based on field monitoring data and literature information ena was applied to detect how much indirect flows influence alters network control and utility relationships between dominant algal species and its related species main conclusions are as follows 1 the integral flow intensity is obviously larger than direct flow intensity p 0 01 indicating indirect flows dominated the model flow configuration of the ulansuhai lake 2 no component has absolute control on algae in system fish and submerged plants are found to be respectively the largest input and output oriented controllers on blooming algae species 3 competition mutually beneficial and amensalism appeared in the network relationships between algae and its related components which are different from direct perceived observation that only direct flows are considered integral flow configuration in ecosystems may differ from empirical observation when important and even dominant indirect flows are involved ena can capture the indirect flows and it is important to incorporate ena into management decisions there is still much work to be done to highlight the application of ena to the biological control of the algal blooming in eutrophic lake such as dynamic assessment and unbalance condition assessment
