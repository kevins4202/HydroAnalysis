25365,human contribution regardless of its form manual skilled or intellectual work is always present in productive systems in the role of adding value to lower transformity materials and energy calculation of human transformity within emergy accounting methodology deserves more discussion due to the complexity and variety of aspects that human activities reflect two approaches identified in the literature for human transformity evaluation were adopted as the background to develop the line of thinking and organize discussion the discussion is developed through the study of an english language school located in brazil where two models were applied to determine the transformity of the entering students and teachers the first model to calculate transformity is based on the educational attainment in an analogous way to odum s approach based on energy hierarchy for the second a cyclic model to calculate teachers transformity it was assumed that they acquired the english knowledge in the same school where they are currently teaching it was recognized that human contribution manifests different dimensions the activity the temporal and the spatial dimensions the dimension considered strongly influences the way human flows captures the inputs and how transformity is calculated it is expected that the recognition and discussion of the influence of the dimension considered to calculate human transformity values will contribute to further methodological development values of transfomity that emerged from the cyclic model better capture the dynamic of the converging resources and can feed the transformity database for future emergy calculations keywords emergy human labor environmental accounting human transformity teaching 1 introduction activities performed by humans are fundamental to add value to productive systems due to their high quality in emergy terms campbell and lu 2009 the term value here refers to real value similarly as in odum 1996 when refers to real wealth that is means to add high quality human inputs in the form of manual skilled or intellectual work in order to transform low quality materials and energy flows in this case the concept of value is ecocentric not anthropocentric emergy is per se an existence value as stated by ju and chen 2011 since it emphasizes the producing procedure of natural contributions donated from the supporting ecosystems and the biosphere emergy is the available energy of one kind previously used up directly or indirectly to make a service or product odum 1996 emergy accounting gives a value to services and products by converting them into equivalents of one form of energy i e solar energy its unit is the solar emjoule the solar emergy of all the resources also including human labor services and information flows is calculated by multiplying their energy flows expressed in joules j by the conversion factor defined as transformity odum 1996 extensive work has been performed for calculating the transformity values of a great part of material and energy resources valuable to society when human activities interact with materials energy and other inputs their emergy contribution generates higher quality products according to odum 1996 transformity values reflect the hierarchical level of a system in the biosphere comprising from natural to societal systems abel 2010 states that the great majority of human transformity values are larger than those corresponding to other products fact that reflects the high quality of human inputs a significant portion of the human emergy flows to a system was built up by the past use of global resources that converged into the individual in order to create the storage of knowledge tasks and know how odum 1996 campbell 2013 another portion emerges through the accumulated experience during operation odum 1996 campbell 2013 whereas cultural information beyond formal education has important roles abel 2010 bergquist et al 2011 point out that labor measure should include calorie intake knowledge and the way it is transferred as well as the cultural context since labor is task and place specific the contribution of informal knowledge is also considered by falkowski et al 2015 who explored traditional ecological knowledge in traditional communities emergy terms we share the same opinion with kamp et al 2016 who affirm that there is no agreement on the calculation method for labor and deeply explored the topic in terms of direct and indirect labor upstream in the associated chain of energy transformation we think that emergy calculations involving high quality human work deserve more discussion our purpose is to contribute to the further development of this methodology by using an english school located in brazil as the focus of discussion the system involves energy materials and intellectual work as well as knowledge that must be maintained and transmitted to the students since transformity is system dependent and considering that the work performed by humans is placed at the higher extreme of the energy quality spectrum the selection of the transformity approach and other considerations will strongly affect final results the case under study deals with the necessity of calculating the transformity of the human inputs entering students and teachers to carry out the emergy accounting of the system which has as the main product students after one year of classes attendance through the calculation of the emergy support that converges to students after a year of class attendance some questions arise that were explored throughout the work first two different approaches that addressed human transformities determination were identified and discussed in order to offer a theoretical background to sustain the research with such approaches in mind we attempt to explain the limitations that arise when adopting transformity values that emerged from the first approach to be used to carry out calculation under the second approach the adoption of such a measure requires methodological considerations that include the clearly establishment of the characteristics of human labor in terms of activity spatial and temporal dimensions for this purpose the school a human intensive system that relies on human inputs and also has a human outflow as the main product supplies the empirical case finally a cyclic model where teacher knowledge was acquired at the same english school they are currently teaching was proposed as an alternative procedure to calculate the transformity of teachers it is concluded that the different dimensions of human activities that were revealed during literature revision and throughout the development of the research permeate the whole discussion and will direct the calculation of human transformity 2 on human transformity approaches two approaches emerge from the literature devoted to human transformity calculation abel 2011 had already stated that emergy analyses generally take two most common forms national emergy analyses and process analyses also two approaches frameworks were identified in the literature revision that will direct the discussion the two approaches classified the fundamental works that deal with the conceptual framework on human transformity evaluation 2 1 first approach focus on hierarchical human scales this framework is based on the assumption that the emergy flows of the universe are organized in an energy transformation hierarchy as stated by odum 1996 the total emergy flow of a nation state or region is assigned to each hierarchical level of a human scale when it is not desired to evidence distinct hierarchical levels each member of the whole population is considered as an average located within a unique human level it is applicable when there is no specific skill or level of knowledge education or experience to be represented ulgiati et al 1994 accounted for the emergy of italy and calculated the transformity of human labor in agriculture and industry sectors by the attribution of the entire solar emergy of italy to its total population neither scales nor differentiated human levels were considered thus resulting in only one level of undifferentiated people the solar transformity calculated by the authors to reflect untrained workers equals 7 38 106 sej j analogous consideration was made for unskilled labor of a bamboo plantation in brazil where the entire national solar emergy was assigned to the total population assuming a unique level of people bonilla et al 2010 in this case the transformity value equals 4 18 106 sej j but differently from ulgiati et al 1994 where both the calculation and application of human transformity are based on macro scale evaluation last work uses a human transformity value calculated under macro scale considerations to feed a micro scale bamboo production when the system is perceived like a chain of production where lower levels become the basis for people operating at higher levels the division of different levels of humans according to knowledge educational attainment or other criteria occurs in odum 1996 the human hierarchy for usa population was categorized according to the attained education level the entire emergy of the country was assigned to each level people who attained higher levels contribute with a greater transformity the interval ranges from 8 9 106 to 2 05 109 sej j for preschool and legacy respectively abel 2010 raises the question if the educational attainment was the most appropriate criterion to define human hierarchy levels he calculated the global population transformity range and human scale categorization was conducted through a mathematical relationship the logarithmic relation adopted by abel 2010 was based on odum s observation regarding the one order of magnitude decrease at each step in the chain of energy transformation odum 1996 global population was thus divided in portions logarithmically related resulting in a transformity range from 7 53 104 to 7 53 1013 sej j abel 2010 abel 2011 calculated transfomity by assuming that a hierarchy of seven human levels logarithmically determined exists within the macro domain of the taiwanese county under study however differently from his previous work the entire emergy was not attributed to each of the seven human levels since other processes are sharing the total emergy flow the transformity interval ranges from 2 78 106 to 2 06 1012 sej j 2 2 second approach process based calculation while in the first approach the entire emergy is assigned to each hierarchical level the second approach accounts for the specific inputs that enter a human system specific and well detailed inflows to the system need to be available in this way even people belonging to the same hierarchical level according to the first approach might require different emergy flows if their consumption way of life place or activities differ the approach emphasizes a process oriented assessment when human flows are the main product of a process that receives different inputs flows including human flows this approach focuses on the role of people within the process odum 1996 calculated the emergy to support the university of florida inputs include flows from the environment resources necessary to operate the university such as fuels gasoline water etc students books faculty and maintenance the emergy flows of the students entering the university were calculated by using the transformities of the educational levels according to the first approach odum 1996 thus the transformity of the corresponding level was multiplied by the hours of intellectual activity and metabolic energy per hour the outflows of the university were graduates research services and sport brandt williams 2002 calculated the transformity of migrants based on the flows of food and wages that converge into an individual the process oriented procedure considered only the flows that directly contribute to migrant life the main products are work sleep and play the transformity of educated students at an educational center in switzerland was calculated by meillaud et al 2005 the products comprised educated students publications courses and services calculation was carried out by considering the portion of emergy that directly contributes to students formation see the authors considerations explained in the text the energy of educated students accounted only for intellectual activity or class attendance 1 pers 120 kcal h 4186 j kcal 8 3 h day 235 days yr the transformity value of these students is 2 40 108 sej j the emergy flows of the entering students as well as the faculty and technical staff were calculated using the transformity range for educational attainment levels according to abel 2011 households are the fundamental units in the social structure since they represent shelter family organization child rearing protection and asset storage the system is considered as a producer of people essential inputs such as electricity water and also cultural information information from media conversation education and government among others were included the residents of the household are inputs to the household system and their transformity values were calculated through the first approach by considering a hierarchy of human levels the products of the households are adults and children and the transformity calculated was 1 50 108 sej j campbell and lu 2014 calculated the emergy required to produce an individual with a given level of education in the usa within the period from 1870 to 2006 the calculation procedure included the determination of the annual emergy required support each education subsystem elementary secondary and college and then summing these inputs over the actual years that an individual needed to attain that specific level of education from pre school to doctoral degree differently from odum 1996 whose calculation implied that the entire emergy of the nation is required to sustain all the people that have attained a given level campbell and lu 2014 considered that each subsystem or level has its own inputs and outputs calculated through the process based procedure the inputs required to run the education systems were mostly obtained from annual national database reports and included flows of money energy and materials all converted into emergy flows the transformity values for 1983 range from 22 6 106 to 1446 3 106 sej j from preschool to public status levels respectively although the authors admitted the necessity of improving calculation by applying an iterative method the work successfully explores the dynamics of the us education system over more than 100 years the comparison among the papers within the second approach enabled to establish a sub division in this way although all the papers share the same process based treatment they differ in the purpose of the study and consequently in the information that transformity captures it is observed that the works authored by odum 1996 brandt williams 2002 meillaud et al 2005 and abel 2011 assess the global resources that converged to the systems in an annual and flow basis on the other side campbell and lu 2014 and also their earlier version published in 2009 capture the accumulative global resources to generate the product products in this way human transformity calculated from those works even expressed in the same units and calculated under the same approach represent either flow or cumulative global resources per individual respectively 3 materials and methods 3 1 background information on the english school the building that hosts the school is approximately 45 years old it is located in ouro fino a city of minas gerais state in brazil and was originally built as a private residence it was reconditioned and modified in order to operate as a school it is 114 24 m2 in area and has five classrooms a waiting room a front desk a toilet and a teacher s room there are about 300 students enrolled in the english courses the courses are classified according to the age and english proficiency levels four course modalities are offered at the schools which are tots kids teens and class listed in increasing order of knowledge the present paper focuses on the 47 students who are attending the class course 3 2 emergy accounting and transformity the emergy accounting methodology offers the flexibility of expressing diverse inputs on a common basis as well as evidences the different abilities for energy to do work a complete assessment of the methodology cannot be addressed here but the reader may find it in odum 1996 and brown and ulgiati 2004 among others as stated by grönlund et al 2004 the calculation of resource flows in emergy is corrected for their position in the energy hierarchy of the biosphere which enables us to establish the relative influence of each item on the system solar transformity reflects the hierarchical position of an item within the biosphere and represents the solar emergy required to produce 1 j of a product or service its unit is solar emjoule per joule sej j to establish the emergy flows every material energy or monetary input has to be inventoried and multiplied by its corresponding transformity or unit emergy value uev emergy per unit to be converted into solar equivalents of emergy the solar emergy of the system represents the costs of capturing concentrating and processing in space and time all the direct and indirect energy inputs to a system coscieme et al 2014 a normal procedure to calculate the transformity of the products that emerge from the system evaluation is to divide the total emergy input by the energy of the output in the present case the products is represented by the students that experience all the emergy inputs necessary to perform the teaching learning activities the system was addressed through the second approach framework the system receives emergy from material water electricity and human activities 3 3 data and general calculation considerations the first step of the emergy accounting consists of the identification of all the global resources necessary for the building structure the brazilian standard abnt 2006 defines and quantifies the construction budget exclusively involved in house construction the annual emergy was calculated from the total emergy required for construction divided by a lifespan of 50 years all the resources used to support the system were identified that includes the human work performed by teachers and secretary and the emergy of students who learn through the interaction with teachers and the operational support the system energy diagram is shown in fig 1 the symbol of storage placed on the left within the system frame represents the concentration that resulted from the interaction of material and labor in construction process in order to simplify the diagram all the materials were aggregated in a unique source symbol independently of their origin the detailed list is shown in table 1 building use represented by a box is the process where the house structure and the flows necessary for school operation converge on the right the teaching learning process is represented by the interaction of teachers and students plus the contribution of the operational support the main product corresponds to students who completed a year of class course attendance the softer lines correspond to the energy dissipation the calculation procedure required some allocations only the students enrolled at the class course were taken into consideration the 47 students correspond to 16 of the total number of students in the english school therefore the same proportion of the school operation inputs was considered on the other side the entire annual emergy flow derived from construction was accounted for since it was considered that any teaching learning process would be impossible without the whole facilities teachers and entering students are represented as sources on the right of the diagram fig 1 the revised value of 12 1 1024 sej yr for the emergy baseline is adopted throughout this paper brown and ulgiati 2016 in this way all the uevs calculated on the older baselines were corrected by multiplying by 1 28 or 0 76 whether expressed according to odum 1996 or odum et al 2000 respectively these factors correspond to the ratio between the revised and the older baselines 3 4 considerations for human work calculation the emergy evaluation of human inputs and outputs of the system deserves a detailed description in order to justify the procedure adopted the system is human intensive since it involves students that receive the contribution of teachers to improve their english knowledge two procedures were explored to calculate the emergy of teachers that is delivered to support teaching the first procedure also used to calculate the entering students transformity assumed that teachers and students belong to different education levels within the population in this case the population of minas gerais state for this purpose an analogous consideration to odum s odum 1996 was adopted and the transformity of people belonging to a specific education level was calculated by dividing the total annual solar emergy supporting minas gerais state calculated by demetrio 2011 by the number of people expressed in total annual metabolic energy per person in each category total emergy was assigned to each level of education english teachers were considered to belong to the college graduate level whereas students were assigned to the high school level the calculation of transformity for teachers and entering students is shown in appendix a the second procedure a cyclic model was developed with the assumption that the teachers acquired their english knowledge in the same school where they are currently teaching it was supposed that they studied at an equivalent of the class advanced course during a period of six years after that period they became proficient enough to initiate teaching activities at the same english school the equations are developed in appendix b the emergy of the teaching learning activities performed by teachers and students is calculated as the sum of the emergy delivered by teachers plus the emergy brought by the students during the class period 4 results and discussion the list of inputs their corresponding raw data uevs and emergy invested at school construction is depicted in table 1 results in table 1 evidence the cost of the biosphere invested in providing the structural support for the teaching learning process the annual value of this support when spanned within life time is 0 82 1016 sej and it is distributed among three main material inflows concrete clay and sand and labor the four inputs represent almost the 80 of the total sej sej table 2 shows all the resources used to support the teaching learning process at the class course for a year table 2 shows the emergy necessary to run the teaching learning process of the class course the transformity for teachers and entering students were calculated according to the first approach as explained in the section 3 in this way teachers and entering students are located in different levels of the human hierarchy scale if educational attainment is considered as the criterion human inputs in the form of teachers labor secretary s labor considered as the main staff services and contribution of students who carry their prior education according to their educational attainment are responsible for the main emergy contribution approximately 95 of the total emergy corresponds to human activities such as teaching learning and supporting the teaching learning process emergy flows corresponding to computers electricity and construction have a small although non negligible weight within building and operation contributions as was previously stated the present calculation is carried out within the framework of the second approach although human transformity values shown in table 2 emerged from the first approach the same pattern regarding the use of human transformity calculated within the first approach framework in process oriented analysis was observed in other papers odum 1996 in florida university case meillaud et al 2005 almeida et al 2013 differently campbell and lu 2009 2014 adopted the salary of teachers converted to emergy and a spun up model to get the input values some aspects should be addressed when calculating or adopting human transformity values calculated within the first approach to be in agreement with the theoretical assumption that supports it the human levels or human scales selected to hierarchically organize a population have to be clearly defined and must compose an arrangement based on a real energy transformation hierarchy if another human scale was preferred or considered more adequate to reflect the categories within the human scale as discussed by abel 2010 the levels should be re defined and delimited in order to avoid overlap among levels each person would belong to a hierarchical level if working within the assumption of the first framework however it is not necessarily true that each human task skill or occupation will define a human scale in this way the rereading of almeida et al 2013 raises the question about the correlation among occupations and hierarchical levels the students entering university are considering as located into the high school attainment level whereas professors were considered to belong to a category composed by college professors whether the higher education professors category really represents a hierarchical level or it better represents an occupation portion of a broader level deserves more discussion the number of components in each level will impact the transformity calculated within the first approach since it is assumed that the annual emergy use is necessary for each level to exist and the whole value will be divided to the number of individuals of each level according to abel 2011 all the persons who reside within a process share the total emergy on a per capita basis the present study shows that students during attendance experience various kinds of inputs that enable school operation the value of 2 51 1017 sej year emerges from table 2 for all the students after one year attendance the question about if it is reasonable to calculate the transformity of emerging students from the emergy per capita value arises abel 2011 argues that in the tourist resorts study performed by brown and ulgiati 2001 transformities were not calculated for tourists since they do not actually reside at the resorts on the other hand some authors have expressed the results transformity terms even under the condition of non residence of students within the system meillaud et al 2005 campbell et al 2009 almeida et al 2013 neither do students reside at the school at the english school all but it is reasonable to understand that they could experience the convergence of inputs during classes almost in such a way as they partially reside within the process maybe the central questions to be answered were which the human related products of the process really mean in a process of producing people as in abel 2011 the human product will be people s lives for the process of tourists spending some time at the tourism destination tourist carrying new experiences will be the human product accordingly different aspects of human activities can be highlighted and calculated in emergy terms grönlund 2009 addressed that the flows in systems can be expressed in terms of the quantity quality thinking he also mentioned that the average scientifics primarily think of quantitative measure of energy and seldom of its quality aspects in the same way as energy which can acquire different forms can reveal different energy density or capacity to do work human flows also present different qualitative aspects that we define as dimensions although inherently attached to human related activities dimensions are seldom explicitly expressed in calculations human flows might be ascribed to at least three dimensions we were able to identify form time and space the first is related to the type of activity and the abilities knowledge or skills necessary to carry out the activity within the system meanwhile human activities as well as people lives are bounded in time time is shared among multiple activities during people lives or even in a day people are also physically bounded to territory as already stated by abel 2011 so convergence of inputs represents a convergence to someplace in a spatially defined way all of the three dimensions that define the human product were not generally considered neither evidenced in emergy accountings possibly time is among the three dimensions the most difficult to deal with in emergy terms it seems reasonable to consider a person as belonging to a hierarchical scale namely a specific education level in a yearly basis human products emerging from a specific hierarchical level seem to be a situation where people are involved full time on the other side under the second approach the person can receive the emergy flows during a period and consequently it is only during this period of time when it is possible to control the human product meanwhile this person can represent a temporal input in another system where he could deliver emergy through interaction and profit from emergy support from this location for a period of time sometimes people are considered as actors who receive or deliver emergy flows for a while thus transformity of the students after one year of class attendance calculated by considering the time period the students can access control or have been supported by the convergence of the inputs is 8 87 107 sej j the value is twice their transformity when they began the class course the second model proposed to calculate teachers emergy inflows assumes that the teacher who is currently teaching at the school studied there in order to acquire the necessary level of english knowledge to become a teacher this scenario shows an endogenous and cyclic way to calculate human transformity shown in appendix b the model adopted a period of 6 years at the advanced class course or a similar table 3 lists the necessary inputs to support the class course during a year in this case teachers emerged from the same school some differences arise when comparing tables 2 and 3 the cumulative way of addressing the inputs that contribute to teacher formation led to emergy values around twice those calculated through their educational attainment whereas the former accounting shows that entering students represents the larger contribution table 3 evidences that the teachers labor is the higher contribution an important aspect to notice in both models is the large contribution of human flows when compared to the other emergy flows as a consequence of large human transformity values as stated by campbell et al 2011 human service is often engaged to add value to lower quality materials the transformity of the students after one year of classes attendance is 1 28 108 sej j that corresponds to 3 5 times the value when they began the course 5 conclusions evaluation of human transformity is a topic that deserves attention and deep exploration due to the essential contributions of human activities to all ecological economic and social systems this fact is qualitatively noticeable in terms of larger transformity values for humans flows when compared with other inputs the study evidences the lack of a unified way of accounting for human activities the hierarchical levels approach exemplified by odum s categorization of population in educational levels deals with average values which may not reflect the real and particular situation of a specific system even so it is the most adopted approach to calculate human inputs regardless the spatial scope of the system the adoption of that approach for quantifying human inputs studied under the process oriented framework does not capture the specific convergence of resources it is argued that human transformity is activity time and place specific so it seems necessary to clearly establish the systems conditions and the characteristics of the human work being performed to accomplish accurate evaluations calculating the transformity of english teachers by the cyclic model assuming their endogenous formation within the system could better capture the dynamic and the resources that were directed to produce teacher s knowledge transformity of students after one year of class attendance increased twice or 3 5 times depending on the model used to calculate teachers transformity the endogenous or cyclic model assumed that the emergy accumulated during the period of 6 years that supported their english learning process is the best estimate of the transformity of the teachers work acknowledgments d m lupinacci wants to thank the prosup program capes for the master degree scholarship the vice reitoria de pós graduação e pesquisa of paulista university unip is fully recognized the comments of prof dr feni agostinho are fully acknowledged and have contributed for the manuscript improvement authors want to thank the four anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions appendix a table a1 appendix b the rules of the emergy algebra establish that the emergy of products is equal to the sum of the inputs the model assumes that a teacher is formed after six years of advance course attendance at the same school where he is actually teaching this means that the infrastructure as well as the other supporting resources are analogous to the ones in table 2 but they were considered for a period of 6 years in order to attain the necessary level of english knowledge the first year of the teacher formation process is represented as emstout1 since they are still students that concluded the first year of the advanced course embuild emoperation corresponds to the annual emergy flows of building and operation this latter includes teachers and secretary labor accordingly to the first model considerations for transformity calculations it equals 1 45 1017 sej yr table 2 emstin1 corresponds to the emergy of students entering the school the value is equal to the value considered in the first model it is 1 06 1017 sej yr according to table 2 emstout1 embuild emoperation emstin1 emstout2 embuild emoperation emstout1 2 embuild emoperation emstin1 emstoutn n embuild emoperation emstin1 the same procedure is repeated for the 6 years where emstouti corresponds to the emergy flow of the output students after i years of study with i between 1 and 6 it is assumed that the emstout i 1 is the entering flows of students of the i year since they have just finished the i 1 year of study for next calculations the transformity value extracted from the flow of the 6th year of course attendance emstout6 was adopted for the teachers in table 3 in this way emstout6 6 1 45 1017 1 06 1017 9 76 1017 sej yr so trteach trstout6 3 45 108 sej j trstout6 is the transformity of the students after 6 years of course attendance and trteach is the transformity of the teachers graduated after 6 years of the advanced course 
25365,human contribution regardless of its form manual skilled or intellectual work is always present in productive systems in the role of adding value to lower transformity materials and energy calculation of human transformity within emergy accounting methodology deserves more discussion due to the complexity and variety of aspects that human activities reflect two approaches identified in the literature for human transformity evaluation were adopted as the background to develop the line of thinking and organize discussion the discussion is developed through the study of an english

educational attainment in an analogous way to odum s approach based on energy hierarchy for the second a cyclic model to calculate teachers transformity it was assumed that they acquired the english knowledge in the same school where they are currently teaching it was recognized that human contribution manifests different dimensions the activity the temporal and the spatial dimensions the dimension considered strongly influences the way human flows captures the inputs and how transformity is calculated it is expected that the recognition and discussion of the influence of the dimension considered to calculate human transformity values will contribute to further methodological development values of transfomity that emerged from the cyclic model better capture the dynamic of the converging resources and can feed the transformity database for future emergy calculations keywords emergy human labor environmental accounting human transformity teaching 1 introduction activities

system which has as the main product students after one year of classes attendance through the calculation of the emergy support that converges to students after a year of class attendance some questions arise that were explored throughout the work first two different approaches that addressed human transformities determination were identified and discussed in order to offer a theoretical background to sustain the research with such approaches in mind we attempt to explain the limitations that arise when adopting transformity values that emerged from the first approach to be used to carry out calculation under the second approach the adoption of such a measure requires methodological considerations that include the clearly establishment of the characteristics of human labor in terms of activity spatial and temporal dimensions for this purpose the school a human intensive system that relies on human inputs and also has a human outflow as the main product supplies the empirical case finally a cyclic model where teacher knowledge was acquired at the same english school they are currently teaching was proposed as an alternative procedure to calculate the transformity of teachers it is concluded that the different dimensions of human activities that were revealed during literature revision and throughout the development of the research permeate the whole discussion and will direct the calculation of human transformity 2 on human transformity approaches two approaches emerge from the literature devoted to human transformity calculation abel 2011 had already stated that emergy analyses generally take two most common forms national emergy analyses and process analyses also two approaches frameworks were identified in the literature revision that will direct the discussion the two approaches classified the fundamental works that deal with the conceptual framework on human transformity evaluation 2 1 first approach focus on hierarchical human scales this framework is based on the assumption that the emergy flows of the universe are organized in an energy transformation hierarchy as stated by odum 1996 the total emergy flow of a nation state or region is assigned to each hierarchical level of a human scale when it is not desired to evidence distinct hierarchical levels each member of the whole population is considered as an average located within a unique human level it is applicable when there is no specific skill or level of knowledge education or experience to be represented ulgiati et al 1994 accounted for the emergy of italy and calculated the transformity of human labor in agriculture and industry sectors by the attribution of the entire solar emergy of italy to its total population neither scales nor differentiated human levels were considered thus resulting in only one level of undifferentiated people the solar transformity calculated by the authors to reflect untrained workers equals 7 38 106 sej j analogous consideration was made for unskilled labor of a bamboo plantation in brazil where the entire national solar emergy was assigned to the total population assuming a unique level of people bonilla et al 2010 in this case the transformity value equals 4 18 106 sej j but differently from ulgiati et al 1994 where both the calculation and application of human transformity are based on macro scale evaluation last work uses a human transformity value calculated under macro scale considerations to feed a micro scale bamboo production when the system is perceived like a chain of production where lower levels become the basis for people operating at higher levels the division of different levels of humans according to knowledge educational attainment or other criteria occurs in odum 1996 the human hierarchy for usa population was categorized according to the attained education level the entire emergy of the country was assigned to each level people who attained higher levels contribute with a greater transformity the interval ranges from 8 9 106 to 2 05 109 sej j for preschool and legacy respectively abel 2010 raises the question if the educational attainment was the most appropriate criterion to define human hierarchy levels he calculated the global population transformity range and human scale categorization was conducted through a mathematical relationship the logarithmic relation adopted by abel 2010 was based on odum s observation regarding the one order of magnitude decrease at each step in the chain of energy transformation odum 1996 global population was thus divided in portions logarithmically related resulting in a transformity range from 7 53 104 to 7 53 1013 sej j abel 2010 abel 2011 calculated transfomity by assuming that a hierarchy of seven human levels logarithmically determined exists within the macro domain of the taiwanese county under study however differently from his previous work the entire emergy was not attributed to each of the seven human levels since other processes are sharing the total emergy flow the transformity interval ranges from 2 78 106 to 2 06 1012 sej j 2 2 second approach process based calculation while in the first approach the entire emergy is assigned to each hierarchical level the second approach accounts for the specific inputs that enter a human system specific and well detailed inflows to the system need to be available in this way even people belonging to the same hierarchical level according to the first approach might require different emergy flows if their consumption way of life place or activities differ the approach emphasizes a process oriented assessment when human flows are the main product of a process that receives different inputs flows including human flows this approach focuses on the role of people within the process odum 1996 calculated the emergy to support the university of florida inputs include flows from the environment resources necessary to operate the university such as fuels gasoline water etc students books faculty and maintenance the emergy flows of the students entering the university were calculated by using the transformities of the educational levels according to the first approach odum 1996 thus the transformity of the corresponding level was multiplied by the hours of intellectual activity and metabolic energy per hour the outflows of the university were graduates research services and sport brandt williams 2002 calculated the transformity of migrants based on the flows of food and wages that converge into an individual the process oriented procedure considered only the flows that directly contribute to migrant life the main products are work sleep and play the transformity of educated students at an educational center in switzerland was calculated by meillaud et al 2005 the products comprised educated students publications courses and services calculation was carried out by considering the portion of emergy that directly contributes to students formation see the authors considerations explained in the text the energy of educated students accounted only for intellectual activity or class attendance 1 pers 120 kcal h 4186 j kcal 8 3 h day 235 days yr the transformity value of these students is 2 40 108 sej j the emergy flows of the entering students as well as the faculty and technical staff were calculated using the transformity range for educational attainment levels according to abel 2011 households are the fundamental units in the social structure since they represent shelter family organization child rearing protection and asset storage the system is considered as a producer of people essential inputs such as electricity water and also cultural information information from media conversation education and government among others were included the residents of the household are inputs to the household system and their transformity values were calculated through the first approach by considering a hierarchy of human levels the products of the households are adults and children and the transformity calculated was 1 50 108 sej j campbell and lu 2014 calculated the emergy required to produce an individual with a given level of education in the usa within the period from 1870 to 2006 the calculation procedure included the determination of the annual emergy required support each education subsystem elementary secondary and college and then summing these inputs over the actual years that an individual needed to attain that specific level of education from pre school to doctoral degree differently from odum 1996 whose calculation implied that the entire emergy of the nation is required to sustain all the people that have attained a given level campbell and lu 2014 considered that each subsystem or level has its own inputs and outputs calculated through the process based procedure the inputs required to run the education systems were mostly obtained from annual national database reports and included flows of money energy and materials all converted into emergy flows the transformity values for 1983 range from 22 6 106 to 1446 3 106 sej j from preschool to public status levels respectively although the authors admitted the necessity of improving calculation by applying an iterative method the work successfully explores the dynamics of the us education system over more than 100 years the comparison among the papers within the second approach enabled to establish a sub division in this way although all the papers share the same process based treatment they differ in the purpose of the study and consequently in the information that transformity captures it is observed that the works authored by odum 1996 brandt williams 2002 meillaud et al 2005 and abel 2011 assess the global resources that converged to the systems in an annual and flow basis on the other side campbell and lu 2014 and also their earlier version published in 2009 capture the accumulative global resources to generate the product products in this way human transformity calculated from those works even expressed in the same units and calculated under the same approach represent either flow or cumulative global resources per individual respectively 3 materials and methods 3 1 background information on the english school the building that hosts the school is approximately 45 years old it is located in ouro fino a city of minas gerais state in brazil and was originally built as a private residence it was reconditioned and modified in order to operate as a school it is 114 24 m2 in area and has five classrooms a waiting room a front desk a toilet and a teacher s room there are about 300 students enrolled in the english courses the courses are classified according to the age and english proficiency levels four course modalities are offered at the schools which are tots kids teens and class listed in increasing order of knowledge the present paper focuses on the 47 students who are attending the class course 3 2 emergy accounting and transformity the emergy accounting methodology offers the flexibility of expressing diverse inputs on a common basis as well as evidences the different abilities for energy to do work a complete assessment of the methodology cannot be addressed here but the reader may find it in odum 1996 and brown and ulgiati 2004 among others as stated by grönlund et al 2004 the calculation of resource flows in emergy is corrected for their position in the energy hierarchy of the biosphere which enables us to establish the relative influence of each item on the system solar transformity reflects the hierarchical position of an item within the biosphere and represents the solar emergy required to produce 1 j of a product or service its unit is solar emjoule per joule sej j to establish the emergy flows every material energy or monetary input has to be inventoried and multiplied by its corresponding transformity or unit emergy value uev emergy per unit to be converted into solar equivalents of emergy the solar emergy of the system represents the costs of capturing concentrating and processing in space and time all the direct and indirect energy inputs to a system coscieme et al 2014 a normal procedure to calculate the transformity of the products that emerge from the system evaluation is to divide the total emergy input by the energy of the output in the present case the products is represented by the students that experience all the emergy inputs necessary to perform the teaching learning activities the system was addressed through the second approach framework the system receives emergy from material water electricity and human activities 3 3 data and general calculation considerations the first step of the emergy accounting consists of the identification of all the global resources necessary for the building structure the brazilian standard abnt 2006 defines and quantifies the construction budget exclusively involved in house construction the annual emergy was calculated from the total emergy required for construction divided by a lifespan of 50 years all the resources used to support the system were identified that includes the human work performed by teachers and secretary and the emergy of students who learn through the interaction with teachers and the operational support the system energy diagram is shown in fig 1 the symbol of storage placed on the left within the system frame represents the concentration that resulted from the interaction of material and labor in construction process in order to simplify the diagram all the materials were aggregated in a unique source symbol independently of their origin the detailed list is shown in table 1 building use represented by a box is the process where the house structure and the flows necessary for school operation converge on the right the teaching learning process is represented by the interaction of teachers and students plus the contribution of the operational support the main product corresponds to students who completed a year of class course attendance the softer lines correspond to the energy dissipation the calculation procedure required some allocations only the students enrolled at the class course were taken into consideration the 47 students correspond to 16 of the total number of students in the english school therefore the same proportion of the school operation inputs was considered on the other side the entire annual emergy flow derived from construction was accounted for since it was considered that any teaching learning process would be impossible without the whole facilities teachers and entering students are represented as sources on the right of the diagram fig 1 the revised value of 12 1 1024 sej yr for the emergy baseline is adopted throughout this paper brown and ulgiati 2016 in this way all the uevs calculated on the older baselines were corrected by multiplying by 1 28 or 0 76 whether expressed according to odum 1996 or odum et al 2000 respectively these factors correspond to the ratio between the revised and the older baselines 3 4 considerations for human work calculation the emergy evaluation of human inputs and outputs of the system deserves a detailed description in order to justify the procedure adopted the system is human intensive since it involves students that receive the contribution of teachers to improve their english knowledge two procedures were explored to calculate the emergy of teachers that is delivered to support teaching the first procedure also used to calculate the entering students transformity assumed that teachers and students belong to different education levels within the population in this case the population of minas gerais state for this purpose an analogous consideration to odum s odum 1996 was adopted and the transformity of people belonging to a specific education level was calculated by dividing the total annual solar emergy supporting minas gerais state calculated by demetrio 2011 by the number of people expressed in total annual metabolic energy per person in each category total emergy was assigned to each level of education english teachers were considered to belong to the college graduate level whereas students were assigned to the high school level the calculation of transformity for teachers and entering students is shown in appendix a the second procedure a cyclic model was developed with the assumption that the teachers acquired their english knowledge in the same school where they are currently teaching it was supposed that they studied at an equivalent of the class advanced course during a period of six years after that period they became proficient enough to initiate teaching activities at the same english school the equations are developed in appendix b the emergy of the teaching learning activities performed by teachers and students is calculated as the sum of the emergy delivered by teachers plus the emergy brought by the students during the class period 4 results and discussion the list of inputs their corresponding raw data uevs and emergy invested at school construction is depicted in table 1 results in table 1 evidence the cost of the biosphere invested in providing the structural support for the teaching learning process the annual value of this support when spanned within life time is 0 82 1016 sej and it is distributed among three main material inflows concrete clay and sand and labor the four inputs represent almost the 80 of the total sej sej table 2 shows all the resources used to support the teaching learning process at the class course for a year table 2 shows the emergy necessary to run the teaching learning process of the class course the transformity for teachers and entering students were calculated according to the first approach as explained in the section 3 in this way teachers and entering students are located in different levels of the human hierarchy scale if educational attainment is considered as the criterion human inputs in the form of teachers labor secretary s labor considered as the main staff services and contribution of students who carry their prior education according to their educational attainment are responsible for the main emergy contribution approximately 95 of the total emergy corresponds to human activities such as teaching learning and supporting the teaching learning process emergy flows corresponding to computers electricity and construction have a small although non negligible weight within building and operation contributions as was previously stated the present calculation is carried out within the framework of the second approach although human transformity values shown in table 2 emerged from the first approach the same pattern regarding the use of human transformity calculated within the first approach framework in process oriented analysis was observed in other papers odum 1996 in florida university case meillaud et al 2005 almeida et al 2013 differently campbell and lu 2009 2014 adopted the salary of teachers converted to emergy and a spun up model to get the input values some aspects should be addressed when calculating or adopting human transformity values calculated within the first approach to be in agreement with the theoretical assumption that supports it the human levels or human scales selected to hierarchically organize a population have to be clearly defined and must compose an arrangement based on a real energy transformation hierarchy if another human scale was preferred or considered more adequate to reflect the categories within the human scale as discussed by abel 2010 the levels should be re defined and delimited in order to avoid overlap among levels each person would belong to a hierarchical level if working within the assumption of the first framework however it is not necessarily true that each human task skill or occupation will define a human scale in this way the rereading of almeida et al 2013 raises the question about the correlation among occupations and hierarchical levels the students entering university are considering as located into the high school attainment level whereas professors were considered to belong to a category composed by college professors whether the higher education professors category really represents a hierarchical level or it better represents an occupation portion of a broader level deserves more discussion the number of components in each level will impact the transformity calculated within the first approach since it is assumed that the annual emergy use is necessary for each level to exist and the whole value will be divided to the number of individuals of each level according to abel 2011 all the persons who reside within a process share the total emergy on a per capita basis the present study shows that students during attendance experience various kinds of inputs that enable school operation the value of 2 51 1017 sej year emerges from table 2 for all the students after one year attendance the question about if it is reasonable to calculate the transformity of emerging students from the emergy per capita value arises abel 2011 argues that in the tourist resorts study performed by brown and ulgiati 2001 transformities were not calculated for tourists since they do not actually reside at the resorts on the other hand some authors have expressed the results transformity terms even under the condition of non residence of students within the system meillaud et al 2005 campbell et al 2009 almeida et al 2013 neither do students reside at the school at the english school all but it is reasonable to understand that they could experience the convergence of inputs during classes almost in such a way as they partially reside within the process maybe the central questions to be answered were which the human related products of the process really mean in a process of producing people as in abel 2011 the human product will be people s lives for the process of tourists spending some time at the tourism destination tourist carrying new experiences will be the human product accordingly different aspects of human activities can be highlighted and calculated in emergy terms grönlund 2009 addressed that the flows in systems can be expressed in terms of the quantity quality thinking he also mentioned that the average scientifics primarily think of quantitative measure of energy and seldom of its quality aspects in the same way as energy which can acquire different forms can reveal different energy density or capacity to do work human flows also present different qualitative aspects that we define as dimensions although inherently attached to human related activities dimensions are seldom explicitly expressed in calculations human flows might be ascribed to at least three dimensions we were able to identify form time and space the first is related to the type of activity and the abilities knowledge or skills necessary to carry out the activity within the system meanwhile human activities as well as people lives are bounded in time time is shared among multiple activities during people lives or even in a day people are also physically bounded to territory as already stated by abel 2011 so convergence of inputs represents a convergence to someplace in a spatially defined way all of the three dimensions that define the human product were not generally considered neither evidenced in emergy accountings possibly time is among the three dimensions the most difficult to deal with in emergy terms it seems reasonable to consider a person as belonging to a hierarchical scale namely a specific education level in a yearly basis human products emerging from a specific hierarchical level seem to be a situation where people are involved full time on the other side under the second approach the person can receive the emergy flows during a period and consequently it is only during this period of time when it is possible to control the human product meanwhile this person can represent a temporal input in another system where he could deliver emergy through interaction and profit from emergy support from this location for a period of time sometimes people are considered as actors who receive or deliver emergy flows for a while thus transformity of the students after one year of class attendance calculated by considering the time period the students can access control or have been supported by the convergence of the inputs is 8 87 107 sej j the value is twice their transformity when they began the class course the second model proposed to calculate teachers emergy inflows assumes that the teacher who is currently teaching at the school studied there in order to acquire the necessary level of english knowledge to become a teacher this scenario shows an endogenous and cyclic way to calculate human transformity shown in appendix b the model adopted a period of 6 years at the advanced class course or a similar table 3 lists the necessary inputs to support the class course during a year in this case teachers emerged from the same school some differences arise when comparing tables 2 and 3 the cumulative way of addressing the inputs that contribute to teacher formation led to emergy values around twice those calculated through their educational attainment whereas the former accounting shows that entering students represents the larger contribution table 3 evidences that the teachers labor is the higher contribution an important aspect to notice in both models is the large contribution of human flows when compared to the other emergy flows as a consequence of large human transformity values as stated by campbell et al 2011 human service is often engaged to add value to lower quality materials the transformity of the students after one year of classes attendance is 1 28 108 sej j that corresponds to 3 5 times the value when they began the course 5 conclusions evaluation of human transformity is a topic that deserves attention and deep exploration due to the essential contributions of human activities to all ecological economic and social systems this fact is qualitatively noticeable in terms of larger transformity values for humans flows when compared with other inputs the study evidences the lack of a unified way of accounting for human activities the hierarchical levels approach exemplified by odum s categorization of population in educational levels deals with average values which may not reflect the real and particular situation of a specific system even so it is the most adopted approach to calculate human inputs regardless the spatial scope of the system the adoption of that approach for quantifying human inputs studied under the process oriented framework does not capture the specific convergence of resources it is argued that human transformity is activity time and place specific so it seems necessary to clearly establish the systems conditions and the characteristics of the human work being performed to accomplish accurate evaluations calculating the transformity of english teachers by the cyclic model assuming their endogenous formation within the system could better capture the dynamic and the resources that were directed to produce teacher s knowledge transformity of students after one year of class attendance increased twice or 3 5 times depending on the model used to calculate teachers transformity the endogenous or cyclic model assumed that the emergy accumulated during the period of 6 years that supported their english learning process is the best estimate of the transformity of the teachers work acknowledgments d m lupinacci wants to thank the prosup program capes for the master degree scholarship the vice reitoria de pós graduação e pesquisa of paulista university unip is fully recognized the comments of prof dr feni agostinho are fully acknowledged and have contributed for the manuscript improvement authors want to thank the four anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions appendix a table a1 appendix b the rules of the emergy algebra establish that the emergy of products is equal to the sum of the inputs the model assumes that a teacher is formed after six years of advance course attendance at the same school where he is actually teaching this means that the infrastructure as well as the other supporting resources are analogous to the ones in table 2 but they were considered for a period of 6 years in order to attain the necessary level of english knowledge the first year of the teacher formation process is represented as emstout1 since they are still students that concluded the first year of the advanced course embuild emoperation corresponds to the annual emergy flows of building and operation this latter includes teachers and secretary labor accordingly to the first model considerations for transformity calculations it equals 1 45 1017 sej yr table 2 emstin1 corresponds to the emergy of students entering the school the value is equal to the value considered in the first model it is 1 06 1017 sej yr according to table 2 emstout1 embuild emoperation emstin1 emstout2 embuild emoperation emstout1 2 embuild emoperation emstin1 emstoutn n embuild emoperation emstin1 the same procedure is repeated for the 6 years where emstouti corresponds to the emergy flow of the output students after i years of study with i between 1 and 6 it is assumed that the emstout i 1 is the entering flows of students of the i year since they have just finished the i 1 year of study for next calculations the transformity value extracted from the flow of the 6th year of course attendance emstout6 was adopted for the teachers in table 3 in this way emstout6 6 1 45 1017 1 06 1017 9 76 1017 sej yr so trteach trstout6 3 45 108 sej j trstout6 is the transformity of the students after 6 years of course attendance and trteach is the transformity of the teachers graduated after 6 years of the advanced course 
25366,despite diel and seasonal vertical migrations dvm and svm of high latitude zooplankton have been studied since the late 19th century questions still remain about the influence of environmental seasonality on vertical migration and the combined influence of dvm and svm on zooplankton fitness toward addressing these we developed a model for simulating dvm and svm of high latitude herbivorous copepods in high spatio temporal resolution in the model a unique timing and amplitude of dvm and svm and its ontogenetic trajectory were defined as a vertical strategy growth survival and reproductive performances of numerous vertical strategies hardwired to copepods spawned in different times of the year were assessed by a fitness estimate which was heuristically maximized by a genetic algorithm to derive the optimal vertical strategy for a given model environment the modelled food concentration temperature and visual predation risk had a significant influence on the observed vertical strategies under low visual predation risk dvm was less pronounced and svm and reproduction occurred earlier in the season where capital breeding played a significant role reproduction was delayed by higher visual predation risk and copepods that spawned later in the season used the higher food concentrations and temperatures to attain higher growth which was efficiently traded off for survival through dvm consequently the timing of svm did not change much from that predicted under lower visual predation risk but the body and reserve sizes of overwintering stages and the importance of capital breeding diminished altogether these findings emphasize the significance of dvm in environments with elevated visual predation risk and shows its contrasting influence on the phenology of reproduction and svm and moreover highlights the importance of conducting field and modeling work to study these migratory strategies in concert keywords vertical migration seasonality phenology optimization model genetic algorithm habitat choice 1 introduction vertical migration is a common behavior of many zooplankton taxa based on the periodicity vertical migrations of high latitude zooplankton are classified into diel and seasonal components which have been studied since the late 19th century reviewed in russell 1927 cushing 1951 banse 1964 the short term diel vertical migration dvm has a periodicity of up to 24 h and is understood as a strategy that trades off growth potential to reduce the mortality risk imposed by visual predators lampert 1989 ohman 1990 loose and dawidowicz 1994 the long term seasonal vertical migration svm has a periodicity of up to one year and reflects adaptations to seasonal extremities of food availability head and harris 1985 hind et al 2000 bandara et al 2016 temperature hirche 1991 astthorsson and gislason 2003 and predation risk kaartvedt 1996 bagøien et al 2000 varpe and fiksen 2010 in either case since both dvm and svm can alter feeding growth survival and reproduction and ultimately affect fitness aidley 1981 alerstam et al 2003 cresswell et al 2011 litchman et al 2013 these migratory strategies are termed vertical strategies bandara et al 2016 empirical knowledge on zooplankton vertical strategies largely comes from studying the dynamic vertical positioning of populations in a water column and are often rather coarse in spatial vertical and temporal resolution pearre 1979 this can undermine the key concept that such migrations are individual responses to certain cues or stimuli and not a property of the population zink 2002 and may complicate the understanding of the relationships between vertical strategies and environmental variables see table 1 for examples moreover since diel and seasonal vertical migrations occur on different spatial and temporal scales studying these migrations together in the field in adequate resolution remains a major challenge although novel optical and acoustic methods of in situ observation offer a solution to some of these problems e g basedow et al 2010 sainmont et al 2014b bozman et al 2017 darnis et al 2017 long term deployment and accurately resolving the identity of the migrants remain as key challenges mechanistic models offer an alternative means of studying zooplankton vertical strategies in higher resolution models related to dvm usually encompass the highest spatial 1 m temporal 1 h and biological individual resolution e g fiksen and giske 1995 eiane and parisi 2001 liu et al 2003 burrows and tarling 2004 hansen and visser 2016 models related to svm and diapause i e hibrnation in deeper waters e g hirche 1996 encompass the same biological resolution but are usually coarse in spatio temporal resolution here the time intervals range from 1 h to 1d and vertical spatial elements are usually resolved to either absolute depth units e g 1 m bins or segregated habitats e g fiksen and carlotti 1998 miller et al 1998 hind et al 2000 ji 2011 ji et al 2012 sainmont et al 2015 banas et al 2016 the choice of a coarser spatio temporal resolution of these models reflects the broader space and time scales at which the svm and diapause occurs this contrasting spatio temporal scale makes it difficult to harbor lifetime dynamics of dvm to be simulated in svm models without significantly increasing computer time consequently most models that simulate svm tend to either fully e g hind et al 2000 or partly i e of younger developmental stages e g fiksen and carlotti 1998 disregard dvm however the validity of such simplifications are questionable given the geographically and taxonomically widespread nature of zooplankton dvm behavior and its ontogenetic patterns huntley and brooks 1982 huang et al 1993 osgood and frost 1994 hays 1995 it is thus interesting to investigate whether the extra biological information resulting from modeling dvm and svm in concert is a worthy trade off for the elevated computer time if so such models may lead to improvements of the current understanding about how environmental seasonality shapes up vertical strategies and the means of which the latter influences life histories of high latitude zooplankton in this study we present a model of zooplankton vertical strategies the model operates in a high latitude setting and simulates both dvm and svm of a herbivorous copepod with an annual life cycle in high spatial vertical and temporal resolution using this model we aim to investigate the influence of environmental variables on vertical strategies and how vertical strategies affect fitness and phenology in seasonal environments we further discuss how short term behavior dvm influences and interacts in the longer term and shape up different life history components of copepod strategies 2 materials and methods although the model is not strictly individual based it is described following the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 to improve reproducibility 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to investigate the bottom up and top down influences of environmental variability i e irradiance temperature food availability and predation risk on vertical strategies of a high latitude herbivorous copepod and to understand the influences of vertical strategies on its fitness and phenology 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model consists of three entities vertical strategies model organism and the model environment vertical strategies define the timing amplitude and the ontogenetic trajectories of dvm and svm and are described using six evolvable soft parameters table 2 these are hardwired to the model organism i e copepods spawned in different times of the year the model organism is a hypothetical herbivorous semelparous female copepod hereafter the copepod with an annual life cycle that resembles calanus finmarchicus and c glacialis in terms of body size behavior and life history strategies conover 1988 these two species often dominate the copepod biomass in the north atlantic and most eurasian sub arctic and arctic seas and shelves falk petersen et al 2009 their life cycle consists of an embryonic stage egg six naupliar stages ni nvi five copepodite stages ci cv and an adult eggs that are released in near surface waters in the spring usually develop into civ or cv stages toward the end of the productive season as further development is typically constrained by the duration of the productive season and seasonal peaks of visual predation risk civs and cvs descend into deeper waters and remain in a state of diapause dormancy with minimal physiological activity hirche 1996 overwintering stages ascend to near surface waters as the primary production commences in the following year molt into adults and start to reproduce conover 1988 varpe 2012 the life cycle of the two species is usually completed within one year in most sub arctic and arctic

annual life cycle of the copepod carlotti and wolf 1998 have implemented a similar construct but the svm of their model was constrained by fixing the timing of ascent and descent to match the field observations of the region of interest in contrast the timing and the amplitude of dvm and svm of our model are flexible and allowed to evolve according to the environmental conditions to achieve this level of flexibility we used multiple evolvable proxies to represent vertical migration table 2 this resulted in a complex seven dimensional optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using heuristic techniques zanakis and evans 1981 as evolutionary algorithms provide an efficient means of solving multi dimensional optimization problems deb 2001 eiben and smith 2003 we used a ga as the optimization platform of this model further to increase the precision of the evolvable parameters and that of the behavioral strategies and life history traits ensued fig 2 we used a ga variant with floating point representation i e a real coded genetic algorithm davis 1989 lucasius and kateman 1989 herrera et al 1998 the strategy oriented construct of this model contrasts classic individual based models of zooplankton life history and behavior in two main ways first trading off of biological resolution strategies vs individuals to accommodate higher spatio temporal resolution and second the lack of population level responses such as density dependence as a result modelled vertical strategies do not interact with each other and show no quantitative feedbacks with the model environment

role in the model initialization section 2 5 and selection recombination and mutation operators of the ga section 2 6 4 2 4 6 observations for a given model environment the model produces heuristic estimates of the optimal vertical strategy and optimal time of birth along with a range of associated life history traits fig 2 table 3 2 5 initialization the model initializes with seeding of n 106 eggs at random times of the year to random depths 50 m of the water column each seed represents an embryonic stage of a copepod with a specific vertical strategy which is determined by randomly assigning values to the evolvable proxies the ranges bounds and resolutions of these proxies are listed in table 2 2 6 submodels 2 6 1 growth and development we modelled somatic growth in carbon units μg c according to the growth model of huntley and boyd 1984 eqs 1 8 below using a chlorophyll a c ratio of 0 030 båmstedt et al 1991 sakshaug et al 2009 this growth sub model was used due to its simplicity and general applicability which are shown by its utility to model several different copepod taxa with varying body sizes representing a wide range of geographical locations e g robinson

0 exp ψ z where iz and i 0 are irradiance at depth z and surface at a given time and ψ 0 06 m 1 is the attenuation coefficient for downwards directed irradiance in the water column we remapped irradiance i between 0 1 0 9 i so that visual predation risk is not nullified even at the lowest levels of irradiance and the copepod has some chance of survival even at highest levels of irradiance the detection efficiency of visually orientating planktivores increases with the size of their prey brooks and dodson 1965 batty et al 1990 for simplicity we modelled the size dependent visual predation risk using a linear model assuming that the largest developmental stage is ca 10 times more vulnerable to visual predators compared to the smallest developmental stage fig 4 a table 5 de robertis 2002 this was implemented using the scalar k 1 k 0 as 10 m v i t z i t z k i t the initial value of k i e k value at the embryonic stage range 1 10 4 1 5 10 2 was decided so that it produces hourly estimates of visual predator induced mortality we assumed the mortality risk caused by non visual predators non visual predation risk mn to be 1 of the maximum visual predation risk and constant over time and depth eiane and parisi 2001 2 6 2 2 diel vertical migration the copepod may perform dvm to trade off growth potential to minimize the visual predation risk we used the photoreactive behavior as a proxy to estimate the timing and amplitude of dvm e g kerfoot 1970 carlotti and wolf 1998 here α an evolvable light sensitivity parameter table 2 was used to define an irradiance threshold above which induces a negative phototatic response in the vertical swimming behavior båtnes et al 2015 cohen et al 2015 at any given time the copepod occupies a depth with an irradiance level it z below α from a series of possible depth bins that satisfy the it z α condition we assumed that the copepod searches and occupies the depth that maximizes its growth potential for simplicity we further assumed that internal state dependent factors such as hunger and satiation have a negligible influence on the modelled dvm the vertical search pattern was predicted using a biased random walk algorithm codling 2003 appendix a2 in supplementary material assuming that the copepod is neutrally buoyant and vertically moves in the water column at a maximum velocity hereafter cruising velocity u we used several stage specific cruising velocity estimates of calanus spp available in the literature fig 4b and related those to body mass as 11 u i t 8 0116 w c i t 0 4531 we considered the size or stage specific variability of dvm as a response to size dependent visual predation risk zaret and kerfoot 1975 uye et al 1990 hays et al 1994 eiane and ohman 2004 and modelled it by scaling the light sensitivity parameter α with the body mass wc as data on the light sensitivity of younger developmental stages ni ciii of calanus spp is rare we could not derive a general relationship between wc and α to address this we defined an evolvable parameter β that describes the size specificity of α which at its maximum β 10 downscales α of the adult female to 10 of that of the egg ni fig 4c higher trajectories than β 10 were not used as it was shown in the trial runs that the model always converges on β 10 even at highest levels of visual predation risk 2 6 2 3 energy storage civ and cv stages can allocate a specific fraction from surplus growth evolvable growth allocation parameter γ table 2 to build up an energy reserve fig 3c that possesses a maximum size of 70

year reviewed in conover 1988 hagen and auel 2001 falk petersen et al 2009 the copepod may perform svm we used the state of the energetic reserve as a proxy of timing of the svm cf visser and

overwintering period surplus gains are not allocated to develop further energetic reserves but may be used for structural growth and reproduction fig 3e and f table 5 2 6 2 5 metabolism the basal metabolic cost relates with the body mass and ambient temperature expressed as k wm in eq 3 terms as defined above and in table 4 the metabolic cost of zooplankton vertical movements can account for 0 300 of the basal metabolic demand vlymen 1970 foulds and roff 1976 morris et al 1985 dawidowicz and loose 1992 for simplicity we assumed the cost of vertical movement to be 150 of the basal metabolic cost midpoint of the above range this additional cost is subtracted from the growth eqs 1 or 3 the energy reserve is used to balance the metabolic demands that cannot be sustained under low ambient food concentrations fig 3c f 2 6 2 6 starvation risk when energy reserves are depleted the metabolic demands that cannot be balanced by food intake are met by catabolizing structural body mass fig 3b f this elevates the mortality risk due to starvation starvation risk ms which is defined as a probability that increases as a linear function of catabolized structural mass as 12 m s i t 2 w q i t here wq is the catabolized structural mass expressed as a proportion of the maximum structural mass prior to structural catabolization wq can reach a maximum of 0 5 during which ms peaks following eq 12 and the copepod dies according the chossat s rule chossat 1843 which posits that starving animals may catabolize about half of their body weight before death irrespective of the age of this generalized rule it has been used as a constraint in starvation studies of many vertebrate and invertebrate taxa e g threlkeld 1976 spencer 1997 costello 1998 loos et al 2010 2 6 3 reproduction we assumed that somatic growth ceases after the final molt and all adults become sexually mature at a constant structural body mass fig 3f table 5 energetic input to egg production may be sourced from food intake income breeding or allocating a specific amount of matter c equivalent to the maximum growth rate gt eqs 1 and 2 from the remaining energetic reserve capital breeding cf varpe et al 2009

optimization models e g kiørboe and hirst 2008 but may not bare the same interpretation given the strategy oriented construct of this model when the model predicts an optimal vertical strategy and time of birth for a particular environment we can assume that those predicted optima should persist from one generation to the next if the environment remains constant if a copepod s spawning period lasts from time tr to td time of death we assumed that it produces a series of offspring with the same vertical strategy but born at different times of the year ranging from tr to td however only the offspring with a time of birth matching that of the mother can represent the entire evolvable soft parameter set of the mother and guarantee its persistence from one generation to another fig 5 a c therefore we adjusted the fitness using a binary weight ω by setting ω 0 if the copepod s spawning season does not overlap its time of birth fig 5a and b and vice versa fig 5c we used a real coded genetic algorithm rcga to derive heuristic estimates of optimal vertical strategy and time of birth that maximizes fitness in a given model environment fig 5d in the rcga six proxies of vertical strategies and the time of birth of the copepod that those are hardwired to table 2 are considered as genes on a single chromosome the rcga begins by selecting a mating pool of n chromosomes parents i e n vertical strategies seeded in different times of the year from the initial seeds using a binary two way deterministic tournament selection goldberg and deb 1991 miller and goldberg 1995 genes of two randomly selected parents from the mating pool are recombined through blend crossover following the blx α method eshelman and schaffer 1993 which produces two offspring recombinants genes of the recombinants are mutated at a probability of 0 02 by random replacement uniform mutation eiben and smith 2003 haupt and haupt 2004 the population of strategies resulting from these operations comprises of n parents whose fitness is known and n offspring whose fitness is not yet known parents with unique gene combinations are selected to construct a library hereafter the reference library which is updated at each iteration each offspring is compared with those in the reference library to assess their fitness fitness of the offspring with similar gene combination to those in the library are assigned in situ while the rest goes through the life cycle simulation to determine fitness ls 2 in fig 5d once the fitness of all 2n individuals are known n survivors are selected following a round robin all play all tournament of size 10 harik et al 1997 eiben and smith 2003 this process is repeated for a minimum of 100 iterations and terminated when the mean fitness of the population shows no improvement for 25 consecutive iterations ϕ in fig 5d eiben and smith 2003 2 7 programming execution and analysis of the model we used r version 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and r studio integrated development environment ide version 1 0 136 rstudio team 2016 along with the high performance computing packages rcpp eddelbuettel et al 2011 and bigmemory kane et al 2013 to construct simulate and analyze the model a basic run was performed in the environment l using default values for model parameters table 4 in order to test the influence of model parameters and environmental variables on model predicted vertical strategies and fitness we performed a sensitivity analysis following jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 here we calculated a sensitivity score sx as 16 s x x b r x m x b r p b r p m p b r where x is the predicted model output of the basic run xbr and the modified run xm for a given change 25 of input parameter value between the basic run pbr and the modified run pm we tested the sensitivity of vertical strategies and fitness for 13 different input parameters appendix a3 in supplementary material for the convenience of interpretation of these results we presented the sensitivity scores under three categories no sensitivity sx 0 low sensitivity 0 sx 3 and high sensitivity sx 3 finally we studied the changes of heuristically optimized vertical strategies by performing model simulations in the three model environments at different levels of visual predation risk while maintaining the rest of the parameter values at its default levels as gas produce heuristic estimates of the maximum fitness there is no guarantee that it would converge on the global maximum given a potentially diverse fitness landscape record et al 2010 therefore we replicated each model run 10 times with different starting values assigned to the soft parameters table 2 to check if the algorithm converges on the same set of solutions as the optimized parameter values showed little variability between replicate runs 5 we used the mean of the replicates for each parameter for analyses 3 results 3 1 the basic run in the basic run the life cycle emerging from the model began as an egg spawned at 20 m depth in late april the first two nauplii stages did not perform dvm but dvm and the associated metabolic cost swimming cost increased ontogenetically from niii onwards fig 6 a b e and f the somatic growth of all developmental stages beyond nv occurred under food limitation fig 6c and because of reduced growth rates their predicted development times were higher than those estimated from bělehrádek temperature functions fig 6d as the energetic reserve reached 65 of the total body mass ws 196 μg c fig 6g the developmental stage cv descended to an overwintering depth of 150 m in mid june ca 2 months before the pelagic primary production had terminated fig 6e it remained there for ca 290 days and ascended into near surface waters again in early april of the following year ca 10 days after the pelagic primary production had commenced fig 1c with fully depleted energetic reserves although the energetic cost of seasonal migration was quite high the cost of ascent was ca ¼ of that of the descent due to the loss of body mass during overwintering fig 6f and g the copepod developed to an adult female in mid april and thenceforth produced eggs ca 3000 via income breeding until mid june and then died fig 6h 3 2 sensitivity analysis the model predicted fitness was highly sensitive to visual predation risk food concentration and temperature fig 7 a 25 change in the visual predation risk k 7 5 10 3 and 1 25 10 2 influenced the dvm which intensified at the higher end of k and vice versa table 6 although the overwintering depth deepened by ca 13 under higher visual predation risk it did not change under lower visual predation risk furthermore higher visual predation risk lowered the fecundity and longevity and vice versa table 6 a 25 change in food concentration f 10 and 6 mg m 3 chl a notably influenced the dvm timing of svm and time of birth but not the overwintering depth fig 7 under low food concentration the dvm was less pronounced and the seasonal descent was delayed ca 15 d compared to the basic run possibly because of foraging later into the feeding season due to lower growth potential sustained under increased food limitation table 6 however the copepod overwintered as a significantly large cv with elevated energetic reserves and made ca 7 d earlier spring ascent late march followed by spawning that preceded the pelagic bloom by ca 2 days cf fig 1c here ca 2 of the total egg production was sourced from capital breeding table 6 early seasonal ascent capital breeding and early spawning thus appear as strategies employed to avoid seasonal peak in visual predation risk cf fig 1a eqs 9 and 10 when foraging efforts are elevated to cope with lower growth potential however this came with a cost of decreased fecundity 80 and longevity 7 fig 7 table 6 increased food concentration had the opposing effects on the predicted behavioral strategies and life history traits described above fig 7 table 6 the influence of 4 5 c change in temperature t 22 5 and 13 5 c on copepod s behavior and life history followed the same general trends described for food concentration fig 7 table 6 and highlight the equally important roles played by food availability and temperature in growth and development 3 3 latitudinal environmental variability and visual predation risk model predicted optimal time of birth body mass wc and ws at seasonal descent overwintering depth and longevity changed with visual predation risk k but showed less variability along the modelled latitudinal environmental gradient fig 8 b d and g the predicted optimal time of birth changed from late april to mid may with increasing visual predation risk and was constant across the three model environments with the exception that it occurred the earliest in mid april at environment h under the lowest visual predation risk k 10 4 fig 8d at lower levels of visual predation risk the copepod overwintered as relatively large cvs with elevated energetic reserves at relatively shallow depths fig 8b and c however as the visual predation risk increased the copepod overwintered as smaller cvs or civs with relatively less energetic reserves at greater depths although the predicted longevity decreased by ca 80 d along the modelled visual predation risk gradient fig 8g longevity at environment h under k 10 4 was lower 365 d compared to those predicted under higher visual predation risk levels 384 430 d the predicted timing of svm showed significant variability across the three model environments but was less affected by visual predation risk fig 8a both the descent and ascent occurred earliest at the lowest latitude environment but happened later in the season at higher latitude environments with a shift of about a month although this reflects the delayed occurrence of the pelagic bloom along the modelled latitudinal gradient fig 1c f and i appendix a1 in supplementary material the seasonal ascent at environment h under lowest visual predation risk k 10 4 occurred ca 25 days before the pelagic primary production had commenced figs 1i and 8a the predicted onset of spawning fecundity and breeding mode index fig 8d f along with the predicted timing and amplitude of dvm food limitation index and development time fig 9 varied with both the visual predation risk and latitudinal environmental gradient in all model environments the spawning started earliest under the lowest visual predation risk k 10 4 fig 8d here spawning commenced ca 5 7 days earlier than the onset of spring primary production in lower latitude environments fig 1c and f and ca 2 5 5 of the total egg production were sourced from capital breeding fig 8f spawning at environment h commenced ca 25 d prior to the pelagic bloom but lasted only for ca 10 days figs 1i 8d and g consequently the expected fecundity was the lowest ca 145 eggs fig 8e and all eggs were sourced from capital breeding fig 8f the onset of spawning shifted later into the season at higher latitude model environments at higher levels of visual predation risk and occurred after the commencement of the pelagic primary production figs 1c f i and 8d here all eggs were produced via income breeding fig 8f at lower levels of visual predation risk 10 4 k 5 10 3 the predicted dvm pattern was similar across the three model environments where developmental stages until early copepodites did not perform dvm fig 9a and b although the model predicted the younger developmental stages niii onwards to perform dvm under elevated visual predation risk at environment l this effect gradually waned in higher latitude model environments the food limitation index strongly followed the dvm pattern where developmental stages that performed dvm suffered from increased food limitation fig 9c food limitation significantly reduced the growth rates cf eqs 1 3 see also appendix a4 in supplementary material and consequently the development times increased along the modelled environmental gradient fig 9d further in each model environment lowest development times were predicted under the lowest level of visual predation risk 4 discussion 4 1 influence of environmental variables on vertical strategies 4 1 1 diel vertical migration in this model visual predation risk had the highest influence on the dvm which diminished under low visual predation risk figs 7 and 9 table 6 and completely ceased when visual predation was removed from the model k 0 data not presented conversely under high visual predation risk also younger developmental stages reduced the time spent in food rich surface waters by performing low amplitude shallow dvm fig 9a and b food concentration and temperature also influenced the dvm fig 7 table 6 lower food concentrations or temperatures produced low amplitude dvm possibly due the low growth potential attained in cold food limited conditions fig 9 eqs 1 8 appendix a4 in supplementary material under these conditions it appears that modelled copepods do not possess sufficient growth potential to trade off for survival and perform high amplitude deep dvm a conclusion also drawn in empirical work e g huntley and brooks 1982 loose and dawidowicz 1994 reduced or absence of dvm under low food concentrations and temperatures are reported from several other modeling studies on copepods and euphausiids e g andersen and nival 1991 fiksen and giske 1995 fiksen and carlotti 1998 tarling et al 2000 and from empirical work on marine copepods and freshwater cladocerans e g hardy and gunther 1935 huntley and brooks 1982 johnsen and jakobsen 1987 however the largely exogenous regulated dvm behavior emerging from this model does not render a complete view on the subject matter as dvm can also be sensitive to internal physiological states of zooplankton e g hunger and satiation hays et al 2001 pearre 2003 the effect of temperature on growth potential further explains the diminished influence of visual predation risk on the timing and amplitude of dvm predicted at higher latitude model environments fig 9 albeit similar food concentrations the modelled temperatures decreased from lower to higher latitude model environments reflecting a decreasing gradient of growth potential fig 1 appendix a4 in supplementary material consequently the model predicted optimal dvm strategy for higher latitude environments was to elevate the growth potential by spending more time foraging in near surface waters fig 9a and b this effect was most pronounced among younger developmental stages niii ci whose dvm reduced from environment l to m and completely ceased at environment h dvm of younger developmental stages niii onwards are most commonly reported from lower latitudes for calanus spp e g huntley and brooks 1982 uye et al 1990 huang et al 1993 osgood and frost 1994 zakardjian et al 1999 and metridia spp e g hays 1995 while some field studies failed to detect notable dvm in high latitudes e g blachowiak samolyk et al 2006 basedow et al 2010 others reported ontogenetic increase of dvm ci onwards e g dale and kaartvedt 2000 daase et al 2008 in calanus spp however empirical data with high spatial temporal and biological i e developmental stage resolution is needed to test the ontogenetic and latitudinal patterns of dvm predicted by our model the predicted dvm amplitudes spanned across the productive part of the water column i e upper 30 m cf figs 1 6 and 9 and showed a positive relationship with the vertical extent of food availability fig 7 moreover strategies that involve higher amplitude dvm lead to increased food limitation where younger developmental stages with no energetic reserves tend to suffer from starvation risk due to low temperatures and food concentrations that prevail in deeper parts of the model environments fig 1 therefore low amplitude dvm appears to be a strategy that efficiently trades off growth potential for survival by balancing both the visual predation and starvation risks kerfoot 1970 fiksen and giske 1995 de robertis 2002 although higher amplitude dvm can be predicted either by not modeling starvation risk or imposing starvation tolerance e g andersen and nival 1991 carlotti and wolf 1998 zakardjian et al 1999 tarling et al 2000 we did not follow these approaches because our model sufficiently represents the relative importance of dvm across the modelled environmental gradients 4 1 2 seasonal vertical migration food availability and temperature had the most notable influence on the model predicted timing of svm fig 7 table 6 the predicted shift in timing of seasonal descent and ascent coincided with those of the pelagic algal bloom and thermal stratification along the modelled latitudinal gradient figs 1 and 8a this agrees with the argument that food availability is the ultimate factor influencing the timing of seasonal vertical migration of calanus spp herman 1983 head and harris 1985 hind et al 2000 however field estimates of timing of svm of calanus spp from low to high latitudes do not point to a simple south north gradient as predicted in our model table 7 see also melle et al 2014 this discrepancy of model predictions and field estimates underlies the differences between location specific variability in hydrography algal bloom dynamics and species composition e g hirche 1991 daase et al 2013 diversity of generation lengths and breeding strategies e g conover 1988 falk petersen et al 2009 and climate driven and other stochastic oscillations of environmental conditions e g reid et al 1998 eiane and parisi 2001 ji 2011 however direct comparisons between vertical migratory patterns predicted by a strategy oriented model and field estimates should be done with caution as an environment specific optimal vertical strategy predicted by the model contrasts the diversity of vertical behavior exhibited by individuals of a zooplankton population visual predation risk and depth of thermal stratification summer autumn were the only environmental variables that influenced the model predicted overwintering depth figs 7 and 8b table 6 the overwintering depth deepened at higher levels of visual predation risk and deeper thermal stratification depths and agrees with hirche 1991 kaartvedt 1996 dale et al 1999 bagøien et al 2000 and astthorsson and gislason 2003 that calanus spp prefer colder water masses with low predator abundance for overwintering however the overwintering depths predicted by or model underestimate those of field observations which can extend well below 1000 m e g østvedt 1955 apart from the shallow bottom depths modelled this discrepancy largely reflects how overwintering habitat selection of calanus spp is influenced by the buoyancy effect of stored lipid reserves visser and jónasdóttir 1999 convective mixing of surface waters irigoien 2004 and vertical distribution of water masses and predator populations such as mesopelagic fish predatory ctenophores and krill hirche 1991 kaartvedt 1996 bagøien et al 2000 bandara et al 2016 4 2 influence of vertical strategies on fitness and phenology 4 2 1 diel vertical migration in the model high amplitude dvm caused increased food limitation that led to slow growth and development and reduced fecundity figs 7 and 9 table 6 this ultimately resulted in lower fitness relative to that predicted for low amplitude dvm it is therefore apparent that decisions to fully or partly disregard dvm in models focusing svm and other seasonal strategies should be made with caution as our findings indicate that dvm can have a notable negative influence on growth and development of younger developmental stages especially at lower latitudes at higher levels of visual predation risk the model predicted up to a one month delay in the onset of spawning fig 8d and highlights the influence of predation risk on the reproductive phenology magnhagen 1991 stibor 1992 varpe et al 2007 these late spawned copepods appeared to possess higher fitness compared to those spawned earlier fig 8h this seems counterintuitive as zooplankton are more vulnerable to visual predation risk later in the season due to the higher irradiance levels that persist in late spring and summer in this model the early feeding season i e until the time of peak pelagic bloom is characterized by higher food concentrations and lower temperatures fig 1 although the food concentration decreases by ca 20 by late spring or early summer the ambient temperature increases by ca 2 4 times further even at the onset of the productive season the visual predation risk had reached ca 70 of its maximum in all model environments fig 1a d and g therefore it is likely that copepods born relatively later in the season use the higher temperatures to attain a higher growth eqs 1 8 appendix a4 in supplementary material which is then efficiently traded off for survival through dvm to counter the risk of increasing visual predation risk fig 9 conversely due to lower temperatures copepods born earlier in the season must elevate the time spent foraging in near surface waters to attain higher growth rates and become more vulnerable to visual predation risk however it should be noted that our model does not consider the ability of calanus spp to use the darker and seasonally ice covered period of the year to attain growth with minimal influence from visual predators by feeding on alternative food sources such as ice algae and microzooplankton conover and siferd 1993 søreide et al 2010 compared to the phenology of reproduction the elevated visual predation risk had little influence on the timing of seasonal migration fig 8a the svm strategy predicted by the model was to descend to overwintering depth approximately at the same period of the year mid late summer but with ca ⅓ lesser the body mass both structural and energetic reserve mass compared to that under the lowest visual predation risk fig 8a and c as higher visual predation risk tends to intensify dvm in this model fig 9a and b it appears that trading off growth potential for survival makes an earlier seasonal descent unfavorable as food limitation and slower growth rates fig 9c and d demands more time to acquire sufficient energy reserves to overwinter despite the smaller body mass of the overwintering stage further as the model predicted body mass of the overwintering stage reaches a lower threshold at k 10 4 fig 8c it is likely that modelled copepods overwintered with minimum reserves to last the overwintering duration and therefore makes an earlier descent with lesser energy reserves nearly impossible in the contrary occupying near surface waters later into the season and descend to overwintering depths with elevated energetic reserves is also unfavorable as the visual predation risk in this model is not nullified even at the deepest parts of the water column eq 10 the lesser influence of visual predation risk on the timing of svm does not align with kaartvedt 2000 and varpe and fiksen 2010 who view predation by planktivorous fish as a key driver of generation lengths and timing of seasonal descent in c finmarchicus in the norwegian sea however the consequences of dvm on the timing of seasonal descent presented here may diminish if there is an energetic benefit of dvm e g mclaren 1963 enright 1977 if copepods are capable of utilizing alternative food sources e g runge and ingram 1991 hirche and kwasniewski 1997 or if there is a strong size selection against larger developmental stages by visual predators than the linear relationship applied in our model cf fig 4a with brooks and dodson 1965 batty et al 1990 langbehn and varpe 2017 4 2 2 seasonal vertical migration svm was essential for the wintertime survival of the modelled copepods given its food source is only available during the primary production season spring autumn fig 1 different combinations of proxies table 2 yielded non seasonally migrating strategies in which the copepods developed to adults and reproduced within the same productive season although this strategy had the potential to produce more than one generation per year especially in the relatively lower latitude environment l fig 1a c we did not peruse this further as our focus was on an annual life cycle see the fitness weighing process eq 14 fig 5a c the body mass and the size of energetic reserve at seasonal descent together with the timing of seasonal ascent had a profound influence on the predicted timing of reproduction breeding strategy and fecundity fig 8 overwintering as large cvs with elevated energetic reserves at lower visual predation risk enabled the copepod to allocate the post overwintering surplus energetic reserves to capital breeding in the following year fig 8c and f and see also sainmont et al 2014a ejsmond et al 2015 halvorsen 2015 as capital breeding emerged in environments with lower temperatures and food concentrations fig 7 table 6 it appears as a strategy that allows the new generation to feed from the very start of the feeding season while avoiding the seasonal peak in visual predation risk later in the year fig 1 see also varpe et al 2009 the proportional increase of capital breeding eggs from relatively lower latitude environment l to higher latitude environment h reflects the decreasing temperature gradient that occur at overwintering depths of these environments figs 1 8b and f overwintering in colder water masses reduces the metabolic costs and conserves the energetic reserve which ultimately boosts the fecundity through capital breeding hirche 1991 hirche 1996 astthorsson and gislason 2003 the pure capital breeding strategy predicted at environment h under the lowest visual predation risk more resembles the spawning strategy of c hyperboreus than c finmarchicus and c glacialis conover 1988 falk petersen et al 2009 the sensitivity of the model predicted breeding strategy to visual predation risk indicates an extensive pre breeding cost of capital breeding imposed by the size dependent visual predation risk and acquisition and carriage of energy reserves jönsson 1997 varpe et al 2009 moreover excess energy storage i e more than to overwinter and capital breeding do not emerge as dominant strategies in this model as the environmental parameters are modelled in a perfectly predictable manner without any year to year variability however capital breeding and energy storage may possess a much larger adaptive significance in nature where spatio temporal environmental heterogeneity and unpredictability are more pronounced compared to our model e g jönsson 1997 fischer et al 2009 4 3 concluding remarks findings of this study highlight the influence of environmental variables on vertical strategies and suggest that in seasonal environments dvm and svm should be studied in concert as these behavioral strategies can have profound and largely different effects on fitness and phenology of herbivorous zooplankton therefore given the significance of biological information ensued sacrificing computer time to adopt higher spatio temporal resolution in behavioral and life history models seems to be an appealing practice however strong recommendations should only be made after testing our model predictions further

25366,despite diel and seasonal vertical migrations dvm and svm of high latitude zooplankton have been studied since the late 19th century questions still remain about the influence of environmental seasonality on vertical migration and the combined influence of dvm and svm on zooplankton fitness toward addressing these we developed a model for simulating dvm and svm of high latitude herbivorous copepods in high spatio temporal resolution in the model a unique timing and amplitude of dvm and svm and its ontogenetic trajectory were defined as a vertical strategy growth survival and reproductive performances of numerous vertical strategies hardwired to copepods spawned in different times of the year were assessed by a fitness estimate which was heuristically maximized by a genetic algorithm to derive the optimal vertical strategy for a given model environment the modelled food concentration temperature and visual predation risk had a significant influence on the observed vertical strategies under low visual predation risk dvm was less pronounced and svm and reproduction occurred earlier in the season where capital breeding played a significant role reproduction was delayed by higher visual predation risk and copepods that spawned later in the season used the higher food concentrations and temperatures to attain higher growth which was efficiently traded off for survival through dvm consequently the timing of svm did not change much from that predicted under lower visual predation risk but the body and reserve sizes of overwintering stages and the importance of capital breeding diminished altogether these findings emphasize the significance of dvm in environments with elevated visual predation risk and shows its contrasting influence on the phenology of reproduction and svm and moreover highlights the importance of conducting field and modeling work to study these migratory strategies in concert keywords vertical migration seasonality phenology optimization model genetic algorithm habitat choice 1 introduction vertical migration is a common behavior of many zooplankton taxa based on the periodicity vertical migrations of high latitude zooplankton are classified into diel and seasonal components which have been studied since the late 19th century reviewed in russell 1927 cushing 1951 banse 1964 the short term diel vertical migration dvm has a periodicity of up to 24 h and is understood as a strategy that trades off growth potential to reduce the mortality risk imposed by visual predators lampert 1989 ohman 1990 loose and dawidowicz 1994 the long term seasonal vertical migration svm has a periodicity of up to one year and reflects adaptations to seasonal extremities of food availability head and harris 1985 hind et al 2000 bandara et al 2016 temperature hirche 1991 astthorsson and gislason 2003 and predation risk kaartvedt 1996 bagøien et al 2000 varpe and fiksen 2010 in either case since both dvm and svm can alter feeding growth survival and reproduction and ultimately affect fitness aidley 1981 alerstam et al 2003 cresswell et al 2011 litchman et al 2013 these migratory strategies are termed vertical strategies bandara et al 2016 empirical knowledge on zooplankton vertical strategies largely comes from studying the dynamic vertical positioning of populations in a water column and are often rather coarse in spatial vertical and temporal resolution pearre 1979 this can undermine the key concept that such migrations are individual responses to certain cues or stimuli and not a property of the population zink 2002 and may complicate the understanding of the relationships between vertical strategies and environmental variables see table 1 for examples moreover since diel and seasonal vertical migrations occur on different spatial and temporal scales studying these migrations together in the field in adequate resolution remains a major challenge although novel optical and acoustic methods of in situ observation offer a solution to some of these problems e g basedow et al 2010 sainmont et al 2014b bozman et al 2017 darnis et al 2017 long term deployment and accurately resolving the identity of the migrants remain as key challenges mechanistic models offer an alternative means of studying zooplankton vertical strategies in higher resolution models related to dvm usually encompass the highest spatial 1 m temporal 1 h and biological individual resolution e g fiksen and giske 1995 eiane and parisi 2001 liu et al 2003 burrows and tarling 2004 hansen and visser 2016 models related to svm and diapause i e hibrnation in deeper waters e g hirche 1996 encompass the same biological resolution but are usually coarse in spatio temporal resolution here the time intervals range from 1 h to 1d and vertical spatial elements are usually resolved to either absolute depth units e g 1 m bins or segregated habitats e g fiksen and carlotti 1998 miller et al 1998 hind et al 2000 ji 2011 ji et al 2012 sainmont et al 2015 banas et al 2016 the choice of a coarser spatio temporal resolution of these models reflects the broader space and time scales at which the svm and diapause occurs this contrasting spatio temporal scale makes it difficult to harbor lifetime dynamics of dvm to be simulated in svm models without significantly increasing computer time consequently most models that simulate svm tend to either fully e g hind et al 2000 or partly i e of younger developmental stages e g fiksen and carlotti 1998 disregard dvm however the validity of such simplifications are questionable given the geographically and taxonomically widespread nature of zooplankton dvm behavior and its ontogenetic patterns huntley and brooks 1982 huang et al 1993 osgood and frost 1994 hays 1995 it is thus interesting to investigate whether the extra biological information resulting from modeling dvm and svm in concert is a worthy trade off for the elevated computer time if so such models may lead to improvements of the current understanding about how environmental seasonality shapes up vertical strategies and the means of which the latter influences life histories of high latitude zooplankton in this study we present a model of zooplankton vertical strategies the model operates in a high latitude setting and simulates both dvm and svm of a herbivorous copepod with an annual life cycle in high spatial vertical and temporal resolution using this model we aim to investigate the influence of environmental variables on vertical strategies and how vertical strategies affect fitness and phenology in seasonal environments we further discuss how short term behavior dvm influences and interacts in the longer term and shape up different life history components of copepod strategies 2 materials and methods although the model is not strictly individual based it is described following the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 to improve reproducibility 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to investigate the bottom up and top down influences of environmental variability i e irradiance temperature food availability and predation risk on vertical strategies of a high latitude herbivorous copepod and to understand the influences of vertical strategies on its fitness and phenology 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model consists of three entities vertical strategies model organism and the model environment vertical strategies define the timing amplitude and the ontogenetic trajectories of dvm and svm and are described using six evolvable soft parameters table 2 these are hardwired to the model organism i e copepods spawned in different times of the year the model organism is a hypothetical herbivorous semelparous female copepod hereafter the copepod with an annual life cycle that resembles calanus finmarchicus and c glacialis in terms of body size behavior and life history strategies conover 1988 these two species often dominate the copepod biomass in the north atlantic and most eurasian sub arctic and arctic seas and shelves falk petersen et al 2009 their life cycle consists of an embryonic stage egg six naupliar stages ni nvi five copepodite stages ci cv and an adult eggs that are released in near surface waters in the spring usually develop into civ or cv stages toward the end of the productive season as further development is typically constrained by the duration of the productive season and seasonal peaks of visual predation risk civs and cvs descend into deeper waters and remain in a state of diapause dormancy with minimal physiological activity hirche 1996 overwintering stages ascend to near surface waters as the primary production commences in the following year molt into adults and start to reproduce conover 1988 varpe 2012 the life cycle of the two species is usually completed within one year in most sub arctic and arctic locations falk petersen et al 2009 daase et al 2013 within which reside the model environments of this study the model runs in three 500 m deep artificial seasonal environments that represent three high latitude locations along the southern and southeastern coast of norway 60 70 n these environments do not point to specific geographic locations but the modelled environmental dynamics were

the time and space consist of 1 h and 1 m discreet intervals 2 3 process overview and scheduling at each timestep the model follows vertical strategies hardwired to copepods born in different times of the year and simulates their growth survival and reproduction state variables are updated simultaneously vertical strategies are evaluated using a fitness function based on the expected survival and reproductive performances the fitness is heuristically maximized using a genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 to estimate the optimal vertical strategy and optimal time of birth for a given set of environmental conditions fig 2 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 basic principles the high spatial and temporal resolution implemented in the model allow both dvm and svm to be simulated over the entire annual life cycle of the copepod carlotti and wolf 1998 have implemented a similar construct but the svm of their model was constrained by fixing the timing of ascent and descent to match the field observations of the region of interest in contrast the timing and the amplitude of dvm and svm of our model are flexible and allowed to evolve according to the environmental conditions to achieve this level of flexibility we used multiple evolvable proxies to represent vertical migration table 2 this resulted in a complex seven dimensional optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using heuristic techniques zanakis and evans 1981 as evolutionary algorithms provide an efficient means of solving multi dimensional optimization problems deb 2001 eiben and smith 2003 we used a ga as the optimization platform of this model further to increase the precision of the evolvable parameters and that of the behavioral strategies and life history traits ensued fig 2 we used a ga variant with floating point representation i e a real coded genetic algorithm davis 1989 lucasius and kateman 1989 herrera et al 1998 the strategy oriented construct of this model contrasts classic individual based models of zooplankton life history and behavior in two main ways first trading off of biological resolution strategies vs individuals to accommodate higher spatio temporal resolution and second the lack of population level responses such as density dependence as a result modelled vertical strategies do not interact with each other and show no quantitative feedbacks with the model environment e g impact of grazing on food concentration and duration of the productive season 2 4 2 emergence the behavioral strategies and life history traits emerging from the model are presented in fig 2 and described in table 3 2 4 3 adaptation and sensing copepods are sensitive to their internal states i e structural body mass mass of the energetic reserve and developmental stage and external stimuli i

objectives the model uses a fitness estimate that evaluates the expected reproduction and survival performances rendered by different vertical strategies section 2 6 4 2 4 5 prediction and stochasticity the vertical search pattern of copepod behavior is based on a semi stochastic predictive algorithm section 2 6 2 2 and appendix a2 in supplementary material stochasticity plays a central role in the model initialization section 2 5 and selection recombination and mutation operators of the ga section 2 6 4 2 4 6 observations for a given model environment the model produces heuristic estimates of the optimal vertical strategy and optimal time of birth along with a range of associated life history traits fig 2 table 3 2 5 initialization the model initializes with seeding of n 106 eggs at random times of the year to random depths 50 m of the water column each seed represents an embryonic stage of a copepod with a specific vertical strategy which is determined by randomly assigning values to the evolvable proxies the ranges bounds and resolutions of these proxies are listed in table 2 2 6 submodels 2 6 1 growth and development we modelled somatic growth in carbon units μg c according to the growth model of huntley and boyd 1984 eqs 1 8 below using a chlorophyll a c ratio of 0 030 båmstedt et al 1991 sakshaug et al 2009 this growth sub model was used due to its simplicity and general applicability which are shown by its utility to model several different copepod taxa with varying body sizes representing a wide range of geographical locations e g robinson 1994 fiksen and giske 1995 roman et al 2000 definitions and units of all the terms described henceforth are listed in table 4 for ambient food concentrations f μg c ml 1 above a specific saturation

critical molting mass wx μg c table 5 however for simplicity we did not model the dependence of molting process on the physiological state nival et al 1988 and the limitation of growth by the exoskeleton mauchline 1998 2 6 2 survival 2 6 2 1 predation risk visual v and non visual n predators induce mortality which is estimated as a probability following eiane and parisi 2001 as 9 i t z i t 0 exp ψ z where iz and i 0 are irradiance at depth z and surface at a given time and ψ 0 06 m 1 is the attenuation coefficient for downwards directed irradiance in the water column we remapped irradiance i between 0 1 0 9 i so that visual predation risk is not nullified even at the lowest levels of irradiance and the copepod has some chance of survival even at highest levels of irradiance the detection efficiency of visually orientating planktivores increases with the size of their prey brooks and dodson 1965 batty et al 1990 for simplicity we modelled the size dependent visual predation risk using a linear model assuming that the largest developmental stage is ca 10 times more vulnerable to visual predators compared to the smallest developmental stage fig 4 a table 5 de robertis 2002 this was implemented using the scalar k 1 k 0 as 10 m v i t z i t z k i t the initial value of k i e k value at the embryonic stage range 1 10 4 1 5 10 2 was decided so that it produces hourly estimates of visual predator induced mortality we assumed the mortality risk caused by non visual predators non visual predation risk mn to be 1 of the maximum visual predation risk and constant over time and depth eiane and parisi 2001 2 6 2 2 diel vertical migration the copepod may perform dvm to trade off growth potential to minimize the visual predation risk we used the photoreactive behavior as a proxy to estimate the timing and amplitude of dvm e g kerfoot 1970 carlotti and wolf 1998 here α an evolvable light sensitivity parameter table 2 was used to define an irradiance threshold above which induces a negative phototatic response in the vertical swimming behavior båtnes et al 2015 cohen et al 2015 at any given time the copepod occupies a depth with an irradiance level it z below α from a series of possible depth bins that satisfy the it z α condition we assumed that the copepod searches and occupies the depth that maximizes its growth potential for simplicity we further assumed that internal state dependent factors such as hunger and satiation have a negligible influence on the modelled dvm the vertical search pattern was predicted using a biased random walk algorithm codling 2003 appendix a2 in supplementary material assuming that the copepod is neutrally buoyant and vertically moves in the water column at a maximum velocity hereafter cruising velocity u we used several stage specific cruising velocity estimates of calanus spp available in the literature fig 4b and related those to body mass as 11 u i t 8 0116 w c i t 0 4531 we considered the size or stage specific variability of dvm as a response to size dependent visual predation risk zaret and kerfoot 1975 uye et al 1990 hays et al 1994 eiane and ohman 2004 and modelled it by scaling the light sensitivity parameter α with the body mass wc as data on the light sensitivity of younger developmental stages ni ciii of calanus spp is rare we could not derive a general relationship between wc and α to address this we defined an evolvable parameter β that describes the size specificity of α which at its maximum β 10 downscales α of the adult female to 10 of that of the egg ni fig 4c higher trajectories than β 10 were not used as it was shown in the trial runs that the model always converges on β 10 even at highest levels of visual predation risk 2 6 2 3 energy storage civ and cv stages can allocate a specific fraction from surplus growth evolvable growth allocation parameter γ table 2 to build up an energy reserve fig 3c that possesses a maximum size of 70 of the total body mass fig 4d fiksen and carlotti 1998 2 6 2 4 seasonal vertical migration similar to most high latitude marine zooplankton which descend to depths during the unproductive part of the year reviewed in conover 1988 hagen and auel 2001 falk petersen et al 2009 the copepod may perform svm we used the state of the energetic reserve as a proxy of timing of the svm cf visser and jónasdóttir 1999 here the copepod descends to a specific depth evolvable overwintering depth ζ table 2 when the stores account for a specific fraction of the total body mass evolvable seasonal descent parameter δ table 2 upon reaching the overwintering depth the copepod remains stagnant at a diapause state hirche 1996 with its metabolic rate reduced by 90 from that under normal conditions fig 3d table 5 pasternak et al 1994 varpe et al 2007 the overwintering period terminates when a specific fraction evolvable seasonal ascent parameter ε table 2 of the energetic reserve is exhausted after the overwintering period surplus gains are not allocated to develop further energetic reserves but may be used for structural growth and reproduction fig 3e and f table 5 2 6 2 5 metabolism the basal metabolic cost relates with the body mass and ambient temperature expressed as k wm in eq 3 terms as defined above and in table 4 the metabolic cost of zooplankton vertical movements can account for 0 300 of the basal metabolic demand vlymen 1970 foulds and roff 1976 morris et al 1985 dawidowicz and loose 1992 for simplicity we assumed the cost of vertical movement to be 150 of the basal metabolic cost midpoint of the above range this additional cost is subtracted from the growth eqs 1 or 3 the energy reserve is used to balance the metabolic demands that cannot be sustained under low ambient food concentrations fig 3c f 2 6 2 6 starvation risk when energy reserves are depleted the metabolic demands that cannot be balanced by food intake are met by catabolizing structural body mass fig 3b f this elevates the mortality risk due to starvation starvation risk ms which is defined as a probability that increases as a linear function of catabolized structural mass as 12 m s i t 2 w q i t here wq is the catabolized structural mass expressed as a proportion of the maximum structural mass prior to structural catabolization wq can reach a maximum of 0 5 during which ms peaks following eq 12 and the copepod dies according the chossat s rule chossat 1843 which posits that starving animals may catabolize about half of their body weight before death irrespective of the age of this generalized rule it has been used as a constraint in starvation studies of many vertebrate and invertebrate taxa e g threlkeld 1976 spencer 1997 costello 1998 loos et al 2010 2 6 3 reproduction we assumed that somatic growth ceases after the final molt and all adults become sexually mature at a constant structural body mass fig 3f table 5 energetic input to egg production may be sourced from food intake income breeding or allocating a specific amount of matter c equivalent to the maximum growth rate gt eqs 1 and 2 from the remaining energetic reserve capital breeding cf varpe et al 2009

optimization models e g kiørboe and hirst 2008 but may not bare the same interpretation given the strategy oriented construct of this model when the model predicts an optimal vertical strategy and time of birth for a particular environment we can assume that those predicted optima should persist from one generation to the next if the environment remains constant if a copepod s spawning period lasts from time tr to td time of death we assumed that it produces a series of offspring with the same vertical strategy but born at different times of the year ranging from tr to td however only the offspring with a time of birth matching that of the mother can represent the entire evolvable soft parameter set of the mother and guarantee its persistence from one generation to another fig 5 a c therefore we adjusted the fitness using a binary weight ω by setting ω 0 if the copepod s spawning season does not overlap its time of birth fig 5a and b and vice versa fig 5c we used a real coded genetic algorithm rcga to derive heuristic estimates of optimal vertical strategy and time of birth that maximizes fitness in a given model environment fig 5d in the rcga six proxies of vertical strategies and the time of birth of the copepod that those are hardwired to table 2 are considered as genes on a single chromosome the rcga begins by selecting a mating pool of n chromosomes parents i e n vertical strategies seeded in different times of the year from the initial seeds using a binary two way deterministic tournament selection goldberg and deb 1991 miller and goldberg 1995 genes of two randomly selected parents from the mating pool are recombined through blend crossover following the blx α method eshelman and schaffer 1993 which produces two offspring recombinants genes of the recombinants are mutated at a probability of 0 02 by random replacement uniform mutation eiben and smith 2003 haupt and haupt 2004 the population of strategies resulting from these operations comprises of n parents whose fitness is known and n offspring whose fitness is not yet known parents with unique gene combinations are selected to construct a library hereafter the reference library which is updated at each iteration each offspring is compared with those in the reference library to assess their fitness fitness of the offspring with similar gene combination to those in the library are assigned in situ while the rest goes through the life cycle simulation to determine fitness ls 2 in fig 5d once the fitness of all 2n individuals are known n survivors are selected following a round robin all play all tournament of size 10 harik et al 1997 eiben and smith 2003 this process is repeated for a minimum of 100 iterations and terminated when the mean fitness of the population shows no improvement for 25 consecutive iterations ϕ in fig 5d eiben and smith 2003 2 7 programming execution and analysis of the model we used r version 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and r studio integrated development environment ide version 1 0 136 rstudio team 2016 along with the high performance computing packages rcpp eddelbuettel et al 2011 and bigmemory kane et al 2013 to construct simulate and analyze the model a basic run was performed in the environment l using default values for model parameters table 4 in order to test the influence of model parameters and environmental variables on model predicted vertical strategies and fitness we performed a sensitivity analysis following jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 here we calculated a sensitivity score sx as 16 s x x b r x m x b r p b r p m p b r where x is the predicted model output of the basic run xbr and the modified run xm for a given change 25 of input parameter value between the basic run pbr and the modified run pm we tested the sensitivity of vertical strategies and fitness for 13 different input parameters appendix a3 in supplementary material for the convenience of interpretation of these results we presented the sensitivity scores under three categories no sensitivity sx 0 low sensitivity 0 sx 3 and high sensitivity sx 3 finally we studied the changes of heuristically optimized vertical strategies by performing model simulations in the three model environments at different levels of visual predation risk while maintaining the rest of the parameter values at its default levels as gas produce heuristic estimates of the maximum fitness there is no guarantee that it would converge on the global maximum given a potentially diverse fitness landscape record et al 2010 therefore we replicated each model run 10 times with different starting values assigned to the soft parameters table 2 to check if the algorithm converges on the same set of solutions as the optimized parameter values showed little variability between replicate runs 5 we used the mean of the replicates for each parameter for analyses 3 results 3 1 the basic run in the basic run the life cycle emerging from the model began as an egg spawned at 20 m depth in late april the first two nauplii stages did not perform dvm but dvm and the associated metabolic cost swimming cost increased ontogenetically from niii onwards fig 6 a b e and f the somatic growth of all developmental stages beyond nv occurred under food limitation fig 6c and because of reduced growth rates their predicted development times were higher than those estimated from bělehrádek temperature functions fig 6d as the energetic reserve reached 65 of the total body mass ws 196 μg c fig 6g the developmental stage cv descended to an overwintering depth of 150 m in mid june ca 2 months before the pelagic primary production had terminated fig 6e it remained there for ca 290 days and ascended into near surface waters again in early april of the following year ca 10 days after the pelagic primary production had commenced fig 1c with fully depleted energetic reserves although the energetic cost of seasonal migration was quite high the cost of ascent was ca ¼ of that of the descent due to the loss of body mass during overwintering fig 6f and g the copepod developed to an adult female in mid april and thenceforth produced eggs ca 3000 via income breeding until mid june and then died fig 6h 3 2 sensitivity analysis the model predicted fitness was highly sensitive to visual predation risk food concentration and temperature fig 7 a 25 change in the visual predation risk k 7 5 10 3 and 1 25 10 2 influenced the dvm which intensified at the higher end of k and vice versa table 6 although the overwintering depth deepened by ca 13 under higher visual predation risk it did not change under lower visual predation risk furthermore higher visual predation risk lowered the fecundity and longevity and vice versa table 6 a 25 change in food concentration f 10 and 6 mg m 3 chl a notably influenced the dvm timing of svm and time of birth but not the overwintering depth fig 7 under low food concentration the dvm was less pronounced and the seasonal descent was delayed ca 15 d compared to the basic run possibly because of foraging later into the feeding season due to lower growth potential sustained under increased food limitation table 6 however the copepod overwintered as a significantly large cv with elevated energetic reserves and made ca 7 d earlier spring ascent late march followed by spawning that preceded the pelagic bloom by ca 2 days cf fig 1c here ca 2 of the total egg production was sourced from capital breeding table 6 early seasonal ascent capital breeding and early spawning thus appear as strategies employed to avoid seasonal peak in visual predation risk cf fig 1a eqs 9 and 10 when foraging efforts are elevated to cope with lower growth potential however this came with a cost of decreased fecundity 80 and longevity 7 fig 7 table 6 increased food concentration had the opposing effects on the predicted behavioral strategies and life history traits described above fig 7 table 6 the influence of 4 5 c change in temperature t 22 5 and 13 5 c on copepod s behavior and life history followed the same general trends described for food concentration fig 7 table 6 and highlight the equally important roles played by food availability and temperature in growth and development 3 3 latitudinal environmental variability and visual predation risk model predicted optimal time of birth body mass wc and ws at seasonal descent overwintering depth and longevity changed with visual predation risk k but showed less variability along the modelled latitudinal environmental gradient fig 8 b d and g the predicted optimal time of birth changed from late april to mid may with increasing visual predation risk and was constant across the three model environments with the exception that it occurred the earliest in mid april at environment h under the lowest visual predation risk k 10 4 fig 8d at lower levels of visual predation risk the copepod overwintered as relatively large cvs with elevated energetic reserves at relatively shallow depths fig 8b and c however as the visual predation risk increased the copepod overwintered as smaller cvs or civs with relatively less energetic reserves at greater depths although the predicted longevity decreased by ca 80 d along the modelled visual predation risk gradient fig 8g longevity at environment h under k 10 4 was lower 365 d compared to those predicted under higher visual predation risk levels 384 430 d the predicted timing of svm showed significant variability across the three model environments but was less affected by visual predation risk fig 8a both the descent and ascent occurred earliest at the lowest latitude environment but happened later in the season at higher latitude environments with a shift of about a month although this reflects the delayed occurrence of the pelagic bloom along the modelled latitudinal gradient fig 1c f and i appendix a1 in supplementary material the seasonal ascent at environment h under lowest visual predation risk k 10 4 occurred ca 25 days before the pelagic primary production had commenced figs 1i and 8a the predicted onset of spawning fecundity and breeding mode index fig 8d f along with the predicted timing and amplitude of dvm food limitation index and development time fig 9 varied with both the visual predation risk and latitudinal environmental gradient in all model environments the spawning started earliest under the lowest visual predation risk k 10 4 fig 8d here spawning commenced ca 5 7 days earlier than the onset of spring primary production in lower latitude environments fig 1c and f and ca 2 5 5 of the total egg production were sourced from capital breeding fig 8f spawning at environment h commenced ca 25 d prior to the pelagic bloom but lasted only for ca 10 days figs 1i 8d and g consequently the expected fecundity was the lowest ca 145 eggs fig 8e and all eggs were sourced from capital breeding fig 8f the onset of spawning shifted later into the season at higher latitude model environments at higher levels of visual predation risk and occurred after the commencement of the pelagic primary production figs 1c f i and 8d here all eggs were produced via income breeding fig 8f at lower levels of visual predation risk 10 4 k 5 10 3 the predicted dvm pattern was similar across the three model environments where developmental stages until early copepodites did not perform dvm fig 9a and b although the model predicted the younger developmental stages niii onwards to perform dvm under elevated visual predation risk at environment l this effect gradually waned in higher latitude model environments the food limitation index strongly followed the dvm pattern where developmental stages that performed dvm suffered from increased food limitation fig 9c food limitation significantly reduced the growth rates cf eqs 1 3 see also appendix a4 in supplementary material and consequently the development times increased along the modelled environmental gradient fig 9d further in each model environment lowest development times were predicted under the lowest level of visual predation risk 4 discussion 4 1 influence of environmental variables on vertical strategies 4 1 1 diel vertical migration in this model visual predation risk had the highest influence on the dvm which diminished under low visual predation risk figs 7 and 9 table 6 and completely ceased when visual predation was removed from the model k 0 data not presented conversely under high visual predation risk also younger developmental stages reduced the time spent in food rich surface waters by performing low amplitude shallow dvm fig 9a and b food concentration and temperature also influenced the dvm fig 7 table 6 lower food concentrations or temperatures produced low amplitude dvm possibly due the low growth potential attained in cold food limited conditions fig 9 eqs 1 8 appendix a4 in supplementary material under these conditions it appears that modelled copepods do not possess sufficient growth potential to trade off for survival and perform high amplitude deep dvm a conclusion also drawn in empirical work e g huntley and brooks 1982 loose and dawidowicz 1994 reduced or absence of dvm under low food concentrations and temperatures are reported from several other modeling studies on copepods and euphausiids e g andersen and nival 1991 fiksen and giske 1995 fiksen and carlotti 1998 tarling et al 2000 and from empirical work on marine copepods and freshwater cladocerans e g hardy and gunther 1935 huntley and brooks 1982 johnsen and jakobsen 1987 however the largely exogenous regulated dvm behavior emerging from this model does not render a complete view on the subject matter as dvm can also be sensitive to internal physiological states of zooplankton e g hunger and satiation hays et al 2001 pearre 2003 the effect of temperature on growth potential further explains the diminished influence of visual predation risk on the timing and amplitude of dvm predicted at higher latitude model environments fig 9 albeit similar food concentrations the modelled temperatures decreased from lower to higher latitude model environments reflecting a decreasing gradient of growth potential fig 1 appendix a4 in supplementary material consequently the model predicted optimal dvm strategy for higher latitude environments was to elevate the growth potential by spending more time foraging in near surface waters fig 9a and b this effect was most pronounced among younger developmental stages niii ci whose dvm reduced from environment l to m and completely ceased at environment h dvm of younger developmental stages niii onwards are most commonly reported from lower latitudes for calanus spp e g huntley and brooks 1982 uye et al 1990 huang et al 1993 osgood and frost 1994 zakardjian et al 1999 and metridia spp e g hays 1995 while some field studies failed to detect notable dvm in high latitudes e g blachowiak samolyk et al 2006 basedow et al 2010 others reported ontogenetic increase of dvm ci onwards e g dale and kaartvedt 2000 daase et al 2008 in calanus spp however empirical data with high spatial temporal and biological i e developmental stage resolution is needed to test the ontogenetic and latitudinal patterns of dvm predicted by our model the predicted dvm amplitudes spanned across the productive part of the water column i e upper 30 m cf figs 1 6 and 9 and showed a positive relationship with the vertical extent of food availability fig 7 moreover strategies that involve higher amplitude dvm lead to increased food limitation where younger developmental stages with no energetic reserves tend to suffer from starvation risk due to low temperatures and food concentrations that prevail in deeper parts of the model environments fig 1 therefore low amplitude dvm appears to be a strategy that efficiently trades off growth potential for survival by balancing both the visual predation and starvation risks kerfoot 1970 fiksen and giske 1995 de robertis 2002 although higher amplitude dvm can be predicted either by not modeling starvation risk or imposing starvation tolerance e g andersen and nival 1991 carlotti and wolf 1998 zakardjian et al 1999 tarling et al 2000 we did not follow these approaches because our model sufficiently represents the relative importance of dvm across the modelled environmental gradients 4 1 2 seasonal vertical migration food availability and temperature had the most notable influence on the model predicted timing of svm fig 7 table 6 the predicted shift in timing of seasonal descent and ascent coincided with those of the pelagic algal bloom and thermal stratification along the modelled latitudinal gradient figs 1 and 8a this agrees with the argument that food availability is the ultimate factor influencing the timing of seasonal vertical migration of calanus spp herman 1983 head and harris 1985 hind et al 2000 however field estimates of timing of svm of calanus spp from low to high latitudes do not point to a simple south north gradient as predicted in our model table 7 see also melle et al 2014 this discrepancy of model predictions and field estimates underlies the differences between location specific variability in hydrography algal bloom dynamics and species composition e g hirche 1991 daase et al 2013 diversity of generation lengths and breeding strategies e g conover 1988 falk petersen et al 2009 and climate driven and other stochastic oscillations of environmental conditions e g reid et al 1998 eiane and parisi 2001 ji 2011 however direct comparisons between vertical migratory patterns predicted by a strategy oriented model and field estimates should be done with caution as an environment specific optimal vertical strategy predicted by the model contrasts the diversity of vertical behavior exhibited by individuals of a zooplankton population visual predation risk and depth of thermal stratification summer autumn were the only environmental variables that influenced the model predicted overwintering depth figs 7 and 8b table 6 the overwintering depth deepened at higher levels of visual predation risk and deeper thermal stratification depths and agrees with hirche 1991 kaartvedt 1996 dale et al 1999 bagøien et al 2000 and astthorsson and gislason 2003 that calanus spp prefer colder water masses with low predator abundance for overwintering however the overwintering depths predicted by or model underestimate those of field observations which can extend well below 1000 m e g østvedt 1955 apart from the shallow bottom depths modelled this discrepancy largely reflects how overwintering habitat selection of calanus spp is influenced by the buoyancy effect of stored lipid reserves visser and jónasdóttir 1999 convective mixing of surface waters irigoien 2004 and vertical distribution of water masses and predator populations such as mesopelagic fish predatory ctenophores and krill hirche 1991 kaartvedt 1996 bagøien et al 2000 bandara et al 2016 4 2 influence of vertical strategies on fitness and phenology 4 2 1 diel vertical migration in the model high amplitude dvm caused increased food limitation that led to slow growth and development and reduced fecundity figs 7 and 9 table 6 this ultimately resulted in lower fitness relative to that predicted for low amplitude dvm it is therefore apparent that decisions to fully or partly disregard dvm in models focusing svm and other seasonal strategies should be made with caution as our findings indicate that dvm can have a notable negative influence on growth and development of younger developmental stages especially at lower latitudes at higher levels of visual predation risk the model predicted up to a one month delay in the onset of spawning fig 8d and highlights the influence of predation risk on the reproductive phenology magnhagen 1991 stibor 1992 varpe et al 2007 these late spawned copepods appeared to possess higher fitness compared to those spawned earlier fig 8h this seems counterintuitive as zooplankton are more vulnerable to visual predation risk later in the season due to the higher irradiance levels that persist in late spring and summer in this model the early feeding season i e until the time of peak pelagic bloom is characterized by higher food concentrations and lower temperatures fig 1 although the food concentration decreases by ca 20 by late spring or early summer the ambient temperature increases by ca 2 4 times further even at the onset of the productive season the visual predation risk had reached ca 70 of its maximum in all model environments fig 1a d and g therefore it is likely that copepods born relatively later in the season use the higher temperatures to attain a higher growth eqs 1 8 appendix a4 in supplementary material which is then efficiently traded off for survival through dvm to counter the risk of increasing visual predation risk fig 9 conversely due to lower temperatures copepods born earlier in the season must elevate the time spent foraging in near surface waters to attain higher growth rates and become more vulnerable to visual predation risk however it should be noted that our model does not consider the ability of calanus spp to use the darker and seasonally ice covered period of the year to attain growth with minimal influence from visual predators by feeding on alternative food sources such as ice algae and microzooplankton conover and siferd 1993 søreide et al 2010 compared to the phenology of reproduction the elevated visual predation risk had little influence on the timing of seasonal migration fig 8a the svm strategy predicted by the model was to descend to overwintering depth approximately at the same period of the year mid late summer but with ca ⅓ lesser the body mass both structural and energetic reserve mass compared to that under the lowest visual predation risk fig 8a and c as higher visual predation risk tends to intensify dvm in this model fig 9a and b it appears that trading off growth potential for survival makes an earlier seasonal descent unfavorable as food limitation and slower growth rates fig 9c and d demands more time to acquire sufficient energy reserves to overwinter despite the smaller body mass of the overwintering stage further as the model predicted body mass of the overwintering stage reaches a lower threshold at k 10 4 fig 8c it is likely that modelled copepods overwintered with minimum reserves to last the overwintering duration and therefore makes an earlier descent with lesser energy reserves nearly impossible in the contrary occupying near surface waters later into the season and descend to overwintering depths with elevated energetic reserves is also unfavorable as the visual predation risk in this model is not nullified even at the deepest parts of the water column eq 10 the lesser influence of visual predation risk on the timing of svm does not align with kaartvedt 2000 and varpe and fiksen 2010 who view predation by planktivorous fish as a key driver of generation lengths and timing of seasonal descent in c finmarchicus in the norwegian sea however the consequences of dvm on the timing of seasonal descent presented here may diminish if there is an energetic benefit of dvm e g mclaren 1963 enright 1977 if copepods are capable of utilizing alternative food sources e g runge and ingram 1991 hirche and kwasniewski 1997 or if there is a strong size selection against larger developmental stages by visual predators than the linear relationship applied in our model cf fig 4a with brooks and dodson 1965 batty et al 1990 langbehn and varpe 2017 4 2 2 seasonal vertical migration svm was essential for the wintertime survival of the modelled copepods given its food source is only available during the primary production season spring autumn fig 1 different combinations of proxies table 2 yielded non seasonally migrating strategies in which the copepods developed to adults and reproduced within the same productive season although this strategy had the potential to produce more than one generation per year especially in the relatively lower latitude environment l fig 1a c we did not peruse this further as our focus was on an annual life cycle see the fitness weighing process eq 14 fig 5a c the body mass and the size of energetic reserve at seasonal descent together with the timing of seasonal ascent had a profound influence on the predicted timing of reproduction breeding strategy and fecundity fig 8 overwintering as large cvs with elevated energetic reserves at lower visual predation risk enabled the copepod to allocate the post overwintering surplus energetic reserves to capital breeding in the following year fig 8c and f and see also sainmont et al 2014a ejsmond et al 2015 halvorsen 2015 as capital breeding emerged in environments with lower temperatures and food concentrations fig 7 table 6 it appears as a strategy that allows the new generation to feed from the very start of the feeding season while avoiding the seasonal peak in visual predation risk later in the year fig 1 see also varpe et al 2009 the proportional increase of capital breeding eggs from relatively lower latitude environment l to higher latitude environment h reflects the decreasing temperature gradient that occur at overwintering depths of these environments figs 1 8b and f overwintering in colder water masses reduces the metabolic costs and conserves the energetic reserve which ultimately boosts the fecundity through capital breeding hirche 1991 hirche 1996 astthorsson and gislason 2003 the pure capital breeding strategy predicted at environment h under the lowest visual predation risk more resembles the spawning strategy of c hyperboreus than c finmarchicus and c glacialis conover 1988 falk petersen et al 2009 the sensitivity of the model predicted breeding strategy to visual predation risk indicates an extensive pre breeding cost of capital breeding imposed by the size dependent visual predation risk and acquisition and carriage of energy reserves jönsson 1997 varpe et al 2009 moreover excess energy storage i e more than to overwinter and capital breeding do not emerge as dominant strategies in this model as the environmental parameters are modelled in a perfectly predictable manner without any year to year variability however capital breeding and energy storage may possess a much larger adaptive significance in nature where spatio temporal environmental heterogeneity and unpredictability are more pronounced compared to our model e g jönsson 1997 fischer et al 2009 4 3 concluding remarks findings of this study highlight the influence of environmental variables on vertical strategies and suggest that in seasonal environments dvm and svm should be studied in concert as these behavioral strategies can have profound and largely different effects on fitness and phenology of herbivorous zooplankton therefore given the significance of biological information ensued sacrificing computer time to adopt higher spatio temporal resolution in behavioral and life history models seems to be an appealing practice however strong recommendations should only be made after testing our model predictions further

25367,accurately predicting the dynamics of tree species productivity as well as their ranges at large scales is of key importance for assessing the impact of global change on forests dynamic vegetation models dvms particularly forest gap models fgms have been suggested as suitable tools for such joint predictions however dvms generally feature a large number of parameters that need to be estimated and may cause considerable uncertainty in model outputs in addition model sensitivity may depend on environmental conditions stand composition and development stage we systematically evaluated the parameter sensitivity on simulated basal area of the state of the art fgm forclim along a wide ecological gradient to analyze model behavior and identify key parameters and processes that cause the highest variability in model output we applied the revised morris screening method at 30 representative sites across europe and compared results for monospecific and mixed stands at two system states in time i e early and late succession dynamic equilibrium the most influential parameters were related to tree establishment the water and light regimes growth and temperature whereby the relative parameter influence of the latter strongly varied with climate further model sensitivity differed between monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession reflecting the differential influence of ecological processes with stand structure we conclude that the parameter sensitivity of complex models should be analyzed individually for several system states of interest we recommend to focus the further development process representation and calibration and analysis of fgms on process representations related to establishment water limitations and phenology to improve the robustness of model predictions we provide recommendations for specific improvements of fgms to better represent range dynamics keywords europe forclim forest gap model morris screening method 1 introduction accurately predicting tree species productivity as well as tree species ranges and range shifts at large scales is of key importance for assessing the impact of global change on ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services they provide e g hanewinkel et al 2013 montoya and raffaelli 2010 climate change has been shown to affect the geographical range of tree species walter et al 2002 and productivity boisvenue and running 2006 since forests are long lived ecosystems it is of key interest to understand transient dynamics i e non equilibrium situations that result from changes in environmental drivers succession and large scale disturbances moreover while studying species range shifts impacts of interspecific competition should be considered instead of focusing on climatic changes only e g araujo and luoto 2007 brooker et al 2007 bullock et al 2000 meier et al 2012 nieto lugilde et al 2015 currently two broad approaches are used to model forest productivity and plant distributions namely correlative and process based approaches to model plant distributions correlative species distribution models sdm relate species presence absence data to environmental predictor variables elith and leathwick 2009 guisan and zimmermann 2000 and use these correlations to project species occurrence probabilities under changing conditions they however assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with the environment guisan and theurillat 2000 and thus are not able to describe transient dynamics moreover they do not estimate forest productivity directly but apply allometric regression equations e g jenkins et al 2003 pastor et al 1984 on the contrary dynamic vegetation models dvms explicitly simulate population processes such as establishment growth and mortality as well as intra and interspecific competition through time bugmann 2001 snell et al 2014 thus in addition to allowing for the direct estimation of species productivity these models enable the analysis of non equilibrium situations shugart 1998 thus dvms should be preferred for projecting future forest productivity and species distribution snell et al 2014 however few dvms have been used to this end with a species specific resolution but see gutierrez et al 2016 hickler et al 2012 morin et al 2008 forest gap models fgms are dvms that simulate the establishment growth and mortality of individual trees or cohorts on small patches representing the processes that lead to canopy gaps by the death of a dominant large tree as a function of biotic and abiotic factors bugmann 2001 several hundred fgms have been developed worldwide across all major forest biomes kimmins 2004 the state of the art fgm forclim bugmann 1996 was originally developed to simulate the dynamics of temperate mountain forests in central europe but was later successfully applied and tested against observations in other parts of europe e g mina et al 2017b rasche et al 2013 and elsewhere e g in north america bugmann and solomon 2000 gutierrez et al 2016 or china shao et al 2001 to further enhance model applications across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales as well as the robustness of model projections it is essential to improve the understanding of model behavior assess its consistency and identify key parameters and processes that have strong effects on model outputs this knowledge supports the identification of targeted model improvements process representations and calibration and data that might be most suitable to reduce the variance of the output of interest since dvms are most often complex and feature a large parameter space sensitivity analyses sa represent an important step in the iterative modeling cycle augusiak et al 2014 courbaud et al 2015 grimm and railsback 2005 saltelli et al 2000 sas allow for estimating the effects of variations in parameter values on model outputs and thus identify subsets of parameters that have strong effects on model outputs saltelli et al 2000 since the framework of dvms implies that the sensitivity of the implemented processes should reflect the sensitivity of the real processes pappas et al 2013 saltelli et al 2000 sas are able to highlight model limitations and directions of further improvements cariboni et al 2007 saltelli et al 2000 however few comprehensive sas of dvms and particularly fgms have been accomplished to date and none of these were conducted at larger spatial scales such as an entire continent c f bugmann 1996 courbaud et al 2015 leemans 1991 pappas et al 2013 tian et al 2014 wang et al 2013 wramneby et al 2008 zaehle et al 2005 moreover there is yet little consensus about the respective influence of the processes at different temporal and spatial scales or for different species assemblages e g monospecific vs mixed stands due to non equilibrium conditions it is however likely that relative process influence is not constant over time and varies with site conditions stand structure and species composition therefore the overall aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the parameter sensitivity of a state of the art fgm forclim at the scale of the entire european continent since most fgms are based on the same jabowa framework a study of the influence of the underlying processes and parameters is of broad interest for other models adhering to this framework as well our specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the model s sensitivity to the different parameters and processes over this large environmentally heterogeneous area specifically we considered a possible temporal changes in parameter sensitivity by separating the early successional from the late successional response b both monospecific and mixed species stands to investigate model behavior under intra specific and inter specific competition 2 to assess the ecological plausibility of the fgm s parameter sensitivity especially when applying forclim at the continental scale i e beyond the range it was developed for 3 to identify key processes and parameters that should be prioritized in subsequent model development process representation and calibration and analysis to further enhance the applicability of forclim and other fgms especially with regard to predicting species ranges and range shifts 2 material and methods 2 1 the forest gap model forclim forclim v3 3 351 mina et al 2017a is a modular fgm initially developed to predict tree species composition in the european alps bugmann 1994 bugmann 1996 the model is parameterized for 30 central european tree species and was found to be applicable across a wide range of environmental conditions in temperate forests of central europe and on other continents e g bugmann and solomon 2000 gutierrez et al 2016 shao et al 2001 each species is characterized by a set of species specific parameters in addition to general ecological and site related parameters table 1 the parameter space is thus of the order of 500 forclim is composed of four sub models in the weather and water sub models the bioclimatic indices for the plant sub model are derived from climatic and soil input data in the plant sub model establishment growth and mortality of trees are simulated at yearly time steps on independent patches the management sub model allows to simulate a wide range of planting cutting and thinning techniques rasche et al 2011 but it was not used in the present study disturbances extrinsic to the forest patch were not considered here either e g windthrow or fire all parameters relevant for this study are presented in table 1 2 1 1 weather and water sub models the weather sub model yields yearly minimum winter temperature and the annual and seasonal sums of degree days sampled from monthly long term means and standard deviations of temperature and log normally distributed precipitation data bugmann 1996 in the water sub model monthly drought indices are derived based on a modified version of the soil water balance model by thornthwaite and mather 1957 with one soil layer bugmann and cramer 1998 bugmann and solomon 2000 the monthly drought indices are aggregated to seasonal and annual drought indices for deciduous and evergreen species respectively which are used to simulate species specific drought responses three site specific parameters are used soil bucket size kbs representing the plant available water in the soil geographical latitude and a slope and aspect correction factor kslasp which accounts for effects of the terrain on potential evapotranspiration due to varying incident radiation bugmann and cramer 1998 bugmann 1996 2 1 2 plant sub model 2 1 2 1 natural regeneration establishment is possible only when a set of species specific environmental and biotic constraints is fulfilled these are formulated as boolean variables that either allow establishment or prevent it bugmann 1996 the following variables filters are considered soil moisture winter temperature the sum of growing degree days light availability and browsing pressure bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009a if establishment is allowed for a species trees establish as a cohort group of trees of one species with identical age of saplings with a dbh diameter at breast height of 1 27 cm because establishment also depends on factors not considered explicitly establishment probability is reduced by a parameter kestp that represents the average fraction of years in which establishment is possible when all species specific environmental and biotic conditions filters are fulfilled bugmann 1996 when establishment takes place the number of saplings in the cohort is calculated based on maximum sapling establishment rate kestdens the size of the patch and the species shade tolerance kla bugmann 1996 risch et al 2005 the latter serves as a proxy for species specific rates of seed production risch et al 2005 2 1 2 2 growth tree growth is simulated for each cohort using the carbon budget model by moore 1989 modified according to the following constraints soil moisture degree day sum nitrogen availability light availability and crown length bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009a moore 1989 besides these constraints species specific growth rate kg and maximum tree height khmax are used to calculate diameter increment bugmann 1996 species specific maximum tree height is reduced by two site specific factors i e unfavorable temperature and drought resulting in a site specific maximum height rasche et al 2012 2 1 2 3 mortality mortality is simulated for each tree individually and consists of a constant background mortality and a stress induced mortality background mortality is calculated using two parameters species maximum age kamax and a mortality probability coefficient kdeathp stress induced mortality depends on recent radial growth if diameter increment falls below a threshold minimum absolute or relative diameter growth increment respectively kminabsinc and kminrelinc for a certain time period number of years a tree can grow slowly without being subject to stress induced mortality ksgrt then annual mortality is augmented by the mortality rate of slow growing trees kslowgrp bugmann 1996 2 1 2 4 competition forclim explicitly simulates competition for light between cohorts but not competition for water light availability is calculated at the height of each cohort and at the forest floor as a function of leaf area index lai bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009b the impact of shading depends on cumulative lai and on the species specific shade tolerance of adult trees kla and saplings kly the lai of a cohort is derived from foliage traits see table 1 for parameter descriptions which are defined for species types crown length and dbh cumulative lai determines available light across the vertical height profile of the patch and thus influences both growth and establishment directly increasing lai of a cohort negatively affects growth of all smaller cohorts and thus may increase stress induced mortality bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009b 2 2 study sites in order to investigate the parameter sensitivity of forclim at the scale of the european continent 30 sites were selected table 2 thereby the choice of the number of sites was subject to a trade off between sufficient spatial and environmental coverage and computational limits since 58 356 model runs were required at each site see 2 3 2 we used conditioned latin hypercube sampling clhs minasny and mcbratney 2006 to select 30 representative sites from a 10 10 km european grid 11 w 32 e 34 s 72 n the following ancillary variables were applied latitude longitude annual mean temperature annual precipitation sum elevation aster global dem and the 13 environmental zones enz of the environmental stratification of europe metzger et al 2005 latitude and longitude were incorporated to ensure maximum spatial coverage of the selected sites while the other variables were included to account for climatic and topographical variation within europe for the climate data long term annual and monthly means were calculated for the period 1980 2009 from a gridded database climateeu v4 63 hamann et al 2013 the same climate data were used to run the model for the sa details on the site selection are given in appendix a1 2 3 sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 the revised morris screening method given the large parameter space of forclim we used the revised morris screening method campolongo et al 2007 cariboni et al 2007 morris 1991 that aims at identifying the most influential parameters at relatively low computational cost for models with many parameters and or long run time the method has been found to be quite reliable returning rankings similar to the method of sobol sobol 1993 confalonieri et al 2010 herman et al 2013 wainwright et al 2013 wu et al 2013 which often serves as benchmark for other sa methods cf saltelli and sobol 1995 the sampling strategy of the morris method is based on one at a time oat discrete jumps between p levels of parameter values forming trajectories selected to maximize the exploration of the parameter space for each trajectory and parameter elementary effects are calculated describing how much the output changes if the respective parameter is varied from one level to a neighboring one the absolute mean value μ of the elementary effects of a parameter is an estimator of its overall influence on the output while σ gives the respective standard deviation a high σ points towards interactions with other parameters and nonlinear effects campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 the number of simulations to run is given by s r n 1 where r is the number of trajectories and n the number of parameters 2 3 2 implementation we used the morris function implemented in the r package sensitivity pujol et al 2017 we performed separate sas for monospecific and mixed stands whereby species basal area ba was the output of interest to reduce the complexity of the sa we focused on seven tree species that feature diverse trait combinations and include the commercially most important species of europe norway spruce picea abies scots pine pinus sylvestris european beech fagus sylvatica sessile oak quercus petraea small leaved lime tilia cordata sweet chestnut castanea sativa and holm oak quercus ilex for the monospecific stands an individual sa was run for each of the seven species at each site for the mixed stands one sa was conducted for each of the 30 sites allowing all seven species to establish via natural regeneration simulations started from bare ground and ran for 1000 years representing dynamic equilibrium conditions all model parameters were included in the sas except for local climate geographical latitude patch size disturbance probability and initial diameter at breast height of tree saplings see table 1 for parameter descriptions this sums up to 17 parameters per species and 15 general and site specific parameters we varied each parameter within a range of plausible values representing its uncertainty range based on model specific literature referring to the original parameter estimation procedure or literature surveys table 1 since parameter ranges were very different we set the argument scale of the morris function to true to standardize all parameter ranges to 0 1 the number of levels p explored for each parameter depends on the parameter s variation range and thus on the desired size of the jumps p should be an even number to ensure a symmetric treatment of parameters morris 1991 by default p was set to 4 for parameters with a very wide parameter range p was increased to 6 to reduce the distance between the levels to herewith avoid overestimating their influence on model output due to very large jumps for some categorical parameters for which only integers are allowed as model input p was set to 2 table 1 the number of trajectories r should be as high as possible given the simulation costs because higher r values provide a better coverage of the parameter space and reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of the sensitivity indices ciric et al 2012 r was defined based on the results of a preliminary analysis where we compared the 95 confidence intervals of the μ values derived from bootstrap selection for a set of r values cf appendix a2 for the monospecific simulations r was set to 3 n n 17 15 32 parameters r 96 for the mixed species simulations r was set to 2 n n 7 17 15 134 r 268 thus we ran 22 176 s 96 32 1 7 and 36 180 s 268 134 1 simulations per site and a total of 665 280 and 1 085 400 simulations for the monospecific and mixed species case respectively to ensure that differences in the results between species or sites do not arise from differences in the sampling of the r trajectories further explanation is given in appendix a3 we defined one unique experimental design i e set of trajectories for the sas of monospecific and mixed stands respectively one unique design of 3168 simulations s 96 32 1 for the monospecific sas applied to each species and site one unique design of 36 180 simulations for the mixed species sas applied to every site since sa results can be biased by an unbalanced experimental design e g some parameter levels are more represented than others we selected the most balanced set of trajectories out of 100 possible sets for both cases selection process described in appendix a3 2 4 analysis of the results for the early successional response we analyzed the results of the sensitivity analysis 100 years after initialization from bare ground the late successional response referred to the year 1000 stand in dynamic equilibrium at each site all species that did not reach a mean ba across all simulations of at least 2 m2 ha were excluded from the analysis because the environmental conditions at the site were far beyond the species needs since μ and σ were highly correlated fig a4 a pattern that was found for other models as well e g campolongo and saltelli 1997 we focused the analysis on μ but checked for parameters expressing an unexpectedly high σ compared to μ as output of the morris function the μ values were expressed in units of species ba thus the higher species ba at a site the higher were the μ values of the most influential parameters hence when comparing or aggregating these values directly for different species and or sites we would underestimate the model s sensitivity to the most influential parameters for the species or sites with low basal area thus to allow for the comparison of relative parameter influence between sites and species μ values were scaled for each site and species to range between 0 and 1 with the highest μ value set to 1 hereafter we always refer to the scaled μ values parameters with mean μ values 0 25 were considered as influential for each species relative parameter influence was derived by calculating the arithmetic mean of the μ values of each parameter over all sites where the species was growing i e reached a ba 2 m2 ha for each species we analyzed differences between both monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession to aggregate the results of the seven species for each parameter we calculated the arithmetic mean of the μ values of each species to further condense the results of the four system states we created an overview figure fig 1 cf appendix a5 for the aggregation procedure showing the overall influence of each parameter on model output and whether the influence of a parameter was related to a system state analyzed e g whether a parameter was more influential for early than late succession further we assigned the parameters to the following thematic groups to facilitate the interpretation of the results water temperature nitrogen light establishment growth and mortality table 1 it should however be noted that most parameters of the first four groups are also directly or indirectly linked to establishment and growth for each species in mixtures the species parameters of the other six species were assigned to the additional group interaction and are referred to as heterospecific parameters hereafter 3 results 3 1 overall model sensitivity eight parameters were identified as being influential in all system states analyzed i e they showed a mean μ 0 25 fig 1a and b they were related to establishment kestdens kestp kbrpr cf table 1 water kdrtol kbs kslasp light ka2 and temperature kwitn in addition five parameters were identified as influential depending on the system state fig 1a and b they were related to establishment kbrow water kcw growth kg and mortality kamax ksgrt thus a small subset of parameters was identified to be most influential which was related to different species traits and ecological processes incorporated in the model of these parameters kcw and ksgrt featured an unexpectedly high mean σ compared to their mean μ in the case of kcw parameter influence was mainly dependent on the parameter kbs interaction while ksgrt as mortality related parameter showed interactions with most other influential parameters the most influential parameters had a rather strong impact on model output the most influential parameter per species had generally a huge impact on species ba varying it by one level impacted mean simulated ba by approximately 200 on average fig c1 and c2 even less influential parameters led to variations of more than 25 so they were still quite influential according to the 95 confidence intervals for μ unscaled the sa results were quite robust examples provided in appendix b furthermore the results are consistent between sites of the same environmental zone fig 2 the relative influence of the parameters however varied strongly between monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession fig 1c parameters related to establishment and the growth parameter kg were of particular influence during early succession in contrast parameters related to light ka2 kly and mortality kamax ksgrt kdeathp were more influential in late succession further the light related parameter ka2 was more influential in monospecific stands while the growth parameter kg was more influential in mixed stands moreover the water and mortality related parameters tended to be more influential in mixed stands in addition relative parameter influence varied with mean simulated ba fig c3 the influence of parameters related to establishment and water decreased with increasing ba whereas parameters related to light growth and mortality became more influential with ba thus the influence of most parameter groups was distinctly linked to a system state 3 2 sensitivity of monospecific stands 3 2 1 late successional response since the equilibrium state is the focus of most past fgms applications we present the results for this state first ba of the monospecific stands was mainly sensitive to parameters related to listed in decreasing order of influence light water establishment and temperature fig 1a among the light related parameters the allometric parameter for foliage weight ka2 was of outstanding influence for all species fig 1a see fig c4 for individual species results among the water related parameters all were influential except for the fraction of intercepted precipitation kicpt fig 1a the influence of the water related parameters on species ba was species and site dependent it decreased with species drought tolerance and with the annual precipitation of the site fig c5 within the establishment related parameters maximum sapling establishment rate kestdens was most influential for all species fig c4 also browsing pressure kbrpr and the rate of seedling establishment kestp were identified as influential fig 1a the influence of the four temperature related parameters varied strongly across species and sites fig 3 see fig c4 for individual species results all species were sensitive to the minimal annual degree day sum kddmin and to the development threshold temperature kdtt at the high latitude and altitude range of their simulated distribution fig 3 the two conifers were also sensitive to the maximum winter temperature tolerated kwitx fig c4a and b representing the chilling requirement for establishment which was influential at sites with gentle winter conditions in southern and western europe fig 3a in contrast to conifers fagus sylvatica quercus petraea and q ilex were sensitive to the minimum winter temperature tolerated kwitn fig c4c d g representing the cold temperature limit to seedling establishment this parameter was most influential at high elevation sites and in northeastern europe for the two former species fig 3b whereas it was influential everywhere except at the most southern sites for q ilex fig 3d 3 2 2 early successional response early successional ba was sensitive to the same parameters as late successional ba fig 1a in addition the species specific growth rate kg exceeded the sensitivity threshold and was thus judged as influential for all species figs 1a and c4 however the relative influence of the processes was different such that early successional ba was more sensitive to establishment kestdens kestp kbrpr and growth kg but less sensitive to light ka2 3 3 sensitivity of mixed stands 3 3 1 comparison to monospecific stands species ba of mixed stands was often sensitive to the same parameters as in monospecific stands whereby the variability of the global parameter influence was higher in mixed than in monospecific stands fig 1a and b for mixed stands the following additional parameters became influential fig 1b 1 the establishment related browsing sensitivity kbrow became influential in early succession 2 the two mortality related parameters kamax and ksgrt became influential in late succession 3 the light requirement of tree saplings kly became influential in late succession for some species but remained below the sensitivity threshold when aggregated over all species fig d1 further some parameters that were influential for monospecific stands changed their relative influence in mixture considerably fig 1c the growth parameter kg was distinctly more influential in mixed than in monospecific stands especially in early succession while the influence of the light parameter ka2 in late succession was lower in mixed than in monospecific stands moreover some water related parameters kdrtol kbs kslasp were more influential in mixed than in monospecific stands especially in late succession where the difference was significant for all three parameters and all species except for picea abies and fagus sylvatica 3 3 2 interspecific interactions when comparing monospecific and mixed stands the seven species could be grouped into two classes according to their reaction to interspecific competition 1 species sensitive to competition pinus sylvestris quercus petraea tilia cordata castanea sativa and 2 species not strongly affected by intraspecific competition picea abies fagus sylvatica quercus ilex first the number of sites where the species was present as well as its mean species ba were distinctly lower in mixed than in monospecific stands for the less competitive species of the first class table d1 this result was independent of the threshold used to exclude sites from the analysis the late successional species second class were less affected by the presence of other species second the heterospecific parameters of the interaction group i e the species parameters of the non focal species were of minor influence when averaged across sites yet detailed results showed that these parameters could be influential especially for the less competitive species in late succession table 3 moreover the relative influence of ecological processes varied strongly between mixed and monospecific stands for the less competitive species e g pinus sylvestris fig 2a and b while late successional species featured similar parameter sensitivities in both cases e g fagus sylvatica fig 2c and d in the late succession less competitive species were less sensitive to light but more sensitive to water and mortality in mixed fig 2b than monospecific fig 2a stands moreover the shade tolerance of saplings kly became influential in mixed stands for three of the four less competitive species fig d1d e f 4 discussion we evaluated the model sensitivity to parameters and processes as incorporated in the forclim model at the continental scale ranging from boreal to mediterranean conditions and thus considerably exceeding the model s original range of application a small set of parameters was identified to be most influential being related to different ecological processes and indicating that model behavior was not dominated by one single process or parameter as may be the case for other dvms e g photosynthesis in lpj guess pappas et al 2013 model sensitivity varies in successional time with climate and with ecological complexity i e between monospecific and mixed stands thus reflecting the joint impact of environmental conditions stand structure and composition on the relative influence of processes the high model sensitivity to a given parameter may be due to one or several of the following reasons the parameter is 1 a key factor for forest dynamics 2 a pivotal element in the model equations of a process e g used in the exponent of a power term or 3 related to considerable parameter uncertainty which is reflected in a wide parameter range below model sensitivity is discussed from an ecological section 4 1 and modeling section 4 2 point of view 4 1 ecological patterns emerging from the model 4 1 1 model sensitivity to different demographic processes simulated ba was highly sensitive to establishment related parameters in both monospecific and mixed stands especially in early succession this is consistent with ecological knowledge because on the one hand establishment represents a key bottleneck for species occurrence e g clark et al 1999 grubb 1977 i e determines whether a species is present at a site or not and thus strongly co determines species composition e g kobe et al 1995 price et al 2001 on the other hand the process of establishment determines the number of trees that were able to establish and thus strongly influences stand basal area yet due to its erratic occurrence in space and time establishment is quite difficult to model bugmann 2001 this is why the establishment related parameters feature wide uncertainty ranges table 1 which are at least partly responsible for the high sensitivity of model outputs in forclim as well as in other models e g samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 thus clearly calling for model improvements cf 4 2 1 simulated ba was sensitive to the species specific growth rate kg but only marginally to khmax and kredmax the latter parameters have an indirect influence on diameter increment as they affect the partitioning of volume increment into diameter and height growth but the direct effect of kg is more influential in contrast to establishment and growth simulated ba showed surprisingly moderate sensitivity to mortality related parameters even in the long term this result contradicts those of previous studies indicating that long term simulated forest dynamics are highly sensitive to the assumptions on tree mortality bircher et al 2015 hülsmann et al 2017 in contrast to our study bircher et al 2015 initialized forclim with single tree inventory data ba 40 m2 ha of the late successional species picea abies in the european alps under high ba conditions it is to be expected that the model is sensitive to the formulation of mortality this is in line with our results showing that simulated ba was the more and more sensitive to parameters related to mortality especially kamax and kdeathp with increasing mean simulated value while establishment related parameters became less influential 4 1 2 water versus temperature limitations water limitations were found to be more influential than temperature limitations but the latter contained high inter site and inter species variability temperature related limitations are indeed highly influential primarily at range limits where they are associated with a range of processes such as growing season length frost drought or phenology chuine 2010 morin et al 2007 sykes et al 1996 the sensitivity of forclim to temperature related parameters was strongly site and species dependent and the model distinguished and reproduced different temperature related processes at range limits e g the lack of the fulfillment of chilling requirements in the south for conifers yet a more detailed representation of temperature related processes is expected to improve the model s reliability especially when aiming towards robust projections of species range shifts under climate change see 4 2 3 in contrast to temperature limitations forclim was highly sensitive to water related parameters across most of the european continent although their influence decreased with increasing precipitation sum and species drought tolerance thus model behavior appears to consistently represent that 1 species vary in their ability to cope with water limitations e g churakova sidorova et al 2016 ogaya and penuelas 2007 and that 2 water supply is a major limiting factor throughout the full climatic range of a species littell et al 2008 martin benito and pederson 2015 although its impact culminates as the dry distribution limit is approached adams and kolb 2005 bigler et al 2006 yet the high sensitivity to water related parameters may point at possible structural and parameterization problems concerning the representation of water limitations in forclim see 4 2 2 further the high model sensitivity to water related parameters is at least partly due to the wide parameter ranges table 1 of the water related parameters 4 1 3 competition for light in line with our results and the known impact of the light climate in real forests bazzaz 1979 canham et al 1994 valladares and niinemets 2008 other dvms have been found to be sensitive to light related processes e g leemans 1991 pappas et al 2013 shading determines the growth performance of subdominant and suppressed trees as well as the abundance and species composition of the regeneration kobe et al 1995 among the light related parameters in forclim one parameter was highly influential i e the allometric parameter ka2 which determines foliage weight as a function of tree size dbh in contrast to all other light related parameters ka2 is the exponent in the power term used to calculate foliage weight bugmann 1994 therefore ka2 mainly controls the light regime in the model and is thus a key candidate for calibration see 4 2 4 it is important to note that all species were sensitive to ka2 irrespective of their shade tolerance indeed although shade tolerant species such as fagus sylvatica are able to persist under low light conditions they also require a minimum amount of light to reach the upper canopy in the long term wagner et al 2010 which depends on ka2 in the model thus model behavior outlines the model s sensitivity to leaf related parameters but this finding is not restricted to this particular model 4 1 4 interspecific interaction effects when comparing the results of monospecific vs mixed stands interspecific interaction effects were found to be influential especially for late succession less competitive species pinus sylvestris quercus petraea tilia cordata castanea sativa were strongly affected by the presence of other species across all sites leading either to their absence or a strong reduction of ba in addition less competitive species showed higher sensitivity to heterospecific parameters than late successional species picea abies fagus sylvatica quercus ilex this asymmetry in the strength of interspecific competition is typical of forest communities e g canham et al 2004 getzin et al 2006 rohner et al 2012 the growth parameter kg was distinctly more influential in mixtures than in monospecific stands especially in early succession this can be explained by the facts that 1 species in forclim compete for light and hence kg is decisive in the race for resources and 2 growth rate kg controls both diameter and height growth and thus determines whether a species is able to grow faster than its competitors and is thereby able to shade them instead of being shaded hence our analysis confirms that light competition is a key driver of succession kimmins 2004 water related parameters were distinctly more influential in mixtures than in monospecific stands for the less competitive species since these species are more drought tolerant than their main competitors picea abies fagus sylvatica their competitive ability increases in drier conditions thus they experience a competition release when the dominant mesic species reach their physiological limits this phenomenon has been described across a range of ecosystems and is considered of increasing importance for future vegetation shifts e g aguade et al 2015 rigling et al 2013 moreover mortality related parameters and the shade tolerance of saplings kly became influential in mixed stands for less competitive species this is because these species grow very slowly due to substantial shading by the taller dominant species provided that they are able to establish in mixtures at all however slow growth increases stress induced mortality in the model the simulation results thus outline that the ability to cope with unfavorable light conditions is one of the most influential processes in forest dynamics e g coomes et al 2005 4 2 recommendations for model development and further analysis based on the sa we were able to determine the key processes and key parameters for simulating forest dynamics with forclim even though high sensitivity per se does not imply that process representations are inappropriate it points towards areas of the model where new data or improved processes would be particularly important to increase the model s reliability these parameters and processes should be considered in future model development including both sub model output verification calibration and if necessary changes in process representations below we outline potential directions of subsequent model development and analysis and identify data that may help to reduce predictive model uncertainties 4 2 1 establishment we assigned four parameters to the establishment group table 1 which feature wide parameter ranges in fact however several others are directly or indirectly involved in this ecological process as well table 1 thus model sensitivity with regard to establishment was quite large and further analysis of the establishment process and model improvements process development and or calibration are needed indeed forclim and many other fgms simulate establishment in a highly aggregated manner i e without a mechanistic representation of neither the germination nor the growth and mortality of seedlings and small saplings bugmann 2001 price et al 2001 priority issues and recommendations for improving the representation of establishment processes are not new cf cailleret et al 2014 price et al 2001 wehrli et al 2007 here we emphasize two core issues derived from our results that should be prioritized in the context of future model improvement first maximum sapling establishment rate kestdens was one of the key parameters thus seedling density in the case of forclim the density of trees with a dbh of 1 27 cm strongly determines model output further research should focus on a better assessment of seedling density especially when aiming at improving predictions of forest productivity under consideration of natural regeneration to do so more data are needed on seedling density which are often ignored or underreported in forest inventories second since establishment success largely determines a species local colonization or extinction probability further research is needed at range margins where shifts in species composition are most pronounced e g aguade et al 2015 rigling et al 2013 in this context temperature limitations for seedling establishment deserve special attention possibly using a more sophisticated and more accurate model of phenology chuine and beaubien 2001 instead of simple temperature related establishment filters 4 2 2 water limitations water limitations represent an urgent research need in view of climate change allen et al 2015 cook et al 2014 ipcc 2001 especially in mediterranean but also in boreal forests barber et al 2000 wu et al 2012 from a modeling point of view drought is a complex phenomenon affecting and interacting with many physiological processes in both the short and long run this makes drought difficult to model and drought related parameters challenging to parameterize forclim applies a simple water sub model operating on a monthly time step with a one layer soil bucket bugmann 1996 the following issues give rise to model improvements 1 the calculation of potential evapotranspiration 2 the representation of soil properties and the modeling of soil moisture 3 the calculation of the drought index and 4 the re assessment of drought tolerance as discussed below first in forclim potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the temperature based model by thornthwaite and mather 1957 which has been shown to agree well with radiation based and combination models in temperate regions at medium latitudes fisher et al 2011 however when applied outside of this area water limitations may be over or underestimated considerably fisher et al 2011 second model results were highly sensitive to soil bucket size kbs whose uncertainty range was considerable thus our results underline the importance of large scale availability of reliable site specific soil data e g de cáceres et al 2015 manusch et al 2014 further competition for soil moisture in combination with a more detailed representation of water availability in the soil e g by including more than one layer manusch et al 2014 thrippleton et al 2017 is likely to enhance model projections moreover modeling the process of snow accumulation and melting as done e g by schwörer et al 2016 is expected to enhance model applicability at high latitudes as well as at high elevations rutter et al 2009 third in forclim every month within the growing season influences the annual drought index to the same extent bugmann and cramer 1998 while cambial activity is not uniform over time e g camarero et al 2010 gutierrez et al 2011 primicia et al 2013 considering the seasonal variability in growth responses to drought based on ring width data may be an option to better predict long term species productivity cf mina et al 2016 further variations of water availability within months are not considered because forclim uses monthly input data bugmann 1996 thus the current structure of the model is hardly able to account for short term extreme events which may become increasingly critical in a changing climate allen et al 2015 finally a european wide calibration of the species specific drought tolerance kdrtol is expected to increase model robustness thereby intra specific variability in model parameters should be considered which may arise from local adaption to drought and phenotypic plasticity e g benito garzón et al 2011 and has been shown to be considerable mina et al 2016 such a calibration could make use of a wealth of empirical data based on wood anatomical and dendroecological methods herrero et al 2013 king et al 2013 martin et al 2010 modrzynski and eriksson 2002 sanchez salguero et al 2015 as well as pollen and macrofossil data from sediment records schwörer et al 2016 4 2 3 temperature related process in forclim higher temperatures act to increase tree growth as long as it is not limited by drought or restricted by the fixed maximum length of the growing season for deciduous trees i e april october bugmann 1996 however the model may overestimate the positive effect on growth because it does not consider phenological mechanisms such as late or early frost events körner et al 2016 muffler et al 2016 vanoni et al 2016 photoperiodic controls jolly et al 2005 dormancy breaks chuine et al 2016 differing dormancy phases across ecosystems such as summer dormancy due to drought or the time of snow melt kirdyanov et al 2003 littell et al 2008 model approaches including phenology in dvms have been shown to improve the prediction of species range shifts under climate change morin et al 2008 thus a more detailed representation of temperature related processes would be highly beneficial when aiming towards robust projections of range shifts at the very least for european wide model applications the current temperature related parameters may need to be calibrated based on species specific distributions maps 4 2 4 further key parameters for calibration apart from the drought tolerance and temperature related parameters the light related parameter ka2 is a key candidate for calibration since ka2 is not estimated for each species individually but rather for species groups the accuracy of model projections is likely to increase with a more refined if possible even species specific parameter estimation to calibrate ka2 by species data on foliage weight and dbh would be needed e g burger 1952 and or ka2 could be calibrated inversely using bayesian methods van oijen et al 2005 another candidate for calibration is the growth parameter kg which is difficult to estimate because it relates to growth under optimal conditions which are hardly found in reality besides applying inverse modeling techniques tree ring data cf fyllas et al 2017 could be used to reduce the uncertainty in the parameter estimates by providing at least a lower limit for the value of kg specifically with regard to early successional species further key parameters for calibration are sapling shade tolerance kly as well as mortality related parameters improved parameter estimates for early successional species are of high relevance to provide robust model projections in the context of the conversion of monospecific to mixed forests which is receiving increasing attention in forestry cools et al 2011 4 3 conclusions we analyzed the global parameter sensitivity of forclim at 30 representative sites across europe for both monospecific and mixed stands at two representative system states in time the set of influential parameters was related to different processes indicating that model behavior was not dominated by one single process or parameter and thus pointing at a balanced process influence in the model structure the relative influence of the parameters varied between monospecific and mixed stands at identical sites and it also differed between sites as well as between early and late succession thus the sensitivity of complex models should be analyzed for all system states of interest since inference gained from one state or site may be misleading when extrapolated to another state or site to further enhance model applications across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and reduce the uncertainty in model outputs it is moreover essential to focus model development process representation and calibration and analysis on the most influential processes and parameters of all system states of interest we recommend to focus the further development and analysis of fgms on process representations related to establishment water limitations and phenology so as to further enhance their applicability across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and improve the robustness of model projections especially with regard to predicting species ranges and range shifts under climate change overall this comprehensive

25367,accurately predicting the dynamics of tree species productivity as well as their ranges at large scales is of key importance for assessing the impact of global change on forests dynamic vegetation models dvms particularly forest gap models fgms have been suggested as suitable tools for such joint predictions however dvms generally feature a large number of parameters that need to be estimated and may cause considerable uncertainty in model outputs in addition model sensitivity may depend on environmental conditions stand composition and development stage we systematically evaluated the parameter sensitivity on simulated basal area of the state of the art fgm forclim along a wide ecological gradient to analyze model behavior and identify key parameters and processes that cause the highest variability in model output we applied the revised morris screening method at 30 representative sites across europe and compared results for monospecific and mixed stands at two system states in time i e early and late succession dynamic equilibrium the most influential parameters were related to tree establishment the water and light regimes growth and temperature whereby the relative parameter influence of the latter strongly varied with climate further model sensitivity differed between monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession reflecting the differential influence of ecological processes with stand structure we conclude that the parameter sensitivity of complex models should be analyzed individually for several system states of interest we recommend to focus the further development process representation and calibration and analysis of fgms on process representations related to establishment water limitations and phenology to improve the robustness of model predictions we provide recommendations for specific improvements of fgms to better represent range dynamics keywords europe forclim forest gap model morris

result from changes in environmental drivers succession and large scale disturbances moreover while studying species range shifts impacts of interspecific competition should be considered instead of focusing on climatic changes only e g araujo and luoto 2007 brooker et al 2007 bullock et al 2000 meier et al 2012 nieto lugilde et al 2015 currently two broad approaches are used to model forest productivity and plant distributions namely correlative and process based approaches to model plant distributions correlative species distribution models sdm relate species presence absence data to environmental predictor variables elith and leathwick 2009 guisan and zimmermann 2000 and use these correlations to project species occurrence probabilities under changing conditions they however assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with the environment guisan and theurillat 2000 and thus are not able to describe transient dynamics moreover they do not estimate forest productivity directly but apply allometric regression equations e g jenkins et al 2003 pastor et al 1984 on the contrary dynamic vegetation models dvms explicitly simulate population processes such as establishment growth and mortality as well as intra and interspecific competition through time bugmann 2001 snell et al 2014 thus in addition to allowing for the direct estimation of species productivity these models enable the analysis of non equilibrium situations shugart 1998 thus dvms should be preferred for projecting future forest productivity and species distribution snell et al 2014 however few dvms have been used to this end with a species specific resolution but see gutierrez et al 2016 hickler et al 2012 morin et al 2008 forest gap models fgms are dvms that simulate the establishment growth and mortality of individual trees or cohorts on small patches representing the processes that lead to canopy gaps by the death of a dominant large tree as a function of biotic and abiotic factors bugmann 2001 several hundred fgms have been developed worldwide across all major forest biomes kimmins 2004 the state of the art fgm forclim bugmann 1996 was originally developed to simulate the dynamics of temperate mountain forests in central europe but was later successfully applied and tested against observations in other parts of europe e g mina et al 2017b rasche et al 2013 and elsewhere e g in north america bugmann and solomon 2000 gutierrez et al 2016 or china shao et al 2001 to further enhance model applications across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales as well as the robustness of model projections it is essential to improve the understanding of model behavior assess its consistency and identify key parameters and processes that have strong effects on model outputs this knowledge supports the identification of targeted model improvements process representations and calibration and data that might be most suitable to reduce the variance of the output of interest since dvms are most often complex and feature a large parameter space sensitivity analyses sa represent an important step in the iterative modeling cycle augusiak et al 2014 courbaud et al 2015 grimm and railsback 2005 saltelli et al 2000 sas allow for estimating the effects of variations in parameter values on model outputs and thus identify subsets of parameters that have strong effects on model outputs saltelli et al 2000 since the framework of dvms implies that the sensitivity of the implemented processes should reflect the sensitivity of the real processes pappas et al 2013 saltelli et al 2000 sas are able to highlight model limitations and directions of further improvements cariboni et al 2007 saltelli et al 2000 however few comprehensive sas of dvms and particularly fgms have been accomplished to date and none of these were conducted at larger spatial scales such as an entire continent c f bugmann 1996 courbaud et al 2015 leemans 1991 pappas et al 2013 tian et al 2014 wang et al 2013 wramneby et al 2008 zaehle et al 2005 moreover there is yet little consensus about the respective influence of the processes at different temporal and spatial scales or for different species assemblages e g monospecific vs mixed stands due to non equilibrium conditions it is however likely that relative process influence is not constant over time and varies with site conditions stand structure and species composition therefore the overall aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the parameter sensitivity of a state of the art fgm forclim at the scale of the entire european continent since most fgms are based on the same jabowa framework a study of the influence of the underlying processes and parameters is of broad interest for other models adhering to this framework as well our specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the model s sensitivity to the different parameters and processes over this large environmentally heterogeneous area specifically we considered a possible temporal changes in parameter sensitivity by separating the early successional from the late successional response b both monospecific and mixed species stands to investigate model behavior under intra specific and inter specific competition 2 to assess the ecological plausibility of the fgm s parameter sensitivity especially when applying forclim at the continental scale i e beyond the range it was developed for 3 to identify key processes and parameters that should be prioritized in subsequent model development process representation and calibration and analysis to further enhance the applicability of forclim and other fgms especially with regard to predicting species ranges and range shifts 2 material and methods 2 1 the forest gap model forclim forclim v3 3 351 mina et al 2017a is a modular fgm initially developed to predict tree species composition in the european alps bugmann 1994 bugmann 1996 the model is parameterized for 30 central european tree species and was found to be applicable across a wide range of environmental conditions in temperate forests of central europe and on other continents e g bugmann and solomon 2000 gutierrez et al 2016 shao et al 2001 each species is characterized by a set of species specific parameters in addition to general ecological and site related parameters table 1 the parameter space is thus of the order of 500 forclim is composed of four sub models in the weather and water sub models the bioclimatic indices for the plant sub model are derived from climatic and soil input data in the plant sub model establishment growth and mortality of trees are simulated at yearly time steps on independent patches the management sub model allows to simulate a wide range of planting cutting and thinning techniques rasche et al 2011 but it was not used in the present study disturbances extrinsic to the forest patch were not considered here either e g windthrow or fire all parameters relevant for this study are presented in table 1 2 1 1 weather and water sub models the weather sub model yields yearly minimum winter temperature and the annual and seasonal sums of degree days sampled from monthly long term means and standard deviations of temperature and log normally distributed precipitation data bugmann 1996 in the water sub model monthly drought indices are derived based on a modified version of the soil water balance model by thornthwaite and mather 1957 with one soil layer bugmann and cramer 1998 bugmann and solomon 2000 the monthly drought indices are aggregated to seasonal and annual drought indices for deciduous and evergreen species respectively which are used to simulate species specific drought responses three site specific parameters are used soil bucket size kbs representing the plant available water in the soil geographical latitude and a slope and aspect correction factor kslasp which accounts for effects of the terrain on potential evapotranspiration due to varying incident radiation bugmann and cramer 1998 bugmann 1996 2 1 2 plant sub model 2 1 2 1 natural regeneration establishment is possible only when a set of species specific environmental and biotic constraints is fulfilled these are formulated as boolean variables that either allow establishment or prevent it bugmann 1996 the following variables filters are considered soil moisture winter temperature the sum of growing degree days light availability and browsing pressure bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009a if establishment is allowed for a species trees establish as a cohort group of trees of one species with identical age of saplings with a dbh diameter at breast height of 1 27 cm because establishment also depends on factors not considered explicitly establishment probability is reduced by a parameter kestp that represents the average fraction of years in which establishment is possible when all species specific environmental and biotic conditions filters are fulfilled bugmann 1996 when establishment takes place the number of saplings in the cohort is calculated based on maximum sapling establishment rate kestdens the size of the patch and the species shade tolerance kla bugmann 1996 risch et al 2005 the latter serves as a proxy for species specific rates of seed production risch et al 2005 2 1 2 2 growth tree growth is simulated for each cohort using the carbon budget model by moore 1989 modified according to the following constraints soil moisture degree day sum nitrogen availability light availability and crown length bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009a moore 1989 besides these constraints species specific growth rate kg and maximum tree height khmax are used to calculate diameter increment bugmann 1996 species specific maximum tree height is reduced by two site specific factors i e unfavorable temperature and drought resulting in a site specific maximum height rasche et al 2012 2 1 2 3 mortality mortality is simulated for each tree individually and consists of a constant background mortality and a stress induced mortality background mortality is calculated using two parameters species maximum age kamax and a mortality probability coefficient kdeathp stress induced mortality depends on recent radial growth if diameter increment falls below a threshold minimum absolute or relative diameter growth increment respectively kminabsinc and kminrelinc for a certain time period number of years a tree can grow slowly without being subject to stress induced mortality ksgrt then annual mortality is augmented by the mortality rate of slow growing trees kslowgrp bugmann 1996 2 1 2 4 competition forclim explicitly simulates competition for light between cohorts but not competition for water light availability is calculated at the height of each cohort and at the forest floor as a function of leaf area index lai bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009b the impact of shading depends on cumulative lai and on the species specific shade tolerance of adult trees kla and saplings kly the lai of a cohort is derived from foliage traits see table 1 for parameter descriptions which are defined for species types crown length and dbh cumulative lai determines available light across the vertical height profile of the patch and thus influences both growth and establishment directly increasing lai of a cohort negatively affects growth of all smaller cohorts and thus may increase stress induced mortality bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009b 2 2 study sites in order to investigate the parameter sensitivity of forclim at the scale of the european continent 30 sites were selected table 2 thereby the choice of the number of sites was subject to a trade off between sufficient spatial and environmental coverage and computational limits since 58 356 model runs were required at each site see 2 3 2 we used conditioned latin hypercube sampling clhs minasny and mcbratney 2006 to select 30 representative sites from a 10 10 km european grid 11 w 32 e 34 s 72 n the following ancillary variables were applied latitude longitude annual mean temperature annual precipitation sum elevation aster global dem and the 13 environmental zones enz of the environmental stratification of europe metzger et al 2005 latitude and longitude were incorporated to ensure maximum spatial coverage of the selected sites while the other variables were included to account for climatic and topographical variation within europe for the climate data long term annual and monthly means were calculated for the period 1980 2009 from a gridded database climateeu v4 63 hamann et al 2013 the same climate data were used to run the model for the sa details on the site selection are given in appendix a1 2 3 sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 the revised morris screening method given the large parameter space of forclim we used the revised morris screening method campolongo et al 2007 cariboni et al 2007 morris 1991 that aims at identifying the most influential parameters at relatively low computational cost for models with many parameters and or long run time the method has been found to be quite reliable returning rankings similar to the method of sobol sobol 1993 confalonieri et al 2010 herman et al 2013 wainwright et al 2013 wu et al 2013 which often serves as benchmark for other sa methods cf saltelli and sobol 1995 the sampling strategy of the morris method is based on one at a time oat discrete jumps between p levels of parameter values forming trajectories selected to maximize the exploration of the parameter space for each trajectory and parameter elementary effects are calculated describing how much the output changes if the respective parameter is varied from one level to a neighboring one the absolute mean value μ of the elementary effects of a parameter is an estimator of its overall influence on the output while σ gives the respective standard deviation a high σ points towards interactions with other parameters and nonlinear effects campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 the number of simulations to run is given by s r n 1 where r is the number of trajectories and n the number of parameters 2 3 2 implementation we used the morris function implemented in the r package sensitivity pujol et al 2017 we performed separate sas for monospecific and mixed stands whereby species basal area ba was the output of interest to reduce the complexity of the sa we focused on seven tree species that feature diverse trait combinations and include the commercially most important species of europe norway spruce picea abies scots pine pinus sylvestris european beech fagus sylvatica sessile oak quercus petraea small leaved lime tilia cordata sweet chestnut castanea sativa and holm oak quercus ilex for the monospecific stands an individual sa was run for each of the seven species at each site for the mixed stands one sa was conducted for each of the 30 sites allowing all seven species to establish via natural regeneration simulations started from bare ground and ran for 1000 years representing dynamic equilibrium conditions all model parameters were included in the sas except for local climate geographical latitude patch size disturbance probability and initial diameter at breast height of tree saplings see table 1 for parameter descriptions this sums up to 17 parameters per species and 15 general and site specific parameters we varied each parameter within a range of plausible values representing its uncertainty range based on model specific literature referring to the original parameter estimation procedure or literature surveys table 1 since parameter ranges were very different we set the argument scale of the morris function to true to standardize all parameter ranges to 0 1 the number of levels p explored for each parameter depends on the parameter s variation range and thus on the desired size of the jumps p should be an even number to ensure a symmetric treatment of parameters morris 1991 by default p was set to 4 for parameters with a very wide parameter range p was increased to 6 to reduce the distance between the levels to herewith avoid overestimating their influence on model output due to very large jumps for some categorical parameters for which only integers are allowed as model input p was set to 2 table 1 the number of trajectories r should be as high as possible given the simulation costs because higher r values provide a better coverage of the parameter space and reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of the sensitivity indices ciric et al 2012 r was defined based on the results of a preliminary analysis where we compared the 95 confidence intervals of the μ values derived from bootstrap selection for a set of r values cf appendix a2 for the monospecific simulations r was set to 3 n n 17 15 32 parameters r 96 for the mixed species simulations r was set to 2 n n 7 17 15 134 r 268 thus we ran 22 176 s 96 32 1 7 and 36 180 s 268 134 1 simulations per site and a total of 665 280 and 1 085 400 simulations for the monospecific and mixed species case respectively to ensure that differences in the results between species or sites do not arise from differences in the sampling of the r trajectories further explanation is given in appendix a3 we defined one unique experimental design i e set of trajectories for the sas of monospecific and mixed stands respectively one unique design of 3168 simulations s 96 32 1 for the monospecific sas applied to each species and site one unique design of 36 180 simulations for the mixed species sas applied to every site since sa results can be biased by an unbalanced experimental design e g some parameter levels are more represented than others we selected the most balanced set of trajectories out of 100 possible sets for both cases selection process described in appendix a3 2 4 analysis of the results for the early successional response we analyzed the results of the sensitivity analysis 100 years after initialization from bare ground the late successional response referred to the year 1000 stand in dynamic equilibrium at each site all species that did not reach a mean ba across all simulations of at least 2 m2 ha were excluded from the analysis because the environmental conditions at the site were far beyond the species needs since μ and σ were highly correlated fig a4 a pattern that was found for other models as well e g campolongo and saltelli 1997 we focused the analysis on μ but checked for parameters expressing an unexpectedly high σ compared to μ as output of the morris function the μ values were expressed in units of species ba thus the higher species ba at a site the higher were the μ values of the most influential parameters hence when comparing or aggregating these values directly for different species and or sites we would underestimate the model s sensitivity to the most influential parameters for the species or sites with low basal area thus to allow for the comparison of relative parameter influence between sites and species μ values were scaled for each site and species to range between 0 and 1 with the highest μ value set to 1 hereafter we always refer to the scaled μ values parameters with mean μ values 0 25 were considered as influential for each species relative parameter influence was derived by calculating the arithmetic mean of the μ values of each parameter over all sites where the species was growing i e reached a ba 2 m2 ha for each species we analyzed differences between both monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession to aggregate the results of the seven species for each parameter we calculated the arithmetic mean of the μ values of each species to further condense the results of the four system states we created an overview figure fig 1 cf appendix a5 for the aggregation procedure showing the overall influence of each parameter on model output and whether the influence of a parameter was related to a system state analyzed e g whether a parameter was more influential for early than late succession further we assigned the parameters to the following thematic groups to facilitate the interpretation of the results water temperature nitrogen light establishment growth and mortality table 1 it should however be noted that most parameters of the first four groups are also directly or indirectly linked to establishment and growth for each species in mixtures the species parameters of the other six species were assigned to the additional group interaction and are referred to as heterospecific parameters hereafter 3 results 3 1 overall model sensitivity eight parameters were identified as being influential in all system states analyzed i e they showed a mean μ 0 25 fig 1a and b they were related to establishment kestdens kestp kbrpr cf table 1 water kdrtol kbs kslasp light ka2 and temperature kwitn in addition five parameters were identified as influential depending on the system state fig 1a and b they were related to establishment kbrow water kcw growth kg and mortality kamax ksgrt thus a small subset of parameters was identified to be most influential which was related to different species traits and ecological processes incorporated in the model of these parameters kcw and ksgrt featured an unexpectedly high mean σ compared to their mean μ in the case of kcw parameter influence was mainly dependent on the parameter kbs interaction while ksgrt as mortality related parameter showed interactions with most other influential parameters the most influential parameters had a rather strong impact on model output the most influential parameter per species had generally a huge impact on species ba varying it by one level impacted mean simulated ba by approximately 200 on average fig c1 and c2 even less influential parameters led to variations of more than 25 so they were still quite influential according to the 95 confidence intervals for μ unscaled the sa results were quite robust examples provided in appendix b furthermore the results are consistent between sites of the same environmental zone fig 2 the relative influence of the parameters however varied strongly between monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession fig 1c parameters related to establishment and the growth parameter kg were of particular influence during early succession in contrast parameters related to light ka2 kly and mortality kamax ksgrt kdeathp were more influential in late succession further the light related parameter ka2 was more influential in monospecific stands while the growth parameter kg was more influential in mixed stands moreover the water and mortality related parameters tended to be more influential in mixed stands in addition relative parameter influence varied with mean simulated ba fig c3 the influence of parameters related to establishment and water decreased with increasing ba whereas parameters related to light growth and mortality became more influential with ba thus the influence of most parameter groups was distinctly linked to a system state 3 2 sensitivity of monospecific stands 3 2 1 late successional response since the equilibrium state is the focus of most past fgms applications we present the results for this state first ba of the monospecific stands was mainly sensitive to parameters related to listed in decreasing order of influence light water establishment and temperature fig 1a among the light related parameters the allometric parameter for foliage weight ka2 was of outstanding influence for all species fig 1a see fig c4 for individual species results among the water related parameters all were influential except for the fraction of intercepted precipitation kicpt fig 1a the influence of the water related parameters on species ba was species and site dependent it decreased with species drought tolerance and with the annual precipitation of the site fig c5 within the establishment related parameters maximum sapling establishment rate kestdens was most influential for all species fig c4 also browsing pressure kbrpr and the rate of seedling establishment kestp were identified as influential fig 1a the influence of the four temperature related parameters varied strongly across species and sites fig 3 see fig c4 for individual species results all species were sensitive to the minimal annual degree day sum kddmin and to the development threshold temperature kdtt at the high latitude and altitude range of their simulated distribution fig 3 the two conifers were also sensitive to the maximum winter temperature tolerated kwitx fig c4a and b representing the chilling requirement for establishment which was influential at sites with gentle winter conditions in southern and western europe fig 3a in contrast to conifers fagus sylvatica quercus petraea and q ilex were sensitive to the minimum winter temperature tolerated kwitn fig c4c d g representing the cold temperature limit to seedling establishment this parameter was most influential at high elevation sites and in northeastern europe for the two former species fig 3b whereas it was influential everywhere except at the most southern sites for q ilex fig 3d 3 2 2 early successional response early successional ba was sensitive to the same parameters as late successional ba fig 1a in addition the species specific growth rate kg exceeded the sensitivity threshold and was thus judged as influential for all species figs 1a and c4 however the relative influence of the processes was different such that early successional ba was more sensitive to establishment kestdens kestp kbrpr and growth kg but less sensitive to light ka2 3 3 sensitivity of mixed stands 3 3 1 comparison to monospecific stands species ba of mixed stands was often sensitive to the same parameters as in monospecific stands whereby the variability of the global parameter influence was higher in mixed than in monospecific stands fig 1a and b for mixed stands the following additional parameters became influential fig 1b 1 the establishment related browsing sensitivity kbrow became influential in early succession 2 the two mortality related parameters kamax and ksgrt became influential in late succession 3 the light requirement of tree saplings kly became influential in late succession for some species but remained below the sensitivity threshold when aggregated over all species fig d1 further some parameters that were influential for monospecific stands changed their relative influence in mixture considerably fig 1c the growth parameter kg was distinctly more influential in mixed than in monospecific stands especially in early succession while the influence of the light parameter ka2 in late succession was lower in mixed than in monospecific stands moreover some water related parameters kdrtol kbs kslasp were more influential in mixed than in monospecific stands especially in late succession where the difference was significant for all three parameters and all species except for picea abies and fagus sylvatica 3 3 2 interspecific interactions when comparing monospecific and mixed stands the seven species could be grouped into two classes according to their reaction to interspecific competition 1 species sensitive to competition pinus sylvestris quercus petraea tilia cordata castanea sativa and 2 species not strongly affected by intraspecific competition picea abies fagus sylvatica quercus ilex first the number of sites where the species was present as well as its mean species ba were distinctly lower in mixed than in monospecific stands for the less competitive species of the first class table d1 this result was independent of the threshold used to exclude sites from the analysis the late successional species second class were less affected by the presence of other species second the heterospecific parameters of the interaction group i e the species parameters of the non focal species were of minor influence when averaged across sites yet detailed results showed that these parameters could be influential especially for the less competitive species in late succession table 3 moreover the relative influence of ecological processes varied strongly between mixed and monospecific stands for the less competitive species e g pinus sylvestris fig 2a and b while late successional species featured similar parameter sensitivities in both cases e g fagus sylvatica fig 2c and d in the late succession less competitive species were less sensitive to light but more sensitive to water and mortality in mixed fig 2b than monospecific fig 2a stands moreover the shade tolerance of saplings kly became influential in mixed stands for three of the four less competitive species fig d1d e f 4 discussion we evaluated the model sensitivity to parameters and processes as incorporated in the forclim model at the continental scale ranging from boreal to mediterranean conditions and thus considerably exceeding the model s original range of application a small set of parameters was identified to be most influential being related to different ecological processes and indicating that model behavior was not dominated by one single process or parameter as may be the case for other dvms e g photosynthesis in lpj guess pappas et al 2013 model sensitivity varies in successional time with climate and with ecological complexity i e between monospecific and mixed stands thus reflecting the joint impact of environmental conditions stand structure and composition on the relative influence of processes the high model sensitivity to a given parameter may be due to one or several of the following reasons the parameter is 1 a key factor for forest dynamics 2 a pivotal element in the model equations of a process e g used in the exponent of a power term or 3 related to considerable parameter uncertainty which is reflected in a wide parameter range below model sensitivity is discussed from an ecological section 4 1 and modeling section 4 2 point of view 4 1 ecological patterns emerging from the model 4 1 1 model sensitivity to different demographic processes simulated ba was highly sensitive to establishment related parameters in both monospecific and mixed stands especially in early succession this is consistent with ecological knowledge because on the one hand establishment represents a key bottleneck for species occurrence e g clark et al 1999 grubb 1977 i e determines whether a species is present at a site or not and thus strongly co determines species composition e g kobe et al 1995 price et al 2001 on the other hand the process of establishment determines the number of trees that were able to establish and thus strongly influences stand basal area yet due to its erratic occurrence in space and time establishment is quite difficult to model bugmann 2001 this is why the establishment related parameters feature wide uncertainty ranges table 1 which are at least partly responsible for the high sensitivity of model outputs in forclim as well as in other models e g samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 thus clearly calling for model improvements cf 4 2 1 simulated ba was sensitive to the species specific growth rate kg but only marginally to khmax and kredmax the latter parameters have an indirect influence on diameter increment as they affect the partitioning of volume increment into diameter and height growth but the direct effect of kg is more influential in contrast to establishment and growth simulated ba showed surprisingly moderate sensitivity to mortality related parameters even in the long term this result contradicts those of previous studies indicating that long term simulated forest dynamics are highly sensitive to the assumptions on tree mortality bircher et al 2015 hülsmann et al 2017 in contrast to our study bircher et al 2015 initialized forclim with single tree inventory data ba 40 m2 ha of the late successional species picea abies in the european alps under high ba conditions it is to be expected that the model is sensitive to the formulation of mortality this is in line with our results showing that simulated ba was the more and more sensitive to parameters related to mortality especially kamax and kdeathp with increasing mean simulated value while establishment related parameters became less influential 4 1 2 water versus temperature limitations water limitations were found to be more influential than temperature limitations but the latter contained high inter site and inter species variability temperature related limitations are indeed highly influential primarily at range limits where they are associated with a range of processes such as growing season length frost drought or phenology chuine 2010 morin et al 2007 sykes et al 1996 the sensitivity of forclim to temperature related parameters was strongly site and species dependent and the model distinguished and reproduced different temperature related processes at range limits e g the lack of the fulfillment of chilling requirements in the south for conifers yet a more detailed representation of temperature related processes is expected to improve the model s reliability especially when aiming towards robust projections of species range shifts under climate change see 4 2 3 in contrast to temperature limitations forclim was highly sensitive to water related parameters across most of the european continent although their influence decreased with increasing precipitation sum and species drought tolerance thus model behavior appears to consistently represent that 1 species vary in their ability to cope with water limitations e g churakova sidorova et al 2016 ogaya and penuelas 2007 and that 2 water supply is a major limiting factor throughout the full climatic range of a species littell et al 2008 martin benito and pederson 2015 although its impact culminates as the dry distribution limit is approached adams and kolb 2005 bigler et al 2006 yet the high sensitivity to water related parameters may point at possible structural and parameterization problems concerning the representation of water limitations in forclim see 4 2 2 further the high model sensitivity to water related parameters is at least partly due to the wide parameter ranges table 1 of the water related parameters 4 1 3 competition for light in line with our results and the known impact of the light climate in real forests bazzaz 1979 canham et al 1994 valladares and niinemets 2008 other dvms have been found to be sensitive to light related processes e g leemans 1991 pappas et al 2013 shading determines the growth performance of subdominant and suppressed trees as well as the abundance and species composition of the regeneration kobe et al 1995 among the light related parameters in forclim one parameter was highly influential i e the allometric parameter ka2 which determines foliage weight as a function of tree size dbh in contrast to all other light related parameters ka2 is the exponent in the power term used to calculate foliage weight bugmann 1994 therefore ka2 mainly controls the light regime in the model and is thus a key candidate for calibration see 4 2 4 it is important to note that all species were sensitive to ka2 irrespective of their shade tolerance indeed although shade tolerant species such as fagus sylvatica are able to persist under low light conditions they also require a minimum amount of light to reach the upper canopy in the long term wagner et al 2010 which depends on ka2 in the model thus model behavior outlines the model s sensitivity to leaf related parameters but this finding is not restricted to this particular model 4 1 4 interspecific interaction effects when comparing the results of monospecific vs mixed stands interspecific interaction effects were found to be influential especially for late succession less competitive species pinus sylvestris quercus petraea tilia cordata castanea sativa were strongly affected by the presence of other species across all sites leading either to their absence or a strong reduction of ba in addition less competitive species showed higher sensitivity to heterospecific parameters than late successional species picea abies fagus sylvatica quercus ilex this asymmetry in the strength of interspecific competition is typical of forest communities e g canham et al 2004 getzin et al 2006 rohner et al 2012 the growth parameter kg was distinctly more influential in mixtures than in monospecific stands especially in early succession this can be explained by the facts that 1 species in forclim compete for light and hence kg is decisive in the race for resources and 2 growth rate kg controls both diameter and height growth and thus determines whether a species is able to grow faster than its competitors and is thereby able to shade them instead of being shaded hence our analysis confirms that light competition is a key driver of succession kimmins 2004 water related parameters were distinctly more influential in mixtures than in monospecific stands for the less competitive species since these species are more drought tolerant than their main competitors picea abies fagus sylvatica their competitive ability increases in drier conditions thus they experience a competition release when the dominant mesic species reach their physiological limits this phenomenon has been described across a range of ecosystems and is considered of increasing importance for future vegetation shifts e g aguade et al 2015 rigling et al 2013 moreover mortality related parameters and the shade tolerance of saplings kly became influential in mixed stands for less competitive species this is because these species grow very slowly due to substantial shading by the taller dominant species provided that they are able to establish in mixtures at all however slow growth increases stress induced mortality in the model the simulation results thus outline that the ability to cope with unfavorable light conditions is one of the most influential processes in forest dynamics e g coomes et al 2005 4 2 recommendations for model development and further analysis based on the sa we were able to determine the key processes and key parameters for simulating forest dynamics with forclim even though high sensitivity per se does not imply that process representations are inappropriate it points towards areas of the model where new data or improved processes would be particularly important to increase the model s reliability these parameters and processes should be considered in future model development including both sub model output verification calibration and if necessary changes in process representations below we outline potential directions of subsequent model development and analysis and identify data that may help to reduce predictive model uncertainties 4 2 1 establishment we assigned four parameters to the establishment group table 1 which feature wide parameter ranges in fact however several others are directly or indirectly involved in this ecological process as well table 1 thus model sensitivity with regard to establishment was quite large and further analysis of the establishment process and model improvements process development and or calibration are needed indeed forclim and many other fgms simulate establishment in a highly aggregated manner i e without a mechanistic representation of neither the germination nor the growth and mortality of seedlings and small saplings bugmann 2001 price et al 2001 priority issues and recommendations for improving the representation of establishment processes are not new cf cailleret et al 2014 price et al 2001 wehrli et al 2007 here we emphasize two core issues derived from our results that should be prioritized in the context of future model improvement first maximum sapling establishment rate kestdens was one of the key parameters thus seedling density in the case of forclim the density of trees with a dbh of 1 27 cm strongly determines model output further research should focus on a better assessment of seedling density especially when aiming at improving predictions of forest productivity under consideration of natural regeneration to do so more data are needed on seedling density which are often ignored or underreported in forest inventories second since establishment success largely determines a species local colonization or extinction probability further research is needed at range margins where shifts in species composition are most pronounced e g aguade et al 2015 rigling et al 2013 in this context temperature limitations for seedling establishment deserve special attention possibly using a more sophisticated and more accurate model of phenology chuine and beaubien 2001 instead of simple temperature related establishment filters 4 2 2 water limitations water limitations represent an urgent research need in view of climate change allen et al 2015 cook et al 2014 ipcc 2001 especially in mediterranean but also in boreal forests barber et al 2000 wu et al 2012 from a modeling point of view drought is a complex phenomenon affecting and interacting with many physiological processes in both the short and long run this makes drought difficult to model and drought related parameters challenging to parameterize forclim applies a simple water sub model operating on a monthly time step with a one layer soil bucket bugmann 1996 the following issues give rise to model improvements 1 the calculation of potential evapotranspiration 2 the representation of soil properties and the modeling of soil moisture 3 the calculation of the drought index and 4 the re assessment of drought tolerance as discussed below first in forclim potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the temperature based model by thornthwaite and mather 1957 which has been shown to agree well with radiation based and combination models in temperate regions at medium latitudes fisher et al 2011 however when applied outside of this area water limitations may be over or underestimated considerably fisher et al 2011 second model results were highly sensitive to soil bucket size kbs whose uncertainty range was considerable thus our results underline the importance of large scale availability of reliable site specific soil data e g de cáceres et al 2015 manusch et al 2014 further competition for soil moisture in combination with a more detailed representation of water availability in the soil e g by including more than one layer manusch et al 2014 thrippleton et al 2017 is likely to enhance model projections moreover modeling the process of snow accumulation and melting as done e g by schwörer et al 2016 is expected to enhance model applicability at high latitudes as well as at high elevations rutter et al 2009 third in forclim every month within the growing season influences the annual drought index to the same extent bugmann and cramer 1998 while cambial activity is not uniform over time e g camarero et al 2010 gutierrez et al 2011 primicia et al 2013 considering the seasonal variability in growth responses to drought based on ring width data may be an option to better predict long term species productivity cf mina et al 2016 further variations of water availability within months are not considered because forclim uses monthly input data bugmann 1996 thus the current structure of the model is hardly able to account for short term extreme events which may become increasingly critical in a changing climate allen et al 2015 finally a european wide calibration of the species specific drought tolerance kdrtol is expected to increase model robustness thereby intra specific variability in model parameters should be considered which may arise from local adaption to drought and phenotypic plasticity e g benito garzón et al 2011 and has been shown to be considerable mina et al 2016 such a calibration could make use of a wealth of empirical data based on wood anatomical and dendroecological methods herrero et al 2013 king et al 2013 martin et al 2010 modrzynski and eriksson 2002 sanchez salguero et al 2015 as well as pollen and macrofossil data from sediment records schwörer et al 2016 4 2 3 temperature related process in forclim higher temperatures act to increase tree growth as long as it is not limited by drought or restricted by the fixed maximum length of the growing season for deciduous trees i e april october bugmann 1996 however the model may overestimate the positive effect on growth because it does not consider phenological mechanisms such as late or early frost events körner et al 2016 muffler et al 2016 vanoni et al 2016 photoperiodic controls jolly et al 2005 dormancy breaks chuine et al 2016 differing dormancy phases across ecosystems such as summer dormancy due to drought or the time of snow melt kirdyanov et al 2003 littell et al 2008 model approaches including phenology in dvms have been shown to improve the prediction of species range shifts under climate change morin et al 2008 thus a more detailed representation of temperature related processes would be highly beneficial when aiming towards robust projections of range shifts at the very least for european wide model applications the current temperature related parameters may need to be calibrated based on species specific distributions maps 4 2 4 further key parameters for calibration apart from the drought tolerance and temperature related parameters the light related parameter ka2 is a key candidate for calibration since ka2 is not estimated for each species individually but rather for species groups the accuracy of model projections is likely to increase with a more refined if possible even species specific parameter estimation to calibrate ka2 by species data on foliage weight and dbh would be needed e g burger 1952 and or ka2 could be calibrated inversely using bayesian methods van oijen et al 2005 another candidate for calibration is the growth parameter kg which is difficult to estimate because it relates to growth under optimal conditions which are hardly found in reality besides applying inverse modeling techniques tree ring data cf fyllas et al 2017 could be used to reduce the uncertainty in the parameter estimates by providing at least a lower limit for the value of kg specifically with regard to early successional species further key parameters for calibration are sapling shade tolerance kly as well as mortality related parameters improved parameter estimates for early successional species are of high relevance to provide robust model projections in the context of the conversion of monospecific to mixed forests which is receiving increasing attention in forestry cools et al 2011 4 3 conclusions we analyzed the global parameter sensitivity of forclim at 30 representative sites across europe for both monospecific and mixed stands at two representative system states in time the set of influential parameters was related to different processes indicating that model behavior was not dominated by one single process or parameter and thus pointing at a balanced process influence in the model structure the relative influence of the parameters varied between monospecific and mixed stands at identical sites and it also differed between sites as well as between early and late succession thus the sensitivity of complex models should be analyzed for all system states of interest since inference gained from one state or site may be misleading when extrapolated to another state or site to further enhance model applications across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and reduce the uncertainty in model outputs it is moreover essential to focus model development process representation and calibration and analysis on the most influential processes and parameters of all system states of interest we recommend to focus the further development and analysis of fgms on process representations related to establishment water limitations and phenology so as to further enhance their applicability across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and improve the robustness of model projections especially with regard to predicting species ranges and range shifts under climate change overall this comprehensive

25368,determination of the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton is critical to the lake eutrophication management the average value of total nitrogen total phosphorus tn tp ratio is widely used to determine the limiting nutrient while it suffers from the risk of the incorrect description of data and neglecting dynamics of the nutrient limitation a probabilistic method was thereby proposed in this study to explore dynamics of nutrient limitation including a indicator definition as the probability of tn tp ratio failing in redfield ratio line pfr indicating the possibility of tn limitation to improve a probabilistic measure for the nutrient limitation b bayesian anova analysis for posterior distributions of different treatments and c dynamics determination as pfrs to show dynamics of nutrient limitation lake xingyun in southwestern china was taken as a case to explore the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation according to modeling results we deducted that a for the interannual dynamics the limiting nutrient shifted from tp to tn and b for the seasonal dynamics tn and tp were co limiting deductions were further confirmed by the observed data with the proposed probabilistic method the co limitation of tn and tp was identified for the seasonal dynamics while using the average ratio solely denied the possibility of co limitation the current study also revealed that due to neglecting the interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation the average ratio might mislead the eutrophication management strategy by recommending reducing tn and tp concentration together the proposed probabilistic method demonstrated that tn was the limiting nutrient during the growing season of the phytoplankton in recent years and actions should focus on the tn concentration reduction keywords probabilistic method bayesian anova limiting nutrient interannual and seasonal dynamics tn tp ratio 1 introduction eutrophication has become the primary problem for freshwater and marine ecosystems smith et al 2006 leading to the deterioration of water quality damages of ecosystem structure and function and huge economic losses dodds et al 2009 mcdowell and hamilton 2013 paerl and otten 2013 excessive phosphorus and nitrogen are main drivers of eutrophication conley et al 2009 to maximize the efficiency of restoration measurements it is critical to distinguish the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton dodds 2007 in spite of increasing doubts in recent years the total nitrogen total phosphorus tn tp ratio has been widely used to determine the limiting nutrient of waterbody bergstrom 2010 persic et al 2009 symons et al 2012 xu et al 2010 with respect to the redfield ratio 16 1 by molar redfield 1934 1958 generally if the ratio is above the redfield ratio the waterbody is tp limited and if the ratio is smaller than the redfield ratio tn is the limiting nutrient when there are more than one group of data averaging tn tp ratios seems like a natural way to determine the limiting nutrient li et al 2013 pelechata et al 2016 however the average ratio loses information of the observed data and may lead to an incorrect description of the data de fouquet 2012 for example if there are four groups of data whose average ratio is above the redfield ratio it can jump into the conclusion of tp limitation unfortunately under that condition it is possible that three of them are smaller than the redfield ratio while the rest one is very large and the lake is actually tn limited for most of the chances moreover the average ratio may also neglect dynamics of nutrient limitation when data is aggregated from different sources e g different years months or sites because the tn tp ratio varies temporally and spatially cha et al 2016 frigstad et al 2011 sterner et al 2008 the temporal trend of the ratio is impacted by atmospheric deposition miyazako et al 2015 runoff diversion and internal loading release cruz et al 2015 the relative more internal release of tp than tn always lead to significantly seasonal variations davies et al 2010 dolman et al 2016 since the growth rate of phytoplankton varies with seasons mainly caused by the water temperature paerl et al 2016 exploring the limiting nutrient in the growing season is critically important for the eutrophication control the ratio is always larger in upstream than downstream green and fritsen 2006 and varies spatially both in lakes and oceans caccia and boyer 2005 smith and bennett 1999 while aggregated environmental data for status and trend assessments has been increasingly used maas hebner et al 2015 new methods which overcome these two shortcomings of using the average ratio solely are required to determine the limiting nutrient while using the average solely could be misleading the distribution would give a full view of the tn tp ratio that is the determination of nutrient limitation should be distribution based we defined an indicator the probability of tn tp ratio failing in redfield ratio line pfr to extract useful information from the distribution of the tn tp ratio to identify the limiting nutrient it is the probability when the ratio is smaller than the redfield ratio indicating the possibility of tn limitation thus it improves a probabilistic measure for the nutrient limitation the larger pfr indicates that tn is more likely to be the limiting nutrient exploring dynamics of the nutrient limitation is critical to making the proper strategy for the watershed load reduction alam et al 2016 niemisto et al 2008 the bayesian analysis of variance bayesian anova method is an effective tool to estimate treatment effects using a hierarchical regression gelman 2005 qian and shen 2007 and thus is suitable to explore dynamics of the tn tp ratio compared with the conventional anova approach bayesian anova is more flexible in model formulation easier to set up and easier to present graphically qian et al 2009 more importantly based on the bayesian theorem it gives the distribution of the tn tp ratio for every treatment conveniently ellison 2004 qian 2015 which is exactly the basis for calculating the pfr therefore integrating the pfr and the bayesian anova method we propose a probabilistic method to explore dynamics of the nutrient limitation by which the distributions of tn tp ratio for different treatments can be obtained via the bayesian anova model and then corresponding pfrs can be calculated to explore dynamics of the nutrient limitation dynamics of the nutrient limitation in hyper eutrophic lake xingyun southwestern china was taken as an example to verify the applicability of the proposed probabilistic method the eutrophication of lake xingyun calls for exploration of the limiting nutrient for proper management strategy due to the relatively small lake size the spatial dynamics was not explored in this study it is hypothesized that dynamics of the nutrient limitation has both interannual and seasonal differences in lake xingyun therefore it was important to explore interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation for proper eutrophication management strategy the proposed probabilistic method was applied to test the hypothesis to facilitate the efficient eutrophication management and to verify the applicability of the proposed probabilistic method 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake xingyun 24 17 23 24 23 11 n 102 45 19 102 48 12 e is located in yuxi city yunnan province southwestern china with an average depth of 7m and a maximum depth of 11m the catchment area is 386km2 and the lake surface area is 34 7km2 the watershed belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate characterized by wet summers and dry winters the mean annual temperature is 16 1 c with a mean july temperature of 21 c and a mean january temperature of 9 c the mean annual precipitation is 879mm and the wet season from may to october contributes approximate 85 of the annual precipitation chen et al 2014 july is the month with maximum rainfall accounting for 20 of the annual precipitation the surface runoff about 82 million m3 a accounts for 73 of the total lake water supply people s government of yuxin city 2016 with the development of the agriculture and phosphate industry the lake water quality has deteriorated since the 2000s together with the cyanobacterial bloom li et al 2007 the runoff brings heavy nutrients loading into the lake and total loadings of tn and tp are approximately 1060t a and 230t a respectively besides as a semi enclosed lake pollutants tend to accumulate within the lake zhang et al 2016 consequently the lake is susceptible to eutrophication last decade has witnessed the significant degradation of water quality especially for the increase of tp concentration fig s1 it is now in a hyper eutrophic state with a mean chlorophyll a chla concentration of 56μg l table 1 the interannual trend of water quality over the last decade and the seasonal fluctuations of nutrients fig s1 make lake xingyun a proper example to show interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation more importantly the eutrophication calls for the identification of the limiting nutrient to help set proper management strategy and that is also what we try to provide the data was from the monthly routine monitoring by environmental monitoring station of yunnan province from 2006 to 2014 with 108 groups of data in total 2 2 methods the proposed probabilistic method to explore interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation in lake xingyun includes four steps fig 1 1 transformation of original data as normal distribution 2 bayesian anova model development and parameters estimation 3 distributions calculation for each year and each month 4 pfrs calculation to explore interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation 2 2 1 the pfr instead of using the average ratio solely we used the distribution to give a full view of the population of the tn tp ratio therefore the first step is to identify a proper distribution to describe the tn tp ratio water quality variables such as tn and tp always obey lognormal distribution and the joint distribution of log tn and log tp can be treated as a bivariate normal distribution cha et al 2016 since the log tn tp is a linear combination of log tn and log tp it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of the log tn tp is a normal distribution that is the tn tp ratio is also a lognormal distribution instead of giving a deterministic judgment based on the average ratio we define the indicator pfr indicating the possibility of tn limitation the indicator gives a probabilistic measure of the nutrient limitation the pfr is calculated based on the lognormal distribution of the tn tp ratio eq 1 1 p f r 0 r r φ x d x 2 φ x 1 2 π x κ e l og x μ 2 2 κ 2 where x is the variable representing the tn tp ratio φ x is the probability density function of x which is a lognormal distribution μ is the mean of log x and κ is the standard deviation of log x rr is the redfield ratio although some researchers revised the redfield ratio to 14 1 by molar allmon and martin 2014 and revealed that faster growing phytoplankton has lower ratio hillebrand et al 2013 the value of 16 1 is generally the most widely used cha et al 2016 moffett et al 2015 reinhard et al 2017 therefore rr is equal to 16 in this study the pfr represents the chance of tn limitation for the population with respect to the redfield ratio similarly the probability of tn tp ratio over the redfield ratio line is defined as r r φ x d x it reflects the chance of tp limited and is exactly 1 pfr therefore we just used the pfr to explore the limiting nutrient for example if the pfr is 0 3 it means that tn is the limiting nutrient for 30 of the time during the research period and tp is the limiting nutrient for the rest 70 time a larger pfr indicates that tn is more likely as the limiting nutrient after obtaining the pfr of every year and every month we can show the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation to calculate pfrs we should get distributions of different years and different months firstly which is exactly the results of bayesian anova 2 2 2 bayesian anova in the bayesian anova model the total variance was decomposed into three factors namely year month and residuals posterior distributions of treatment effects for the year factor and the month factor were estimated 3 r i k r 0 r 1 i r 2 k ε i k 4 r 0 n m 0 τ 2 ε i k n 0 σ 0 2 5 r 1 i n 0 σ 1 2 r 2 k n 0 σ 2 2 where rik are log transformed tn tp ratios i is the index of the year i 1 2 9 represent the year from 2006 to 2014 and k is the index of the month k 1 2 12 represent 12 months in a year r 0 is the overall mean r 1i and r 2k are the year effect of the ith year and month effect of the kth month respectively e g r 22 0 5 indicates the mean in the second month is r 0 0 5 εik are residuals all the year effects or month effects obey the same prior normal distribution with zero mean and variance to be estimated eq 5 σ 1 2 is the between year variance σ 2 2 is the between month variance and σ 0 2 is the variance of residuals caused by the measurement error and other random noise the total variance is σ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 0 2 due to the hierarchical structure the model partially pooled data and borrowed strength from the other years or months when estimating the posterior distribution of the treatment effect of a certain year or month in that way we could reduce the overall estimation error and improve the accuracy of decision qian et al 2015 in addition it allowed better comparisons of multiple means gelman et al 2012 which was particularly suitable for the exploration of interannual and seasonal dynamics the distribution of the log tn tp in the ith year eq 6 or in the kth month eq 7 was easy to obtain qian 2015 we can also got the distribution of the kth month in the ith year according to eq 8 6 n r 0 r 1 i σ 2 2 σ 0 2 7 n r 0 r 2 k σ 1 2 σ 0 2 8 n r 0 r 1 i r 2 k σ 0 2 2 2 3 candidate models to identify the necessity of adding the year or the month as an influencing factor two other candidate models were also developed in these two models we deleted the year factor or the month factor respectively besides the normal distribution we also assumed that the tn tp ratio obeyed normal distribution and built three models to select a proper distribution thus we had six candidate models in total table 2 the leave one out cross validation information criterion looic was used to estimate pointwise out of sample prediction accuracy and to select the best model looic used the full bayesian posterior distribution and was thus much more reliable than deviance information criterion dic whereas dic was based on point estimates vehtari et al 2016 a smaller looic indicated a better model with smaller deviance penalized by the model complexity the bayesian anova model was implemented via rstanarm package stan development team 2016a in r software r version 3 3 2 we chose non informative prior distributions for all the parameters posterior distributions were obtained via hamiltonian monte carlo algorithm stan development team 2016b four hamiltonian monte carlo chains were set with random initials and each chain ran 10 000 iterations the first half were for the burn in period and the last 5 000 iterations were for obtaining the posterior distribution the convergence was assessed by the r hat statistic r hat 1 1 at convergence dufour et al 2014 gelman and hill 2007 3 results and discussions 3 1 model identification and parameters estimation 3 1 1 model identification performances of six candidate models were compared table 2 full models considered both the year and the month as influencing factors the other two models only included the year or the month factor respectively results showed that looic values of models with the lognormal distribution were much smaller than models with the normal distribution indicating that the lognormal distribution was more appropriate for the tn tp ratio in addition we compared the relationship between the distribution function and the empirical distribution function of the two full models fig s2 and fig s3 to get the empirical distribution function we sorted the observed tn tp ratios from the smallest to the largest and calculated the empirical quantile which was i n 1 where i is the rank and n is the sample size ahmad et al 1988 the model with normal distribution had bad goodness of fit while the model with lognormal distribution fitted perfectly fig s2 and fig s3 therefore the lognormal distribution was reasonable and appropriate to describe the tn tp ratio as for the model structure the full model had the smallest looic indicating both the year factor and the month factor were important to the variation of the tn tp ratio according to the analysis above the full model with lognormal distribution had perfect goodness of fit and thus was chosen as the best model for further analysis 3 1 2 parameters estimation the result of parameters estimation was shown in table s1 note that estimated parameters were the overall mean and treatment effects of the log transformed tn tp ratio the estimated overall mean was 2 73 the treatment effect of a certain year represented the difference between the mean of that year and the overall mean and the treatment effect of a certain month represented the difference between the mean of that month and the overall mean according to the estimated overall mean and treatment effects we could obtain the estimated mean of each year and each month together with the mean of a combination of any year and any month the result of estimated variances was in table 3 the estimated between year variance and the between month variance were 0 335 and 0 064 accounting for 58 and 11 of the total variance respectively according to the estimated result of variances we can obtain the estimated variance of each year or each month together with the estimated variance of a combination of any year and any month after obtaining the estimated mean and the estimated variance the distribution was identified based on the distribution the pfr of every year eq 5 or every month eq 6 or a combination of any year and any month eq 7 could be calculated 3 2 interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation 3 2 1 interannual dynamics of nutrient limitation generally the pfr had an increasingly interannual trend fig 2 there was an abrupt increase between 2009 and 2010 therefore the interannual variation was divided into two parts the first part was the lower pfr period lpp including the first four years from 2006 to 2009 the second part was the higher pfr period hpp including the last five years from 2010 to 2014 compared with the lpp pfrs during the hpp were much larger the smallest pfr in the lpp was only 0 04 while the largest pfr in the hpp was as high as 0 91 the average pfr for the two periods were 0 20 and 0 80 respectively because of the huge difference of pfr between the hpp and the lpp we deduced that a tp was the limiting nutrient during the lpp and b tn was the limiting nutrient during the hpp besides it was evident that the year of 2009 was the transition year from tp limitation to tn limitation fig 2 non point pollutants are main sources of the tn and tp loadings to the lake accounting for 86 and 89 of total loadings respectively table 4 livestock breeding and agriculture runoff are two main sources of the nutrient loading tn tp ratios of both the livestock manure and the runoff are much smaller than the redfield ratio wang et al 2011 besides phosphate mining contributed a large portion about 28 of external loading of tp jin et al 2011 therefore the extended input of pollutants with low tn tp ratio leads to the decreasingly interannual trend of the tn tp ratio and further the shift form tp limitation to tn limitation unfortunately the reason for the abrupt increase of the tp concentration between 2009 and 2010 remains unknown the regime shift from the turbid state to the clear state might be a possible reason wang et al 2010 but more data and study is required 3 2 2 seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation the seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation changed gradually with months and no evident change point existed fig 3 the smallest pfr was 0 37 in march while the largest pfr was 0 67 in august generally pfr values were lower from january to april and were higher from july to november in may june and december pfr values were close to 0 5 thus the seasonal dynamics was divided into three parts the first part was the lower pfr season lps from january to april the second part was the higher pfr season hps from july to november the third part included the other three months and because pfr values were close to 0 5 these three months were clustered into the transition season ts the average pfr during the lps was 0 39 and was 0 63 during the hps although the pfr increased from lps to hps due to the relatively small difference of the pfr between the lps and the hps neither tn nor tp took the dominant role in all the three seasons therefore we inferred a seasonal co limitation of tn and tp for the phytoplankton more pollutants flowed into the lake in the wet season from may to october accounting for 85 of the annual precipitation might be a cause of the decrease of the tn tp ratio in the hps besides the sedimentation and decomposition of the phytoplankton residuals might cause hypolimnetic hypoxia and then lead to more phosphorus released into the water cao et al 2016 while more nitrogen removed by denitrification cottingham et al 2015 that could be another reason for the lower tp tn ratio in the hps however in spite of the seasonal variation of the tn tp ratio it did not cause the seasonal change of nutrient limitation to verify our deductions on interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation we further tested the significance of the relationship between chla concentration and nutrients concentrations based on the observed data when there are more than one independent variable the partial correlation analysis is a better way to explore the relationship between a certain independent variable and the dependent variable than the simple correlation analysis morrissey et al 2014 the partial correlation analysis eliminates the effect of the other independent variables and reflects the relationship veritably wang et al 2016 since the log tp log tn and log chla obey normal distribution we calculated the partial correlation coefficients between log tp and log chla using pearson s method together with partial correlation coefficients between log tn and log chla of different periods and seasons a t statistic was established to test the significance of partial correlation coefficients kim 2015 results showed that the chla concentration had a significantly positive correlation with the tp concentration and had no significant correlation with the tn concentration in the lpp and had a significantly positive correlation with tn concentration and had no significant correlation with tp concentration in the hpp table 5 it was consistent with our deduction on the interannual dynamics under the seasonal scale chla concentration had a significantly positive correlation with both tn and tp during all the three seasons table 5 again the result agreed with our inference on the seasonal dynamics thus the observed data confirmed our pfr based deductions notice that we concluded the month factor was important to the variation of the tn tp ratio in the model selection part section 3 1 1 and it was not contradictory with the conclusion that the nutrient limitation did not change seasonally because the change of the tn tp did not necessarily change the limiting nutrient 3 3 discussions 3 3 1 pfr is a better indicator than the average ratio to determine the limiting nutrient traditionally the average ratio is used to make a deterministic conclusion on the limiting nutrient with respect to the redfield ratio li et al 2013 pelechata et al 2016 however for decision making the average ratio is an ambiguous indicator considering that the tn tp ratio obeys the lognormal distribution the median of the tn tp ratio is e μ and the mean is e μ τ 2 2 sprugel 1983 where μ is the mean and τ is the standard deviation of the log tn tp obviously the mean is larger than the median and therefore the mean is higher than the 50 quantile of the population if the mean is smaller than the redfield ratio the pfr is lower than 0 5 however if the mean is higher than the redfield ratio it is hard to determine whether the pfr is higher than 0 5 thus the average ratio is impossible to quantify the probability of the tn limitation and to improve adequate evidence to determine the limiting nutrient moreover the traditional method also denied the possibility of co limitation by both tn and tp which could lead to false conclusions for the seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation in lake xingyun judging from the average tn tp ratio we would mistakenly conclude that most of the months were tp limited fig 4 while tn and tp were actually co limiting table 4 some researchers also used a two threshold method to determine the limiting nutrient guildford and hecky 2000 sakamoto 1966 the method distinguished three kinds of nutrient limitation namely n limitation co limitation and p limitation which did go a step further to reveal the existence of co limitation however this method continued using the average ratio to give a deterministic answer on nutrient limitation abell et al 2010 it also ignored the distribution of the ratio and provided no quantitative information on the probability of different nutrient limitation conditions what s more the disagreement on the values for the two thresholds is still a problem that limits the application of this method abell et al 2010 hakanson et al 2007 the indicator pfr was defined in this study to provide another line of thinking the purpose was not to give an explicit partitioning of the nutrient limitation instead we recognized the fact that the tn tp ratio was variable which might lead to changes of the limiting nutrient the practical meaning of the pfr was clear and understandable it was the proportion of time when tn was the limiting nutrient tn was the principal limitation nutrient of phytoplankton when the pfr was close to one if the pfr was close to zero tp was the principal limiting nutrient when the pfr slightly fluctuated around 0 5 tn and tp were co limiting while the average ratio was impossible to identify the nutrient co limitation condition for the seasonal dynamics in lake xingyun the pfr identified that character successfully therefore the pfr is a better indicator to determine the limiting nutrient than the average ratio for its more understandable practical meaning and the ability to identify the nutrient co limitation for our case analysis we did not have any information on thresholds of the pfr to distinguish tn limitation co limitation and tp limitation we used the observed data table 5 to confirm our deductions on interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation in order to broaden the application of pfr it is necessary to determine thresholds of the pfr based on a larger database 3 3 2 bayesian anova is a good tool to get the distribution of each treatment the proposed probabilistic method gets the distribution of the tn tp ratio first and then calculates the pfr a reliable and accurate distribution of the ratio is the basis to calculate the pfr and to determine the limiting nutrient the bayesian anova method is a qualified tool for the requirement the first advantage is the precise estimation of the distribution as a typical form of bayesian hierarchical model the bayesian anova model can improve the overall prediction accuracy and reduce the uncertainty by partial data pooling shrinking individual sample averages toward the overall average qian et al 2015 this improvement is especially significant for small sample size which is often the case for lake management qian 2015 the second advantage is the flexible model structure gelman 2005 although we already proved the rationality of the lognormal distribution for the tn tp ratio another form of n p ratio might obey another different distribution the bayesian anova method allows different distribution assumptions for the variable qian and shen 2007 moreover although we only explored two influencing factors it is flexible to add more factors if necessary finally the recent progress of r package such as rstanarm package and stan software makes it easy and convenient to run and diagnose the bayesian anova model stan development team 2016a b 3 3 3 the proposed probability method is applicable to explore dynamics of the nutrient limitation scale aggregation both temporally and spatially could lead to the loss of important information on system dynamics cha et al 2016 the case study in lake xingyun demonstrated the necessity of exploring the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation instead of only pay attention to the average ratio it hypothesized that dynamics of the nutrient limitation had both interannual and seasonal differences in lake xingyun and tested it employing the proposed probabilistic method the interannual change of the nutrient limitation from the tp limited to the tn limited was further confirmed by the observed data although pfrs were different in different months tn and tp were co limiting for all the months the integration of the bayesian anova method and the pfr help us to reveal these characters successfully more importantly via illustrating dynamics of the nutrient limitation the proposed probabilistic method avoided the misleading suggestion on the eutrophication management strategy for the lake xingyun if all data was aggregated to calculate an overall pfr it is 0 52 fig 5 indicating tn and tp are co limiting and control of tn and tp should be treated equally however the limiting nutrient during the growing season of the phytoplankton from may to september in the recent years is more instructive thus we combined the growing season of the phytoplankton with the hpp and calculated the distribution of each month in each year according to eq 8 results showed that the lowest pfr was 0 74 and the largest was as high as 0 98 fig 5 indicating tn was the limiting nutrient thus the decrease of tn concentration would be more effective than the decrease of tp concentration management actions should focus on the reduction of tn concentration in the lake 4 conclusions a four step probabilistic method was proposed in this study to reveal dynamics of nutrient limitation of phytoplankton according to the case study in lake xingyun the method gives a probabilistic measure and shows dynamics of the nutrient limitation properly it could provide much more useful information than deterministic conclusions based on the average ratio method because of the flexible structure of the bayesian anova model adding some other factors influencing the dynamics of the tn tp ratio e g monitoring sites in a large lake is easy to implement in this study we confirmed deductions of the proposed probabilistic method using monitoring data while the exact value of the redfield ratio is disputable in experimental studies integrating the statistical method and monitoring data might improve another line of thinking besides thresholds of the pfr to distinguish the nutrient limitation condition is still unknown further research focusing on determining thresholds of the pfr is required to broaden the application of the

25368,determination of the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton is critical to the lake eutrophication management the average value of total nitrogen total phosphorus tn tp ratio is widely used to determine the limiting nutrient while it suffers from the risk of the incorrect description of data and neglecting dynamics of the nutrient limitation a probabilistic method was thereby proposed in this study to explore dynamics of nutrient limitation including a indicator definition as the probability of tn tp ratio failing in redfield ratio line pfr indicating the possibility of tn limitation to improve a probabilistic measure for the nutrient limitation b bayesian anova analysis for posterior distributions of different treatments and c dynamics determination as pfrs to show dynamics of nutrient limitation lake xingyun in southwestern china was taken as a case to explore the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation according to modeling results we deducted that a for the interannual dynamics the limiting nutrient shifted from tp to tn and b for the seasonal dynamics tn and tp were co limiting deductions were further confirmed by the observed data with the proposed probabilistic method the co limitation of tn and tp was identified for the seasonal dynamics while using the average ratio solely denied the possibility of co limitation the current study also revealed that due to neglecting the interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation the average ratio might mislead the eutrophication management strategy by recommending reducing tn and tp concentration together the proposed probabilistic method demonstrated that tn was the limiting nutrient during the growing season of the phytoplankton in recent years and actions should focus on the tn concentration reduction keywords probabilistic method bayesian anova limiting nutrient interannual and seasonal dynamics tn tp ratio 1 introduction eutrophication has become the primary problem for freshwater and marine ecosystems smith et al 2006 leading to the deterioration of water quality damages of ecosystem structure and function and huge economic losses dodds et al 2009 mcdowell and hamilton 2013 paerl and otten 2013 excessive phosphorus and nitrogen are main drivers of eutrophication conley et al 2009 to maximize the efficiency of restoration measurements it is critical to distinguish the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton dodds 2007 in spite of increasing doubts in recent years the total nitrogen total phosphorus tn tp ratio has been widely used to determine the limiting nutrient of waterbody bergstrom 2010 persic et al 2009 symons et al 2012 xu et al 2010 with respect to the redfield ratio 16 1 by molar redfield 1934 1958 generally if the ratio is above the redfield ratio the waterbody is tp limited and if the ratio is smaller than the redfield ratio tn is the limiting nutrient when there are more than one group of data averaging tn tp ratios seems like a natural way to determine the limiting nutrient li et al 2013 pelechata et al 2016 however the average ratio loses information of the observed data and may lead to an incorrect description of the data de fouquet 2012 for example if there are four groups of data whose average ratio is above the redfield ratio it can jump into the conclusion of tp limitation unfortunately under that condition it is possible that three of them are smaller than the redfield ratio while the rest one is very large and the lake is actually tn limited for most of the chances moreover the average ratio may also neglect dynamics of nutrient limitation when data is aggregated from different sources e g different years months or sites because the tn tp ratio varies temporally and spatially cha et al 2016 frigstad et al 2011 sterner et al 2008 the temporal trend of the ratio is impacted by atmospheric deposition miyazako et al 2015 runoff diversion and internal loading release cruz et al 2015 the relative more internal release of tp than tn always lead to significantly seasonal variations davies et al 2010 dolman et al 2016 since the growth rate of phytoplankton varies with seasons mainly caused by the water temperature paerl et al 2016 exploring the limiting nutrient in the growing season is critically important for the eutrophication control the ratio is always larger in upstream than downstream green and fritsen 2006 and varies spatially both in lakes and oceans caccia and boyer 2005 smith and bennett 1999 while aggregated environmental data for status and trend assessments has been increasingly used maas hebner et al 2015 new methods which overcome these two shortcomings of using the average ratio solely are required to determine the limiting nutrient while using the average solely could be misleading the distribution would give a full view of the tn tp ratio that is the determination of nutrient limitation should be distribution based we defined an indicator the probability of tn tp ratio failing in redfield ratio line pfr to extract useful information from the distribution of the tn tp ratio to identify the limiting nutrient it is the probability when the ratio is smaller than the redfield ratio indicating the possibility of tn limitation thus it improves a probabilistic measure for the nutrient limitation the larger pfr indicates that tn is more likely to be the limiting nutrient exploring dynamics of the nutrient limitation is critical to making the proper strategy for the watershed load reduction alam et al 2016 niemisto et al 2008 the bayesian analysis of variance bayesian anova method is an effective tool to estimate treatment effects using a hierarchical regression gelman 2005 qian and shen 2007 and thus is suitable to explore dynamics of the tn tp ratio compared with the conventional anova approach bayesian anova is more flexible in model formulation easier to set up and easier to present graphically qian et al 2009 more importantly based on the bayesian theorem it gives the distribution of the tn tp ratio for every treatment conveniently ellison 2004 qian 2015 which is exactly the basis for calculating the pfr therefore integrating the pfr and the bayesian anova method we propose a probabilistic method to explore dynamics of the nutrient limitation by which the distributions of tn tp ratio for different treatments can be obtained via the bayesian anova model and then corresponding pfrs can be calculated to explore dynamics of the nutrient limitation dynamics of the nutrient limitation in hyper eutrophic lake xingyun southwestern china was taken as an example to verify the applicability of the proposed probabilistic method the eutrophication of lake xingyun calls for exploration of the limiting nutrient for proper management strategy due to the relatively small lake size the spatial dynamics was not explored in this study it is hypothesized that dynamics of the nutrient limitation has both interannual and seasonal differences in lake xingyun therefore it was important to explore interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation for proper eutrophication management strategy the proposed probabilistic method was applied to test the hypothesis to facilitate the efficient eutrophication management and to verify the applicability of the proposed probabilistic method 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake xingyun 24 17 23 24 23 11 n 102 45 19 102 48 12 e is located in yuxi city yunnan province southwestern china with an average depth of 7m and a maximum depth of 11m the catchment area is 386km2 and the lake surface area is 34 7km2 the watershed belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate characterized by wet summers and dry winters the mean annual temperature is 16 1 c with a mean july temperature of 21 c and a mean january temperature of 9 c the mean annual precipitation is 879mm and the wet season from may to october contributes approximate 85 of the annual precipitation chen et al 2014 july is the month with maximum rainfall accounting for 20 of the annual precipitation the surface runoff about 82 million m3 a accounts for 73 of the total lake water supply people s government of yuxin city 2016 with the development of the agriculture and phosphate industry the lake water quality has deteriorated since the 2000s together with the cyanobacterial bloom li et al 2007 the runoff brings heavy nutrients loading into the lake and total loadings of tn and tp are approximately 1060t a and 230t a respectively besides as a semi enclosed lake pollutants tend to accumulate within the lake zhang et al 2016 consequently the lake is susceptible to eutrophication last decade has witnessed the significant degradation of water quality especially for the increase of tp concentration fig s1 it is now in a hyper eutrophic state with a mean chlorophyll a chla concentration of 56μg l table 1 the interannual trend of water quality over the last decade and the seasonal fluctuations of nutrients fig s1 make lake xingyun a proper example to show interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation more importantly the eutrophication calls for the identification of the limiting nutrient to help set proper management strategy and that is also what we try to provide the data was from the monthly routine monitoring by environmental monitoring station of yunnan province from 2006 to 2014 with 108 groups of data in total 2 2 methods the proposed probabilistic method to explore interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation in lake xingyun includes four steps fig 1 1 transformation of original data as normal distribution 2 bayesian anova model development and parameters estimation 3 distributions calculation for each year and each month 4 pfrs calculation to explore interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation 2 2 1 the pfr instead of using the average ratio solely we used the distribution to give a full view of the population of the tn tp ratio therefore the first step is to identify a proper distribution to describe the tn tp ratio water quality variables such as tn and tp always obey lognormal distribution and the joint distribution of log tn and log tp can be treated as a bivariate normal distribution cha et al 2016 since the log tn tp is a linear combination of log tn and log tp it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of the log tn tp is a normal distribution that is the tn tp ratio is also a lognormal distribution instead of giving a deterministic judgment based on the average ratio we define the indicator pfr indicating the possibility of tn limitation the indicator gives a probabilistic measure of the nutrient limitation the pfr is calculated based on the lognormal distribution of the tn tp ratio eq 1 1 p f r 0 r r φ x d x 2 φ x 1 2 π x κ e l og x μ 2 2 κ 2 where x is the variable representing the tn tp ratio φ x is the probability density function of x which is a lognormal distribution μ is the mean of log x and κ is the standard deviation of log x rr is the redfield ratio although some researchers revised the redfield ratio to 14 1 by molar allmon and martin 2014 and revealed that faster growing phytoplankton has lower ratio hillebrand et al 2013 the value of 16 1 is generally the most widely used cha et al 2016 moffett et al 2015 reinhard et al 2017 therefore rr is equal to 16 in this study the pfr represents the chance of tn limitation for the population with respect to the redfield ratio similarly the probability of tn tp ratio over the redfield ratio line is defined as r r φ x d x it reflects the chance of tp limited and is exactly 1 pfr therefore we just used the pfr to explore the limiting nutrient for example if the pfr is 0 3 it means that tn is the limiting nutrient for 30 of the time during the research period and tp is the limiting nutrient for the rest 70 time a larger pfr indicates that tn is more likely as the limiting nutrient after obtaining the pfr of every year and every month we can show the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation to calculate pfrs we should get distributions of different years and different months firstly which is exactly the results of bayesian anova 2 2 2 bayesian anova in the bayesian anova model the total variance was decomposed into three factors namely year month and residuals posterior distributions of treatment effects for the year factor and the month factor were estimated 3 r i k r 0 r 1 i r 2 k ε i k 4 r 0 n m 0 τ 2 ε i k n 0 σ 0 2 5 r 1 i n 0 σ 1 2 r 2 k n 0 σ 2 2 where rik are log transformed tn tp ratios i is the index of the year i 1 2 9 represent the year from 2006 to 2014 and k is the index of the month k 1 2 12 represent 12 months in a year r 0 is the overall mean r 1i and r 2k are the year effect of the ith year and month effect of the kth month respectively e g r 22 0 5 indicates the mean in the second month is r 0 0 5 εik are residuals all the year effects or month effects obey the same prior normal distribution with zero mean and variance to be estimated eq 5 σ 1 2 is the between year variance σ 2 2 is the between month variance and σ 0 2 is the variance of residuals caused by the measurement error and other random noise the total variance is σ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 0 2 due to the hierarchical structure the model partially pooled data and borrowed strength from the other years or months when estimating the posterior distribution of the treatment effect of a certain year or month in that way we could reduce the overall estimation error and improve the accuracy of decision qian et al 2015 in addition it allowed better comparisons of multiple means gelman et al 2012 which was particularly suitable for the exploration of interannual and seasonal dynamics the distribution of the log tn tp in the ith year eq 6 or in the kth month eq 7 was easy to obtain qian 2015 we can also got the distribution of the kth month in the ith year according to eq 8 6 n r 0 r 1 i σ 2 2 σ 0 2 7 n r 0 r 2 k σ 1 2 σ 0 2 8 n r 0 r 1 i r 2 k σ 0 2 2 2 3 candidate models to identify the necessity of adding the year or the month as an influencing factor two other candidate models were also developed in these two models we deleted the year factor or the month factor respectively besides the normal distribution we also assumed that the tn tp ratio obeyed normal distribution and built three models to select a proper distribution thus we had six candidate models in total table 2 the leave one out cross validation information criterion looic was used to estimate pointwise out of sample prediction accuracy and to select the best model looic used the full bayesian posterior distribution and was thus much more reliable than deviance information criterion dic whereas dic was based on point estimates vehtari et al 2016 a smaller looic indicated a better model with smaller deviance penalized by the model complexity the bayesian anova model was implemented via rstanarm package stan development team 2016a in r software r version 3 3 2 we chose non informative prior distributions for all the parameters posterior distributions were obtained via hamiltonian monte carlo algorithm stan development team 2016b four hamiltonian monte carlo chains were set with random initials and each chain ran 10 000 iterations the first half were for the burn in period and the last 5 000 iterations were for obtaining the posterior distribution the convergence was assessed by the r hat statistic r hat 1 1 at convergence dufour et al 2014 gelman and hill 2007 3 results and discussions 3 1 model identification and parameters estimation 3 1 1 model identification performances of six candidate models were compared table 2 full models considered both the year and the month as influencing factors the other two models only included the year or the month factor respectively results showed that looic values of models with the lognormal distribution were much smaller than models with the normal distribution indicating that the lognormal distribution was more appropriate for the tn tp ratio in addition we compared the relationship between the distribution function and the empirical distribution function of the two full models fig s2 and fig s3 to get the empirical distribution function we sorted the observed tn tp ratios from the smallest to the largest and calculated the empirical quantile which was i n 1 where i is the rank and n is the sample size ahmad et al 1988 the model with normal distribution had bad goodness of fit while the model with lognormal distribution fitted perfectly fig s2 and fig s3 therefore the lognormal distribution was reasonable and appropriate to describe the tn tp ratio as for the model structure the full model had the smallest looic indicating both the year factor and the month factor were important to the variation of the tn tp ratio according to the analysis above the full model with lognormal distribution had perfect goodness of fit and thus was chosen as the best model for further analysis 3 1 2 parameters estimation the result of parameters estimation was shown in table s1 note that estimated parameters were the overall mean and treatment effects of the log transformed tn tp ratio the estimated overall mean was 2 73 the treatment effect of a certain year represented the difference between the mean of that year and the overall mean and the treatment effect of a certain month represented the difference between the mean of that month and the overall mean according to the estimated overall mean and treatment effects we could obtain the estimated mean of each year and each month together with the mean of a combination of any year and any month the result of estimated variances was in table 3 the estimated between year variance and the between month variance were 0 335 and 0 064 accounting for 58 and 11 of the total variance respectively according to the estimated result of variances we can obtain the estimated variance of each year or each month together with the estimated variance of a combination of any year and any month after obtaining the estimated mean and the estimated variance the distribution was identified based on the distribution the pfr of every year eq 5 or every month eq 6 or a combination of any year and any month eq 7 could be calculated 3 2 interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation 3 2 1 interannual dynamics of nutrient limitation generally the pfr had an increasingly interannual trend fig 2 there was an abrupt increase between 2009 and 2010 therefore the interannual variation was divided into two parts the first part was the lower pfr period lpp including the first four years from 2006 to 2009 the second part was the higher pfr period hpp including the last five years from 2010 to 2014 compared with the lpp pfrs during the hpp were much larger the smallest pfr in the lpp was only 0 04 while the largest pfr in the hpp was as high as 0 91 the average pfr for the two periods were 0 20 and 0 80 respectively because of the huge difference of pfr between the hpp and the lpp we deduced that a tp was the limiting nutrient during the lpp and b tn was the limiting nutrient during the hpp besides it was evident that the year of 2009 was the transition year from tp limitation to tn limitation fig 2 non point pollutants are main sources of the tn and tp loadings to the lake accounting for 86 and 89 of total loadings respectively table 4 livestock breeding and agriculture runoff are two main sources of the nutrient loading tn tp ratios of both the livestock manure and the runoff are much smaller than the redfield ratio wang et al 2011 besides phosphate mining contributed a large portion about 28 of external loading of tp jin et al 2011 therefore the extended input of pollutants with low tn tp ratio leads to the decreasingly interannual trend of the tn tp ratio and further the shift form tp limitation to tn limitation unfortunately the reason for the abrupt increase of the tp concentration between 2009 and 2010 remains unknown the regime shift from the turbid state to the clear state might be a possible reason wang et al 2010 but more data and study is required 3 2 2 seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation the seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation changed gradually with months and no evident change point existed fig 3 the smallest pfr was 0 37 in march while the largest pfr was 0 67 in august generally pfr values were lower from january to april and were higher from july to november in may june and december pfr values were close to 0 5 thus the seasonal dynamics was divided into three parts the first part was the lower pfr season lps from january to april the second part was the higher pfr season hps from july to november the third part included the other three months and because pfr values were close to 0 5 these three months were clustered into the transition season ts the average pfr during the lps was 0 39 and was 0 63 during the hps although the pfr increased from lps to hps due to the relatively small difference of the pfr between the lps and the hps neither tn nor tp took the dominant role in all the three seasons therefore we inferred a seasonal co limitation of tn and tp for the phytoplankton more pollutants flowed into the lake in the wet season from may to october accounting for 85 of the annual precipitation might be a cause of the decrease of the tn tp ratio in the hps besides the sedimentation and decomposition of the phytoplankton residuals might cause hypolimnetic hypoxia and then lead to more phosphorus released into the water cao et al 2016 while more nitrogen removed by denitrification cottingham et al 2015 that could be another reason for the lower tp tn ratio in the hps however in spite of the seasonal variation of the tn tp ratio it did not cause the seasonal change of nutrient limitation to verify our deductions on interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation we further tested the significance of the relationship between chla concentration and nutrients concentrations based on the observed data when there are more than one independent variable the partial correlation analysis is a better way to explore the relationship between a certain independent variable and the dependent variable than the simple correlation analysis morrissey et al 2014 the partial correlation analysis eliminates the effect of the other independent variables and reflects the relationship veritably wang et al 2016 since the log tp log tn and log chla obey normal distribution we calculated the partial correlation coefficients between log tp and log chla using pearson s method together with partial correlation coefficients between log tn and log chla of different periods and seasons a t statistic was established to test the significance of partial correlation coefficients kim 2015 results showed that the chla concentration had a significantly positive correlation with the tp concentration and had no significant correlation with the tn concentration in the lpp and had a significantly positive correlation with tn concentration and had no significant correlation with tp concentration in the hpp table 5 it was consistent with our deduction on the interannual dynamics under the seasonal scale chla concentration had a significantly positive correlation with both tn and tp during all the three seasons table 5 again the result agreed with our inference on the seasonal dynamics thus the observed data confirmed our pfr based deductions notice that we concluded the month factor was important to the variation of the tn tp ratio in the model selection part section 3 1 1 and it was not contradictory with the conclusion that the nutrient limitation did not change seasonally because the change of the tn tp did not necessarily change the limiting nutrient 3 3 discussions 3 3 1 pfr is a better indicator than the average ratio to determine the limiting nutrient traditionally the average ratio is used to make a deterministic conclusion on the limiting nutrient with respect to the redfield ratio li et al 2013 pelechata et al 2016 however for decision making the average ratio is an ambiguous indicator considering that the tn tp ratio obeys the lognormal distribution the median of the tn tp ratio is e μ and the mean is e μ τ 2 2 sprugel 1983 where μ is the mean and τ is the standard deviation of the log tn tp obviously the mean is larger than the median and therefore the mean is higher than the 50 quantile of the population if the mean is smaller than the redfield ratio the pfr is lower than 0 5 however if the mean is higher than the redfield ratio it is hard to determine whether the pfr is higher than 0 5 thus the average ratio is impossible to quantify the probability of the tn limitation and to improve adequate evidence to determine the limiting nutrient moreover the traditional method also denied the possibility of co limitation by both tn and tp which could lead to false conclusions for the seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation in lake xingyun judging from the average tn tp ratio we would mistakenly conclude that most of the months were tp limited fig 4 while tn and tp were actually co limiting table 4 some researchers also used a two threshold method to determine the limiting nutrient guildford and hecky 2000 sakamoto 1966 the method distinguished three kinds of nutrient limitation namely n limitation co limitation and p limitation which did go a step further to reveal the existence of co limitation however this method continued using the average ratio to give a deterministic answer on nutrient limitation abell et al 2010 it also ignored the distribution of the ratio and provided no quantitative information on the probability of different nutrient limitation conditions what s more the disagreement on the values for the two thresholds is still a problem that limits the application of this method abell et al 2010 hakanson et al 2007 the indicator pfr was defined in this study to provide another line of thinking the purpose was not to give an explicit partitioning of the nutrient limitation instead we recognized the fact that the tn tp ratio was variable which might lead to changes of the limiting nutrient the practical meaning of the pfr was clear and understandable it was the proportion of time when tn was the limiting nutrient tn was the principal limitation nutrient of phytoplankton when the pfr was close to one if the pfr was close to zero tp was the principal limiting nutrient when the pfr slightly fluctuated around 0 5 tn and tp were co limiting while the average ratio was impossible to identify the nutrient co limitation condition for the seasonal dynamics in lake xingyun the pfr identified that character successfully therefore the pfr is a better indicator to determine the limiting nutrient than the average ratio for its more understandable practical meaning and the ability to identify the nutrient co limitation for our case analysis we did not have any information on thresholds of the pfr to distinguish tn limitation co limitation and tp limitation we used the observed data table 5 to confirm our deductions on interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation in order to broaden the application of pfr it is necessary to determine thresholds of the pfr based on a larger database 3 3 2 bayesian anova is a good tool to get the distribution of each treatment the proposed probabilistic method gets the distribution of the tn tp ratio first and then calculates the pfr a reliable and accurate distribution of the ratio is the basis to calculate the pfr and to determine the limiting nutrient the bayesian anova method is a qualified tool for the requirement the first advantage is the precise estimation of the distribution as a typical form of bayesian hierarchical model the bayesian anova model can improve the overall prediction accuracy and reduce the uncertainty by partial data pooling shrinking individual sample averages toward the overall average qian et al 2015 this improvement is especially significant for small sample size which is often the case for lake management qian 2015 the second advantage is the flexible model structure gelman 2005 although we already proved the rationality of the lognormal distribution for the tn tp ratio another form of n p ratio might obey another different distribution the bayesian anova method allows different distribution assumptions for the variable qian and shen 2007 moreover although we only explored two influencing factors it is flexible to add more factors if necessary finally the recent progress of r package such as rstanarm package and stan software makes it easy and convenient to run and diagnose the bayesian anova model stan development team 2016a b 3 3 3 the proposed probability method is applicable to explore dynamics of the nutrient limitation scale aggregation both temporally and spatially could lead to the loss of important information on system dynamics cha et al 2016 the case study in lake xingyun demonstrated the necessity of exploring the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation instead of only pay attention to the average ratio it hypothesized that dynamics of the nutrient limitation had both interannual and seasonal differences in lake xingyun and tested it employing the proposed probabilistic method the interannual change of the nutrient limitation from the tp limited to the tn limited was further confirmed by the observed data although pfrs were different in different months tn and tp were co limiting for all the months the integration of the bayesian anova method and the pfr help us to reveal these characters successfully more importantly via illustrating dynamics of the nutrient limitation the proposed probabilistic method avoided the misleading suggestion on the eutrophication management strategy for the lake xingyun if all data was aggregated to calculate an overall pfr it is 0 52 fig 5 indicating tn and tp are co limiting and control of tn and tp should be treated equally however the limiting nutrient during the growing season of the phytoplankton from may to september in the recent years is more instructive thus we combined the growing season of the phytoplankton with the hpp and calculated the distribution of each month in each year according to eq 8 results showed that the lowest pfr was 0 74 and the largest was as high as 0 98 fig 5 indicating tn was the limiting nutrient thus the decrease of tn concentration would be more effective than the decrease of tp concentration management actions should focus on the reduction of tn concentration in the lake 4 conclusions a four step probabilistic method was proposed in this study to reveal dynamics of nutrient limitation of phytoplankton according to the case study in lake xingyun the method gives a probabilistic measure and shows dynamics of the nutrient limitation properly it could provide much more useful information than deterministic conclusions based on the average ratio method because of the flexible structure of the bayesian anova model adding some other factors influencing the dynamics of the tn tp ratio e g monitoring sites in a large lake is easy to implement in this study we confirmed deductions of the proposed probabilistic method using monitoring data while the exact value of the redfield ratio is disputable in experimental studies integrating the statistical method and monitoring data might improve another line of thinking besides thresholds of the pfr to distinguish the nutrient limitation condition is still unknown further research focusing on determining thresholds of the pfr is required to broaden the application of the

25369,urbanization is an important driver of environmental changes causing an increasing demand of ecosystem services while altering natural ecosystems yet the sustainable management of urban areas can support the long term provision of goods and services typical of healthy and resilient ecosystems and essential for human well being in this study multiple ecosystem services generated by forest agricultural cropland and grassland and urban areas in the municipality of uppsala sweden were first assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units afterwards the economic value of provisioning and regulating services was spatialized using geographic information systems gis the economic value of all investigated services amounted to 1 81 billion swedish kronor sek or 198 million

highest 20 000 sekha 1 or 2200 ha 1 followed by forest areas 11 387 sekha 1 or 1250 ha 1 and agricultural areas 6398 sekha 1 or 703 ha 1 the integration between the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of several ecosystem services provided by different land uses as well as their spatial analysis allowed a deeper understanding on the ecological life support system to the urban area of uppsala in conclusion we maintain that the interplay between nature services and human settlements can be better explored by using an interdisciplinary approach providing ecological and economic information integrated in support of policy makers and urban planners keywords ecosystem services environmental accounting cities uppsala 1 introduction ecosystem services es are benefits that human obtain directly or indirectly from ecosystems ma 2005 stocks of natural capital and flows of es are massively exploited to support human economy and well being thus emphasizing the dependence of human activities on the ecological life support system daly 1990 over the last century urbanization in cities has become an important driver of environmental changes triggering the demand of es while increasing the amount of waste and emissions in surrounding ecosystems eigenbrod et al 2011 in europe about 80 of the population already lives in urban areas while at global level about 50 of the world population lives in urban areas hölzinger et al 2014 haase et al 2014a in addition it is projected that 70 of the global population will live in urban areas by 2030 adding an even higher pressure on the fragile balance between human economy and supporting ecosystems demuzere et al 2014 folke et al 1997 estimated the ecosystem surface needed for es consumption and waste assimilation of the 29 largest cities in the baltic sea region such ecosystem surface was estimated to be at least 500 1000 times larger than the surface of the cities themselves yet urban areas if sustainably managed can play a crucial role in supporting human well being while containing environmental costs and impacts of human activities chrysoulakis et al 2013 elmqvist et al 2015 mcphearson et al 2016 the long term provision of multiple ecosystem goods and services is based on the balanced relationship between the demand of es by cities and the supply of es ensured by green urban areas and peri urban ecosystems therefore a major research and policy effort should be made to better understand and properly manage es generated within cities and their surrounding environments gómez baggethun and barton 2013 haase et al 2014b several biophysical and economic assessment methods have been developed and applied to account for environmental costs and benefits due to the exploitation of es ulgiati et al 2010 seppelt et al 2011 franzese et al 2014 häyhä and franzese 2014 schröter et al 2014 nikodinoska et al 2015 2017 spatial analysis is increasingly used to assess the value of multiple es while investigating their supply demand and budgets burkhard et al 2012 mapping es is also functional to establishing a more rational resource management policy in particular landscape and urban planning can be supported by considering additional information including the local provision and consumption of es and related biophysical constraints to human development ahern et al 2014 haase et al 2014c wolff et al 2015 the economic assessment of es can explore different forms of utility i e use and non use value provided by ecosystems to humans indeed different money based valuation methods can be used to assess both marketable e g provisioning and non marketable e g regulating es the latter although vital for human well being are often overlooked by market based valuations farber et al 2002 in addition many issues arise when es are valued in money units the economic value of es is highly dependent on the chosen market or survey based assessment method most often characterized by simplified assumptions e g rational behavior also relying on subjective preferences moreover the estimated economic value of es does not necessarily reflect the individual or societal value of the investigated services ludwig 2000 when ecosystems are approaching ecological thresholds natural capital and es can reach critical levels in both quantity and quality farley 2012 in such cases money based methods used to account for marginal changes in the provision of es are not effective estimation tools since an infinitesimal decrease in the physical quantity of natural capital and es could lead to a dramatic increase of their marginal economic value limburg et al 2002 therefore a solid biophysical accounting should precede the economic valuation to reflect the state of ecosystems and their actual provision of services franzese et al 2017 picone et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 many studies have focused on assessing single or bundle of es at national level gren and isacs 2009 uk nea 2014

conditions in urban neighborhoods in the city of new york usa derkzen et al 2015 quantified the es generated by urban green areas located in the city of rotterdam the netherlands elmqvist et al 2015 estimated in biophysical and money terms the benefits received in terms of es in 25 urban areas in usa china and canada in spite of this broad literature an integrated biophysical economic approach to the assessment of es at municipal level is still a relatively new research area requiring a multi method and multi criteria perspective gómez baggethun and barton 2013 hubacek and kronenberg 2013 haase et al 2014b derkzen et al 2015 franzese et al 2015 in this study multiple es generated by forest agricultural cropland and grassland and urban areas in the municipality of uppsala sweden were firstly assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units afterwards the economic value of provisioning regulating and cultural es was spatialized using geographic information systems gis finally the main spatial patterns of es provision in relation to different land uses as well as the utility of an interdisciplinary and biophysical based valuation were discussed 1 1 added value and usefulness of the study the added value of the study is the integrated assessment of the ecological and economic benefits that ecosystem services generate for human well being and local economy in the city of uppsala the study was performed by using local and regional data not international average data in addition the integrated use of gis allowed the spatial representation of the results the produced tables and maps can support local managers and policy makers while informing the local population and raising the awareness about the ecological and economic importance of the annual flows of es generated by forest agricultural and green urban areas in the city system moreover the findings of this study represent a quantitative and spatially explicit benchmark useful to monitor the future trends in the development of the city system the same assessment protocol implemented in this study can be applied to any other city worldwide for the investigation of other city systems or for comparative purposes 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the municipality of uppsala 59 51 29 n 17 38 41 e is located in the east central sweden and it is part of the uppsala county the municipality covers a total surface of 2234km2 consisting of forests 60 arable and grazing land 25 urban areas 6 water courses 2 and other land 7 fig 1 the city of uppsala is the fourth largest city of sweden with a land area of 48 77km2 and a total population of 140 454 inhabitants with a density of population of 2880 inh km 2 it accounts for 68 of the population of the municipality of uppsala the main land use in the municipality of uppsala is the forest area 133 292ha indicating the importance of such ecosystem for the local economy and human well being the main forest types are scots pine picea abies l forests with 42 6 of the total forest area norway spruce pinus sylvestris l forests with 38 4 and birch betula pendula roth and betula pubescens ehrh forests with 10 4 the forest management follows the 1993 forestry act giving equal importance to a sustainable and commercial timber production and environmental protection the forest land in the municipality of uppsala is divided in productive forests 124 262ha providing different types of wood products i e sawlogs pulpwood round wood and fuelwood and non productive forests 9030ha annually producing less than one cubic meter of wood biomass per hectare according to the swedish forestry act the active forestry management is aimed at using limited forest areas for clear cutting also considering natural higher biodiversity and amount of deadwood and cultural values of the forests swedish forest agency 2009 nature conservation in the swedish forest management is achieved through the establishment of national parks and natural reserves as well as voluntary nature protection agreements involving forests owners there are about 5000ha of forest dominated natural reserves and 126ha of habitat protection areas in the forest land located in the municipality of uppsala statistics sweden 2014 the municipality of uppsala has a higher share of agricultural land 25 compared to the national average 8 involving 832 agricultural enterprises supplying crops meat and dairy products on the local and national level in the municipality there is much effort towards enhancing sustainable agriculture while reducing the environmental impact due to conventional farming about 9500ha of land were converted to organic farming 17 of the total agricultural land in 2014 swedish agricultural board 2014 also according to the idea of a multi functional agriculture there is a strong potential for diversifying the use of food crops and residues to supply food feedstock and energy sources ekman et al 2013 semi natural grasslands in sweden are defined as unfertilized meadows or pastures with a flora and fauna traditionally used for forage production kumm 2003 the surface of semi natural grasslands meadows and pastures and forest grazing was drastically reduced during the 20th century from 1 3mha to about 229 000ha kumm 2003 instead nowadays such a land use is gaining importance in sweden due to its high natural biodiversity and cultural landscape value öhlund et al 2015 since the socio economic value of semi natural grasslands is highly dependent on a continuous management and animal husbandry financial incentives have been provided to farmers to prevent their abandonment lindborg et al 2008 currently in the municipality of uppsala there are 4 658ha of semi natural grasslands the maintenance and enhancement of urban parks and green areas i e gardens allotment areas playgrounds street trees represent an important component of the urban planning of the municipality currently there are 1100ha of parks and green areas and about 20 540 urban trees at city level parks and green areas represent 22 of the city area 1054ha with an average green area of 69m2 per inhabitant uppsala kommun 2013 uppsala city also has 518 cottage plots and 1766 cultivation plots with a total surface of 34ha devoted to urban agriculture lönnerud 2012 the city of uppsala is one of the fastest growing cities in sweden for which it is predicted an increment of additional 30 40 000 inhabitants in the period between 2010 and 2030 requiring space for almost 25 000 new housing units uppsala municipality 2010 this population increase can cause an increasing competition between different land uses especially in the case of development and expansion of urban areas over existing arable or forest land soderbaum 2012 in the period between 2006 and 2010 the municipality of uppsala has registered the highest transformation of arable 91ha and pastures 7ha land in sweden swedish agricultural board 2013 moreover the municipal urban planning addressed the issue of the population increase by projecting a development of new housing areas streets roads and rail links on natural lands currently used mainly for agricultural purposes these changes can have social economic and environmental consequences in terms of forgone income by local farmers increased competition for the remaining agricultural areas leading to high land prices thelin 2014 and also possible lower supply of es hölzinger et al 2014 2 2 methods for the assessment of es different definitions and classifications of es are available in the literature costanza 2008 de groot et al 2010 this study used the classification scheme proposed by teeb 2010 to assess and value twenty two selected es generated by forest agricultural and urban areas in the municipality of uppsala the reference year of the study is 2014 and the assessment and valuation were focused on those es for which local and regional data and statistics were available the biophysical value was calculated to assess the actual provision of es generated by different land uses in the municipality of uppsala the investigated services and related biophysical indicators calculated to quantify the provision of the es in the reference year are summarized in tables 1 3 the data source and specific calculations performed to quantify the biophysical value of each es are provided in the supplementary material available on line paragraphs 1 3 the economic value ev of the investigated es was assessed according to the following equation ev si pi where si is the supply and pi is the price or shadow price of each es this calculation procedure provides a conservative estimate of the theoretical value of es such estimate can be considered a reasonable proxy of the economic value of es provided to human economy over a short time frame howarth and farber 2002 the economic valuation methods used in this study are 1 market based valuation and 2 benefit transfer method based on contingent valuation and replacement cost each of these methods is briefly described below considering both the advantages and limitations of their use in valuing es in the cases of es directly observable through market transactions monetary valuations can be obtained by using their market prices indeed in a well defined and well functioning market both preferences and marginal production costs are reflected by market price representing a reliable proxy of the value of es since many provisioning es are marketable their market price can be used to estimate their economic value even though most often such price does not take into account the externalities due to their production instead in the case of distorted markets e g presence of a subsidy scheme or absence of full competitiveness prices provide biased estimates of the economic value of es since they do not resemble marginal costs and utility teeb 2010 the benefit transfer method is used to transfer the results of previous researches on es implemented in one site study site to another site with similar characteristics and subject to a new policy design policy site wilson and hoehn 2006 while benefit transfer is surely a time and resource saving way of valuing es it should be remarked that its robustness is highly dependent on the resemblance between study and policy site in this study the benefit transfer method was used to calculate the value of cultural es in forest agricultural and urban areas by using information from previous swedish national and regional studies on the willingness to pay for preserving landscapes and amenity values and for outdoor recreation axellie 2013 drake 1992 ezebilo 2014 transek 1993 the benefit transfer method was also used for valuing the forest service of nutrient sequestration in this case the results from a previous study using the replacement cost to value the nutrient sequestration from mälar region forest ecosystem were transferred to value the forest es of nutrient retention gren 2015 such value transfer is consistent as the forest area of the municipality of uppsala is a part of the mälar region and therefore it shares similar features and management schemes the replacement cost method is used to assign an economic value to an es based on the costs of replacing such nature provided service with a technology sundberg 2004 this method can be applied if the following conditions are satisfied 1 the technology is capable of providing the same services generated by natural ecosystems 2 the chosen technology is the least costly available alternative for the investigated es and 3 there is a public demand for the chosen technology when the nature provided service is no longer available one of the drawbacks of the replacement cost method is that often technologies alternative to nature services provide only one or a limited set of es compared to the multi functionality of ecosystems allowing the co production of several es in addition another limit is represented by the difficulty to find a perfect technological substitute to nature services notaro and paletto 2012 the contingent valuation cv is a survey based method in which respondents directly state their preferences for quantitative or qualitative changes in ecosystem goods and services it is called contingent valuation because people are asked to state their willingness to pay wtp or their willingness to accept wta contingent on a specific hypothetical scenario and description of the environmental good or service carson et al 2001 while price or cost based approaches are not suitable for estimating ecosystem goods and services for which a relevant market is missing e g biodiversity the state preference method of cv can provide conservative estimates of these services value kriström 1990 the main limitations of using this methodology are the underlying assumptions that people can identify and understand the investigated es and that they will reveal their real preferences in reality people may not be familiar with the concept of regulating or supporting services i e services missing a clear market and therefore they may lack an adequate basis for stating their value nunes and van den bergh 2001 the investigated services and related economic indicators calculated to value the es generated in the study area are summarized in tables 1 3 the data sources and specific calculations performed to assess the economic value of each es are provided in the supplementary material available on line supplementary paragraphs 1 3 3 results the biophysical and economic values of twenty two es generated by three different land uses in the municipality of uppsala are summarized in tables 4 6 the spatial distribution of the economic value of selected provisioning regulating and cultural es generated in forest agricultural and green urban areas is shown in figs 2 10 the annual economic value of the provisioning es generated by the municipal forest area resulted in 777m sek or 85m 1 9 10 sek 1 6 84 sek average annual rates in the year 2014 this figure translates into an average economic value of 6179 sek ha 1 the economic value of the forest regulating and cultural es was 2793 sek ha 1 320 ha 1 and 2415 sek ha 1 220 ha 1 while their annual economic value resulted in 347 and 320m sek respectively table 4 and figs 2 4 differences in biophysical and economic values of provisioning and regulating es were found between conifers broadleaved and mixed forests as well as in nature reserves mainly due to wood products and carbon sequestration figs 2 and 3 in particular the economic value of wood products saw logs pulpwood and fuelwood resulted in 1938 sek ha 1 210 ha 1 for conifer forests 1409 sek ha 1 150 ha 1 for broadleaved forests and 1726 sek ha 1 190 ha 1 for mixed forests the value of wood products in nature reserves was set to zero since their forest management implies strict ecological conservation instead the economic value of the carbon sequestration service was 9020 sek ha 1 for nature reserves followed by 1897 sek ha 1 208 ha 1 for broadleaved forests 1322 sek ha 1 145 ha 1 for mixed forests and 900 sek ha 1 100 ha 1 for conifer forests the economic value per hectare of the provisioning es generated by arable and grasslands areas were 5650 sek ha 1 620 ha 1 and 1683 sek ha 1 185 ha 1 while their annual economic value amounted to 276m sek and 7 83m sek respectively table 5 crop production contributed with 70 of the total value of the provisioning services followed by fodder and forage production with 22 the average economic value per hectare and the annual economic value of the regulating es was 93 sek ha 1 10 ha 1 and 4 6m sek for the arable land and 110 sek ha 1 12 ha 1 and 0 5m sek for the grasslands the economic value of the cultural es landscape value resulted in 850 sek ha 1 90 ha 1 for the arable areas and the much higher value of 2551 sek ha 1 280 ha 1 for grasslands the annual economic value of this cultural es amounted to 42m sek for the arable land and 12m sek for the grasslands table 5 and figs 5 7 the economic value of the provisioning es generated by green urban areas was 1136 sek ha 1 125 ha 1 while the annual economic value was 1 5m sek the investigated provisioning es include urban agriculture performed in allotment gardens and compost biomass from urban green waste the regulating service of co2 sequestration from urban parks and street trees was 2057 sek ha 1 225 ha 1 resulting in a total annual value of 2 7m sek the economic value of the cultural es aesthetic benefits provided by urban parks was the highest among all the investigated es generated by green urban areas with an average value of 16 806 sek ha 1 1850 ha 1 and a total annual value of 22m sek table 6 and fig 8 10 the total economic value of all the investigated es resulted in 1 81 billion swedish kronor 198 million of which 80 generated by forest areas 19 by agricultural areas and 1 by green urban areas considering the size of different land uses the average economic value of green urban areas was the highest 20 000 sek ha 1 or 2200 ha 1 followed by forest areas 11 387 sek ha 1 or 1250 ha 1 and agricultural areas 6398 sek ha 1 or 703 ha 1 fig 11 4 discussion bundles of ecosystem services generated by different land uses forest agricultural and green urban areas were assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units moreover a spatial distribution of the economic value of provisioning regulating and cultural es was provided for each land use such an interdisciplinary approach complemented by the spatial analysis allowed a detailed representation of the actual flows of es in the municipality of uppsala figs 2 11 the outcomes of this study represent a useful benchmark for future studies assessing and valuing the es of the municipality their supply and demands and the relationships and dependences between urban and peri urban areas the spatial distribution of the economic value of es is also useful to support landscape and urban planning in particular the results can support policy makers and local managers in charge for deciding on alternative exploitation and conservation strategies land use changes and their possible effects on the local provision of es they can be also used as a visual communication tool for raising awareness among the general public on the economic benefits and the importance of a proper management of natural and semi natural areas located in and around the densely populated urban area in uppsala more studies on individual and collective values that different stakeholders e g citizens tourists consumers assign to these land uses can be useful to better identify the adoption of shared and participative strategies for a more sustainable urbanization of the city of uppsala the estimated economic value of the es generated per hectare of forest agricultural and green urban areas are comparable with other studies valuing forest hein 2011 häyhä et al 2015 grilli et al 2015 agricultural sandhu et al 2015 and green urban es brander and koetse 2011 remme et al 2015 for instance the forest provisioning service of wood production from 154 ha 1 for the broadleaved to 213 ha 1 for the conifer forests table 4 ranges between 122 ha 1 in the study of hein 2011 and 218 ha 1 in häyhä et al 2015 the regulating forest es of carbon sequestration amounted to 11 ha 1 in hein 2011 16 ha 1 in the study of grilli et al 2015 and 78 ha 1 in the case of häyhä et al 2015 considering the same shadow pricing i e emission permit price the results of this study fall within the range of the abovementioned studies the recreation forest es is typically highly affected by the valuation method employed nieto and barredo 2015 in this case study the value of about 230 ha 1 table 4 is significantly higher than the economic value generated by the mediterranean forests around 80 ha 1 grilli et al 2015 häyhä et al 2015 but much lower compared to forests located in the northern countries such as the netherlands 1220 ha 1 hein 2011 or ireland from 1400 to 30 000 ha 1 scarpa et al 2000 the economic value of crop es 436 ha 1 table 5 is within the range of the economic value of crop production provided by perennial and non perennial plants in the province of limburg the netherlands remme et al 2015 the economic value of the carbon sequestration es provided by grasslands 12 ha 1 table 5 is somewhat higher than the economic value calculated for the carbon sequestration service provided by grasslands in the same dutch province 6 ha 1 the recreational value of 93 ha 1 for the arable land and 280 ha 1 for the grasslands is in line with the economic value of 200 ha 1 for grasslands and permanent crop and 117 ha 1 for the arable land which are average economic values of the eu agricultural landscape ciaian and paloma 2011 finally the economic value of the recreational es of green urban areas 1850 ha 1 table 6 is comparable with some estimates obtained from stated preferences studies in finland ranging from 1800 ha 1 to 20 000 ha 1 tyrväinen and väänänen 1998 tyrväinen 2001 4 1 forest ecosystem services water supply resulted the most important service among all the investigated forest es it accounted for 533m sek per year equal to 70 of the provisioning es and 37 of the total economic value generated by all es provided by local forests table 4 these figures highlight the importance of clean water supply reflecting at same time a conservative estimate of the economic cost that should be sustained in the case of overexploitation or pollution of locally available groundwater in the long run a projected population increase could lead to a higher water demand and a possible shortage of clean water due to agriculture and urban expansion uppsala kommun 2015a under this scenario the uppsala ridge could not be capable of providing fresh clean water to fulfill the need of an increased population for these reasons water supply represents a crucial es in the municipality of uppsala requiring special attention when dealing with urban planning and land use management wood and food products also represent important nature services supporting the local economy and well being of the local population among the regulating forest es the services of co2 sequestration showed the highest economic value table 4 in particular es provided by nature reserves show an interesting spatial pattern as although they do not contribute in terms of wood provision due to the conservation policy they significantly contribute in terms of carbon sequestration and recreational value figs 2 4 in addition it should be remarked that local forests are capable of sequestering 2 90 105 tco2 table 4 accounting for about 22 of the greenhouse gas emissions of the municipality uppsala kommun 2015b three scenarios were drawn to represent the value of carbon sequestration provided by forest agricultural and green urban areas by using emission permit price price of voluntary carbon market and swedish carbon tax table 7 the swedish carbon tax yields one of the highest shadow prices almost seven times higher than the emission permit price and twenty two times higher than the voluntary carbon market prices world bank 2014 the choice of using the swedish carbon tax as a shadow price to calculate the economic value of co2 sequestration in the municipality of uppsala was due to its relevance and use in the swedish context typically oriented to lower and regulate co2 emissions from various sectors of the economy lundgren et al 2015 other two services provided by local forests are nitrogen and phosphorous retention the ability to perform these services is affected by forestry management particularly by clear cuttings and fertilization practices in productive forests the trade off between the exploitation of local forests and the preservation of their regulating services should be carefully considered when evaluating forest policy and management finally the presence of local forests also entails the generation of a recreational value due to hunter and hiking activities accounting for 296m sek per year table 4 this estimate deals with the benefits assigned by the local population visiting nearby forests and is in line with other scandinavian studies that investigated the recreational benefits generated by urban and peri urban forest areas e g tyrväinen and väänänen 1998 tyrväinen 2001 a better estimate of the contribution of forest cultural services could be obtained if data on both local population and non resident tourists would be available 4 2 agricultural ecosystem services crop production resulted the most important service generated by agricultural areas accounting for 68 of the provisioning services and 56 of the total economic value of all the es generated by agricultural areas fodder and forage from agricultural area represent another important service for the local economy in the municipality of uppsala accounting for 26 of the economic value of the provisioning es yet regarding crop production it should be remarked that potential trade offs can emerge when adopting intensive agricultural practices aimed at maximizing the harvest of selected crops at the expense of other agricultural es the agricultural sector in sweden is one of the main sources of co2 emissions consisting of both direct co2 emissions due to the use of fossil resources fuels and indirect co2 emissions due to the production and use of other inputs machineries fertilizers pesticides among others the co2 emissions from the swedish agricultural sector are also a consequence of the intensive cultivation on peatlands berglund and berglund 2010 swedish environmental protection agency 2014 in particular 4670ha of peat soil and 2330ha of gyttja soils i e mud formed from a partial decay of peat are used in the municipality for the production of annual crops causing an annual emission of 19 tco2 ha 1 brandt et al 2006 in addition using fertilizers for conventional farming leads to a major nutrient leakage in water bodies affecting habitat services and diversity in local and regional aquatic ecosystems björklund et al 1999 these aspects related to conventional management schemes adopted for the exploitation of local agroecosystems although maximizing the production of certain provisioning es e g crop productions can reduce the ability of ecosystems to provide other types of es e g regulating services also reducing their ability to offset the impact of anthropogenic activities as it is the case of co2 emissions björklund et al 1999 swedish environmental protection agency 2014 the economic value of the service of co2 sequestration performed by semi natural grasslands 110 sek ha 1 yr 1 table 5 confirms the ability of land uses managed by extensive agriculture to mitigate co2 emissions karltun et al 2010 the arable land use covering 23 of the area of the municipality shows the highest economic value per hectare in terms of provisioning es while grasslands covering 2 show the highest value in terms of regulating and cultural es figs 5 7 the semi natural grasslands showed a higher value of the cultural es compared to arable land mainly due to their higher landscape diversity the cultural es of the agricultural land use accounted for 16 of the total economic value of all agricultural es table 5 showing the importance of preserving this land use to provide the local population with landscape and recreational benefits this need of the local population is also confirmed by the recent national and regional initiatives on achieving a more sustainable and multi functional agriculture by restoring meadows and pastures while increasing organic productions öhlund et al 2015 with reference to the agricultural land use results confirm the importance of proper agricultural practices capable of ensuring a healthy and resilient agroecosystem while generating a bundle of es 4 3 ecosystem services from green urban areas the total economic value of the es generated by green urban areas 20 000 sek ha 1 table 6 showed the highest value per hectare compared to forest and agricultural land uses accounting for 11 387 and 6398 sek ha 1 respectively fig 11 this outcome confirms the importance of green urban areas for the local population yet the urban area of the city of uppsala is relatively small representing 6 of the territory of the municipality of uppsala while the green urban areas represent 0 6 of the total green areas investigated in the study this is why the total annual value of the es generated by green urban areas accounted for only 1 of the total economic value of all the es generated by the three land uses of the municipality although representing a small fraction of the green urban area of the city fig 8 urban agriculture performed in allotment gardens generates a high yield in terms of vegetables fruits and berries showing a high economic value per hectare 24 527 sek ha 1 table 6 while urban agriculture in allotment gardens is surely an important es in terms of availability of local food potential trade offs could emerge if expanding such land use in the urban area at the expense of urban parks and street trees providing a significant contribution in terms of regulating and cultural es figs 9 and 10 this trade off would be even more evident if a broader assessment of the regulating es would be performed by also including noise reduction air purification runoff mitigation nutrient retention and treatment reduction of heat waves and habitat services mcphearson et al 2013b the cumulative value of green urban areas due to the presence of several urban parks in the city shows a very high economic value of 16 806 sek ha 1 table 6 this figure calculated on the base of the willingness to pay of the local residents to live nearby urban parks could increase if the recreational value of local residents and tourists would be also accounted for this aspect was not considered due to the lack of statistics on recreational activities in the urban parks of the city although the city of uppsala is surely dependent on resources coming from outside its administrative border russo et al 2014 the outcomes of this study show that green urban areas generate es with a high economic value while the peri urban areas of the municipality support the city with a buffer area generating multiple forest and agricultural es 5 concluding remarks this study investigated the biophysical and economic value of es generated by different land uses in the municipality of uppsala assessing the importance of both marketable and non marketable benefits provided by forest agricultural and green urban areas the integration between biophysical assessment and monetary valuation as well as the analysis of the main spatial patterns of es provided outcomes useful for decision makers local managers and urban planners in charge for natural resources management at city level also in front of competing land uses the results show that the green areas in the municipality of uppsala generate high value for the local urban population and that the urban system is dependent on the surrounding ecosystems the spatial representation of the economic value of different categories of es allowed a deeper understanding about the relationships between urban and peri urban areas and the support that the latter provide to the urban area of the municipality its human economy and citizens well being the results also represent a quantitative and spatially explicit benchmark useful to monitor the future trends in the development of the city system in terms of replicability of the study it should be remarked that the same assessment protocol implemented in this study could be applied to any other city worldwide for the investigation of other city systems or for comparative purposes a biophysical approach to the assessment of es is also useful to account for actual and potential flows of es this information can help preventing es overexploitation and ecosystem degradation in conclusion we maintain that the interplay between nature services and human settlements can be better explored by using an

25369,urbanization is an important driver of environmental changes causing an increasing demand of ecosystem services while altering natural ecosystems yet the sustainable management of urban areas can support the long term provision of goods and services typical of healthy and resilient ecosystems and essential for human well being in this study multiple ecosystem services generated by forest agricultural cropland and grassland and urban areas in the municipality of uppsala sweden were first assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units afterwards the economic value of provisioning and regulating services was spatialized using geographic information systems gis the economic value of all investigated services amounted to 1 81 billion swedish kronor sek or 198 million per year of which 80 generated by forest areas 19 by agricultural areas and 1 by green urban areas considering the size of different land uses the average economic value of green urban areas was the highest 20 000 sekha 1 or 2200 ha 1 followed by forest areas 11 387 sekha 1 or 1250 ha 1 and agricultural areas 6398 sekha 1 or 703 ha 1 the integration between the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of several ecosystem services provided by different land uses as well as their spatial analysis allowed a deeper understanding on the ecological life support system to the urban area of uppsala in conclusion we maintain that the interplay between nature services and human settlements can be better explored by using an interdisciplinary approach providing ecological and economic information integrated in support of policy makers and urban planners keywords ecosystem services environmental accounting cities uppsala 1 introduction ecosystem services es are benefits that human obtain directly or indirectly from ecosystems ma 2005 stocks of natural capital and flows of es are massively exploited to support human economy and well being thus emphasizing the dependence of human activities on the ecological life support system daly 1990 over the last century urbanization in cities has become an important driver of environmental changes triggering the demand of es while increasing the amount of waste and emissions in surrounding ecosystems eigenbrod et al 2011 in europe about 80 of the population already lives in urban areas while at global level about 50 of the world population lives in urban areas hölzinger et al 2014 haase et al 2014a in addition it is projected that 70 of the global population will live in urban areas by 2030 adding an even higher pressure on the fragile balance between human economy and supporting ecosystems demuzere et al 2014 folke et al 1997 estimated the ecosystem surface needed for es consumption and waste assimilation of the 29 largest cities in the baltic sea region such ecosystem surface was estimated to be at least 500 1000 times larger than the surface of the cities themselves yet urban areas if sustainably managed can play a crucial role in supporting human well being while containing environmental costs and impacts of human activities chrysoulakis et al 2013 elmqvist et al 2015 mcphearson et al 2016 the long term provision of multiple ecosystem goods and services is based on the balanced relationship between the demand of es by cities and the supply of es ensured by green urban areas and peri urban ecosystems therefore a major research and policy effort should be made to better understand and properly manage es generated within cities and their surrounding environments gómez baggethun and barton 2013 haase et al 2014b several biophysical and economic assessment methods have been developed and applied to account for environmental costs and benefits due to the exploitation of es ulgiati et al 2010 seppelt et al 2011 franzese et al 2014 häyhä and franzese 2014 schröter et al 2014 nikodinoska et al 2015 2017 spatial analysis is increasingly used to assess the value of multiple es while investigating their supply demand and budgets burkhard et al 2012 mapping es is also functional to establishing a more rational resource management policy in particular landscape and urban planning can be supported by considering additional information including the local provision and consumption of es and related biophysical constraints to human development ahern et al 2014 haase et al 2014c wolff et al 2015 the economic assessment of es can explore different forms of utility i e use and non use value provided by ecosystems to humans indeed different money based valuation methods can be used to assess both marketable e g provisioning and non marketable e g regulating es the latter although vital for human well being are often overlooked by market based valuations farber et al 2002 in addition many issues arise when es are valued in money units the economic value of es is highly dependent on the chosen market or survey based assessment method most often characterized by simplified assumptions e g rational behavior also relying on subjective preferences moreover the estimated economic value of es does not necessarily reflect the individual or societal value of the investigated services ludwig 2000 when ecosystems are approaching ecological thresholds natural capital and es can reach critical levels in both quantity and quality farley 2012 in such cases money based methods used to account for marginal changes in the provision of es are not effective estimation tools since an infinitesimal decrease in the physical quantity of natural capital and es could lead to a dramatic increase of their marginal economic value limburg et al 2002 therefore a solid biophysical accounting should precede the economic valuation to reflect the state of ecosystems and their actual provision of services franzese et al 2017 picone et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 many studies have focused on assessing single or bundle of es at national level gren and isacs 2009 uk nea 2014

conditions in urban neighborhoods in the city of new york usa derkzen et al 2015 quantified the es generated by urban green areas located in the city of rotterdam the netherlands elmqvist et al 2015 estimated in biophysical and money terms the benefits received in terms of es in 25 urban areas in usa china and canada in spite of this broad literature an integrated biophysical economic approach to the assessment of es at municipal level is still a relatively new research area requiring a multi method and multi criteria perspective gómez baggethun and barton 2013 hubacek and kronenberg 2013 haase et al 2014b derkzen et al 2015 franzese et al 2015 in this study multiple es generated by forest agricultural cropland and grassland and urban areas in the municipality of uppsala sweden were firstly assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units afterwards the economic value of provisioning regulating and cultural es was spatialized using geographic information systems gis finally the main spatial patterns of es provision in relation to different land uses as well as the utility of an interdisciplinary and biophysical based valuation were discussed 1 1 added value and usefulness of the study the added value of the study is the integrated assessment of the ecological and economic benefits that ecosystem services generate for human well being and local economy in the city of uppsala the study was performed by using local and regional data not international average data in addition the integrated use of gis allowed the spatial representation of the results the produced tables and maps can support local managers and policy makers while informing the local population and raising the awareness about the ecological and economic importance of the annual flows of es generated by forest agricultural and green urban areas in the city system moreover the findings of this study represent a quantitative and spatially explicit benchmark useful to monitor the future trends in the development of the city system the same assessment protocol implemented in this study can be applied to any other city worldwide for the investigation of other city systems or for comparative purposes 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the municipality of uppsala 59 51 29 n 17 38 41 e is located in the east central sweden and it is part of the uppsala county the municipality covers a total surface of 2234km2 consisting of forests 60 arable and grazing land 25 urban areas 6 water courses 2 and other land 7 fig 1 the city of uppsala is the fourth largest city of sweden with a land area of 48 77km2 and a total population of 140 454 inhabitants with a density of population of 2880 inh km 2 it accounts for 68 of the population of the municipality of uppsala the main land use in the municipality of uppsala is the forest area 133 292ha indicating the importance of such ecosystem for the local economy and human well being the main forest types are scots pine picea abies l forests with 42 6 of the total forest area norway spruce pinus sylvestris l forests with 38 4 and birch betula pendula roth and betula pubescens ehrh forests with 10 4 the forest management follows the 1993 forestry act giving equal importance to a sustainable and commercial timber production and environmental protection the forest land in the municipality of uppsala is divided in productive forests 124 262ha providing different types of wood products i e sawlogs pulpwood round wood and fuelwood and non productive forests 9030ha annually producing less than one cubic meter of wood biomass per hectare according to the swedish forestry act the active forestry management is aimed at using limited forest areas for clear cutting also considering natural higher biodiversity and amount of deadwood and cultural values of the forests swedish forest agency 2009 nature conservation in the swedish forest management is achieved through the establishment of national parks and natural reserves as well as voluntary nature protection agreements involving forests owners there are about 5000ha of forest dominated natural reserves and 126ha of habitat protection areas in the forest land located in the municipality of uppsala statistics sweden 2014 the municipality of uppsala has a higher share of agricultural land 25 compared to the national average 8 involving 832 agricultural enterprises supplying crops meat and dairy products on the local and national level in the municipality there is much effort towards enhancing sustainable agriculture while reducing the environmental impact due to conventional farming about 9500ha of land were converted to organic farming 17 of the total agricultural land in 2014 swedish agricultural board 2014 also according to the idea of a multi functional agriculture there is a strong potential for diversifying the use of food crops and residues to supply food feedstock and energy sources ekman et al 2013 semi natural grasslands in sweden are defined as unfertilized meadows or pastures with a flora and fauna traditionally used for forage production kumm 2003 the surface of semi natural grasslands meadows and pastures and forest grazing was drastically reduced during the 20th century from 1 3mha to about 229 000ha kumm 2003 instead nowadays such a land use is gaining importance in sweden due to its high natural biodiversity and cultural landscape value öhlund et al 2015 since the socio economic value of semi natural grasslands is highly dependent on a continuous management and animal husbandry financial incentives have been provided to farmers to prevent their abandonment lindborg et al 2008 currently in the municipality of uppsala there are 4 658ha of semi natural grasslands the maintenance and enhancement of urban parks and green areas i e gardens allotment areas playgrounds street trees represent an important component of the urban planning of the municipality currently there are 1100ha of parks and green areas and about 20 540 urban trees at city level parks and green areas represent 22 of the city area 1054ha with an average green area of 69m2 per inhabitant uppsala kommun 2013 uppsala city also has 518 cottage plots and 1766 cultivation plots with a total surface of 34ha devoted to urban agriculture lönnerud 2012 the city of uppsala is one of the fastest growing cities in sweden for which it is predicted an increment of additional 30 40 000 inhabitants in the period between 2010 and 2030 requiring space for almost 25 000 new housing units uppsala municipality 2010 this population increase can cause an increasing competition between different land uses especially in the case of development and expansion of urban areas over existing arable or forest land soderbaum 2012 in the period between 2006 and 2010 the municipality of uppsala has registered the highest transformation of arable 91ha and pastures 7ha land in sweden swedish agricultural board 2013 moreover the municipal urban planning addressed the issue of the population increase by projecting a development of new housing areas streets roads and rail links on natural lands currently used mainly for agricultural purposes these changes can have social economic and environmental consequences in terms of forgone income by local farmers increased competition for the remaining agricultural areas leading to high land prices thelin 2014 and also possible lower supply of es hölzinger et al 2014 2 2 methods for the assessment of es different definitions and classifications of es are available in the literature costanza 2008 de groot et al 2010 this study used the classification scheme proposed by teeb 2010 to assess and value twenty two selected es generated by forest agricultural and urban areas in the municipality of uppsala the reference year of the study is 2014 and the assessment and valuation were focused on those es for which local and regional data and statistics were available the biophysical value was calculated to assess the actual provision of es generated by different land uses in the municipality of uppsala the investigated services and related biophysical indicators calculated to quantify the provision of the es in the reference year are summarized in tables 1 3 the data source and specific calculations performed to quantify the biophysical value of each es are provided in the supplementary material available on line paragraphs 1 3 the economic value ev of the investigated es was assessed according to the following equation ev si pi where si is the supply and pi is the price or shadow price of each es this calculation procedure provides a conservative estimate of the theoretical value of es such estimate can be considered a reasonable proxy of the economic value of es provided to human economy over a short time frame howarth and farber 2002 the economic valuation methods used in this study are 1 market based valuation and 2 benefit transfer method based on contingent valuation and replacement cost each of these methods is briefly described below considering both the advantages and limitations of their use in valuing es in the cases of es directly observable through market transactions monetary valuations can be obtained by using their market prices indeed in a well defined and well functioning market both preferences and marginal production costs are reflected by market price representing a reliable proxy of the value of es since many provisioning es are marketable their market price can be used to estimate their economic value even though most often such price does not take into account the externalities due to their production instead in the case of distorted markets e g presence of a subsidy scheme or absence of full competitiveness prices provide biased estimates of the economic value of es since they do not resemble marginal costs and utility teeb 2010 the benefit transfer method is used to transfer the results of previous researches on es implemented in one site study site to another site with similar characteristics and subject to a new policy design policy site wilson and hoehn 2006 while benefit transfer is surely a time and resource saving way of valuing es it should be remarked that its robustness is highly dependent on the resemblance between study and policy site in this study the benefit transfer method was used to calculate the value of cultural es in forest agricultural and urban areas by using information from previous swedish national and regional studies on the willingness to pay for preserving landscapes and amenity values and for outdoor recreation axellie 2013 drake 1992 ezebilo 2014 transek 1993 the benefit transfer method was also used for valuing the forest service of nutrient sequestration in this case the results from a previous study using the replacement cost to value the nutrient sequestration from mälar region forest ecosystem were transferred to value the forest es of nutrient retention gren 2015 such value transfer is consistent as the forest area of the municipality of uppsala is a part of the mälar region and therefore it shares similar features and management schemes the replacement cost method is used to assign an economic value to an es based on the costs of replacing such nature provided service with a technology sundberg 2004 this method can be applied if the following conditions are satisfied 1 the technology is capable of providing the same services generated by natural ecosystems 2 the chosen technology is the least costly available alternative for the investigated es and 3 there is a public demand for the chosen technology when the nature provided service is no longer available one of the drawbacks of the replacement cost method is that often technologies alternative to nature services provide only one or a limited set of es compared to the multi functionality of ecosystems allowing the co production of several es in addition another limit is represented by the difficulty to find a perfect technological substitute to nature services notaro and paletto 2012 the contingent valuation cv is a survey based method in which respondents directly state their preferences for quantitative or qualitative changes in ecosystem goods and services it is called contingent valuation because people are asked to state their willingness to pay wtp or their willingness to accept wta contingent on a specific hypothetical scenario and description of the environmental good or service carson et al 2001 while price or cost based approaches are not suitable for estimating ecosystem goods and services for which a relevant market is missing e g biodiversity the state preference method of cv can provide conservative estimates of these services value kriström 1990 the main limitations of using this methodology are the underlying assumptions that people can identify and understand the investigated es and that they will reveal their real preferences in reality people may not be familiar with the concept of regulating or supporting services i e services missing a clear market and therefore they may lack an adequate basis for stating their value nunes and van den bergh 2001 the investigated services and related economic indicators calculated to value the es generated in the study area are summarized in tables 1 3 the data sources and specific calculations performed to assess the economic value of each es are provided in the supplementary material available on line supplementary paragraphs 1 3 3 results the biophysical and economic values of twenty two es generated by three different land uses in the municipality of uppsala are summarized in tables 4 6 the spatial distribution of the economic value of selected provisioning regulating and cultural es generated in forest agricultural and green urban areas is shown in figs 2 10 the annual economic value of the provisioning es generated by the municipal forest area resulted in 777m sek or 85m 1 9 10 sek 1 6 84 sek average annual rates in the year 2014 this figure translates into an average economic value of 6179 sek ha 1 the economic value of the forest regulating and cultural es was 2793 sek ha 1 320 ha 1 and 2415 sek ha 1 220 ha 1 while their annual economic value resulted in 347 and 320m sek respectively table 4 and figs 2 4 differences in biophysical and economic values of provisioning and regulating es were found between conifers broadleaved and mixed forests as well as in nature reserves mainly due to wood products and carbon sequestration figs 2 and 3 in particular the economic value of wood products saw logs pulpwood and fuelwood resulted in 1938 sek ha 1 210 ha 1 for conifer forests 1409 sek ha 1 150 ha 1 for broadleaved forests and 1726 sek ha 1 190 ha 1 for mixed forests the value of wood products in nature reserves was set to zero since their forest management implies strict ecological conservation instead the economic value of the carbon sequestration service was 9020 sek ha 1 for nature reserves followed by 1897 sek ha 1 208 ha 1 for broadleaved forests 1322 sek ha 1 145 ha 1 for mixed forests and 900 sek ha 1 100 ha 1 for conifer forests the economic value per hectare of the provisioning es generated by arable and grasslands areas were 5650 sek ha 1 620 ha 1 and 1683 sek ha 1 185 ha 1 while their annual economic value amounted to 276m sek and 7 83m sek respectively table 5 crop production contributed with 70 of the total value of the provisioning services followed by fodder and forage production with 22 the average economic value per hectare and the annual economic value of the regulating es was 93 sek ha 1 10 ha 1 and 4 6m sek for the arable land and 110 sek ha 1 12 ha 1 and 0 5m sek for the grasslands the economic value of the cultural es landscape value resulted in 850 sek ha 1 90 ha 1 for the arable areas and the much higher value of 2551 sek ha 1 280 ha 1 for grasslands the annual economic value of this cultural es amounted to 42m sek for the arable land and 12m sek for the grasslands table 5 and figs 5 7 the economic value of the provisioning es generated by green urban areas was 1136 sek ha 1 125 ha 1 while the annual economic value was 1 5m sek the investigated provisioning es include urban agriculture performed in allotment gardens and compost biomass from urban green waste the regulating service of co2 sequestration from urban parks and street trees was 2057 sek ha 1 225 ha 1 resulting in a total annual value of 2 7m sek the economic value of the cultural es aesthetic benefits provided by urban parks was the highest among all the investigated es generated by green urban areas with an average value of 16 806 sek ha 1 1850 ha 1 and a total annual value of 22m sek table 6 and fig 8 10 the total economic value of all the investigated es resulted in 1 81 billion swedish kronor 198 million of which 80 generated by forest areas 19 by agricultural areas and 1 by green urban areas considering the size of different land uses the average economic value of green urban areas was the highest 20 000 sek ha 1 or 2200 ha 1 followed by forest areas 11 387 sek ha 1 or 1250 ha 1 and agricultural areas 6398 sek ha 1 or 703 ha 1 fig 11 4 discussion bundles of ecosystem services generated by different land uses forest agricultural and green urban areas were assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units moreover a spatial distribution of the economic value of provisioning regulating and cultural es was provided for each land use such an interdisciplinary approach complemented by the spatial analysis allowed a detailed representation of the actual flows of es in the municipality of uppsala figs 2 11 the outcomes of this study represent a useful benchmark for future studies assessing and valuing the es of the municipality their supply and demands and the relationships and dependences between urban and peri urban areas the spatial distribution of the economic value of es is also useful to support landscape and urban planning in particular the results can support policy makers and local managers in charge for deciding on alternative exploitation and conservation strategies land use changes and their possible effects on the local provision of es they can be also used as a visual communication tool for raising awareness among the general public on the economic benefits and the importance of a proper management of natural and semi natural areas located in and around the densely populated urban area in uppsala more studies on individual and collective values that different stakeholders e g citizens tourists consumers assign to these land uses can be useful to better identify the adoption of shared and participative strategies for a more sustainable urbanization of the city of uppsala the estimated economic value of the es generated per hectare of forest agricultural and green urban areas are comparable with other studies valuing forest hein 2011 häyhä et al 2015 grilli et al 2015 agricultural sandhu et al 2015 and green urban es brander and koetse 2011 remme et al 2015 for instance the forest provisioning service of wood production from 154 ha 1 for the broadleaved to 213 ha 1 for the conifer forests table 4 ranges between 122 ha 1 in the study of hein 2011 and 218 ha 1 in häyhä et al 2015 the regulating forest es of carbon sequestration amounted to 11 ha 1 in hein 2011 16 ha 1 in the study of grilli et al 2015 and 78 ha 1 in the case of häyhä et al 2015 considering the same shadow pricing i e emission permit price the results of this study fall within the range of the abovementioned studies the recreation forest es is typically highly affected by the valuation method employed nieto and barredo 2015 in this case study the value of about 230 ha 1 table 4 is significantly higher than the economic value generated by the mediterranean forests around 80 ha 1 grilli et al 2015 häyhä et al 2015 but much lower compared to forests located in the northern countries such as the netherlands 1220 ha 1 hein 2011 or ireland from 1400 to 30 000 ha 1 scarpa et al 2000 the economic value of crop es 436 ha 1 table 5 is within the range of the economic value of crop production provided by perennial and non perennial plants in the province of limburg the netherlands remme et al 2015 the economic value of the carbon sequestration es provided by grasslands 12 ha 1 table 5 is somewhat higher than the economic value calculated for the carbon sequestration service provided by grasslands in the same dutch province 6 ha 1 the recreational value of 93 ha 1 for the arable land and 280 ha 1 for the grasslands is in line with the economic value of 200 ha 1 for grasslands and permanent crop and 117 ha 1 for the arable land which are average economic values of the eu agricultural landscape ciaian and paloma 2011 finally the economic value of the recreational es of green urban areas 1850 ha 1 table 6 is comparable with some estimates obtained from stated preferences studies in finland ranging from 1800 ha 1 to 20 000 ha 1 tyrväinen and väänänen 1998 tyrväinen 2001 4 1 forest ecosystem services water supply resulted the most important service among all the investigated forest es it accounted for 533m sek per year equal to 70 of the provisioning es and 37 of the total economic value generated by all es provided by local forests table 4 these figures highlight the importance of clean water supply reflecting at same time a conservative estimate of the economic cost that should be sustained in the case of overexploitation or pollution of locally available groundwater in the long run a projected population increase could lead to a higher water demand and a possible shortage of clean water due to agriculture and urban expansion uppsala kommun 2015a under this scenario the uppsala ridge could not be capable of providing fresh clean water to fulfill the need of an increased population for these reasons water supply represents a crucial es in the municipality of uppsala requiring special attention when dealing with urban planning and land use management wood and food products also represent important nature services supporting the local economy and well being of the local population among the regulating forest es the services of co2 sequestration showed the highest economic value table 4 in particular es provided by nature reserves show an interesting spatial pattern as although they do not contribute in terms of wood provision due to the conservation policy they significantly contribute in terms of carbon sequestration and recreational value figs 2 4 in addition it should be remarked that local forests are capable of sequestering 2 90 105 tco2 table 4 accounting for about 22 of the greenhouse gas emissions of the municipality uppsala kommun 2015b three scenarios were drawn to represent the value of carbon sequestration provided by forest agricultural and green urban areas by using emission permit price price of voluntary carbon market and swedish carbon tax table 7 the swedish carbon tax yields one of the highest shadow prices almost seven times higher than the emission permit price and twenty two times higher than the voluntary carbon market prices world bank 2014 the choice of using the swedish carbon tax as a shadow price to calculate the economic value of co2 sequestration in the municipality of uppsala was due to its relevance and use in the swedish context typically oriented to lower and regulate co2 emissions from various sectors of the economy lundgren et al 2015 other two services provided by local forests are nitrogen and phosphorous retention the ability to perform these services is affected by forestry management particularly by clear cuttings and fertilization practices in productive forests the trade off between the exploitation of local forests and the preservation of their regulating services should be carefully considered when evaluating forest policy and management finally the presence of local forests also entails the generation of a recreational value due to hunter and hiking activities accounting for 296m sek per year table 4 this estimate deals with the benefits assigned by the local population visiting nearby forests and is in line with other scandinavian studies that investigated the recreational benefits generated by urban and peri urban forest areas e g tyrväinen and väänänen 1998 tyrväinen 2001 a better estimate of the contribution of forest cultural services could be obtained if data on both local population and non resident tourists would be available 4 2 agricultural ecosystem services crop production resulted the most important service generated by agricultural areas accounting for 68 of the provisioning services and 56 of the total economic value of all the es generated by agricultural areas fodder and forage from agricultural area represent another important service for the local economy in the municipality of uppsala accounting for 26 of the economic value of the provisioning es yet regarding crop production it should be remarked that potential trade offs can emerge when adopting intensive agricultural practices aimed at maximizing the harvest of selected crops at the expense of other agricultural es the agricultural sector in sweden is one of the main sources of co2 emissions consisting of both direct co2 emissions due to the use of fossil resources fuels and indirect co2 emissions due to the production and use of other inputs machineries fertilizers pesticides among others the co2 emissions from the swedish agricultural sector are also a consequence of the intensive cultivation on peatlands berglund and berglund 2010 swedish environmental protection agency 2014 in particular 4670ha of peat soil and 2330ha of gyttja soils i e mud formed from a partial decay of peat are used in the municipality for the production of annual crops causing an annual emission of 19 tco2 ha 1 brandt et al 2006 in addition using fertilizers for conventional farming leads to a major nutrient leakage in water bodies affecting habitat services and diversity in local and regional aquatic ecosystems björklund et al 1999 these aspects related to conventional management schemes adopted for the exploitation of local agroecosystems although maximizing the production of certain provisioning es e g crop productions can reduce the ability of ecosystems to provide other types of es e g regulating services also reducing their ability to offset the impact of anthropogenic activities as it is the case of co2 emissions björklund et al 1999 swedish environmental protection agency 2014 the economic value of the service of co2 sequestration performed by semi natural grasslands 110 sek ha 1 yr 1 table 5 confirms the ability of land uses managed by extensive agriculture to mitigate co2 emissions karltun et al 2010 the arable land use covering 23 of the area of the municipality shows the highest economic value per hectare in terms of provisioning es while grasslands covering 2 show the highest value in terms of regulating and cultural es figs 5 7 the semi natural grasslands showed a higher value of the cultural es compared to arable land mainly due to their higher landscape diversity the cultural es of the agricultural land use accounted for 16 of the total economic value of all agricultural es table 5 showing the importance of preserving this land use to provide the local population with landscape and recreational benefits this need of the local population is also confirmed by the recent national and regional initiatives on achieving a more sustainable and multi functional agriculture by restoring meadows and pastures while increasing organic productions öhlund et al 2015 with reference to the agricultural land use results confirm the importance of proper agricultural practices capable of ensuring a healthy and resilient agroecosystem while generating a bundle of es 4 3 ecosystem services from green urban areas the total economic value of the es generated by green urban areas 20 000 sek ha 1 table 6 showed the highest value per hectare compared to forest and agricultural land uses accounting for 11 387 and 6398 sek ha 1 respectively fig 11 this outcome confirms the importance of green urban areas for the local population yet the urban area of the city of uppsala is relatively small representing 6 of the territory of the municipality of uppsala while the green urban areas represent 0 6 of the total green areas investigated in the study this is why the total annual value of the es generated by green urban areas accounted for only 1 of the total economic value of all the es generated by the three land uses of the municipality although representing a small fraction of the green urban area of the city fig 8 urban agriculture performed in allotment gardens generates a high yield in terms of vegetables fruits and berries showing a high economic value per hectare 24 527 sek ha 1 table 6 while urban agriculture in allotment gardens is surely an important es in terms of availability of local food potential trade offs could emerge if expanding such land use in the urban area at the expense of urban parks and street trees providing a significant contribution in terms of regulating and cultural es figs 9 and 10 this trade off would be even more evident if a broader assessment of the regulating es would be performed by also including noise reduction air purification runoff mitigation nutrient retention and treatment reduction of heat waves and habitat services mcphearson et al 2013b the cumulative value of green urban areas due to the presence of several urban parks in the city shows a very high economic value of 16 806 sek ha 1 table 6 this figure calculated on the base of the willingness to pay of the local residents to live nearby urban parks could increase if the recreational value of local residents and tourists would be also accounted for this aspect was not considered due to the lack of statistics on recreational activities in the urban parks of the city although the city of uppsala is surely dependent on resources coming from outside its administrative border russo et al 2014 the outcomes of this study show that green urban areas generate es with a high economic value while the peri urban areas of the municipality support the city with a buffer area generating multiple forest and agricultural es 5 concluding remarks this study investigated the biophysical and economic value of es generated by different land uses in the municipality of uppsala assessing the importance of both marketable and non marketable benefits provided by forest agricultural and green urban areas the integration between biophysical assessment and monetary valuation as well as the analysis of the main spatial patterns of es provided outcomes useful for decision makers local managers and urban planners in charge for natural resources management at city level also in front of competing land uses the results show that the green areas in the municipality of uppsala generate high value for the local urban population and that the urban system is dependent on the surrounding ecosystems the spatial representation of the economic value of different categories of es allowed a deeper understanding about the relationships between urban and peri urban areas and the support that the latter provide to the urban area of the municipality its human economy and citizens well being the results also represent a quantitative and spatially explicit benchmark useful to monitor the future trends in the development of the city system in terms of replicability of the study it should be remarked that the same assessment protocol implemented in this study could be applied to any other city worldwide for the investigation of other city systems or for comparative purposes a biophysical approach to the assessment of es is also useful to account for actual and potential flows of es this information can help preventing es overexploitation and ecosystem degradation in conclusion we maintain that the interplay between nature services and human settlements can be better explored by using an interdisciplinary approach providing ecological and economic information integrated in support of policy makers and urban planners appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this
