recent decades people migrating towards urban cities for better employment opportunities and professional lifestyles which has contributed to exceptional growth in industrial and urbanization sectors however the low quality and limited availability of pure drinking water are crucial issues across the world the water in the ecosystem is continuously contaminated because of the various effluents heavy metals and metalloids emitting from varieties of industrial resources 1 4 furthermore water is getting polluted with one of the dangerous metalloids like arsenic the existence of arsenic is because of smelting of iron ores wood preservative medium and the usage of arsenic containing pesticides are important anthropogenic sources also volcanic activities erosion of rocks minerals and forest fires are essential natural sources for arsenic contaminated drinking water 5 the consumption of toxic arsenic rich water over a long period can pose a life threatening severe health hazardous effects to millions of populations international agency for research on cancer iarc has categorized arsenic as class a poisonous and carcinogenic to mankind moreover the higher concentration of 10 μg l of arsenic in the drinking water has been restricted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 6 this intern motivated researchers and scientists to develop innovative methods and procedures that can be implemented for treating and recycling of the waste water contaminated by arsenic different methods have been employed for the treatment of arsenic contaminated water the performance of the different arsenic removal methods depends on the chemical and physical properties of arsenic 7 arsenic is typically present in an inorganic form in water based on the redox potential and ph levels arsenate as 5 and arsenite as 3 are two predominated species of arsenic in water 8 arsenite is more toxic and it s not easy to remove from water as compared to the removal of arsenate due to its high solubility in water 9 researchers across the globe have reported several techniques for the decontamination of arsenic by coagulation 10 oxidation 11 flocculation 12 phytoremediation 13 adsorption 14 20 along with membrane filtration by reverse osmosis 21 and nanofiltration 22 many of these methods have certain limitations as precipitation which can create large amount of toxic sludge thus causing severe environmental problems 23 ion exchange process is defined for the well retention of arsenic however the weak selectively for as 5 was influenced by extreme competition from some co existing anions and prohibitively discouraged the process of ion exchange 24 therefore the ultrafiltration membrane process is gaining importance in the separation of varieties of heavy metals including toxic arsenic ions ultrafiltration process is cost effective and offers high retention permeability and efficient with minimum fouling effect 25 26 in addition enhanced arsenic decontamination at pka 2 2 includes the conversion of arsenite as 3 to arsenate ions as 5 from arsenic contaminated water 27 many of the research studies demonstrated that the source water containing arsenate as 5 can be recovered as pure water in compliance with epa s permissible contaminant water quality requirement 9 28 however water containing arsenite as 3 must be treated with preoxidation procedure before passing through membranes for reducing to arsenate species as 5 moreover various oxidizing elements such as h2o chlorine and oxygen were employed to reduce or oxidize the arsenite acid h3aso3 to arsenate oxide aso4 3 29 also the electrostatic repulsion mechanism is a key process for the extraction of arsenic from arsenic polluted water generally the repulsion mechanism depends on the surface charge characteristics and membranes surface hydrophilicity 30 31 it was evident from our previous work that membranes containing different amount of zirconium oxide in ca ppsu and cap ppsu have showed reasonably very good arsenic removal performance 7 similarly in our another work hollow fiber membranes blended with different dosages of zinc magnesium oxide zno mgo as additive in ca ppsu and cap ppsu have decontaminated increased removal of arsenic without compromising arsenic retention permeability 32 the neat ppsu membrane removed 22 of arsenic with 44 01 l m2h bar retention permeability respectively 33 in the case of membrane separation processes an aqueous solution interact with membranes and an enriched permeate containing one of the aqueous compounds was extracted 34 however concentration polarization played a crucial role which causes surface fouling on the membrane surface because of elevated concentrations of arsenic species near to the surfaces of membranes concentration polarization is one of the major drawback in membrane filtration in which the rejected arsenic ions start to collect on the membrane surfaces 35 moreover the size of the arsenic compounds was less than the membrane pore size several researchers employed various polymers to modify the membrane surfaces and to bestow the performance of the membrane by improving hydrophilicity surface charge density and reducing the concentration polarization polyphenylsufone ppsu has gained attention for the membranes fabrication and for ensuring membranes properties the presence of biphenyl functional groups offers high chemical resistance and thermal stability which are major dominating features of ppsu in membrane fabrication 36 however the usage of ppsu was limited in membrane fabrication because of the brittleness increased hydrophobicity and severe fouling properties surfaces of the ppsu membranes were modified to improve the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties many researchers have incorporated several inorganic additives and nanoparticles to bestow the ppsu membrane properties and enhanced retention of various heavy metals 37 38 a flexible reliable inorganic nanomaterial nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 was used to intensify the performance of the blended membranes aluminum oxide is an impressive material to be used in the membrane preparation because of it s low cost chemically stable high abrasive and large surface area to volume ratio properties 39 recently dilshad et al 40 fabricated membranes by cross linking the incremental dosages of al2o3 along with polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyethylene glycol peg the prepared membranes exhibited improved thermal stability and hydrophilic properties with the incremental dosages of al2o3 nanoparticle maximus et al 41 prepared ultrafiltration membranes from polyethersulfone pes with an incremental dosages of al2o3 for the treatment of wastewater the prepared al2o3 contained membranes exhibited low flux decline and improved antifouling properties than neat membranes garcia et al 42 fabricated polymeric ultrafiltration membranes by polyethersulfone pes along with peg as an organic additive and al2o3 as an inorganic additive incremental additive dosages in the pes dope solution have resulted in the improved hydrophilic and antifouling properties ghaemi and daraei 43 incorporated intensified dosages of polypyrrole ppy al2o3 to enhance hydrophilic and adsorptive properties of the pes mixed matrix membrane however the neat al2o3 membranes suffer from a lack of hydrophilic and carboxylic functional groups additionally the existence of hydrophilic functional groups from cellulose acetate ca and cellulose acetate phthalate cap makes an effective additive for membrane surface modification 7 33 44 moreover cellulose acetate bio sorbents are more hydrophilic and adsorptive due to the existence of hydrophilic polar functional groups and β 1 4 glycosidic linkages 45 46 the introduction of cellulose acetate derivatives into the hydrophobic polymer matrix has been documented in several studies to improve membrane properties durthi et al 47 fabricated membranes containing cellulose acetate along with zinc oxide as an additive for the decontamination of arsenic membranes exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity water permeability and better arsenic retention properties gholami et al 48 fabricated nanocomposite nanofiltration membranes using polyvinylchloride pvc blended with cellulose acetate iron oxide nanoparticle the blended modified membranes exhibited improved hydrophilicity water uptake and pure water flux from the literature it was observed that no any research work was reported on nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 along with cellulose acetate derivatives into the ppsu for the membrane fabrication and enhanced arsenic removal from arsenic containing drinking water therefore in order to manage the stated research gap we intended to develop new efficient membranes for the purification of arsenic contaminated drinking water in present work hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated by polyphenylsulfone and cellulose acetate derivatives along with incremental dosages of nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 by non solvent induced phase separation method 49 as used nano al2o3 was examined by xrd and tem the

of the prepared hollow fiber membranes the prepared pristine and nano aluminum oxide incorporated membrane s cross section morphological images were represented in fig 4 the cross sectional images of all fabricated membranes showed asymmetric structure and consisted of finger like arrangement thin top layer dense middle layer sponge layer and a supportive layer the intense interaction between water and nmp was responsible for the development of a thin selective layer on the surfaces of the inner and outer layers of the hollow fiber membranes in the coagulation bath the sem morphologies of fabricated membranes are direct evidence for deciding the characteristics of the membrane i e the top layer influences the selectivity the middle layer affects productivity and the base layer or supportive layer is liable for the mechanical strength 66 the fabricated membranes without the addition of nanoparticle neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 contains many macrovoids and closed end narrow finger like structures in its cross sectional morphologies as demonstrated in fig 4a and b in addition considerable improvement was perceived from sem morphological configurations of the membranes with the addition of nano al2o3 due to the differences in the thermodynamics properties and kinetics of the dope solution in the phase inversion process the expansion of macrovoids can be observed with the assistance of incremental dosages of nano al2o3 into the ppsu dope solution furthermore macrovoids and narrow finger like morphologies become a broadened structure the expansion of the sponge like morphological structure in between the finger like morphologies were also evidenced due to increased concentrations of nanoparticle which is due to the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent 67 this can be witnessed from fig 4g and h improving the membrane morphological structure has a significant impact on membrane permeability and selectivity membrane surface morphologies and energy dispersive x ray analysis edx with a magnification of 3000 for neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 along with increased dosages of the nano al2o3 membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 were illustrated in fig

promises the incorporation of the nanoparticle on the surfaces which was witnessed in fig 5c and d from fig 5 the edx analysis also revealed the blending and presence of nano al2o3 on modified membranes surfaces alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 as shown in fig 5c1 and 5d1 respectively on the other hand neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 exhibited the absence of the aluminum oxide on the membrane

dosage of nano al2o3 nanoparticle in ca ppsu and cap ppsu membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 was illustrated in the fig 6 from fig 6a for the neat membrane alca 0 the peak 3324 85 cm 1 ascribed to oh hydroxyl group and 2833 95 cm 1 2932 67 cm 1 ascribed to ch2 group respectively the peak 1584 95 1654 82 cm 1 ascribed to co carbonyl group and 1481 85 cm 1 ocor functional group respectively peaks 869 54 cm 1 and 1233 99 cm 1 were attributed to co and ch functional groups respectively 7 33 from fig 6b neat alcap 0 membrane a broad peak observed at 3358 93 cm 1 assigned to oh group and 2834 85 cm 1 2936 95 cm 1 was because of the ch2 stretching group of methylene ch group respectively the peak at 1739 45 cm 1 was due to co carbonyl functional group which was absent in alca 0 neat membrane the peak 1236 50 cm 1 was assigned to cyclic ether group co of cellulose acetate phthalate 1035 85 cm 1 1104 85 cm 1 attributed to coc stretching vibrations respectively peaks 867 85 cm 1 and 1600 95 cm 1 were assigned to ch and cc groups of vinyl aromatic conjugated ring 32 however for alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 membranes there is a shift was perceived in the ftir spectra for ch2 co and coc functional sites because of the presence of the hydrogen bonding in between nano al2o3 and cellulose acetate constitutes as such for alca 1 5 membrane fig 6c the peak 3400 cm 1 3300 cm 1 attributed to hydroxyl group oh 1487 cm 1 and 1236 cm 1 attributed to cc bond stretching and co stretching vibration respectively peaks 1039 01 cm 1 and 1647 cm 1 corresponds to oso symmetry and carbonyl stretching group 1036 cm 1 1000 cm 1 attributed to complex vibration of alo group respectively the peak 1577 cm 1 assigned to benzene stretching group peaks at 790 02 cm 1 1039 50 cm 1 vibration stretching and symmetric bending of aloal bond respectively peaks observed at 2350 cm 1 and 2959 cm 1 were attributed to ch stretching vibration of the methyl group and asymmetric vibration stretching respectively 68 similarly in case of alcap 1 5 fig 6d membrane the peak at 3100 cm 1 3400 cm 1 correspond to hydroxyl group oh peak at 1483 cm 1 and 1236 50 cm 1 assigned to cc stretching and co stretching vibration respectively peaks 1038 16 cm 1 and 1647 82 cm 1 attributed to oso and oco carbonyl stretching groups respectively the peak observed at 1582 82 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of benzene peak at 1038 36 cm 1 to 1000 83 cm 1 assigned to complex vibration of alo peak at 780 12 1038 85 cm 1 corresponds to stretching and the symmetric bending of the aloal respectively the peak at 2381 68 cm 1 and 2951 20 cm 1 was due to methyl group ch stretching vibration and ch2 stretching asymmetric vibration respectively 32 68 3 5 thermogravimetric study of the as prepared hollow fiber membranes fabricated neat and nano al2o3 incorporated ca ppsu and cap ppsu membrane s thermal properties and weight loss of each membrane were demonstrated in fig 7 the thermal degradation behavior can be explained in three different stages for each membrane from tga graph it is clear that the better thermal stability of the nano al2o3 contained membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 than the neat alca 0 and alcap 0 fabricated membranes in the case of neat membranes initial thermal degradation begins at room temperature to 132 73 c for alca 0 membrane and alcap 0 membrane the initial thermal degradation is because of the volatilization of moisture content on surfaces of membranes the second phase of the temperature degradation was from 135 24 c to 368 51 c for alca 0 membrane and membrane alcap 0 was found to be 139 5 c to 293 84 c respectively this phase of thermal decomposition is for the degradation of the sulphur group from ppsu and hydrophilic groups from cellulose acetate polymers 7 56 the last step of the thermal degradation is because of disruption of all polymer content and finally ash in the temperature range of 464 85 c 685 45 c for the alca 0 membrane the final stage of the thermal decomposition for membrane alcap 0 was from 505 02 c 706 06 c respectively 7 44 similarly the modified membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 the initial thermal decomposition starts from 32 09 c 114 39 c and 29 01 c 115 69 c respectively for the removal of volatile matter which was present on the surface of the nano al2o3 contained membranes the second stage of decomposition started from 129 34 c 276 42 c for alca 1 5 and for the membrane alcap 1 5 was from 130 64 c 285 07 c is because of the decomposition of the polymers incorporated on the membrane surfaces the last stage of the thermal degradation starts from 467 02 c 691 41 c and 475 02 c 715 30 c for alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 respectively at this temperature membranes underwent degradation and resulted in ash from the figure increased concentrations of the nanoparticle nano al2o3 to neat membranes intern cause improved decomposition temperature and reduced weight loss from the modified membranes it was noted that the alcap 1 5 exhibited slightly increased weight loss as compared to the alca 1 5 because of the high surface area to volume ratio and increased porosity also the degradation of the phthalic anhydride was considerable from the alcap 1 5 membrane 44 however nano al2o3 incorporated membranes exhibited improved thermal stability as compared to neat polymeric membranes due to better thermal miscibility of used cellulose acetate derivatives and enhanced concentrations of nano al2o3 in ppsu dope solution 63 3 6 atomic force microscopy study of prepared hollow fiber membranes the three dimensional topographical afm pictures of as prepared hollow fiber membranes were illustrated in fig 8 a to h in general surface roughness parameter ra was assessed for determining the surface roughness of the as prepared hollow fiber membrane 33 from table 3 the roughness parameter ra for neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 was 8 6 nm and 18 3 nm respectively the enhanced surface roughness properties with the improved concentrations of nano al2o3 0 6 wt 1 wt and 1 5 wt into the neat polymeric dope solution for membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 were 32 5 nm and 43 9 nm respectively the enhanced ra value indicated an improved surface pore on the membrane surfaces 7 this intern facilitates reduced fouling behavior and improved hydrophilicity also the root mean square z data related to roughness rq peak difference of few maximum peaks and minimum peaks rz parameters are also increased with the intensified concentrations of nano al2o3 moreover the bright side and darkest part related to the membrane surfaces indicated the occurrence of small amount of nanoparticle segregation and distribution of tiny porous structures on the membranes surfaces 69 as such high concentrated 1 5 wt in ppsu ca and ppsu cap membranes demonstrated an increased amount of peaks bright surface as the highest percentage of nano al2o3 was present in the respective dope solution which confirmed the enhancement of the surface roughness of the membrane previous investigations proved that the rough membrane surfaces enhanced the total effective surface area thereby increasing water permeability 70 the increased porosity confirmed enhancement in water contact angle and pure water permeability as evidenced from fig 13 fig 12 and fig 14 respectively 3 7 surface charge analysis of the fabricated membrane the assessment of membrane surface charge of the good performed alca 1 5 membrane s zeta potential parameter on the y axis and ph on the x axis were illustrated in fig 9 the alca 1 5 membrane was positively charged at ph 1 05 which was 7 45 mv at different ph of 3 10 5 2 7 3 9 1 and 10 1 the negative zeta potential was recorded as 18 1 mv 30 2 mv 40 3 mv 49 5 mv and 53 6 mv respectively the amplified negative surface charge was due to the accumulation of the hydroxyl oh carboxyl co2h group and deprotonation of the used cellulose acetate hydrophilic functional sites on the membrane surfaces 32 the amplified negative charged membrane surface tends to increase the repulsion of negatively charged arsenate oxide aso4 3 the membrane s negative surface charge helps in the development of the surface area on the membrane which tends to improve of hydrophilicity and pure water permeability 71 also a considerable isoelectric point iep was reported at ph 1 39 at this ph the membrane surface doesn t exhibited any surface charge i e the surface charge parameter was zero 3 8 xps analysis of fabricated membrane the good performed alca 1 5 hollow fiber membrane s x ray photoelectron broad and narrow spectrum were illustrated in fig 10 the 283 9 ev 530 5 ev and 166 4 ev binding energies confirmed the existence of o1s c1s and s2p functional elements respectively fig 10b c and d revealed the deconvolution outcomes of o1s c1s and s2p the c1s binding energies of 283 6 ev 284 5 ev 286 9 ev and 289 5 ev were assigned ch cn cc co and oco bonds respectively 72 a comparatively weak peak at 282 8 ev was assigned to the presence of a carbon atom in the nano al2o3 lattice further confirming the substitution of a small amount of c4 with al4 and existence of calo bonds the o1s binding energy peaks 529 2 ev 529 8 ev 530 6 ev 531 2 ev and 531 8 ev were ascribed to co2h oco coh co and coc bonds respectively 73 the s2p binding energy peaks 165 2 ev 165 7 ev 166 5 ev and 166 7 ev assigned to sulphite so3 2 s2p 1 2 sulphone so2 c oxidized sulphur sox and s2p 3 2 the sulphate group of so4 2 respectively 74 the al2p binding energy peaks 73 0 ev 74 1 ev 75 3 ev and 75 9 ev were assigned to alo al oh 3 aloc and al2o3 respectively 75 different binding energies on the surfaces of the membrane confirmed the homogeneous blend mixture of the various additives and nanoparticle 3 9 high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of the al2o3 hr tem pictures and selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of aluminum oxide nano al2o3 were illustrated in fig 11 a c and fig 10d respectively the morphologies represented the rod like agglomerated structure of the nanopowder furthermore owing to the high surface energy of the nanoparticles particles were aggregated and finally agglomeration of the nanoparticles was witnessed in ethanol solvent the agglomeration has also been attributed to the electrostatic intermolecular attraction between the counter ions however the nanoparticle contains small nanorods with a dimensions of 20 25 nm length from fig 11d saed pattern the presence of many white rings and patches which study of particle size distribution of al2o3 nanoparticle 3 10 hydrophilic hydrophobic properties of the hollow fiber membranes the fabricated pristine and nano al2o3 containing hollow fiber membrane s hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity behavior was demonstrated in fig 12 the neat membrane with less porous structure along with hydrophobicity exhibited the higher value of contact angle for membranes alca 0 as 85 74 and alcap 0 as 82 12 respectively a considerable diminishing parameter of contact angle can be observed with the influence of incremental dosages 0 6 wt 1 wt and 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 into the pristine membrane dope solution the membrane with increased additive concentration alca 1 5 showed 70 14 and alcap 1 5 exhibited 68 47 respectively the increased hydrophilicity on the membrane s surface is because of the presence of nh2 and oh hydrophilic group as the nanoparticle migrates during the phase inversion process to the membrane surfaces 76 the migration of these nanoparticle and additives contributes to the formation of pore interconnectivity furthermore hydroxyl group in the sulphuric acid functional group has an affinity for water and develops h bond with water molecules outcomes in improved hydrophilicity and wettability of the surfaces of membranes 77 therefore the water holding capability of the membrane was increased as an affinity for water absorption was increased also hollow fiber membranes hydrophilicity was increased with the additive concentration of 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 in dope solution because of the existence of the functional groups oh ch and co on the surfaces of the membranes 32 3 11 porosity water uptake study of the prepared hollow fiber membranes the fabricated neat and nano aluminum oxide contained as prepared hollow fiber membrane s porous nature as well as water uptake results were illustrated in fig 13 it revealed that nano al2o3 blended membranes dominate over the pristine hollow fiber membranes neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 fig 13 showed 22 01 and 25 08 of porosity respectively also percentage water uptake from pristine membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 were 48 72 and 51 32 respectively the pristine membrane with less porous and hydrophobic surface revealed fewer porosities on the membrane morphological structures the enhanced porosity parameters were evidenced by incremental dosages of nanoparticle into the ca ppsu and cap ppsu dope solutions as such the membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 showed 71 28 and 76 91 porosities respectively also membranes containing increased dose exhibited the water uptake for alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 were 69 67 and 84 26 respectively the higher percentage of hydrophilic additives contributed to the thermal instability resulting in rapid demixing in the coagulation bath as a result the enhancement of porosity on the surfaces of the membranes the leaching of used additives and nanoparticle during phase inversion process helps to improve the porosity on the membrane surface 54 from fig 13 the enhanced porosity for membrane surfaces enabled better water retaining properties furthermore the membrane containing cellulose acetate phthalate revealed increased porosities as the cap itself acts as an excellent pore former 33 3 12 pure water permeability pwp of prepared hollow fiber membranes the pure water permeability of the fabricated membranes has presented in fig 14 a and b the pristine alca 0 and alcap 0 membranes showed 26 45 l m2h bar and 41 43 l m2h bar respectively membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 with more hydrophilic functional sites exhibited pwp as 88 87 l m2h bar and 102 13 l m2h bar respectively because of the hydrophobic and reduced porosity of the ppsu the decreased parameters of the pwp was observed for pristine membranes than aluminum oxide contained membranes furthermore pwp parameters were considerably improved with the incremental concentrations 0 6 1 0 and 1 5 wt of the nano al2o3 dosages along with the additive in the ppsu dope solutions due to the leaching of the additives during the membrane fabrication increased porosity was observed on the membrane surfaces 49 the water holding capability of the membranes also increases as the porosity increases on the membrane surfaces as more pores were present 54 the permeability of the hollow fiber membrane of the nano al2o3 cap ppsu is greater than that of the nano al2o3 ca ppsu and the pristine membrane because of two main reasons firstly the occurrence of the carboxylate groups on the nano al2o3 cap ppsu membrane surface the existence of a carboxylated group decreases the concentration polarization and enhances the hydrophilicity and pure water permeability of the membrane 7 secondly the additive cap acts as a superior pore former as a result enhanced pores were visible by the incremental dosage of nano al2o3 in hydrophobic ppsu dope solution this is also evidenced by the sem micrograph 3 13 antifouling analysis of prepared hollow fiber membranes antifouling performance of each of the hollow fiber membranes has shown in fig 15 in general the bsa protein deposition or adsorption on to the hollow fiber membrane surface is the predominant cause for membrane fouling fig 15a and b illustrates detailed three fouling steps from the prepared membranes the initial stage of the decline in permeability is due to the mechanical deformation attributed to the more porous structure of the surfaces of the membrane 78 due to the deposition or adsorption of the used protein molecules on the membrane surfaces there is a significant decrease in the permeability properties in the second level in this analysis the neat membrane alca 0 and alcap 0 exhibited moderately lower permeability results in three filtration stages the low permeability was due to the lesser pore size hydrophobic and more fouling nature flow of water through the nano al2o3 concentrated membranes is substantially improved as nano al2o3 concentrated have shown more hydrophilic and less fouling behavior 79 this is because of the inclusion of more hydrophilic groups co2h and oh on the membrane surface creating more affinities with water molecules which transform hydrophobic surfaces of the ppsu membrane to more hydrophilic and adsorptive hollow fiber membranes from fig 15c and d the frr parameter for neat membrane alca 0 and alcap 0 as 72 03 and 77 49 respectively the improved frr of the nano al2o3 concentrated membranes was observed from the membrane alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 as 85 09 and 89 24 respectively which further indicated that the membranes have high hydraulic cleaning and fouling resistance nevertheless the increased surface roughness on the membrane surfaces does not have negative effect on the membrane antifouling performance 80 the other remaining intensified parameters related to antifouling are r r and r t s along with reduced r ir parameter revealed better antifouling characterization from nano al2o3 modified membranes 3 14 arsenic decontamination studies of prepared hollow fiber membranes the arsenic retention in percentage from different concentrations 0 6 1 and 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 in ca ppsu and cap ppsu membranes and the neat membrane was represented in fig 16 initially for easy decontamination of arsenic h3aso4 was reduced to arsenate oxide solution aso4 3 by oxidation with water h2o which can be represented in eq 8 this is due to the reason that the presence of the uncharged ions of arsenite in water is inconvenient for the removal in the ph range of 6 to 9 furthermore through the fabricated membranes the oxidized arsenate oxide aqueous solution was allowed to flow moreover the negatively charged arsenate ions can be easily repelled from negatively charged membrane surfaces due to the electrostatic repulsion 81 the neat membranes with a less negative surface charge and less hydrophilic sites exhibited less removal of the arsenic as alca 0 removed 17 12 and alcap 0 removed 25 85 respectively the arsenic removal permeabilities for alca 0 and alcap 0 were 23 06 l m2h bar and 39 89 l m2h bar respectively as shown in fig 17 a and b the removal percentage of arsenic was gloriously improved by implementing the incremental dosages of aluminum oxide to pristine ca ppsu dope solutions modified membranes alca 1 5 removed 98 67 and alca 1 as 94 89 with arsenic retention permeabilities as 88 41 l m2h bar and 53 42 l m2h bar respectively the increased decontamination of arsenic is due to the well distribution of used nanoparticle and additives on the surface of the membrane the ppsu ca and ppsu cap possible interaction was illustrated in fig 18 a and fig 18b respectively there is a van der waals interaction along with ionic dipole interaction observed from the ppsu nano al2o3 interaction the hydrogen bonding interaction was absent in the polymers a negative charge on the membrane surface was imposed by the presence of carboxyl co2h and amine nh2 functional sites increased negative charge on the membrane surface which repelled negatively charged arsenate oxide 27 furthermore the occurrence of functional groups so3h and co2h on the membrane surface also influences the membrane negative charge 82 the improved negative charge on the membrane surface is because of deprotonation of acetate group in aqueous solution 7 in this study the percentage retention of arsenic was increased and then decreased with improved dosages of nano al2o3 in ppsu cap dope solutions as such membrane alcap 0 6 showed 21 73 and slight increase in arsenic retention of 34 02 from the membrane alcap 1 with the arsenic retention permeability as 61 35 l m2h bar and 86 71 l m2h bar for alcap 0 6 and alcap 1 respectively declined arsenic removal properties with increased 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 dosage in ppsu cap alcap 1 5 dope solution removed 25 75 with the retention permeability of 99 24 l m2h bar respectively previously we fabricated membranes with 1 wt of zro2 in ca ppsu pzca 1 and 0 6 wt of zro2 in cap ppsu pzcap 0 6 which removed 87 27 and 70 48 of arsenic with rejection permeability as 89 94 l m2h bar and 70 59 l m2h bar respectively 7 there is no impact of cumulative dosages of nano al2o3 on cap ppsu dope solution with the arsenic retention permeability the comparison of arsenic removal from used additives and polymers was illustrated in table 4 8 4 conclusions hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes containing nano aluminum oxide in polyphenylsulfone cellulose acetate derivative have been fabricated successfully tem and xrd analysis revealed a crystalline morphology of nano al2o3 finger like microvoids and micropores were expanded with the increase in the concentrations of nanoparticle nano al2o3 the doping of the various nano al2o3 concentrations improved hydrophilic parameters such as pure water permeability water absorption and porosity respectively the enhanced antifouling performance was evidenced by improved flux recovery ratio frr the increased arsenic removal performance was witnessed by enhanced electrostatic repulsion from the modified nano al2o3 membrane surfaces increased arsenic removal properties were demonstrated by nano al2o3 in ppsu ca membranes due to the concentration polarization on the membrane surfaces decreased tendency to extract arsenic was reported from increased concentrations of nano al2o3 in the ppsu cap polymeric dope solution increased arsenic removal properties were observed from alca 1 5 and alca 1 was 98 67 and 94 89 with the rejection permeabilities were 88 41 l m2h bar and 99 24 l m2h bar

13290,in the present work hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated by incorporating intensified dosages of nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 0 6 wt 1 0 wt and 1 5 wt into cellulose acetate

recent decades people migrating towards urban cities for better employment opportunities and professional lifestyles which has contributed to exceptional growth in industrial and urbanization sectors however the low quality and limited availability of pure drinking water are crucial issues across the world the water in the ecosystem is continuously contaminated because of the various effluents heavy metals and metalloids emitting from varieties of industrial resources 1 4 furthermore water is getting polluted with one of the dangerous metalloids like arsenic the existence of arsenic is because of smelting of iron ores wood preservative medium and the usage of arsenic containing pesticides are important anthropogenic sources also volcanic activities erosion of rocks minerals and forest fires are essential natural sources for arsenic contaminated drinking water 5 the consumption of toxic arsenic rich water over a long period can pose a life threatening severe health hazardous effects to millions of populations international agency for research on cancer iarc has categorized arsenic as class a poisonous and carcinogenic to mankind moreover the higher concentration of 10 μg l of arsenic in the drinking water has been restricted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 6 this intern motivated researchers and scientists to develop innovative methods and procedures that can be implemented for treating and recycling of the waste water contaminated by arsenic different methods have been employed for the treatment of arsenic contaminated water the performance of the different arsenic removal methods depends on the chemical and physical properties of arsenic 7 arsenic is typically present in an inorganic form in water based on the redox potential and ph levels arsenate as 5 and arsenite as 3 are two predominated species of arsenic in water 8 arsenite is more toxic and it s not easy to remove from water as compared to the removal of arsenate due to its high solubility in water 9 researchers across the globe have reported several techniques for the decontamination of arsenic by coagulation 10 oxidation 11 flocculation 12 phytoremediation 13 adsorption 14 20 along with membrane filtration by reverse osmosis 21 and nanofiltration 22 many of these methods have certain limitations as precipitation which can create large amount of toxic sludge thus causing severe environmental problems 23 ion exchange process is defined for the well retention of arsenic however the weak selectively for as 5 was influenced by extreme competition from some co existing anions and prohibitively discouraged the process of ion exchange 24 therefore the ultrafiltration membrane process is gaining importance in the separation of varieties of heavy metals including toxic arsenic ions ultrafiltration process is cost effective and offers high retention permeability and efficient with minimum fouling effect 25 26 in addition enhanced arsenic decontamination at pka 2 2 includes the conversion of arsenite as 3 to arsenate ions as 5 from arsenic contaminated water 27 many of the research studies demonstrated that the source water containing arsenate as 5 can be recovered as pure water in compliance with epa s permissible contaminant water quality requirement 9 28 however water containing arsenite as 3 must be treated with preoxidation procedure before passing through membranes for reducing to arsenate species as 5 moreover various oxidizing elements such as h2o chlorine and oxygen were employed to reduce or oxidize the arsenite acid h3aso3 to arsenate oxide aso4 3 29 also the electrostatic repulsion mechanism is a key process for the extraction of arsenic from arsenic polluted water generally the repulsion mechanism depends on the surface charge characteristics and membranes surface hydrophilicity 30 31 it was evident from our previous work that membranes containing different amount of zirconium oxide in ca ppsu and cap ppsu have showed reasonably very good arsenic removal performance 7 similarly in our another work hollow fiber membranes blended with different dosages of zinc magnesium oxide zno mgo as additive in ca ppsu and cap ppsu have decontaminated increased removal of arsenic without compromising arsenic retention permeability 32 the neat ppsu membrane removed 22 of arsenic with 44 01 l m2h bar retention permeability respectively 33 in the case of membrane separation processes an aqueous solution interact with membranes and an enriched permeate containing one of the aqueous compounds was extracted 34 however concentration polarization played a crucial role which causes surface fouling on the membrane surface because of elevated concentrations of arsenic species near to the surfaces of membranes concentration polarization is one of the major drawback in membrane filtration in which the rejected arsenic ions start to collect on the membrane surfaces 35 moreover the size of the arsenic compounds was less than the membrane pore size several researchers employed various polymers to modify the membrane surfaces and to bestow the performance of the membrane by improving hydrophilicity surface charge density and reducing the concentration polarization polyphenylsufone ppsu has gained attention for the membranes fabrication and for ensuring membranes properties the presence of biphenyl functional groups offers high chemical resistance and thermal stability which are major dominating features of ppsu in membrane fabrication 36 however the usage of ppsu was limited in membrane fabrication because of the brittleness increased hydrophobicity and severe fouling properties surfaces of the ppsu membranes were modified to improve the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties many researchers have incorporated several inorganic additives and nanoparticles to bestow the ppsu membrane properties and enhanced retention of various heavy metals 37 38 a flexible reliable inorganic nanomaterial nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 was used to intensify the performance of the blended membranes aluminum oxide is an impressive material to be used in the membrane preparation because of it s low cost chemically stable high abrasive and large surface area to volume ratio properties 39 recently dilshad et al 40 fabricated membranes by cross linking the incremental dosages of al2o3 along with polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyethylene glycol peg the prepared membranes exhibited improved thermal stability and hydrophilic properties with the incremental dosages of al2o3 nanoparticle maximus et al 41 prepared ultrafiltration membranes from polyethersulfone pes with an incremental dosages of al2o3 for the treatment of wastewater the prepared al2o3 contained membranes exhibited low flux decline and improved antifouling properties than neat membranes garcia et al 42 fabricated polymeric ultrafiltration membranes by polyethersulfone pes along with peg as an organic additive and al2o3 as an inorganic additive incremental additive dosages in the pes dope solution have resulted in the improved hydrophilic and antifouling properties ghaemi and daraei 43 incorporated intensified dosages of polypyrrole ppy al2o3 to enhance hydrophilic and adsorptive properties of the pes mixed matrix membrane however the neat al2o3 membranes suffer from a lack of hydrophilic and carboxylic functional groups additionally the existence of hydrophilic functional groups from cellulose acetate ca and cellulose acetate phthalate cap makes an effective additive for membrane surface modification 7 33 44 moreover cellulose acetate bio sorbents are more hydrophilic and adsorptive due to the existence of hydrophilic polar functional groups and β 1 4 glycosidic linkages 45 46 the introduction of cellulose acetate derivatives into the hydrophobic polymer matrix has been documented in several studies to improve membrane properties durthi et al 47 fabricated membranes containing cellulose acetate along with zinc oxide as an additive for the decontamination of arsenic membranes exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity water permeability and better arsenic retention properties gholami et al 48 fabricated nanocomposite nanofiltration membranes using polyvinylchloride pvc blended with cellulose acetate iron oxide nanoparticle the blended modified membranes exhibited improved hydrophilicity water uptake and pure water flux from the literature it was observed that no any research work was reported on nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 along with cellulose acetate derivatives into the ppsu for the membrane fabrication and enhanced arsenic removal from arsenic containing drinking water therefore in order to manage the stated research gap we intended to develop new efficient membranes for the purification of arsenic contaminated drinking water in present work hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated by polyphenylsulfone and cellulose acetate derivatives along with incremental dosages of nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 by non solvent induced phase separation method 49 as used nano al2o3 was examined by xrd and tem the morphologies of hollow fiber membranes were studied using sem afm tga ftir and xps the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of membranes were also scrutinized in addition hollow fiber membranes were further exposed to the extraction of arsenic from the arsenic contaminated drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials aluminum oxide nano al2o3 nanoparticle size 50 nm of mw of 101 96 g mol

membranes the phase inversion dry wet spinning method was employed as prepared dope solutions have been made to extruded through the dope solution cylinder the velocity at which the extrusion of the dope solution was regulated with the assistance of a mechanical gear pump along with nitrogen n2 gas pressure for membrane preparation the bore fluid ro water was allowed to pass on either adjacent side of the spinneret located at 3 5 cm from the coagulation bath this region was known as air gap distance and the phase inversion process has occurred on the rotating drum the continuously prepared membranes were wound membranes were then preserved for approximately 24 h in distilled water and again in a glycerol solution 10 the fabricated membranes were subsequently dried for about 48 h at room temperature additionally hollow fiber membranes were used for further characterization and testing 33 50 the complete specifications for spinning the dope solutions were reported in table 2 2 3

microstructural analysis of the nano al2o3 the joel jem 2100 plus tem apparatus was utilized the copper grid containing the sample was positioned on a sample holder and tem analysis was performed 54 2 3 10 study of hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of prepared hollow fiber membranes the hydrophilic hydrophobic interaction of the surfaces of membranes was investigated using the sessile droplet contact angle fta 200 apparatus on one side of the apparatus the high resolution camera was fixed the light beam was focused through the membrane samples a high resolution camera was used on both sides to capture bubble droplet images on the membranes surfaces 49 as a working fluid dropping fluid the de ionized di water was used an average hydrophilic parameter was recorded by tabulating three readings for each membrane sample 2 3 11 porosities and water uptake measurement of prepared hollow fiber membranes porosities of the prepared hollow fiber membranes were interpreted by dry wet weigh analysis 60 61 porosity measurement of the membrane is the notarized procedure for confirming the implementation of additives and nanoparticle in terms of enhanced porosities by intensified dosages of nanoparticle and additives into the ppsu dope solution initially fine hollow fiber membranes were procured from the fiber bundle with a size range of 2 1 2 cm2 an appropriate mixture of epoxy and hardener was used to close either ends of the hollow fiber membranes later membranes were soaked in distilled water then pressed with blotting paper the wet weight w w in g of each hollow fiber membranes was noted all wet membranes are rigorously dried for about 24 h at a temperature of 50 c in a vacuum oven subsequently the dry weight w d in g of the prepared hollow fiber membrane was noted the porosity of the fabricated membranes can be determined by eq 1 1 porosity w w w d ρ w a δ 100 where ρ w δ and a are water density g cm3 thickness of the membrane cm and surface area of the hollow fiber membrane cm2 respectively the water uptake in percentage for fabricated membranes was assessed by same dry wet weighing principle 62 the wet weight of the fabricated membranes w w in g was determined by immersing the membranes in deionized di water for about 24 h and for another 24 h membranes were permitted to dry completely in a vacuum oven at 55 c the dry weight w d in g of the membrane was also reported the increased parameters of water uptake from the nano al2o3 contained membranes are good agreement for the enhancement of hydrophilicity 63 the water uptake in percentage was determined by substituting the parameters of w w and w d in eq 2 2 water uptake w w w d w d 100 2 3 12 pure water permeability study of hollow fiber membranes the cross flow filtration set up was

ppm 0 8 g l with ph 6 8 0 2 was used and permitted to flow through each membrane samples for about 60 min the bsa permeate j p was tabulated for every 4 min further membranes were cleaned rigorously and mopped with blotting paper again hollow fiber membranes exposed to the permeability test for about 60 min and permeate were collected j w2 for every 4 min 44 the antifouling resistance parameters such as reversible fouling r r flux recovery ratio frr along with irreversible fouling r ir were evaluated by substituting the values of j w1 j w2 and j p in eqs 4 6 4 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 5 r r j w 2

retention analysis from arsenic contaminated drinking water atomic absorption spectroscopy aas perkin elmer apparatus was employed for the evaluation of the content of arsenic in the arsenic contaminated water 7 33 a 1 ppm 1 mg l of laboratory produced arsenic contaminated water solution of 6 9 0 2 has been used as a feed c f for arsenic filtration by maintaining 1 bar tmp in a cross flow filtration system the lab made arsenic solution was permitted to flow over the hollow fiber membranes permeate was collected for each membranes and noted as c p the schematic of membrane preparation and arsenic removal was illustrated in fig 1 the percentage of arsenic rejection was determined by substituting the parameters of feed and permeate in following eq 7 64 65 7 r 1 c p c f 100 where c f and c p are feed of the arsenic solution and permeate of arsenic collected from the membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray diffraction xrd study of nano al2o3 the 2θ diffraction peaks of the used nano aluminum oxide nano al2o3 were illustrated in fig 2 the nature of the crystallinity of the diffraction pattern for nano al2o3 was described in detail it was significant that the used nanoparticle was crystalline in nature with the diffraction peaks at an angle 2θ peaks at 32 55 67 44 40 07 and 46 42 existence with the reference plane of 1 0 0 1 3 1 3 2 1 and 3 2 3 respectively from the diffraction parameters there is no considerable difference in the peaks as a reference pattern 51 3 2 particle size distribution of nano al2o3 particle size distribution was studied by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analyzer which has been presented in fig 3 a and b respectively a 0 1 wt of the nano al2o3 in deionized water was dispersed homogeneously with the viscosity of 0 8859 cp by the sonication process for about 30 min the homogenous suspension was subjected to the particle size distribution in nanotrack particle size analyzer from fig 3a the histogram of the dls method the particle size interms of diameter as 199 2 nm from fig 3b the zeta potential revealed that the particles were negatively polarized along with 10 7 mv as zeta potential the charge on the particle surface was maintained as 0 00180 fcoloumb in addition the homogeneous solution was acquired by sonicating the prepared solution of about 3 h 53 3 3 scanning electron microscope sem pictures of the prepared hollow fiber membranes the prepared pristine and nano aluminum oxide incorporated membrane s cross section morphological images were represented in fig 4 the cross sectional images of all fabricated membranes showed asymmetric structure and consisted of finger like arrangement thin top layer dense middle layer sponge layer and a supportive layer the intense interaction between water and nmp was responsible for the development of a thin selective layer on the surfaces of the inner and outer layers of the hollow fiber membranes in the coagulation bath the sem morphologies of fabricated membranes are direct evidence for deciding the characteristics of the membrane i e the top layer influences the selectivity the middle layer affects productivity and the base layer or supportive layer is liable for the mechanical strength 66 the fabricated membranes without the addition of nanoparticle neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 contains many macrovoids and closed end narrow finger like structures in its cross sectional morphologies as demonstrated in fig 4a and b in addition considerable improvement was perceived from sem morphological configurations of the membranes with the addition of nano al2o3 due to the differences in the thermodynamics properties and kinetics of the dope solution in the phase inversion process the expansion of macrovoids can be observed with the assistance of incremental dosages of nano al2o3 into the ppsu dope solution furthermore macrovoids and narrow finger like morphologies become a broadened structure the expansion of the sponge like morphological structure in between the finger like morphologies were also evidenced due to increased concentrations of nanoparticle which is due to the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent 67 this can be witnessed from fig 4g and h improving the membrane morphological structure has a significant impact on membrane permeability and selectivity membrane surface morphologies and energy dispersive x ray analysis edx with a magnification of 3000 for neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 along with increased dosages of the nano al2o3 membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 were illustrated in fig 5 the neat membrane exhibited less porous and uniformly distributed membrane surfaces as shown in fig 5a and b with the intensified concentrations of nano al2o3 the porous structures were expanded and promises the incorporation of the nanoparticle on the surfaces which was witnessed in fig 5c and d from fig 5 the edx analysis also revealed the blending and presence of nano al2o3 on modified membranes surfaces alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 as shown in fig 5c1 and 5d1 respectively on the other hand neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 exhibited the absence of the aluminum oxide on the membrane surfaces as shown in fig 5a1 and 5b1 respectively 3 4 atr ftir investigation of the prepared hollow fiber membranes the atr ftir spectra of the prepared neat alca 0 and alcap 0 along with increased dosage of nano al2o3 nanoparticle in ca ppsu and cap ppsu membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 was illustrated in the fig 6 from fig 6a for the neat membrane alca 0 the peak 3324 85 cm 1 ascribed to oh hydroxyl group and 2833 95 cm 1 2932 67 cm 1 ascribed to ch2 group respectively the peak 1584 95 1654 82 cm 1 ascribed to co carbonyl group and 1481 85 cm 1 ocor functional group respectively peaks 869 54 cm 1 and 1233 99 cm 1 were attributed to co and ch functional groups respectively 7 33 from fig 6b neat alcap 0 membrane a broad peak observed at 3358 93 cm 1 assigned to oh group and 2834 85 cm 1 2936 95 cm 1 was because of the ch2 stretching group of methylene ch group respectively the peak at 1739 45 cm 1 was due to co carbonyl functional group which was absent in alca 0 neat membrane the peak 1236 50 cm 1 was assigned to cyclic ether group co of cellulose acetate phthalate 1035 85 cm 1 1104 85 cm 1 attributed to coc stretching vibrations respectively peaks 867 85 cm 1 and 1600 95 cm 1 were assigned to ch and cc groups of vinyl aromatic conjugated ring 32 however for alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 membranes there is a shift was perceived in the ftir spectra for ch2 co and coc functional sites because of the presence of the hydrogen bonding in between nano al2o3 and cellulose acetate constitutes as such for alca 1 5 membrane fig 6c the peak 3400 cm 1 3300 cm 1 attributed to hydroxyl group oh 1487 cm 1 and 1236 cm 1 attributed to cc bond stretching and co stretching vibration respectively peaks 1039 01 cm 1 and 1647 cm 1 corresponds to oso symmetry and carbonyl stretching group 1036 cm 1 1000 cm 1 attributed to complex vibration of alo group respectively the peak 1577 cm 1 assigned to benzene stretching group peaks at 790 02 cm 1 1039 50 cm 1 vibration stretching and symmetric bending of aloal bond respectively peaks observed at 2350 cm 1 and 2959 cm 1 were attributed to ch stretching vibration of the methyl group and asymmetric vibration stretching respectively 68 similarly in case of alcap 1 5 fig 6d membrane the peak at 3100 cm 1 3400 cm 1 correspond to hydroxyl group oh peak at 1483 cm 1 and 1236 50 cm 1 assigned to cc stretching and co stretching vibration respectively peaks 1038 16 cm 1 and 1647 82 cm 1 attributed to oso and oco carbonyl stretching groups respectively the peak observed at 1582 82 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of benzene peak at 1038 36 cm 1 to 1000 83 cm 1 assigned to complex vibration of alo peak at 780 12 1038 85 cm 1 corresponds to stretching and the symmetric bending of the aloal respectively the peak at 2381 68 cm 1 and 2951 20 cm 1 was due to methyl group ch stretching vibration and ch2 stretching asymmetric vibration respectively 32 68 3 5 thermogravimetric study of the as prepared hollow fiber membranes fabricated neat and nano al2o3 incorporated ca ppsu and cap ppsu membrane s thermal properties and weight loss of each membrane were demonstrated in fig 7 the thermal degradation behavior can be explained in three different stages for each membrane from tga graph it is clear that the better thermal stability of the nano al2o3 contained membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 than the neat alca 0 and alcap 0 fabricated membranes in the case of neat membranes initial thermal degradation begins at room temperature to 132 73 c for alca 0 membrane and alcap 0 membrane the initial thermal degradation is because of the volatilization of moisture content on surfaces of membranes the second phase of the temperature degradation was from 135 24 c to 368 51 c for alca 0 membrane and membrane alcap 0 was found to be 139 5 c to 293 84 c respectively this phase of thermal decomposition is for the degradation of the sulphur group from ppsu and hydrophilic groups from cellulose acetate polymers 7 56 the last step of the thermal degradation is because of disruption of all polymer content and finally ash in the temperature range of 464 85 c 685 45 c for the alca 0 membrane the final stage of the thermal decomposition for membrane alcap 0 was from 505 02 c 706 06 c respectively 7 44 similarly the modified membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 the initial thermal decomposition starts from 32 09 c 114 39 c and 29 01 c 115 69 c respectively for the removal of volatile matter which was present on the surface of the nano al2o3 contained membranes the second stage of decomposition started from 129 34 c 276 42 c for alca 1 5 and for the membrane alcap 1 5 was from 130 64 c 285 07 c is because of the decomposition of the polymers incorporated on the membrane surfaces the last stage of the thermal degradation starts from 467 02 c 691 41 c and 475 02 c 715 30 c for alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 respectively at this temperature membranes underwent degradation and resulted in ash from the figure increased concentrations of the nanoparticle nano al2o3 to neat membranes intern cause improved decomposition temperature and reduced weight loss from the modified membranes it was noted that the alcap 1 5 exhibited slightly increased weight loss as compared to the alca 1 5 because of the high surface area to volume ratio and increased porosity also the degradation of the phthalic anhydride was considerable from the alcap 1 5 membrane 44 however nano al2o3 incorporated membranes exhibited improved thermal stability as compared to neat polymeric membranes due to better thermal miscibility of used cellulose acetate derivatives and enhanced concentrations of nano al2o3 in ppsu dope solution 63 3 6 atomic force microscopy study of prepared hollow fiber membranes the three dimensional topographical afm pictures of as prepared hollow fiber membranes were illustrated in fig 8 a to h in general surface roughness parameter ra was assessed for determining the surface roughness of the as prepared hollow fiber membrane 33 from table 3 the roughness parameter ra for neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 was 8 6 nm and 18 3 nm respectively the enhanced surface roughness properties with the improved concentrations of nano al2o3 0 6 wt 1 wt and 1 5 wt into the neat polymeric dope solution for membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 were 32 5 nm and 43 9 nm respectively the enhanced ra value indicated an improved surface pore on the membrane surfaces 7 this intern facilitates reduced fouling behavior and improved hydrophilicity also the root mean square z data related to roughness rq peak difference of few maximum peaks and minimum peaks rz parameters are also increased with the intensified concentrations of nano al2o3 moreover the bright side and darkest part related to the membrane surfaces indicated the occurrence of small amount of nanoparticle segregation and distribution of tiny porous structures on the membranes surfaces 69 as such high concentrated 1 5 wt in ppsu ca and ppsu cap membranes demonstrated an increased amount of peaks bright surface as the highest percentage of nano al2o3 was present in the respective dope solution which confirmed the enhancement of the surface roughness of the membrane previous investigations proved that the rough membrane surfaces enhanced the total effective surface area thereby increasing water permeability 70 the increased porosity confirmed enhancement in water contact angle and pure water permeability as evidenced from fig 13 fig 12 and fig 14 respectively 3 7 surface charge analysis of the fabricated membrane the assessment of membrane surface charge of the good performed alca 1 5 membrane s zeta potential parameter on the y axis and ph on the x axis were illustrated in fig 9 the alca 1 5 membrane was positively charged at ph 1 05 which was 7 45 mv at different ph of 3 10 5 2 7 3 9 1 and 10 1 the negative zeta potential was recorded as 18 1 mv 30 2 mv 40 3 mv 49 5 mv and 53 6 mv respectively the amplified negative surface charge was due to the accumulation of the hydroxyl oh carboxyl co2h group and deprotonation of the used cellulose acetate hydrophilic functional sites on the membrane surfaces 32 the amplified negative charged membrane surface tends to increase the repulsion of negatively charged arsenate oxide aso4 3 the membrane s negative surface charge helps in the development of the surface area on the membrane which tends to improve of hydrophilicity and pure water permeability 71 also a considerable isoelectric point iep was reported at ph 1 39 at this ph the membrane surface doesn t exhibited any surface charge i e the surface charge parameter was zero 3 8 xps analysis of fabricated membrane the good performed alca 1 5 hollow fiber membrane s x ray photoelectron broad and narrow spectrum were illustrated in fig 10 the 283 9 ev 530 5 ev and 166 4 ev binding energies confirmed the existence of o1s c1s and s2p functional elements respectively fig 10b c and d revealed the deconvolution outcomes of o1s c1s and s2p the c1s binding energies of 283 6 ev 284 5 ev 286 9 ev and 289 5 ev were assigned ch cn cc co and oco bonds respectively 72 a comparatively weak peak at 282 8 ev was assigned to the presence of a carbon atom in the nano al2o3 lattice further confirming the substitution of a small amount of c4 with al4 and existence of calo bonds the o1s binding energy peaks 529 2 ev 529 8 ev 530 6 ev 531 2 ev and 531 8 ev were ascribed to co2h oco coh co and coc bonds respectively 73 the s2p binding energy peaks 165 2 ev 165 7 ev 166 5 ev and 166 7 ev assigned to sulphite so3 2 s2p 1 2 sulphone so2 c oxidized sulphur sox and s2p 3 2 the sulphate group of so4 2 respectively 74 the al2p binding energy peaks 73 0 ev 74 1 ev 75 3 ev and 75 9 ev were assigned to alo al oh 3 aloc and al2o3 respectively 75 different binding energies on the surfaces of the membrane confirmed the homogeneous blend mixture of the various additives and nanoparticle 3 9 high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of the al2o3 hr tem pictures and selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of aluminum oxide nano al2o3 were illustrated in fig 11 a c and fig 10d respectively the morphologies represented the rod like agglomerated structure of the nanopowder furthermore owing to the high surface energy of the nanoparticles particles were aggregated and finally agglomeration of the nanoparticles was witnessed in ethanol solvent the agglomeration has also been attributed to the electrostatic intermolecular attraction between the counter ions however the nanoparticle contains small nanorods with a dimensions of 20 25 nm length from fig 11d saed pattern the presence of many white rings and patches which study of particle size distribution of al2o3 nanoparticle 3 10 hydrophilic hydrophobic properties of the hollow fiber membranes the fabricated pristine and nano al2o3 containing hollow fiber membrane s hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity behavior was demonstrated in fig 12 the neat membrane with less porous structure along with hydrophobicity exhibited the higher value of contact angle for membranes alca 0 as 85 74 and alcap 0 as 82 12 respectively a considerable diminishing parameter of contact angle can be observed with the influence of incremental dosages 0 6 wt 1 wt and 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 into the pristine membrane dope solution the membrane with increased additive concentration alca 1 5 showed 70 14 and alcap 1 5 exhibited 68 47 respectively the increased hydrophilicity on the membrane s surface is because of the presence of nh2 and oh hydrophilic group as the nanoparticle migrates during the phase inversion process to the membrane surfaces 76 the migration of these nanoparticle and additives contributes to the formation of pore interconnectivity furthermore hydroxyl group in the sulphuric acid functional group has an affinity for water and develops h bond with water molecules outcomes in improved hydrophilicity and wettability of the surfaces of membranes 77 therefore the water holding capability of the membrane was increased as an affinity for water absorption was increased also hollow fiber membranes hydrophilicity was increased with the additive concentration of 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 in dope solution because of the existence of the functional groups oh ch and co on the surfaces of the membranes 32 3 11 porosity water uptake study of the prepared hollow fiber membranes the fabricated neat and nano aluminum oxide contained as prepared hollow fiber membrane s porous nature as well as water uptake results were illustrated in fig 13 it revealed that nano al2o3 blended membranes dominate over the pristine hollow fiber membranes neat membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 fig 13 showed 22 01 and 25 08 of porosity respectively also percentage water uptake from pristine membranes alca 0 and alcap 0 were 48 72 and 51 32 respectively the pristine membrane with less porous and hydrophobic surface revealed fewer porosities on the membrane morphological structures the enhanced porosity parameters were evidenced by incremental dosages of nanoparticle into the ca ppsu and cap ppsu dope solutions as such the membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 showed 71 28 and 76 91 porosities respectively also membranes containing increased dose exhibited the water uptake for alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 were 69 67 and 84 26 respectively the higher percentage of hydrophilic additives contributed to the thermal instability resulting in rapid demixing in the coagulation bath as a result the enhancement of porosity on the surfaces of the membranes the leaching of used additives and nanoparticle during phase inversion process helps to improve the porosity on the membrane surface 54 from fig 13 the enhanced porosity for membrane surfaces enabled better water retaining properties furthermore the membrane containing cellulose acetate phthalate revealed increased porosities as the cap itself acts as an excellent pore former 33 3 12 pure water permeability pwp of prepared hollow fiber membranes the pure water permeability of the fabricated membranes has presented in fig 14 a and b the pristine alca 0 and alcap 0 membranes showed 26 45 l m2h bar and 41 43 l m2h bar respectively membranes alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 with more hydrophilic functional sites exhibited pwp as 88 87 l m2h bar and 102 13 l m2h bar respectively because of the hydrophobic and reduced porosity of the ppsu the decreased parameters of the pwp was observed for pristine membranes than aluminum oxide contained membranes furthermore pwp parameters were considerably improved with the incremental concentrations 0 6 1 0 and 1 5 wt of the nano al2o3 dosages along with the additive in the ppsu dope solutions due to the leaching of the additives during the membrane fabrication increased porosity was observed on the membrane surfaces 49 the water holding capability of the membranes also increases as the porosity increases on the membrane surfaces as more pores were present 54 the permeability of the hollow fiber membrane of the nano al2o3 cap ppsu is greater than that of the nano al2o3 ca ppsu and the pristine membrane because of two main reasons firstly the occurrence of the carboxylate groups on the nano al2o3 cap ppsu membrane surface the existence of a carboxylated group decreases the concentration polarization and enhances the hydrophilicity and pure water permeability of the membrane 7 secondly the additive cap acts as a superior pore former as a result enhanced pores were visible by the incremental dosage of nano al2o3 in hydrophobic ppsu dope solution this is also evidenced by the sem micrograph 3 13 antifouling analysis of prepared hollow fiber membranes antifouling performance of each of the hollow fiber membranes has shown in fig 15 in general the bsa protein deposition or adsorption on to the hollow fiber membrane surface is the predominant cause for membrane fouling fig 15a and b illustrates detailed three fouling steps from the prepared membranes the initial stage of the decline in permeability is due to the mechanical deformation attributed to the more porous structure of the surfaces of the membrane 78 due to the deposition or adsorption of the used protein molecules on the membrane surfaces there is a significant decrease in the permeability properties in the second level in this analysis the neat membrane alca 0 and alcap 0 exhibited moderately lower permeability results in three filtration stages the low permeability was due to the lesser pore size hydrophobic and more fouling nature flow of water through the nano al2o3 concentrated membranes is substantially improved as nano al2o3 concentrated have shown more hydrophilic and less fouling behavior 79 this is because of the inclusion of more hydrophilic groups co2h and oh on the membrane surface creating more affinities with water molecules which transform hydrophobic surfaces of the ppsu membrane to more hydrophilic and adsorptive hollow fiber membranes from fig 15c and d the frr parameter for neat membrane alca 0 and alcap 0 as 72 03 and 77 49 respectively the improved frr of the nano al2o3 concentrated membranes was observed from the membrane alca 1 5 and alcap 1 5 as 85 09 and 89 24 respectively which further indicated that the membranes have high hydraulic cleaning and fouling resistance nevertheless the increased surface roughness on the membrane surfaces does not have negative effect on the membrane antifouling performance 80 the other remaining intensified parameters related to antifouling are r r and r t s along with reduced r ir parameter revealed better antifouling characterization from nano al2o3 modified membranes 3 14 arsenic decontamination studies of prepared hollow fiber membranes the arsenic retention in percentage from different concentrations 0 6 1 and 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 in ca ppsu and cap ppsu membranes and the neat membrane was represented in fig 16 initially for easy decontamination of arsenic h3aso4 was reduced to arsenate oxide solution aso4 3 by oxidation with water h2o which can be represented in eq 8 this is due to the reason that the presence of the uncharged ions of arsenite in water is inconvenient for the removal in the ph range of 6 to 9 furthermore through the fabricated membranes the oxidized arsenate oxide aqueous solution was allowed to flow moreover the negatively charged arsenate ions can be easily repelled from negatively charged membrane surfaces due to the electrostatic repulsion 81 the neat membranes with a less negative surface charge and less hydrophilic sites exhibited less removal of the arsenic as alca 0 removed 17 12 and alcap 0 removed 25 85 respectively the arsenic removal permeabilities for alca 0 and alcap 0 were 23 06 l m2h bar and 39 89 l m2h bar respectively as shown in fig 17 a and b the removal percentage of arsenic was gloriously improved by implementing the incremental dosages of aluminum oxide to pristine ca ppsu dope solutions modified membranes alca 1 5 removed 98 67 and alca 1 as 94 89 with arsenic retention permeabilities as 88 41 l m2h bar and 53 42 l m2h bar respectively the increased decontamination of arsenic is due to the well distribution of used nanoparticle and additives on the surface of the membrane the ppsu ca and ppsu cap possible interaction was illustrated in fig 18 a and fig 18b respectively there is a van der waals interaction along with ionic dipole interaction observed from the ppsu nano al2o3 interaction the hydrogen bonding interaction was absent in the polymers a negative charge on the membrane surface was imposed by the presence of carboxyl co2h and amine nh2 functional sites increased negative charge on the membrane surface which repelled negatively charged arsenate oxide 27 furthermore the occurrence of functional groups so3h and co2h on the membrane surface also influences the membrane negative charge 82 the improved negative charge on the membrane surface is because of deprotonation of acetate group in aqueous solution 7 in this study the percentage retention of arsenic was increased and then decreased with improved dosages of nano al2o3 in ppsu cap dope solutions as such membrane alcap 0 6 showed 21 73 and slight increase in arsenic retention of 34 02 from the membrane alcap 1 with the arsenic retention permeability as 61 35 l m2h bar and 86 71 l m2h bar for alcap 0 6 and alcap 1 respectively declined arsenic removal properties with increased 1 5 wt of nano al2o3 dosage in ppsu cap alcap 1 5 dope solution removed 25 75 with the retention permeability of 99 24 l m2h bar respectively previously we fabricated membranes with 1 wt of zro2 in ca ppsu pzca 1 and 0 6 wt of zro2 in cap ppsu pzcap 0 6 which removed 87 27 and 70 48 of arsenic with rejection permeability as 89 94 l m2h bar and 70 59 l m2h bar respectively 7 there is no impact of cumulative dosages of nano al2o3 on cap ppsu dope solution with the arsenic retention permeability the comparison of arsenic removal from used additives and polymers was illustrated in table 4 8 4 conclusions hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes containing nano aluminum oxide in polyphenylsulfone cellulose acetate derivative have been fabricated successfully tem and xrd analysis revealed a crystalline morphology of nano al2o3 finger like microvoids and micropores were expanded with the increase in the concentrations of nanoparticle nano al2o3 the doping of the various nano al2o3 concentrations improved hydrophilic parameters such as pure water permeability water absorption and porosity respectively the enhanced antifouling performance was evidenced by improved flux recovery ratio frr the increased arsenic removal performance was witnessed by enhanced electrostatic repulsion from the modified nano al2o3 membrane surfaces increased arsenic removal properties were demonstrated by nano al2o3 in ppsu ca membranes due to the concentration polarization on the membrane surfaces decreased tendency to extract arsenic was reported from increased concentrations of nano al2o3 in the ppsu cap polymeric dope solution increased arsenic removal properties were observed from alca 1 5 and alca 1 was 98 67 and 94 89 with the rejection permeabilities were 88 41 l m2h bar and 99 24 l m2h bar

tank reactor cstr the stability of the catalyst was verified during reutilization and long term tests without any iron loss from the catalyst the presence of a hydroxyl radical scavenger in solution led to a decrease in the process efficiency showing that pnp degradation and intermediates mineralization is essentially due to a radical mechanism via the hydroxyl species but the contributes of

introduction p nitrophenol pnp is widely used in several chemical industries namely in the manufacture of drugs dyes pesticides explosives and fungicides among others 1 these types of industries generate wastewaters containing this compound being crucial to treat them before discharge into water bodies for minimizing the negative effects in the environment and public health due to its high toxicity ld50 pnp 250 mg kg 2 moreover pnp is a carcinogenic and mutanogenic compound whereby has been listed as a priority pollutant by the united states environmental protection agency us epa 3 several treatment processes like biological degradation 4 5 adsorption 6 7 adsorption combined with ultrafiltration 8 and electrochemical based methods have been applied to remove degrade pnp however biological processes have disadvantages such as being inefficient specially for pollutant concentrations higher than 100 mg l that showed less pnp removal rate and low sour specific oxygen uptake rate 9 10 because pnp is toxic while others processes only promote the transfer of the pollutant from one phase to another rather than destroying it for adsorption and ultrafiltration or exhibit high operating costs for the electrochemical based methods advanced oxidation processes aops are an attractive alternative that permits to surpass the drawbacks of the above mentioned methods once they allow to effectively mineralize pnp in most cases under moderate conditions the fenton process is one of the aops that has been used for the removal of refractory toxic and or non biodegradable contaminants well known for being an inexpensive process making use of environmentally friendly reagents operating under mild conditions of pressure and temperature and not requiring sophisticated equipment 11 this aop is based on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in acid medium catalyzed by iron generating the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals ho according to eq 1 12 iron iii is

2 o co 2 the commonly employed homogeneous fenton process makes use of dissolved iron or other metal s as catalyst presenting as major drawback the generation of a metal containing sludge to avoid such issue the heterogeneous process has been addressed by several authors 13 18 wherein the metal e g iron is immobilized on a solid porous matrix there are several studies addressing the degradation of pnp by the heterogeneous fenton like processes but mostly in reactors operating in batch mode 13 19 however such reactor configuration requires a subsequent step for catalysts recovery and operates discontinuously thus for the industrial application it is advantageous to use a reactor that operates in continuous mode because effluents are constantly generated among several possibilities the following can be used to apply the heterogeneous fenton process running in a continuous mode the packed bed reactor pbr the fluidized bed reactor fbr and the continuous stirred tank reactor cstr 20 the pbr presents mass transfer limitations associated with the formation of gas bubbles co2 and or o2 that are accumulated over the catalyst bed 21 which limits the transfer of pollutants and oxidant to the catalyst surface on the other hand in the fbr one has to avoid that the catalyst is dragged out of the reactor by the liquid stream so the cstr is a promising configuration for implementing the continuous treatment of effluents by the heterogeneous fenton process once this reactor permits to avoid the disadvantages of the pbr and fbr while also providing good temperature control which is crucial for exothermic reactions like fenton s oxidation of heavily polluted effluents still cstrs are easy to clean present low operation costs and simplicity of construction and operation 20 22 however up to the authors knowledge very few studies employed this continuous system for heterogeneous fenton oxidation 23 27 and none has applied it to the abatement of pnp still the utilization of this reactor configuration is crucial for an industrial application regarding the continuous treatment of pnp containing wastewater in a previous study the degradation and mineralization of pnp were evaluated by wet peroxidation and heterogeneous fenton in a batch reactor 16 finding that the surface chemistry of carbon materials used as catalyst support plays an important role in process performance the catalytic process is impaired by the presence of oxygenated groups but is enhanced by the presence of n containing groups on the carbon surface since these groups increase the π electronic density leading to an improved interaction between the pollutant and the carbon surface it was found that the efficiency of the catalytic process increases with the nitrogen content on the surface of the material and also benefits from the impregnation with iron 16 thus iron supported on a n doped activated carbon fe acm was selected as catalyst in the present work to evaluate the treatment of a pnp containing effluent by the heterogeneous fenton process in a cstr moreover in the above mentioned previous work 16 a parametric study was carried out to find the best operation conditions thus in the present work temperature and ph were fixed at 50 c and 3 respectively corresponding to the best values found in batch mode in this study the stability of the catalyst the oxidation mechanism as well as the effect of the main operating conditions were evaluated in order to maximize the process performance in continuous mode cstr additionally the identification and quantification of the intermediate compounds that remain in the treated effluent their toxicity and biodegradability were also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 catalyst preparation and characterization in this study a commercial activated carbon ac granular norit gac 1240 plus with at least 90 of the particles 80 mesh iron content 0 01 wt and a specific surface area of 824 10 m2 g 1 16 was used as support material for the preparation of the iron based catalyst firstly the ac was sieved to obtain particles with a size between 0 7 and 2 0 mm before impregnation with iron the activated carbon was doped with nitrogen which permits obtaining quaternary nitrogen n c and pyrrole n 5 and pyridinic n 6 structures on the surface 28 for that 0 6 g of ac was added to 50 ml of 1 mol l of melamine 98 wt from sigma aldrich solution and mixed for 24 h at room temperature then the sample herein called acm was filteted washed with distilled water and dried at 110 c overnight finally acm was submitted to a heat treatment at 600 c during 1 h under nitrogen flow then the impregnation was performed under ultrasonic mixing and vacuum conditions using the incipient impregnation method with a solution of iron iii nitrate monohydrate 98 wt from sigma aldrich to obtain a content of 2 wt of iron then the catalyst was dried overnight at 110 c and finally heat treated at 400 c under nitrogen flow during 1 h following by a reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere for 3 h the catalyst was characterized by several techniques in order to determine its specific surface area sbet and pore volume vp ph at the point of zero charge phpzc nitrogen content and mass variation as a function of temperature textural and crystallographic properties were also determined by transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray diffraction xrd the n2 adsorption isotherms at 196 c were used to calculate sbet and vp through the brunauer emmett teller bet equation and from the amount adsorbed at p p0 0 95 respectively for this purpose 0 1 g of catalyst was outgassed at 150 c for 3 h under vacuum in a quantachrome nova 4200e apparatus the phpzc was determined by mixing 0 05 g of catalyst with 25 ml of 0 01 m nacl 99 5 wt from scharlau with the ph previously adjusted between 2 and 12 using 0 01 m hcl 37 from chemlab or naoh 98 5 wt acros organics the final ph was measured after 24 h of agitation the phpzc value corresponds to the point where the curve phfinal vs phinitial crosses the line phinitial phfinal the nitrogen content in the catalysts was measured by elementary analysis using a carlo erba ea 1108 elemental analyser the mass variation as a function of temperature was measured by a thermogravimetric analysis tg carried out under helium with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 from 50 to 900 c in a sta 409 pc 4 h luxx netzsch thermal analyser the tem analysis was carried out in an electron microscope jeol jem 1400 zeiss model em 10c equipped with a sc1000 orius ccd camera operated at 80 kv the sample was dispersed in ethanol before analysis the xrd analysis was performed over a range of 2θ 20 80 on a panalytical x pert mpd x ray diffractometer using cu kα radiation with λ 0 15406 nm further details about the characterization techniques are described elsewhere 16 2 2 heterogeneous fenton procedure the ph and temperature employed to perform the fenton process 50 c and 3 0 respectively were fixed at the best values found in a preliminary study in a reactor operating in batch mode with the same catalyst 16 the fenton process was carried out in an acrylic jacketed continuous stirred tank reactor with a capacity of 920 ml connect to a thermostatic bath huber polystat cc1 for maintaining the temperature constant at 50 c during the reaction the reactor was fed with a pnp solution 500 mg l being this concentration selected because it is representative of several real effluents 29 30 with the ph adjusted to 3 0 with 1 m sulphuric acid 97 98 from vwr chemicals the amount of catalyst employed is submerged into the reactor retained on a porous support with an opening diameter of 0 8 mm which prevents the loss of catalyst for the liquid by using a peristaltic pump gilson miniplus 2 both the pnp and a hydrogen peroxide solution 30 w v from vwr chemicals also with ph adjusted to 3 0 are simultaneously fed to the reactor both solutions are kept in a thermostatized vessel at the same temperature as the reactor jacket the dilution effect factor of two caused by the junction of the two streams at the reactor inlet was taken into account in the calculations during the runs stirring was ensured using a magnetic stir bar 200 rpm and a stir plate vwr model vs c7 periodically samples of treated effluent reactor outlet stream were taken to measure the concentration of pnp toc hydrogen peroxide and iron which eventually leached out from the catalyst support the latter after being filteted with a nitrate cellulose membrane with a porosity of 0 45 μm the concentration of pnp and toc was measured after stopping the homogenous reaction in the sampling flasks by increasing the ph to 10 with 3 m naoh and then neutralizing with 1 m h2so4 or adding an excess of sodium sulphite 98 wt alfa aesar respectively both methods are well known to quickly decompose any remaining hydrogen peroxide 31 32 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of p nitrophenol 4 nitrocatechol hydroquinone and benzoquinone were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc hitachi labcrom elite in an apparatus equipped with a uv dad detector an isocratic method was employed which used a flow rate of 0 75 ml min of eluent 90 distilled water and 10 methanol the latter with a purity 99 8 hipersolv chromanorm from vwr chemicals a volume of 20 μl was injected the separation of the compounds occurring in a purospher star rp 18 column 5 μm 250 4 0 mm heated up to 35 c with detection at a wavelength of 285 nm the concentration of carboxyl acids oxalic pyruvic and maleic was determined in the same hplc using h2so4 2 5 m as eluent with a flow rate of 0 17 ml min an injection sample volume of 15 μl the separation of compounds being now carried out in a rezex roa organic acid h 8 250 4 6 mm column at 25 c with detection at a wavelength of 210 nm the total organic carbon toc was determined according to method 5310 d 33 shortly the combustion of the organic matter occurred at 720 c and the carbon dioxide formed was quantified in an infrared detector for this purpose a shimadzu toc l apparatus with an autosampler was used the hydrogen peroxide was measured by the colorimetric method as proposed by sellers 34 the intensity of the yellow orange color of the complex formed from the reaction between h2o2 and potassium titanium oxalate in acid medium was measured by absorbance at 400 nm in a thermo electron corporation model helios γ spectrophotometer the iron leached from the catalyst was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry aas according to method 3111 b 33 using an aas spectrophotometer from unicam model 939 959 the biological oxygen demand bod was measured according to method 5210 d 33 this method is based on measuring the oxygen consumption by microorganisms for degrading the organic matter susceptible to biological degradation during 5 days at 20 c for this purpose an oxitop velp scientifica apparatus was used the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by measuring the absorbance in a nanocolor 500d photometer from macherey nagel at 620 nm which corresponds to the reduction of chromium vi to iii when the organic and inorganic suitable to chemical oxidation compounds are oxidized after digestion at 150 c for 2 h under closed reflux nanocolor vario 4 from macherey nagel method 5220 d 33 the toxicity of the effluents was evaluated by inhibition of vibrio fischeri according to standard din en iso 11348 3 35 in this determination the bacteria are put in contact with samples at 15 c and the bioluminescence emitted by the bacteria is measured after 5 15 and 30 min in a microtox model 500 from modern water apparatus all analytical determinations were performed in duplicate and the coefficients of variation were 2 for pnp toc cod and oxalic acid concentration and 5 for bod and inhibition of vibrio fischeri 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of the catalyst in this study the fe acm catalyst was selected based on a previous work 16 it has a specific surface area s bet of 814 10 m2 g 1 a phpzc of 7 5 table 1 and a nitrogen content of 3 44 wt the tem technique was used to evaluate the dispersion of iron on the catalyst surface tem photos fig 1 clearly show a good iron dispersion with sizes in the range of 87 36 nm to guarantee the application of the heterogeneous fenton process at the industrial level the catalyst must present a long term stability for this purpose the stability of the fe acm material was evaluated reusing the catalyst in five consecutive runs which were carried out under the same operating conditions ph 3 t 50 c h2o2 feed 1 0 g l lhsv 20 min 1 and τ 30 min results obtained are shown in fig 2 it was observed that both pnp degradation and organics mineralization toc removal as well as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide present the same profiles along the five reutilizations see fig 2a and b it is noteworthy that in each cycle the reactor had a pnp solution with the same concentration as the feed one without any oxidant so the removals of pnp and toc were null for the initial instant and the consumption of h2o2 is total after such reactor start up the high pnp and toc removals obtained in the initial instants and the decrease in the subsequent reaction times up to reaching steady state is due to the adsorption of pnp and the intermediate compounds on the catalyst which becomes saturated after a while after reaching steady state removals of 44 and 35 for pnp and toc respectively were obtained while the consumption of h2o2 was above 34 the variations of such data among the 5 runs were 0 2 moreover the iron content in the solution was below the detection limit i e 0 28 mg l for all experiments which indicates that the catalyst is stable the catalytic stability of fe acm was corroborated during the long term experiment performed the fenton reaction was carried out continuously for 7200 min 120 h being found that the pnp degradation mineralization and consumption of h2o2 were constant along the time on stream average values of 44 35 and 35 respectively after the initial period of ca 150 min to reach steady state see fig 3a and b furthermore the iron leached from the catalyst was also below the detection limit it is also worth noting that the fenton s performance was equal to that reached in each reutilization experiment fig 2 moreover the characterization of the catalyst after 120 h of use shows that its phpzc is not altered with the catalytic process see table 1 the xrd analysis see fig 4 reveals no significant changes between fresh and used catalysts and the iron particles size practically did not change with the fenton process 87 36 and 91 43 nm for fresh and used catalyst respectively fig 1 though there are changes in the surface area table 1 actually there is a decrease of s bet from 814 to 523 m2 g 1 which may result from the deposition of some intermediates reaction by products the same tendency was observed by duarte et al 36 when oxidizing the orange ii dye by the heterogeneous fenton process using iron impregnated on activated carbon as catalyst actually tg analysis reveals the deposition of some organic compounds that start to be released at 300 c while the original catalyst only starts to show weight loss at 450 c see fig 5 however for temperatures above 600 c the weight loss was lower for the used catalyst than for the fresh one whose difference may be associated with the prevention of the release of volatile compounds present on the catalyst surface by the intermediates reaction by products that were adsorbed therein 3 2 hydroxyl radical quenching in order to assess the importance of the hydroxyl radicals in the efficiency of the heterogeneous fenton process a new experiment was carried out wherein dimethyl sulfoxide dmso a scavenger of this radical was added to the pnp solution fed to the reactor the concentration of dmso at the entrance of the cstr was determined taking into account the dmso h2o2 molar ratio of 10 1 proposed by other authors 37 fig 6 shows the results obtained in steady state without and with the presence of the scavenger it can be seen that in the presence of dmso there is a decay of pnp and toc removals both reaching ca half the values without the scavenger with a similar consumption of h2o2 in both runs 33 34 the reduction in the efficiency of the oxidative process is due to the decreasing amount of hydroxyl radicals available to oxidize the pnp and the intermediates since the radicals are mostly reacting with dmso thus as expected the generation of hydroxyl radicals occurs during the fenton process catalyzed by fe acm however during the oxidative process other radicals are generated such as the hydroperoxyl ho2 formed in the regeneration of iron eq 2 and or as a results of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the oxidized carbon surface active sites ac eq 6 38 and superoxide o2 produced through the decomposition of the hydroperoxyl radical according to eq 7 39 these two radicals despite having a lower oxidation potential than the hydroxyl one contribute to the degradation and mineralization of pnp all these radicals are responsible for the oxidation of pnp and the intermediate compounds formed but the contribution of hydrogen peroxide alone as demonstrated in the following section cannot be disregarded 6 ac h 2 o 2 ac ho 2 h 7 ho 2 o 2 h it is worth stressing that the presence of dmso in solution did not affect the iron leaching from the catalyst in fact the concentration of iron in the cstr outlet effluent was below the detection limit as happened in the run that took place without the presence of the scavenger 3 3 parametric study for the heterogeneous fenton process parametric study carried out in the cstr the variables considered were the liquid hourly space velocity lhsv q v cat 40 being q the total feed flow rate and v cat the volume of catalyst which was calculated by the ratio between the mass of catalyst used and its density 958 g l the residence time τ v q where v is the reactor volume and the dose of oxidant fed to the reactor h2o2 feed the ph and temperature were fixed in best conditions found 3 0 and 50 c respectively in a previous study which applied the heterogeneous fenton catalyzed by the same catalysts to degrade pnp in batch mode 16 the subsequent sections present the results gathered and the discussion of their influence 3 3 1 effect of the liquid hourly space velocity the influence of the lhsv was evaluated in the range from 6 25 to 20 min 1 the minimum value was defined by physical limitations of the set up while fixing the other operating conditions results obtained at steady state are shown in fig 7 as expected the removal of pnp and organics mineralization decreased with the increase of lhsv this is related to the decrease in the volume of catalyst in the reactor for the same flow rate leading to the production of a less amount of hydroxyl radicals consequently worsening the process efficiency this is corroborated by the increase in the concentration of oxidant in the reactor outlet stream for higher lhsv values indicating that there is a higher consumption of h2o2 for the run performed with the smallest liquid hourly space velocity lhsv 6 25 min 1 removals of 75 and 53 for pnp and toc respectively with a consumption of h2o2 of 51 were reached in steady state for such lhsv again the amount of iron present in the reactor outlet stream during the reaction was 0 28 mg l for all lhsv values tested 3 3 2 influence of the residence time the effect of the residence time τ which is the ratio between the volume of solution in the reactor and the feed flow rate was evaluated in the range 30 to 120 min for this purpose the feed flow ratio was varied once the reactor volume is fixed while also changing the mass of catalyst in order to maintain unchanged the lhsv in 6 25 min 1 the results obtained are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that an increase in the residence time benefits the heterogeneous fenton process in terms of target pollutant oxidation fig 8a and organics mineralization fig 8b as well as in what concerns the consumption of oxidant fig 8c iron leaching from the catalyst was again negligible for all the residence times studied iron content in the outlet stream was always below the detection limit for the highest residence time 120 min removals of 93 and 76 for pnp and toc respectively with 65 of oxidant consumption were reached at steady state the results obtained indicate that other phenomena apart from the heterogeneous fenton oxidation must be also occurring which allows anticipating the possible contribution of homogeneous reactions as observed in previous studies reported in literature 41 42 queirós et al 25 and esteves et al 23 associated the influence of the residence time to the homogeneous fenton reaction due to iron leaching however in this study there was no detectable loss of iron from the catalysts whereby it cannot be the reason therefore it is envisaged that the degradation of the pollutant and of the intermediate compounds for higher τ values can be due to the hydrogen peroxide alone this fact was confirmed in the runs where only the oxidant was used i e without the fe acm catalyst in which the same trend observed for the heterogeneous fenton s oxidation in what concerns pnp and toc removals and h2o2 consumption was also noticed see fig 8 however the pnp and toc removals were much lower in the runs with h2o2 only compared to the heterogeneous fenton process this is due to the lower oxidation potential 1 78 v 43 of hydrogen peroxide when compared with hydroxyl radicals 2 8 v 43 generated through the fenton reaction subsequent runs were carried out with a residence time of 120 min once it permits to reach a higher removal of pnp and better mineralization 3 3 3 effect of the h2o2 dose in the cstr feed the operating cost of the treatment process is a relevant factor in its implementation so understanding the effect of the oxidant dose in the parametric study aiming to minimize its dose while having high performances is crucial since hydrogen peroxide was found in the reactor outlet stream even for the highest contact and residence time values employed a new series of experiments was carried out using an inlet concentration of oxidant in the range of 0 5 to 1 0 g l the results obtained are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the pnp and toc removals increase with the increase of oxidant dose up to 0 75 g l and a plateau for the pnp removal or a decrease in the case of mineralization was observed for the maximum concentration tested of 1 0 g l such behavior was reported in several previous studies that applied the heterogeneous fenton process to treat a variety of target pollutants or complex effluents in batch reactors but also to treat orange ii dye 25 or a textile dyeing effluent 23 using iron containing zeolite or activated carbon respectively as catalyst in a cstr this fact is explained by the occurrence of the undesirable scavenging reaction of the hydroxyl radical by the excess of h2o2 eq 8 12 on the one hand such reactions lead to a reduction in the amount of hydroxyl radicals available to degrade both the pnp and the intermediate compounds on the other hand the radical formed ho2 has an oxidation potential that is lower than the hydroxyl radical one which explains the decrease in performance this aspect is corroborated by observing the higher consumption of the oxidant 65 for the run wherein the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the feed was 1 0 g l fig 9 which does not translate into an increase in the process efficiency consequently the parallel reaction is taking place 8 h 2 o 2 ho ho 2 h 2 o concerning the iron leached from fe acm again no concentration of this metal in the outlet effluent was detected i e it was lower than 0 28 mg l during the reactions 3 4 effluent biodegradability toxicity and intermediate compounds identification under the best operating conditions employed ph 3 0 t 50 c h2o2 feed 0 75 g l τ 120 min and lhsv 6 25 min 1 high efficiency of the fenton process catalyzed with the fe acm material was achieved in the cstr with a removal of pnp toc and cod of 94 83 and 86 respectively after reaching steady state see table 2 the treated effluent is non toxic since the inhibition of vibrio fischeri decays from 54 60 to 0 after 5 30 min of contact between v fischeri bacteria and the sample and is more biodegradable since the bod and the bod cod ratio increased from 1 mgo2 l and 0 001 to 48 mgo2 l and 0 41 respectively table 2 once more no iron was detected in solution the performance of the heterogeneous process obtained in the cstr for degrading pnp 94 is similar or greater than the one reached in other studies that used batch reactors in the range 60 98 13 15 19 combining a lower consumption of oxidant which allows a reduction in the treatment cost therefore the application of this treatment process in this reactor configuration is economically advantageous and suitable to be applied continuously taking into account that the mineralization was not complete the intermediate compounds such as 4 nitrocatechol hydroquinone benzoquinone maleic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid and acetic acid 44 45 that are commonly formed through oxidation of pnp by the fenton process and that could remain in solution contributing to the remaining toc were identified and quantified in fig 10 it is possible to observe that the concentration of oxalic acid only intermediate compound found increased quickly in the first 30 min of reaction which corresponds to the period wherein more pnp is removed the concentration of oxalic acid continues to increase up to 120 min of reaction reaching steady state at ca 300 360 min the non identification of the remaining intermediate compounds apart from oxalic acid is due to the fact that those species of higher molecular weight are easily oxidized to carboxylic acids oxalic acid is difficult to oxidize so it remains in solution in addition to oxalic acid pnp also remains in solution though with a low concentration being that the contribution of these two compounds to the measured toc is over 98 see table 3 4 conclusions the present study focuses on the utilization of a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to degrade pnp through the heterogeneous fenton s reagent using fe acm as catalyst the stability and reutilization of the catalyst were proven still no leaching of iron from the support to the solution was detected which is an important issue for industrial application the reduction of the fenton s process efficiency in the presence of a hydroxyl radical scavenger dmso allows us to conclude that the oxidation of both pnp and intermediate compounds is due mainly to the formation of radicals however the contribution of hydrogen peroxide per se should not be neglected the effect of some operating parameters such as lhsv residence time and concentration of oxidant feed to the reactor was evaluated under the best conditions tested outstanding results have been reached at steady state 94 and 83 for pnp and toc removal respectively and a non toxic and more biodegradable effluent was generated the only organic compounds present in the treated effluent are pnp and oxalic acid which contribute 98 for the remaining toc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13291,the degradation of a model compound p nitrophenol pnp was evaluated by a heterogeneous fenton process using iron supported on n doped activated carbon fe acm as catalyst in a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the stability of the catalyst was verified during reutilization and long term tests without any iron loss from the catalyst the presence of a hydroxyl radical scavenger in solution led to a decrease in the process efficiency showing that pnp degradation and intermediates mineralization is essentially due to a radical mechanism via the hydroxyl species but the contributes of hydrogen peroxide and other radicals should be taken into account the effect of some relevant operating conditions of the heterogeneous fenton process namely the liquid hourly space velocity lhsv the

introduction p nitrophenol pnp is widely used in several chemical industries namely in the manufacture of drugs dyes pesticides explosives and fungicides among others 1 these types of industries generate wastewaters containing this compound being crucial to treat them before discharge into water bodies for minimizing the negative effects in the environment and public health due to its high toxicity ld50 pnp 250 mg kg 2 moreover pnp is a carcinogenic and mutanogenic compound whereby has been listed as a priority pollutant by the united states environmental protection agency us epa 3 several treatment processes like biological degradation 4 5 adsorption 6 7 adsorption combined with ultrafiltration 8 and electrochemical based methods have been applied to remove degrade pnp however biological processes have disadvantages such as being inefficient specially for pollutant concentrations higher than 100 mg l that showed less pnp removal rate and low sour specific oxygen uptake rate 9 10 because pnp is toxic while others processes only promote the transfer of the pollutant from one phase to another rather than destroying it for adsorption and ultrafiltration or exhibit high operating costs for the electrochemical based methods advanced oxidation processes aops are an attractive alternative that permits to surpass the drawbacks of the above mentioned methods once they allow to effectively mineralize pnp in most cases under moderate conditions the fenton process is one of the aops that has been used for the removal of refractory toxic and or non biodegradable contaminants well known for being an inexpensive process making use of environmentally friendly reagents operating under mild conditions of pressure and temperature and not requiring sophisticated

of pnp by the heterogeneous fenton like processes but mostly in reactors operating in batch mode 13 19 however such reactor configuration requires a subsequent step for catalysts recovery and operates discontinuously thus for the industrial application it is advantageous to use a reactor that operates in continuous mode because effluents are constantly generated among several possibilities the following can be used to apply the heterogeneous fenton process running in a continuous mode the packed bed reactor pbr the fluidized bed reactor fbr and the continuous stirred tank reactor cstr 20 the pbr presents mass transfer limitations associated with the formation of gas bubbles co2 and or o2 that are accumulated over the catalyst bed 21 which limits the transfer of pollutants and oxidant

crucial for exothermic reactions like fenton s oxidation of heavily polluted effluents still cstrs are easy to clean present low operation costs and simplicity of construction and operation 20 22 however up to the authors knowledge very few studies employed this continuous system for heterogeneous fenton oxidation 23 27 and none has applied it to the abatement of pnp still the utilization of this reactor configuration is crucial for an industrial application regarding the continuous treatment of pnp containing wastewater in a previous study the degradation and mineralization of pnp were evaluated by wet peroxidation and heterogeneous fenton in a batch reactor 16 finding that the surface chemistry of carbon materials used as catalyst support plays an important role in process performance the catalytic process is impaired by the presence of oxygenated groups but is enhanced by the presence of n containing groups on the carbon surface since these groups increase the π electronic density leading to an improved interaction between the pollutant and the carbon surface it was found that the efficiency of the catalytic process increases with the nitrogen content on the

treatment of a pnp containing effluent by the heterogeneous fenton process in a cstr moreover in the above mentioned previous work 16 a parametric study was carried out to find the best operation conditions thus in the present work temperature and ph were fixed at 50 c and 3 respectively corresponding to the best values found in batch mode in this study the stability of the catalyst the oxidation mechanism as well as the effect of the main operating conditions were evaluated in order to maximize the process performance in continuous mode cstr additionally the identification and quantification of the intermediate compounds that remain in the treated effluent their toxicity and biodegradability were also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 catalyst preparation and

activated carbon was doped with nitrogen which permits obtaining quaternary nitrogen n c and pyrrole n 5 and pyridinic n 6 structures on the surface 28 for that 0 6 g of ac was added to 50 ml of 1 mol l of melamine 98 wt from sigma aldrich solution and mixed for 24 h at room temperature then the sample herein called acm was filteted washed with distilled water and dried at 110 c overnight finally acm was submitted to a heat treatment at 600 c during 1 h under nitrogen flow then the impregnation was performed under ultrasonic mixing and vacuum conditions using the incipient impregnation method with a solution of iron iii nitrate monohydrate 98 wt from sigma aldrich to obtain a content of 2 wt of iron then the catalyst was dried overnight at 110 c and finally heat treated at 400 c under nitrogen flow during 1 h following by a reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere for 3 h the catalyst was characterized by several techniques in order to determine its specific surface area sbet and pore volume vp ph at the point of zero charge phpzc nitrogen content and mass variation as a function of temperature textural and crystallographic properties were also determined by transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray diffraction xrd the n2 adsorption isotherms at 196 c were used to calculate sbet and vp through the brunauer emmett teller bet equation and from the amount adsorbed at p p0 0 95 respectively for this purpose 0 1 g of catalyst was outgassed at 150 c for 3 h under vacuum in a quantachrome nova 4200e apparatus the phpzc was determined by mixing 0 05 g of catalyst with 25 ml of 0 01 m nacl 99 5 wt from scharlau with the ph previously adjusted between 2 and 12 using 0 01 m hcl 37 from chemlab or naoh 98 5 wt acros organics the final ph was measured after 24 h of agitation the phpzc value corresponds to the point where the curve phfinal vs phinitial crosses the line phinitial phfinal the nitrogen content in the catalysts was measured by elementary analysis using a carlo erba ea 1108 elemental analyser the mass variation as a function of temperature was measured by a thermogravimetric analysis tg carried out under helium with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 from 50 to 900 c in a sta 409 pc 4 h luxx netzsch thermal analyser the tem analysis was carried out in an electron microscope jeol jem 1400 zeiss model em 10c equipped with a sc1000 orius ccd camera operated at

nm further details about the characterization techniques are described elsewhere 16 2 2 heterogeneous fenton procedure the ph and temperature employed to perform the fenton process 50 c and 3 0 respectively were fixed at the best values found in a preliminary study in a reactor operating in batch mode with the same catalyst 16 the fenton process was carried out in an acrylic jacketed continuous stirred tank reactor with a capacity of 920 ml connect to a thermostatic bath huber polystat cc1 for maintaining the temperature constant at 50 c during the reaction the reactor was fed with a pnp solution 500 mg l being this concentration selected because it is representative of several real effluents 29 30 with the ph adjusted to 3 0 with 1 m sulphuric acid 97 98 from vwr chemicals the amount of catalyst employed is submerged into the reactor retained on a porous support with an opening diameter of 0 8 mm which prevents the loss of catalyst for the liquid by using a peristaltic pump gilson miniplus 2 both the pnp and a hydrogen peroxide solution 30 w v from vwr chemicals also with ph adjusted to 3 0 are simultaneously fed to the reactor both solutions are kept in a thermostatized vessel at the same temperature as the reactor jacket the dilution effect factor of two caused by the junction of the two streams at the reactor inlet was taken into account in the calculations during the runs stirring was ensured using a magnetic stir bar 200 rpm and a stir plate vwr model vs c7 periodically samples of treated effluent reactor outlet stream were taken to measure the concentration of pnp toc hydrogen peroxide and iron which eventually leached out from the catalyst support the latter after being filteted with a nitrate cellulose membrane with a porosity of 0 45 μm the concentration of pnp and toc was measured after stopping the homogenous reaction in the sampling flasks by increasing the ph to 10 with 3 m naoh and then neutralizing with 1 m h2so4 or adding an excess of sodium sulphite 98 wt alfa aesar respectively both methods are well known to quickly decompose any remaining hydrogen peroxide 31 32 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of p nitrophenol 4 nitrocatechol hydroquinone and benzoquinone were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc hitachi labcrom elite in an apparatus equipped with a uv dad detector an isocratic method was employed which used a flow rate of 0 75 ml min of eluent 90 distilled water and 10 methanol the latter with a purity 99 8 hipersolv chromanorm from vwr chemicals a volume of 20 μl was injected the separation of the compounds occurring in a purospher star rp 18 column 5 μm 250 4 0 mm heated up to 35 c with detection at a wavelength of 285 nm the concentration of carboxyl acids oxalic pyruvic and maleic was determined in the same hplc using h2so4 2 5 m as eluent with a flow rate of 0 17 ml min an injection sample volume of 15 μl the separation of compounds being now carried out in a rezex roa organic acid h 8 250 4 6 mm column at 25 c with detection at a wavelength of 210 nm the total organic carbon toc was determined according to method 5310 d 33 shortly the combustion of the organic matter occurred at 720 c and the carbon dioxide formed was quantified in an infrared detector for this purpose a shimadzu toc l apparatus with an autosampler was used the hydrogen peroxide was measured by the colorimetric method as proposed by sellers 34 the intensity of the yellow orange color of the complex formed from the reaction between h2o2 and potassium titanium oxalate in acid medium was measured by absorbance at 400 nm in a thermo electron corporation model helios γ spectrophotometer the iron leached from the catalyst was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry aas according to method 3111 b 33 using an aas spectrophotometer from unicam model 939 959 the biological oxygen demand bod was measured according to method 5210 d 33 this method is based on measuring the oxygen consumption by microorganisms for degrading the organic matter susceptible to biological degradation during 5 days at 20 c for this purpose an oxitop velp scientifica apparatus was used the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by measuring the absorbance in a nanocolor 500d photometer from macherey nagel at 620 nm which corresponds to the reduction of chromium vi to iii when the organic and inorganic suitable to chemical oxidation compounds are oxidized after digestion at 150 c for 2 h under closed reflux nanocolor vario 4 from macherey nagel method 5220 d 33 the toxicity of the effluents was evaluated by inhibition of vibrio fischeri according to standard din en iso 11348 3 35 in this determination the bacteria are put in contact with samples at 15 c and the bioluminescence emitted by the bacteria is measured after 5 15 and 30 min in a microtox model 500 from modern water apparatus all analytical determinations were performed in duplicate and the coefficients of variation were 2 for pnp toc cod and oxalic acid concentration and 5 for bod and inhibition of vibrio fischeri 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of the catalyst in this study the fe acm catalyst was selected based on a previous work 16 it has a specific surface area s bet of 814 10 m2 g 1 a phpzc of 7 5 table 1 and a nitrogen content of 3 44 wt the tem technique was used to evaluate the dispersion of iron on the catalyst surface tem photos fig 1 clearly show a good iron dispersion with sizes in the range of 87 36 nm to guarantee the application of the heterogeneous fenton process at the industrial level the catalyst must present a long term stability for this purpose the stability of the fe acm material was evaluated reusing the catalyst in five consecutive runs which were carried out under the same operating conditions ph 3 t 50 c h2o2 feed 1 0 g l lhsv 20 min 1 and τ 30 min results obtained are shown in fig 2 it was observed that both pnp degradation and organics mineralization toc removal as well as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide present the same profiles along the five reutilizations see fig 2a and b it is noteworthy that in each cycle the reactor had a pnp solution with the same concentration as the feed one without any oxidant so the removals of pnp and toc were null for the initial instant and the consumption of h2o2 is total after such reactor start up the high pnp and toc removals obtained in the initial instants and the decrease in the subsequent reaction times up to reaching steady state is due to the adsorption of pnp and the intermediate compounds on the catalyst which becomes saturated after a while after reaching steady state removals of 44 and 35 for pnp and toc respectively were obtained while the consumption of h2o2 was above 34 the variations of such data among the 5 runs were 0 2 moreover the iron content in the solution was below the detection limit i e 0 28 mg l for all experiments which indicates that the catalyst is stable the catalytic stability of fe acm was corroborated during the long term experiment performed the fenton reaction was carried out continuously for 7200 min 120 h being found that the pnp degradation mineralization and consumption of h2o2 were constant along the time on stream average values of 44 35 and 35 respectively after the initial period of ca 150 min to reach steady state see fig 3a and b furthermore the iron leached from the catalyst was also below the detection limit it is also worth noting that the fenton s performance was equal to that reached in each reutilization experiment fig 2 moreover the characterization of the catalyst after 120 h of use shows that its phpzc is not altered with the catalytic process see table 1 the xrd analysis see fig 4 reveals no significant changes between fresh and used catalysts and the iron particles size practically did not change with the fenton process 87 36 and 91 43 nm for fresh and used catalyst respectively fig 1 though there are changes in the surface area table 1 actually there is a decrease of s bet from 814 to 523 m2 g 1 which may result from the deposition of some intermediates reaction by products the same tendency was observed by duarte et al 36 when oxidizing the orange ii dye by the heterogeneous fenton process using iron impregnated on activated carbon as catalyst actually tg analysis reveals the deposition of some organic compounds that start to be released at 300 c while the original catalyst only starts to show weight loss at 450 c see fig 5 however for temperatures above 600 c the weight loss was lower for the used catalyst than for the fresh one whose difference may be associated with the prevention of the release of volatile compounds present on the catalyst surface by the intermediates reaction by products that were adsorbed therein 3 2 hydroxyl radical quenching in order to assess the importance of the hydroxyl radicals in the efficiency of the heterogeneous fenton process a new experiment was carried out wherein dimethyl sulfoxide dmso a scavenger of this radical was added to the pnp solution fed to the reactor the concentration of dmso at the entrance of the cstr was determined taking into account the dmso h2o2 molar ratio of 10 1 proposed by other authors 37 fig 6 shows the results obtained in steady state without and with the presence of the scavenger it can be seen that in the presence of dmso there is a decay of pnp and toc removals both reaching ca half the values without the scavenger with a similar consumption of h2o2 in both runs 33 34 the reduction in the efficiency of the oxidative process is due to the decreasing amount of hydroxyl radicals available to oxidize the pnp and the intermediates since the radicals are mostly reacting with dmso thus as expected the generation of hydroxyl radicals occurs during the fenton process catalyzed by fe acm however during the oxidative process other radicals are generated such as the hydroperoxyl ho2 formed in the regeneration of iron eq 2 and or as a results of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the oxidized carbon surface active sites ac eq 6 38 and superoxide o2 produced through the decomposition of the hydroperoxyl radical according to eq 7 39 these two radicals despite having a lower oxidation potential than the hydroxyl one contribute to the degradation and mineralization of pnp all these radicals are responsible for the oxidation of pnp and the intermediate compounds formed but the contribution of hydrogen peroxide alone as demonstrated in the following section cannot be disregarded 6 ac h 2 o 2 ac ho 2 h 7 ho 2 o 2 h it is worth stressing that the presence of dmso in solution did not affect the iron leaching from the catalyst in fact the concentration of iron in the cstr outlet effluent was below the detection limit as happened in the run that took place without the presence of the scavenger 3 3 parametric study for the heterogeneous fenton process parametric study carried out in the cstr the variables considered were the liquid hourly space velocity lhsv q v cat 40 being q the total feed flow rate and v cat the volume of catalyst which was calculated by the ratio between the mass of catalyst used and its density 958 g l the residence time τ v q where v is the reactor volume and the dose of oxidant fed to the reactor h2o2 feed the ph and temperature were fixed in best conditions found 3 0 and 50 c respectively in a previous study which applied the heterogeneous fenton catalyzed by the same catalysts to degrade pnp in batch mode 16 the subsequent sections present the results gathered and the discussion of their influence 3 3 1 effect of the liquid hourly space velocity the influence of the lhsv was evaluated in the range from 6 25 to 20 min 1 the minimum value was defined by physical limitations of the set up while fixing the other operating conditions results obtained at steady state are shown in fig 7 as expected the removal of pnp and organics mineralization decreased with the increase of lhsv this is related to the decrease in the volume of catalyst in the reactor for the same flow rate leading to the production of a less amount of hydroxyl radicals consequently worsening the process efficiency this is corroborated by the increase in the concentration of oxidant in the reactor outlet stream for higher lhsv values indicating that there is a higher consumption of h2o2 for the run performed with the smallest liquid hourly space velocity lhsv 6 25 min 1 removals of 75 and 53 for pnp and toc respectively with a consumption of h2o2 of 51 were reached in steady state for such lhsv again the amount of iron present in the reactor outlet stream during the reaction was 0 28 mg l for all lhsv values tested 3 3 2 influence of the residence time the effect of the residence time τ which is the ratio between the volume of solution in the reactor and the feed flow rate was evaluated in the range 30 to 120 min for this purpose the feed flow ratio was varied once the reactor volume is fixed while also changing the mass of catalyst in order to maintain unchanged the lhsv in 6 25 min 1 the results obtained are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that an increase in the residence time benefits the heterogeneous fenton process in terms of target pollutant oxidation fig 8a and organics mineralization fig 8b as well as in what concerns the consumption of oxidant fig 8c iron leaching from the catalyst was again negligible for all the residence times studied iron content in the outlet stream was always below the detection limit for the highest residence time 120 min removals of 93 and 76 for pnp and toc respectively with 65 of oxidant consumption were reached at steady state the results obtained indicate that other phenomena apart from the heterogeneous fenton oxidation must be also occurring which allows anticipating the possible contribution of homogeneous reactions as observed in previous studies reported in literature 41 42 queirós et al 25 and esteves et al 23 associated the influence of the residence time to the homogeneous fenton reaction due to iron leaching however in this study there was no detectable loss of iron from the catalysts whereby it cannot be the reason therefore it is envisaged that the degradation of the pollutant and of the intermediate compounds for higher τ values can be due to the hydrogen peroxide alone this fact was confirmed in the runs where only the oxidant was used i e without the fe acm catalyst in which the same trend observed for the heterogeneous fenton s oxidation in what concerns pnp and toc removals and h2o2 consumption was also noticed see fig 8 however the pnp and toc removals were much lower in the runs with h2o2 only compared to the heterogeneous fenton process this is due to the lower oxidation potential 1 78 v 43 of hydrogen peroxide when compared with hydroxyl radicals 2 8 v 43 generated through the fenton reaction subsequent runs were carried out with a residence time of 120 min once it permits to reach a higher removal of pnp and better mineralization 3 3 3 effect of the h2o2 dose in the cstr feed the operating cost of the treatment process is a relevant factor in its implementation so understanding the effect of the oxidant dose in the parametric study aiming to minimize its dose while having high performances is crucial since hydrogen peroxide was found in the reactor outlet stream even for the highest contact and residence time values employed a new series of experiments was carried out using an inlet concentration of oxidant in the range of 0 5 to 1 0 g l the results obtained are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the pnp and toc removals increase with the increase of oxidant dose up to 0 75 g l and a plateau for the pnp removal or a decrease in the case of mineralization was observed for the maximum concentration tested of 1 0 g l such behavior was reported in several previous studies that applied the heterogeneous fenton process to treat a variety of target pollutants or complex effluents in batch reactors but also to treat orange ii dye 25 or a textile dyeing effluent 23 using iron containing zeolite or activated carbon respectively as catalyst in a cstr this fact is explained by the occurrence of the undesirable scavenging reaction of the hydroxyl radical by the excess of h2o2 eq 8 12 on the one hand such reactions lead to a reduction in the amount of hydroxyl radicals available to degrade both the pnp and the intermediate compounds on the other hand the radical formed ho2 has an oxidation potential that is lower than the hydroxyl radical one which explains the decrease in performance this aspect is corroborated by observing the higher consumption of the oxidant 65 for the run wherein the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the feed was 1 0 g l fig 9 which does not translate into an increase in the process efficiency consequently the parallel reaction is taking place 8 h 2 o 2 ho ho 2 h 2 o concerning the iron leached from fe acm again no concentration of this metal in the outlet effluent was detected i e it was lower than 0 28 mg l during the reactions 3 4 effluent biodegradability toxicity and intermediate compounds identification under the best operating conditions employed ph 3 0 t 50 c h2o2 feed 0 75 g l τ 120 min and lhsv 6 25 min 1 high efficiency of the fenton process catalyzed with the fe acm material was achieved in the cstr with a removal of pnp toc and cod of 94 83 and 86 respectively after reaching steady state see table 2 the treated effluent is non toxic since the inhibition of vibrio fischeri decays from 54 60 to 0 after 5 30 min of contact between v fischeri bacteria and the sample and is more biodegradable since the bod and the bod cod ratio increased from 1 mgo2 l and 0 001 to 48 mgo2 l and 0 41 respectively table 2 once more no iron was detected in solution the performance of the heterogeneous process obtained in the cstr for degrading pnp 94 is similar or greater than the one reached in other studies that used batch reactors in the range 60 98 13 15 19 combining a lower consumption of oxidant which allows a reduction in the treatment cost therefore the application of this treatment process in this reactor configuration is economically advantageous and suitable to be applied continuously taking into account that the mineralization was not complete the intermediate compounds such as 4 nitrocatechol hydroquinone benzoquinone maleic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid and acetic acid 44 45 that are commonly formed through oxidation of pnp by the fenton process and that could remain in solution contributing to the remaining toc were identified and quantified in fig 10 it is possible to observe that the concentration of oxalic acid only intermediate compound found increased quickly in the first 30 min of reaction which corresponds to the period wherein more pnp is removed the concentration of oxalic acid continues to increase up to 120 min of reaction reaching steady state at ca 300 360 min the non identification of the remaining intermediate compounds apart from oxalic acid is due to the fact that those species of higher molecular weight are easily oxidized to carboxylic acids oxalic acid is difficult to oxidize so it remains in solution in addition to oxalic acid pnp also remains in solution though with a low concentration being that the contribution of these two compounds to the measured toc is over 98 see table 3 4 conclusions the present study focuses on the utilization of a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to degrade pnp through the heterogeneous fenton s reagent using fe acm as catalyst the stability and reutilization of the catalyst were proven still no leaching of iron from the support to the solution was detected which is an important issue for industrial application the reduction of the fenton s process efficiency in the presence of a hydroxyl radical scavenger dmso allows us to conclude that the oxidation of both pnp and intermediate compounds is due mainly to the formation of radicals however the contribution of hydrogen peroxide per se should not be neglected the effect of some operating parameters such as lhsv residence time and concentration of oxidant feed to the reactor was evaluated under the best conditions tested outstanding results have been reached at steady state 94 and 83 for pnp and toc removal respectively and a non toxic and more biodegradable effluent was generated the only organic compounds present in the treated effluent are pnp and oxalic acid which contribute 98 for the remaining toc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13292,due to the alternate exposure of the biofilm to wastewater and air the rotating biological contactors rbcs provide a changing biofilm external environment for microbiome growth in this study a novel packed cage rotating biological contactor pcrbc system with more artificially intensified biofilm and higher oxygen mass transfer efficiency was applied to treating mustard tuber wastewater mtww the capacity and kinetics of pollutants removal was evaluated based on monod equation and illumina miseq techniques were used to detect the spatial distribution of microorganism community along the flow pathway the results illustrated that the pcrbc has a good performance on cod nh4 n and tn with removal efficiencies over 90 49 99 12 and 70 82 respectively the bacterium community populations at the middle and distal end of the pcrbc train were completely different from those at the beginning of the pcrbc however the strong ecological associations were observed among different bacteria except for conventional denitrification pathway the heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying hn ad combined with short cut denitrification was inferred as the main denitrification pathways especially at the middle and end of the pcrbc this study presents a novel perspective to interpret the resilience of the pcrbc through the deeper analysis of the bacterium community dynamics which was supposed to help guiding optimization strategies for more effective pollutant removal key packed cage rotating biological contactor biological nutrient removal denitrification salinity bacteria diversity wastewater 1 introduction mustard tuber wastewater mtww is a type of food industry wastewater supposed to have high level of nitrogen high organic load low cod tn ratio 3 9 and high salinity 4 when the discharged saline mtww was failure to meet the emission standards it can result in eutrophication and acidification of water and soil there is a large amount of mtww produced in the three gorges reservoir area therefore efficient and reliable biological treatment technologies are urgently need common treating methods such as cass cyclic activated sludge system sbbr sequencing batch biofilm reactor asbbr anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket and ubf upflow anaerobic bio filter reactor were used to deal with the mtww 5 16 38 52 compared with those biological treatment methods above rbcs rotating biological contactors biofilm based reactors for biodegradable organic pollutants adsorption and degradation have potential advantages as sufficiently long biomass detention time resistance from shock loads reduced sludge production more stable ecological system and less land demand 19 39 56 however the rbc system still has some operating problems the turbulence is difficult to be maintained at an ideal steady state and thick and fluffy biofilm limits the transport of substrate and oxygen to biofilm high turbulence could also detach biomass from the surface of the disk 36 49 50 in order to promote the substrate and oxygen mass transfer efficiency and the density of the biofilm a novel packed cage rbc pcrbc was selected to treat high salinity mtww in this study previous studies already demonstrated that high organic and nitrogen removal efficiencies are obtained in pcrbc systems treating wastewater containing various pollutants such as surfactants cl2 residues high nitrogen heavy metals 45 47 the constant rotation of pcrbc mixes the biofilm wastewater and oxygen adequately the rotating cages and biocarriers in the pcrbc alternately comes into contact with air and wastewater 27 in the exposure stage the oxygen transfers between vapor solid phase or vapor liquid phase through the boundary layer of biofilm while substrate is supplied insufficiently on the surface of the biofilm in the immersion stage both oxygen and liquid transfers between liquid solid phase 54 the growth rate of organisms reached the highest outside of the biofilm and it is the lowest inside the biofilm furthermore the substrate also changes along the flow pathway of the pcrbc the distribution of substrate in the solution of reactor or in the microenvironment of the biofilm effects the microbiome community composition 40 51 54 as the core unit of biological treatment microorganism determines the treatment efficiency of the biofilm system 8 11 hence it is essential to investigate microbiome functional microorganism and their relationships in the rotating biological contactors 12 40 however most researches on microbiome in the mtww have so far only concentrated on single processes such as nitrification denitrification and partial nitrification 9 44 51 the biofilm community composition and correlations of those functional bacteria with the changing environment in the pcrbc system have been inadequately characterized comparing with those in other biological wastewater treatment systems this study aims to fill such a research gap specifically a field experiment was conducted to assess the performance of pcrbc treating mtww and high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna was adopted to profile the variation in the bacterial consortia along the pcrbc flow pathway the objectives of the analyses are to address the following questions 1 what is the spatial distribution of the microbe community 2 how do environmental factors impact the functional bacteria communities 3 how are the ecological relationships between functional dominated bacteria in the community 4 what is the main pathway of denitrification in the pcrbc the findings of this study provide a theoretical foundation for pollutant removal pathway of the pcrbc 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup the process of mtww

around 5 kg cod m3 filler d and target of effluent meet the requirement of the first class of discharge standard in china 7 after 35 days of the pcrbc operation the thickness of biofilm in the front of pcrbc reached 2 mm and the cod and nh4 n removal efficiency were maintained over 80 the microorganism such as creeping ciliates vorticellas and wheel animalcule were found in the pcrbc through the optical microscope the whole system was then viewed as stable fig 1c shows the reactor in operation the concentration of cod was finally decreased to below 100 mg l meeting the requirement of the discharge standard 7 2 3 sample collection when the pcrbc started up successfully and ran stably under the load of 5 kg cod m3 filler d water samples 1 8 were obtained along the axial direction as showed in fig 1 d the selected bacterial sampling sites in this study cover the representative positions in the pcrbc biofilm samples b1 b2 b3 were scraped from three different locations separately

oxygen meter wtw weilheim in oberbayern germany a ph meter fe20 k mettler toledo switzerland was used to measure the ph 2 5 kinetic analysis as the plug flow pattern of the pcrbc water samples

order to assess the relative contribution of environmental environmental variables to biofilm community structuring variation partitioning analysis vpa was carried out both rda and vpa were performed using canoco 5 software 29 3 results 3 1 wastewater treatment efficiency the quality of the effluent in the stable operation of pcrbc is shown in table 2 average value of 14 days it can be seen that the actual effluent cod of pcrbc meet the wastewater discharge standard requirements of cod 100 mg l and nh4 n 15 mg l comprehensive wastewater discharge standard of china gb18918 2002 it is worth noting that ammonia oxidizing efficiency aoe was stabilized at 99 and tn removal efficiency reached 70 82 3 98 the tn removal efficiency indicats that the microorganisms could completely degrade the considerable part of nitrogen compounds 3 2 analysis of changes in water quality indicators along the pcrbc fig 2 shows the dynamics of water index include do cod and nitrogen compound in the biofilm samples along the axis direction unremarkable changes were found in the value of salinity and temperature the do increased gradually from 0 89 mg l to 3 88 mg l from the inlet to the outlet since the oxygen was supplied through the rotation of the cage which was kept in the same speed the amount of re oxygenation in each part of the system was the same the do value indirectly reflects oxygen consumption in the biofilm it could be conjectured that the oxygen consumption and organic load degradation is mainly concentrated in the front section of the cage the effluent nh4 n was decreased sharply in the position of sample 2 and the removal rate over 99 could be kept in the position of sample 4 the effluent no3 n and tn show a tendency to decrease along the axis direction while began to increase in the middle part of the pcrbc the position of sample 5 then they decreased slowly continuously and was monitored to kept stable and maintained at low level at the position of sample 7 the changing trend of effluent cod was generally the same as nh4 n namely the pcrbc had a stable performance in the profile of simultaneous organic and nitrogen removal the comprehensive degradation coefficient of pollutants in the reactor was determined by the method of inverse calculation of measured data in the kinetic study the curve fitting toolbox in matlab were used to obtain the parameters of the monod kinetics all data with 12 2 h were summarized and displayed together with the removal kinetic curve based on the monod equation in fig 3 eqs 4 and 5 represents the relationship between pollutant concentration and the distance x m the curve fits well with the experimental data although the values the r2 value of the cod and nh4 n curves were higher than 0 95 indicating the reasonability on the selection of monod kinetics and assumption of plug flow in most cases 4 c cod mg l 774 7 e 0 1285 x 5 c n h 3 mg l 74 7 e 2 553 x in the comparison of the cod value and model

samples to investigate the community spatial distribution on the surface of carriers in the pcrbc 16s rrna high throughput sequencing was conducted total 254 216 sequence were finally obtained in all the samples and 27 813 sequences for each sample further explored of bacterial diversity they were assigned into 677 otus 476 species 343 genera 217 families 125 orders 69 classes 33 phylum and 1 kingdom the bacterial diversity of out based on analyses of α diversity indices rank abundance curves rarefaction curves and venn diagram are shown in fig 4 a d the similar richness estimators ace and chao results showed that there are obvious changes along the axial direction in pcrbc especially between sample b1 and b2 or b3 p 0 05 indicating effect of environment change on microbial richness however little higher shannon and lower simpson indexes of samples b2 and b3 were discovered compared with samples b1 implying that the environment in the middle section of the pcrbc were more propitious to the bacterial diversity but there were no significant difference between them p 0 05 meanwhile high god s nonparametric estimators of coverage value were 99 6 data not shown in all samples meant that the miseq sequencing results were available for effective characterization of bacterial community rarefaction curves fig 4b indicated that the sampling of bacterial richness was complete and all samples were compared at an equivalent sequencing depth the rarefaction curves indicate that the species abundance of the sample was ranked as b2 b3 b1 besides the three curves were approach to plateau finally implying the abundant sequences red would generate few more otus the rank abundant curves fig 4a shows similar changing trend of evenness with the rarefaction curves the venn diagram is used to count the shared and unique otus of each sample as shown in fig 6d there are 537 co owned otus shared by all samples 3 4 active community structure on different samples along the pcrbc the population dynamics of the bacterial community within the biofilm samples distributing along the axial direction of the pcrbc were explored in the terms of top 7 abundant phyla and 32 abundant genera the results are revealed in fig 5 and fig 6 as shown in figs 5 and 8 phyla include proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes chlorobi actinobacteria planctomycetes dominating in all the samples proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the two dominant bacterial phyla accounting for about 36 43 49 54 in all samples however the third dominant phyla were chloroflex which was only account for 5 52 in b2 sample fig 6 presented the genus level abundance of the three samples all the samples consisted of 31 genera denitromonas thauera formosa and desulfomicrobium are the four dominant genus accounting for 15 37 9 17 5 32 and 4 24 in the b1 sample respectively thiothrix pseudomonas formosa and aequorivita genus dominated in the b2 sample accounting for 12 79 8 42 6 18 5 36 the same dominant genus also exits in the sample b3 moreover the abundance discrepancy of thiothrix 2 79 in b1 12 79 in b2 and 15 41 in b3 belongs to denitromonas 15 37 in b1 1 98 in b2 and 2 18 in b3 thauera 9 17 in b1 1 54 in b2 and 2 18 in b3 and desulfomicrobium 4 24 in b1 0 37 in b2 and 0 32 in b3 genus belong to proteobacteria phylum probably caused the difference in the first dominant phylum of the three samples 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of nitrogen compound along the pcrbc denitrification is a crucial part of nitrogen compound transfer in wastewater connecting ammonium oxidation through nitrification with dinitrogen molecule from nitrate or nitrite the nitrogen removal efficiency in the pcrbc is related to the dissolved oxygen and organic matters at the beginning of pcrbc 80 of nh4 n and 26 65 cod were removed from the mtww with the c n rising from 11 26 to 35 54 the high organic matter inhibits the nitrification process resulting in only 3 53 mg l of concentration of no3 n moreover the concentration of no2 n was kept below 1 mg l in the reactor since in pcrbc most of the tn were determined by the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n the results indicated that high tn removal efficiency was obtained at the beginning of pcrbc as can be seen in fig 2 the dissolved oxygen was below 1 67 mg l at the beginning of the prcbc therefore the data shows that conventional denitrification was the principal nitrogen removal pathway 26 the high organic concentration with little no3 n no2 n and nh4 n and limited do imply that a small quantity of nitrogen was removed through simultaneous partial or shortcut nitrification and denitrification process 23 41 at the middle and distal end part of the pcrbc the concentration of dissolve oxygen increased along the flow pathway from 2 89 mg l to 3 88 mg l meanwhile however the nh4 n was almost deplete below 3 37 mg l as demonstrated by existing studies the high do concentration higher than 1 9 mg l was not suitable for achieving stable partial nitridation anammox 3 under such conditions the concentration of no3 n grew to a maximum 31 02 mg l in the middle part of pcrbc indicating that the heterotrophic nitrification process occurred at the middle part of the pcrbc therefore the nh4 n was probably oxidized to no3 n with the do and organic matter such a conclusion is in consistent with previous research 41 4 2 the adaptation of microbial community to the salinity the salinity may pose threats to the processes of biological wastewater treatment in this study the pcrbc are very effective to remove the organic and nitrogen though the salinity in the mtww kept around 0 54 0 73 the cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiency could reached over 89 40 98 95 and 75 25 respectively the highest removal rate of cod nh4 n and tn could achieve 434 mg l h 113 mg l h and 111 05 mg l h respectively the average of the removal loading were 4 47 kg cod m3 filler d 0 52 kg nh4 n m3 filler d and 0 59 kg tn m3 filler d compared with other biofilm reactors the pcrbc had a better performance in removing organic and nitrogen simultaneously in wastewater or high salinity wastewater 25 31 34 43 52 in the pcrbc proteobacteria and bacteroidetes dominate in all the biofilm samples which is generally coincident with the previously reports that no matter under unsalted or salty condition proteobacteria was the most representative phylum with many functional species shared in wastewater treatment 35 53 the previous research also reveal that phyla bacteroidetes was dominant in high salinity wastewater treatment systems 28 bacteroidetes became more abundant as salinity increased compared to the proteobacteria bacteroidetes maintained stronger salinity tolerance 18 33 57 as chloroflexi can survive under any of the conditions in wastewater treatment plants because of their metabolic flexibility they have been often found in hypersaline wastewaters and marine environments 1 30 the role of chloroflexi played in anaerobic process was also hydrolytic fermentation functionalities firmicum are heterotrophic bacteria with obligatory anaerobe or facultative anaerobe most of the thick walled bacteria can produce spores which can resist dehydration and have strong adaptability to survive in the extreme environment the main function of this phylum is to degrade organic matter and the active enzymes such as glucanase pectinase and cellulase 23 in addition many references reported that firmicum plays an important role in denitrification 24 58 4 3 environmental factors impact on denitrification functional bacteria community structure obviously showed from fig 6 in the pcrbc system a large quantity of bacterial with nitrification and denitrification function was detected two important genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira with function of autotrophic nitrification were discovered to increase as the increase of do and decrease of cod it had been found that nitrospira was a ubiquitous nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob playing an important role in mtww and nitrosomonas was an important ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in the aerobic zone sludge 15 in the conventional nitrification process aob and nob convert nh4 n to no3 n collectively 23 the seven dominate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb included azoarcus formosa denitromonas flavobacterium thauera thiobacillus and desulfomicrobium genera indicated the conventional nitrogen removal process predominated which conducted the denitrification by using nitrate nitrite as electron acceptors 10 additionally heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria hn adb included pseudomonas paracocccus hydrogenophaga genera was founded in all the samples they can remove ammonia nitrogen under aerobic conditions and transform nitrification products to nitrogenous gas for rapid nitrogen removal 20 48 60 microbial community structure is not only regulated by biological factors but also influenced by abiotic factors such as environmental factors as shown in fig 7 rda analysis results show that dynamics of microorganism communities in the biological system were closely associated with the environmental variables cod tn do nh4 and no3 in pcrbc all the variables have significant influence on the community compositions especially for do p 0 032 and cod tn p 0 017 the dominated genera of azoarcus denitromonas thauera and desulfomicrobium clustered as hdb have the negative relationship with do and cod tn the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria anb including aob and nob including nitrosomonas and nitrospira was shown to have positive relationship with do the hn adb pseudomonas genus had the positive relationship with cod tn and do negative relationship with nh4 n the carbon resource could provide the electron suppler for the hn adb to conduct the heterotrophic nitrifying and the do ensure the denitrification 20 but the high ammonia nitrogen will inhabit the heterotrophic nitrification process 32 coinstantaneous all the variables were adopting for vpa analysis fig 8 vpa indicated that the no communities were explained by one single variable all the shared variables explained 12 27 of the discrepancy in the community additionally spearman correlation heatmap between all the variables and 30 genera were showed in the fig 9 most genus have significant correlations with do flavobacterium and norank c bacteroidetes vc2 1 bac22 belong to bacteroidetes phylum have weak correlations with conductivity nh4 n and g norank f saprospiraceae have weak correlations with no3 the blastocatella belong to bacteroidetes phylum have no significant relationship with cod tn all the environmental factors have obvious correlations with most top genera include desulfomicrobium paracocccus lewinella vitellibacter thauera thiothrix g unclassified f rhodobacteraceae aequorivita blastocatella denitromonas et al from the above analysis we can see that at the micro level the environmental factors have a more impact on the functional microorganisms of the system which can be transformed into reactor performance in the macroscopical perspective 4 4 bacteriomics characteristics based on genus level in pcrbc correlations between the topological structures of the bacterial communities in the opened pcrbc biofilm samples were calculated based on genus level the result was visualized in a network interface to explore significant bacterial interactions along the pollutant gradient in the pcrbc in our study an interconnection network was constructed based on the 16s rrna reads assigned to the 35 genera occurring with the highest abundances appearing in the biofilm samples in different locations the resulting network contained 35 nodes genera and 61 edges with an average node degree connectivity of 3 49 and a high modularity of 1 338 values 0 4 as shown in fig 10 the nodes frames with blue red and green colors represent the hdb anb and hn adb respectively the strongest correlation coefficient 1 96 as indicated by the thickest edges in fig 10 was observed between nob nitrospira and hn adb denitrifier pseudomonas both genera were simultaneously strongly correlated with blastocatella indicating that an increase in these three genera along the plug flowpath may be related to oxygen preference furthermore hn adb paracocccus also showed a strong correlation coefficient between 1 8 1 9 with aerobic bacterium filamentous thiothrix occupying 22 91 of the total 16s rrna sequences owenweeksia lewinella and vitellibacter the association among hn adb and other heterotrophic or aerobic bacteria indicated that functional bacteria presented related ecological niche preference whereas the co occurrence of hn adb paracocccus and filamentous thiothrix could suggest that thiothrix increased specific surface areas and promoting the absorption of pollutants overall the bacteria involved in nitrogen metabolism preponderance in the formation of the correlation networks thus organic matter oxygen and nitrogen availability seem to be the important factors that shape the microbial community structure in pcrbc all these bacteria contributed to the ecological balance and stable operation of the opened pcrbc system 4 5 the pathway of microbial denitrification in pcrbc traditional biological nitrogen removal in wastewater contains aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification pathways with no3 n no2 n as the main reaction intermediates to propose the mechanistic insight into the denitrification statistics of functional bacteria in denitrification are shown in fig 11 the anb autotrophic nitrifying bacteria including aob and nob hdb and hn adb was founded in all the samples with the hdb dominated in the denitrification process especially in samples b1 the amount of hn adb increased significantly in the samples b2 and b3 in the pcrbc system the removal rate of nh4 n was kept above 99 this implies the robustness of nitrification to a certain saline tress according to the structure of the biofilm the most of aob distributed in the out layer where enough penetrated oxygen is available especially when it was exposed in the air however the aob suffer from the salinity stress first previous study proved that the dense and complex excretion which was generated by the biofilm cover the microbes in the out layer for protection 21 large amount of tn was removed at the beginning end of pcrbc suggesting that denitrification performance remained unaffected with the salinity the hdb was inhabitant in the inner anoxic layer of the biofilm which was supposed to be sheltered by the surface of the mattress to resist the stress of the saline mtww 6 10 in the samples b1 the abundant of hnd reached 39 39 meant the aerobic nitrification heterotrophic denitrification an hd dominate the whole process of denitrification however in the samples b2 and b3 except traditional denitrification an hd the heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hn ad also played an important role in the system the hn ad are recent interests for nitrogen removal in wastewater because of their high cost effectiveness 30 48 59 the previous study demonstrated two types of nitrate reductase in hn adb heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria contains nar membrane bound nitrate reductase and nap periplasmic nitrate reductase the nar which are sensitive to o2 is inhabited completely in the aerobic condition on the contrary the nap represents the original function efficiently under the aerobic condition which was considered as the controller of denitrification process 13 base on the nitrate oxygen co respiration mechanism theory both o2 and no3 can be used as electron acceptors and the electrons can be transferred to o2 the respiratory chain of aerobic denitrifying bacteria was considered as highly differentiated so as the flow of electrons to the denitrification pathway may overcome the postulated bottleneck in transferring electrons to oxygen via cytochrome c and cytochrome aa3 o2 is no longer the key factor to inhibit denitrification when aerobic denitrifying bacteria complete the respiration the transition electrons can be transferred to nitrate through nap to complete the denitrification 22 the research on hn ad mechanism reveal two nitrogen remove pathway elaborated in fig 12 nh2oh is oxidized to no2 n and no3 n under the catalysis of hao hydroxylamine oxidase the nox n is reduced to no by nar and nir nitrite reductase and then contiguously reduced to nitrogenous gas such as n2o and n2 through nor nitric oxide reductase and nos nitrous oxide reductase respectively 61 some research disclosure that most hn adb appeared to have denitrification activity when the do is below 4 mg l in the other side the nir was restrained when the do is below 2 mg l this phenomenon explained the changing trend of the hn adb in different samples the do played a vital role to affect the survive of hn adb for some other nh adb it is speculated the nh4 n is metabolized directly to n2 because of the undetected nar nir and any other midbody 62 it has been reported that the nitrification mainly conducted by aob and nob was widely regarded as a limited step of reaction speed in the conventional denitrification process 2 but the high salinity deteriorated the survive of aob and nob while the aob can tolerate the 2 9 nacl or higher salinity 15 the nob could completely inhabit at the exposure to the 1 96 nacl 42 however in the current study the salinity 0 54 0 73 nacl in the mtww didn t have significant inhibition of anb which had a significant effect on the nitrification rate 14 the heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria are supposed to have better nitrification performance in saline wastewater treatment system however when the salinity of the wastewater is more than 1 they may not perform efficiently in nitrification process 10 30 the paracocccus and pseudomonas detected in this system were depicted as an identified hn ad functional genus being highly adaptable to high saline and high organic matter concentration in the previous studies 17 55 some research also revealed the facts that the cod tn ratio had great significant effects on microbial community structure and metabolic pathways 37 48 the results showed the nh adb pseudomonas bacillus paracoccus and halomonas preferred to cod tn ratio of 25 in the studies 37 in this study the cod tn ration was 17 24 at the middle part of the pcrbc similar to that of previous studies as such a remarkable raise of related abundance of nh adb was also observed see fig 11 based on the denitrification performances and detected functional bacterial the simultaneous nitrogen and carbon removal routs were proposed at different samples b1 b2 since the cod and nh4 n were greatly depleted deficiency of carbon source and electron acceptors nitrate nitrite will affect the traditional denitrification efficiency reliable result might be mainly guaranteed by the hn ad 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that the pcrbc had good ability to remove the cod and nitrogen in the saline mtww the average removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tn were 90 49 99 12 and 70 82 respectively since the changing biofilm external microenvironment generated by alternate exposure of the biofilm to wastewater and air promoted the growth of bacterial community 16s rrna high throughput sequencing revealed the spatial evolution of the microbial community structures along the flow pathway the bacterium community populations at the middle and distal end of the pcrbc train were completely different with those at the beginning of the pcrbc through the analysis of the water indexes and functional microbiome along the axis direction it is founded that except for the conventional denitrification the hn ad combined with short cut denitrification was speculated as an important denitrification pathway especially in the middle and distal end of the pcrbc taken together this study provides a comprehensive insight into the organic s degradation characteristics and bacterial

13292,due to the alternate exposure of the biofilm to wastewater and air the rotating biological contactors rbcs provide a changing biofilm external environment for microbiome growth in this study a novel packed cage rotating biological contactor pcrbc system with more artificially intensified biofilm and higher oxygen mass transfer efficiency was applied to treating mustard tuber wastewater mtww the capacity and kinetics of pollutants removal was evaluated based on monod equation and illumina miseq techniques were used to detect the spatial distribution of microorganism community along the flow pathway the results illustrated that the pcrbc has a good performance on cod nh4 n and tn with removal efficiencies over 90 49 99 12 and 70 82 respectively the bacterium community populations at the middle and distal end of the pcrbc train were completely different from those at the beginning of the pcrbc however the strong ecological associations were observed among different bacteria except for conventional denitrification pathway the heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying hn ad combined with short cut denitrification was inferred as the main denitrification pathways especially at the middle and end of the pcrbc this study presents a novel perspective to interpret the resilience of the pcrbc through the deeper analysis of the bacterium community dynamics which was supposed to help guiding optimization strategies for more effective pollutant removal key packed cage rotating biological contactor biological nutrient removal denitrification salinity bacteria diversity wastewater 1 introduction mustard tuber wastewater mtww is a type of food industry wastewater supposed to have high level of nitrogen high organic load low cod tn ratio 3 9 and high salinity 4 when the discharged saline mtww was failure to meet the emission standards it can result in eutrophication and acidification of water and soil there is a large amount of mtww produced in the three gorges reservoir area therefore efficient and reliable biological treatment technologies are urgently need common treating methods such as cass cyclic activated sludge system sbbr sequencing batch biofilm reactor asbbr anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket and ubf upflow anaerobic bio filter reactor were used to deal with the mtww 5 16 38 52 compared with those biological treatment methods above rbcs rotating biological contactors biofilm based reactors for biodegradable organic pollutants adsorption and degradation have potential advantages as sufficiently long biomass detention time resistance from shock loads reduced sludge production more stable ecological system and less land demand 19 39 56 however the rbc system still has some operating problems the turbulence is difficult to be maintained at an ideal steady state and thick and fluffy biofilm limits the transport of substrate and oxygen to biofilm high turbulence could also detach biomass from the surface of the disk 36 49 50 in order to promote the substrate and oxygen mass transfer efficiency and the density of the biofilm a novel packed cage rbc pcrbc was selected to treat high salinity mtww in this study previous studies already demonstrated that high organic and nitrogen removal efficiencies are obtained in pcrbc systems treating wastewater containing various pollutants such as surfactants cl2 residues high nitrogen heavy metals 45 47 the constant rotation of pcrbc mixes the biofilm wastewater and oxygen adequately the rotating cages and biocarriers in the pcrbc alternately comes into contact with air and wastewater 27 in the exposure stage the oxygen transfers between vapor solid phase or vapor liquid phase through the boundary layer of biofilm while substrate is supplied insufficiently on the surface of the biofilm in the immersion stage both oxygen and liquid transfers between liquid solid phase 54 the growth rate of organisms reached the highest outside of the biofilm and it is the lowest inside the biofilm furthermore the substrate also changes along the flow pathway of the pcrbc the distribution of substrate in the solution of reactor or in the microenvironment of the biofilm effects the microbiome community composition 40 51 54 as the core unit of biological treatment microorganism determines the treatment efficiency of the biofilm system 8 11 hence it is essential to investigate microbiome functional microorganism and their relationships in the rotating biological contactors 12 40 however most researches on microbiome in the mtww have so far only concentrated on single processes such as nitrification denitrification and partial nitrification 9 44 51 the biofilm community composition and correlations of those functional bacteria with the changing environment in the pcrbc system have been inadequately characterized comparing with those in other biological wastewater treatment systems this study aims to fill such a research gap specifically a field experiment was conducted to assess the performance of pcrbc treating mtww and high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna was adopted to profile the variation in the bacterial consortia along the pcrbc flow pathway the objectives of the analyses are to address the following questions 1 what is the spatial distribution of the microbe community 2 how do environmental factors impact the functional bacteria communities 3 how are the ecological relationships between functional dominated bacteria in the community 4 what is the main pathway of denitrification in the pcrbc the findings of this study provide a theoretical foundation for pollutant removal pathway of the pcrbc 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup the process of mtww treatment was as follows the comprehensive wastewater from mustard plant grille regulating pool pcrbc effluent the main part of biological treatment contains the pcrbc obtained by wrapping and filling fillers based on the rbc this study was conducted in a pilot scale of pcrbc with a total effective volume of 15 19 l and dimensions of 1000 200 220 mm l w h as shown in fig 1 a 10 polycarbonate cylinder rooms with an inner diameter of 150 mm were established with separated polycarbonate disks and framework wrapped fig 1a each room was filled with anoxkaldnes k3 carriers 1 mm 5 mm with a filling ratio of 70 fig 1b the immersion rate of the cage was 40 and the water temperature was maintained at 25 1 c with automatic temperature control system the rotation speed was controlled at 8 r min by decelerator and variable frequency drive vfd 2 2 reactor operation the inoculated sludge came from the aeration tank of the wastewater treatment plant of chongqing yuquan mustard company the mtww fed the pcrbc continuously through the pvc polyvinyl chloride pipe from the beginning of the tank to the distal end flowing along the axial direction fig 1a the hrt hydraulic retention time was set as 12 2 h the quality of the integrated wastewater from the mustard plant was shown in table 1 the average of the cod concentration was 936 50 mg l the average organic load was controlled at around 5 kg cod m3 filler d and target of effluent meet the requirement of the first class of discharge standard in china 7 after 35 days of the pcrbc operation the thickness of biofilm in the front of pcrbc reached 2 mm and the cod and nh4 n removal efficiency were maintained over 80 the microorganism such as creeping ciliates vorticellas and wheel animalcule were found in the pcrbc through the optical microscope the whole system was then viewed as stable fig 1c shows the reactor in operation the concentration of cod was finally decreased to below 100 mg l meeting the requirement of the discharge standard 7 2 3 sample collection when the pcrbc started up successfully and ran stably under the load of 5 kg cod m3 filler d water samples 1 8 were obtained along the axial direction as showed in fig 1 d the selected bacterial sampling sites in this study cover the representative positions in the pcrbc biofilm samples b1 b2 b3 were scraped from three different locations separately and repeatedly for three times fig 1d the collected biofilm was stored under the temperature of 80 c 2 4 chemical analysis cod tn nh4 n ph and dissolved oxygen do were detected through apha standard methods 63 ahpa awwa wef 2012 cod was detected by a measuring instrument 5b 3c lian hua tech china based on colorimetric digestion techniques the do concentration was detected using a wtw oxi 330 oxygen meter wtw weilheim in oberbayern germany a ph meter fe20 k mettler toledo switzerland was used to measure the ph 2 5 kinetic analysis as the plug flow pattern of the pcrbc water samples collected from the sampling sites could be converted into samples with different hrts as shown in eq 1 the x m represent the distance from water inlet to the sampling site and l m is the length of the package cage 1 t h 12 2 x l 0 08197 x monod kinetics equation was widely used in describe and predict the degradation of pollutants it contains the concentration of pollutant c in mg l maximum pollutant removal rate μ max in mg l h half saturation constants of pollutant k 0 in mg l represents the pollutant concentration when removal rate is half of μ max and time t in hour the equation is specified as 2 dc dt μ max c k 0 c the cod and nh4 n removing curve can be obtained by solving eq 2 data was processed by origin lab 8 5 software and matlab 2015a was used to calculate the kinetics of the pcrbc 2 6 dna extraction illumina miseq sequencing and statistical analysis microbial dna was extracted from biofilm collected from the surface of biocarriers by using the omega soil dna kit according to manufacturer s protocols the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactachvggg twtctaat for bacterial the pcr products were then quantified using quantifluor st blue fluorescence quantification system high throughput sequencing was conducted at majorbio co ltd shanghai china using the illumina miseq platform based on the valid samples obtained operational units otus were clustered with 97 similarity cutoff using uparse chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime version 7 1 http drive5 com uparse ace chao index shannon and simpson index were calculated to evaluate the community diversities of all samples one way analysis of variance anova nonlinear regressions and linear regressions with 95 confidence intervals were performed using origin lab 8 5 software the venn diagram was used to depict the similarity and difference of samples in different section of the prcbc heatmap of the top 30 genera were generated via the heatmap package in r 3 1 1 redundancy analysis rda was conducted to further explain the correlation between environmental variables including cod tn nh4 n no3 and o2 moreover in order to assess the relative contribution of environmental environmental variables to biofilm community structuring variation partitioning analysis vpa was carried out both rda and vpa were performed using canoco 5 software 29 3 results 3 1 wastewater treatment efficiency the quality of the effluent in the stable operation of pcrbc is shown in table 2 average value of 14 days it can be seen that the actual effluent cod of pcrbc meet the wastewater discharge standard requirements of cod 100 mg l and nh4 n 15 mg l comprehensive wastewater discharge standard of china gb18918 2002 it is worth noting that ammonia oxidizing efficiency aoe was stabilized at 99 and tn removal efficiency reached 70 82 3 98 the tn removal efficiency indicats that the microorganisms could completely degrade the considerable part of nitrogen compounds 3 2 analysis of changes in water quality indicators along the pcrbc fig 2 shows the dynamics of water index include do cod and nitrogen compound in the biofilm samples along the axis direction unremarkable changes were found in the value of salinity and temperature the do increased gradually from 0 89 mg l to 3 88 mg l from the inlet to the outlet since the oxygen was supplied through the rotation of the cage which was kept in the same speed the amount of re oxygenation in each part of the system was the same the do value indirectly reflects oxygen consumption in the biofilm it could be conjectured that the oxygen consumption and organic load degradation is mainly concentrated in the front section of the cage the effluent nh4 n was decreased sharply in the position of sample 2 and the removal rate over 99 could be kept in the position of sample 4 the effluent no3 n and tn show a tendency to decrease along the axis direction while began to increase in the middle part of the pcrbc the position of sample 5 then they decreased slowly continuously and was monitored to kept stable and maintained at low level at the position of sample 7 the changing trend of effluent cod was generally the same as nh4 n namely the pcrbc had a stable performance in the profile of simultaneous organic and nitrogen removal the comprehensive degradation coefficient of pollutants in the reactor was determined by the method of inverse calculation of measured data in the kinetic study the curve fitting toolbox in matlab were used to obtain the parameters of the monod kinetics all data with 12 2 h were summarized and displayed together with the removal kinetic curve based on the monod equation in fig 3 eqs 4 and 5 represents the relationship between pollutant concentration and the distance x m the curve fits well with the experimental data although the values the r2 value of the cod and nh4 n curves were higher than 0 95 indicating the reasonability on the selection of monod kinetics and assumption of plug flow in most cases 4 c cod mg l 774 7 e 0 1285 x 5 c n h 3 mg l 74 7 e 2 553 x in the comparison of the cod value and model value the rmse root mean square error is 58 42 mg l and the mre mean relative error is 8 44 compared nh4 n value with model value the rmse is 3 35 mg l 3 3 active community diversity on different samples to investigate the community spatial distribution on the surface of carriers in the pcrbc 16s rrna high throughput sequencing was conducted total 254 216 sequence were finally obtained in all the samples and 27 813 sequences for each sample further explored of bacterial diversity they were assigned into 677 otus 476 species 343 genera 217 families 125 orders 69 classes 33 phylum and 1 kingdom the bacterial diversity of out based on analyses of α diversity indices rank abundance curves rarefaction curves and venn diagram are shown in fig 4 a d the similar richness estimators ace and chao results showed that there are obvious changes along the axial direction in pcrbc especially between sample b1 and b2 or b3 p 0 05 indicating effect of environment change on microbial richness however little higher shannon and lower simpson indexes of samples b2 and b3 were discovered compared with samples b1 implying that the environment in the middle section of the pcrbc were more propitious to the bacterial diversity but there were no significant difference between them p 0 05 meanwhile high god s nonparametric estimators of coverage value were 99 6 data not shown in all samples meant that the miseq sequencing results were available for effective characterization of bacterial community rarefaction curves fig 4b indicated that the sampling of bacterial richness was complete and all samples were compared at an equivalent sequencing depth the rarefaction curves indicate that the species abundance of the sample was ranked as b2 b3 b1 besides the three curves were approach to plateau finally implying the abundant sequences red would generate few more otus the rank abundant curves fig 4a shows similar changing trend of evenness with the rarefaction curves the venn diagram is used to count the shared and unique otus of each sample as shown in fig 6d there are 537 co owned otus shared by all samples 3 4 active community structure on different samples along the pcrbc the population dynamics of the bacterial community within the biofilm samples distributing along the axial direction of the pcrbc were explored in the terms of top 7 abundant phyla and 32 abundant genera the results are revealed in fig 5 and fig 6 as shown in figs 5 and 8 phyla include proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes chlorobi actinobacteria planctomycetes dominating in all the samples proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the two dominant bacterial phyla accounting for about 36 43 49 54 in all samples however the third dominant phyla were chloroflex which was only account for 5 52 in b2 sample fig 6 presented the genus level abundance of the three samples all the samples consisted of 31 genera denitromonas thauera formosa and desulfomicrobium are the four dominant genus accounting for 15 37 9 17 5 32 and 4 24 in the b1 sample respectively thiothrix pseudomonas formosa and aequorivita genus dominated in the b2 sample accounting for 12 79 8 42 6 18 5 36 the same dominant genus also exits in the sample b3 moreover the abundance discrepancy of thiothrix 2 79 in b1 12 79 in b2 and 15 41 in b3 belongs to denitromonas 15 37 in b1 1 98 in b2 and 2 18 in b3 thauera 9 17 in b1 1 54 in b2 and 2 18 in b3 and desulfomicrobium 4 24 in b1 0 37 in b2 and 0 32 in b3 genus belong to proteobacteria phylum probably caused the difference in the first dominant phylum of the three samples 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of nitrogen compound along the pcrbc denitrification is a crucial part of nitrogen compound transfer in wastewater connecting ammonium oxidation through nitrification with dinitrogen molecule from nitrate or nitrite the nitrogen removal efficiency in the pcrbc is related to the dissolved oxygen and organic matters at the beginning of pcrbc 80 of nh4 n and 26 65 cod were removed from the mtww with the c n rising from 11 26 to 35 54 the high organic matter inhibits the nitrification process resulting in only 3 53 mg l of concentration of no3 n moreover the concentration of no2 n was kept below 1 mg l in the reactor since in pcrbc most of the tn were determined by the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n the results indicated that high tn removal efficiency was obtained at the beginning of pcrbc as can be seen in fig 2 the dissolved oxygen was below 1 67 mg l at the beginning of the prcbc therefore the data shows that conventional denitrification was the principal nitrogen removal pathway 26 the high organic concentration with little no3 n no2 n and nh4 n and limited do imply that a small quantity of nitrogen was removed through simultaneous partial or shortcut nitrification and denitrification process 23 41 at the middle and distal end part of the pcrbc the concentration of dissolve oxygen increased along the flow pathway from 2 89 mg l to 3 88 mg l meanwhile however the nh4 n was almost deplete below 3 37 mg l as demonstrated by existing studies the high do concentration higher than 1 9 mg l was not suitable for achieving stable partial nitridation anammox 3 under such conditions the concentration of no3 n grew to a maximum 31 02 mg l in the middle part of pcrbc indicating that the heterotrophic nitrification process occurred at the middle part of the pcrbc therefore the nh4 n was probably oxidized to no3 n with the do and organic matter such a conclusion is in consistent with previous research 41 4 2 the adaptation of microbial community to the salinity the salinity may pose threats to the processes of biological wastewater treatment in this study the pcrbc are very effective to remove the organic and nitrogen though the salinity in the mtww kept around 0 54 0 73 the cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiency could reached over 89 40 98 95 and 75 25 respectively the highest removal rate of cod nh4 n and tn could achieve 434 mg l h 113 mg l h and 111 05 mg l h respectively the average of the removal loading were 4 47 kg cod m3 filler d 0 52 kg nh4 n m3 filler d and 0 59 kg tn m3 filler d compared with other biofilm reactors the pcrbc had a better performance in removing organic and nitrogen simultaneously in wastewater or high salinity wastewater 25 31 34 43 52 in the pcrbc proteobacteria and bacteroidetes dominate in all the biofilm samples which is generally coincident with the previously reports that no matter under unsalted or salty condition proteobacteria was the most representative phylum with many functional species shared in wastewater treatment 35 53 the previous research also reveal that phyla bacteroidetes was dominant in high salinity wastewater treatment systems 28 bacteroidetes became more abundant as salinity increased compared to the proteobacteria bacteroidetes maintained stronger salinity tolerance 18 33 57 as chloroflexi can survive under any of the conditions in wastewater treatment plants because of their metabolic flexibility they have been often found in hypersaline wastewaters and marine environments 1 30 the role of chloroflexi played in anaerobic process was also hydrolytic fermentation functionalities firmicum are heterotrophic bacteria with obligatory anaerobe or facultative anaerobe most of the thick walled bacteria can produce spores which can resist dehydration and have strong adaptability to survive in the extreme environment the main function of this phylum is to degrade organic matter and the active enzymes such as glucanase pectinase and cellulase 23 in addition many references reported that firmicum plays an important role in denitrification 24 58 4 3 environmental factors impact on denitrification functional bacteria community structure obviously showed from fig 6 in the pcrbc system a large quantity of bacterial with nitrification and denitrification function was detected two important genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira with function of autotrophic nitrification were discovered to increase as the increase of do and decrease of cod it had been found that nitrospira was a ubiquitous nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob playing an important role in mtww and nitrosomonas was an important ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in the aerobic zone sludge 15 in the conventional nitrification process aob and nob convert nh4 n to no3 n collectively 23 the seven dominate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb included azoarcus formosa denitromonas flavobacterium thauera thiobacillus and desulfomicrobium genera indicated the conventional nitrogen removal process predominated which conducted the denitrification by using nitrate nitrite as electron acceptors 10 additionally heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria hn adb included pseudomonas paracocccus hydrogenophaga genera was founded in all the samples they can remove ammonia nitrogen under aerobic conditions and transform nitrification products to nitrogenous gas for rapid nitrogen removal 20 48 60 microbial community structure is not only regulated by biological factors but also influenced by abiotic factors such as environmental factors as shown in fig 7 rda analysis results show that dynamics of microorganism communities in the biological system were closely associated with the environmental variables cod tn do nh4 and no3 in pcrbc all the variables have significant influence on the community compositions especially for do p 0 032 and cod tn p 0 017 the dominated genera of azoarcus denitromonas thauera and desulfomicrobium clustered as hdb have the negative relationship with do and cod tn the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria anb including aob and nob including nitrosomonas and nitrospira was shown to have positive relationship with do the hn adb pseudomonas genus had the positive relationship with cod tn and do negative relationship with nh4 n the carbon resource could provide the electron suppler for the hn adb to conduct the heterotrophic nitrifying and the do ensure the denitrification 20 but the high ammonia nitrogen will inhabit the heterotrophic nitrification process 32 coinstantaneous all the variables were adopting for vpa analysis fig 8 vpa indicated that the no communities were explained by one single variable all the shared variables explained 12 27 of the discrepancy in the community additionally spearman correlation heatmap between all the variables and 30 genera were showed in the fig 9 most genus have significant correlations with do flavobacterium and norank c bacteroidetes vc2 1 bac22 belong to bacteroidetes phylum have weak correlations with conductivity nh4 n and g norank f saprospiraceae have weak correlations with no3 the blastocatella belong to bacteroidetes phylum have no significant relationship with cod tn all the environmental factors have obvious correlations with most top genera include desulfomicrobium paracocccus lewinella vitellibacter thauera thiothrix g unclassified f rhodobacteraceae aequorivita blastocatella denitromonas et al from the above analysis we can see that at the micro level the environmental factors have a more impact on the functional microorganisms of the system which can be transformed into reactor performance in the macroscopical perspective 4 4 bacteriomics characteristics based on genus level in pcrbc correlations between the topological structures of the bacterial communities in the opened pcrbc biofilm samples were calculated based on genus level the result was visualized in a network interface to explore significant bacterial interactions along the pollutant gradient in the pcrbc in our study an interconnection network was constructed based on the 16s rrna reads assigned to the 35 genera occurring with the highest abundances appearing in the biofilm samples in different locations the resulting network contained 35 nodes genera and 61 edges with an average node degree connectivity of 3 49 and a high modularity of 1 338 values 0 4 as shown in fig 10 the nodes frames with blue red and green colors represent the hdb anb and hn adb respectively the strongest correlation coefficient 1 96 as indicated by the thickest edges in fig 10 was observed between nob nitrospira and hn adb denitrifier pseudomonas both genera were simultaneously strongly correlated with blastocatella indicating that an increase in these three genera along the plug flowpath may be related to oxygen preference furthermore hn adb paracocccus also showed a strong correlation coefficient between 1 8 1 9 with aerobic bacterium filamentous thiothrix occupying 22 91 of the total 16s rrna sequences owenweeksia lewinella and vitellibacter the association among hn adb and other heterotrophic or aerobic bacteria indicated that functional bacteria presented related ecological niche preference whereas the co occurrence of hn adb paracocccus and filamentous thiothrix could suggest that thiothrix increased specific surface areas and promoting the absorption of pollutants overall the bacteria involved in nitrogen metabolism preponderance in the formation of the correlation networks thus organic matter oxygen and nitrogen availability seem to be the important factors that shape the microbial community structure in pcrbc all these bacteria contributed to the ecological balance and stable operation of the opened pcrbc system 4 5 the pathway of microbial denitrification in pcrbc traditional biological nitrogen removal in wastewater contains aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification pathways with no3 n no2 n as the main reaction intermediates to propose the mechanistic insight into the denitrification statistics of functional bacteria in denitrification are shown in fig 11 the anb autotrophic nitrifying bacteria including aob and nob hdb and hn adb was founded in all the samples with the hdb dominated in the denitrification process especially in samples b1 the amount of hn adb increased significantly in the samples b2 and b3 in the pcrbc system the removal rate of nh4 n was kept above 99 this implies the robustness of nitrification to a certain saline tress according to the structure of the biofilm the most of aob distributed in the out layer where enough penetrated oxygen is available especially when it was exposed in the air however the aob suffer from the salinity stress first previous study proved that the dense and complex excretion which was generated by the biofilm cover the microbes in the out layer for protection 21 large amount of tn was removed at the beginning end of pcrbc suggesting that denitrification performance remained unaffected with the salinity the hdb was inhabitant in the inner anoxic layer of the biofilm which was supposed to be sheltered by the surface of the mattress to resist the stress of the saline mtww 6 10 in the samples b1 the abundant of hnd reached 39 39 meant the aerobic nitrification heterotrophic denitrification an hd dominate the whole process of denitrification however in the samples b2 and b3 except traditional denitrification an hd the heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hn ad also played an important role in the system the hn ad are recent interests for nitrogen removal in wastewater because of their high cost effectiveness 30 48 59 the previous study demonstrated two types of nitrate reductase in hn adb heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria contains nar membrane bound nitrate reductase and nap periplasmic nitrate reductase the nar which are sensitive to o2 is inhabited completely in the aerobic condition on the contrary the nap represents the original function efficiently under the aerobic condition which was considered as the controller of denitrification process 13 base on the nitrate oxygen co respiration mechanism theory both o2 and no3 can be used as electron acceptors and the electrons can be transferred to o2 the respiratory chain of aerobic denitrifying bacteria was considered as highly differentiated so as the flow of electrons to the denitrification pathway may overcome the postulated bottleneck in transferring electrons to oxygen via cytochrome c and cytochrome aa3 o2 is no longer the key factor to inhibit denitrification when aerobic denitrifying bacteria complete the respiration the transition electrons can be transferred to nitrate through nap to complete the denitrification 22 the research on hn ad mechanism reveal two nitrogen remove pathway elaborated in fig 12 nh2oh is oxidized to no2 n and no3 n under the catalysis of hao hydroxylamine oxidase the nox n is reduced to no by nar and nir nitrite reductase and then contiguously reduced to nitrogenous gas such as n2o and n2 through nor nitric oxide reductase and nos nitrous oxide reductase respectively 61 some research disclosure that most hn adb appeared to have denitrification activity when the do is below 4 mg l in the other side the nir was restrained when the do is below 2 mg l this phenomenon explained the changing trend of the hn adb in different samples the do played a vital role to affect the survive of hn adb for some other nh adb it is speculated the nh4 n is metabolized directly to n2 because of the undetected nar nir and any other midbody 62 it has been reported that the nitrification mainly conducted by aob and nob was widely regarded as a limited step of reaction speed in the conventional denitrification process 2 but the high salinity deteriorated the survive of aob and nob while the aob can tolerate the 2 9 nacl or higher salinity 15 the nob could completely inhabit at the exposure to the 1 96 nacl 42 however in the current study the salinity 0 54 0 73 nacl in the mtww didn t have significant inhibition of anb which had a significant effect on the nitrification rate 14 the heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria are supposed to have better nitrification performance in saline wastewater treatment system however when the salinity of the wastewater is more than 1 they may not perform efficiently in nitrification process 10 30 the paracocccus and pseudomonas detected in this system were depicted as an identified hn ad functional genus being highly adaptable to high saline and high organic matter concentration in the previous studies 17 55 some research also revealed the facts that the cod tn ratio had great significant effects on microbial community structure and metabolic pathways 37 48 the results showed the nh adb pseudomonas bacillus paracoccus and halomonas preferred to cod tn ratio of 25 in the studies 37 in this study the cod tn ration was 17 24 at the middle part of the pcrbc similar to that of previous studies as such a remarkable raise of related abundance of nh adb was also observed see fig 11 based on the denitrification performances and detected functional bacterial the simultaneous nitrogen and carbon removal routs were proposed at different samples b1 b2 since the cod and nh4 n were greatly depleted deficiency of carbon source and electron acceptors nitrate nitrite will affect the traditional denitrification efficiency reliable result might be mainly guaranteed by the hn ad 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that the pcrbc had good ability to remove the cod and nitrogen in the saline mtww the average removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tn were 90 49 99 12 and 70 82 respectively since the changing biofilm external microenvironment generated by alternate exposure of the biofilm to wastewater and air promoted the growth of bacterial community 16s rrna high throughput sequencing revealed the spatial evolution of the microbial community structures along the flow pathway the bacterium community populations at the middle and distal end of the pcrbc train were completely different with those at the beginning of the pcrbc through the analysis of the water indexes and functional microbiome along the axis direction it is founded that except for the conventional denitrification the hn ad combined with short cut denitrification was speculated as an important denitrification pathway especially in the middle and distal end of the pcrbc taken together this study provides a comprehensive insight into the organic s degradation characteristics and bacterial profiles of pcrbc treating complex industrial wastewater credit authorship contribution statement yang dong investigation formal analysis writing original draft jinsong guo conceptualization project

13293,decentralized greywater treatment is gaining increasing recognition as an alternative for natural water supplies laundry wastewater in relatively large amounts of greywater is considered as a valuable resource with high reuse potential however organic pollutants with low molecular weights e g anionic surfactants that originate from laundry additives should be effectively removed because anionic surfactants are widely used to produce detergents the retention of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs a typical anionic surfactant in laundry wastewater was evaluated with a bench scale ceramic ultrafiltration uf membrane filtration system the results demonstrate that sdbs can be successfully retained with a ceramic uf membrane with a nominal pore size of 1 kda 4 0 nm by carefully controlling several operating parameters the dynamic phase changes of the surfactant that depend on its concentration affect the sdbs retention performances regardless of the operating parameters at a high transmembrane pressure tmp and room temperature the sdbs micelles that form on the membrane surface cause a pre sieving effect induced by concentration polarization thereby increasing the sdbs retention as the solution ph increased electrostatic repulsion between the solute and membrane surface induced higher sdbs retention rates the retention rate also increased significantly with increasing ionic strength which was especially pronounced with divalent ions than with monovalent ions because higher ion specificity could reduce the charge repulsion and induce their micellization these electrostatic and adsorptive interaction could demonstrate a better understanding of surfactant retention mechanisms consequently ceramic uf membranes have the potential of treating laundry wastewater attaining moderately high concentrations of surfactants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anionic surfactant ceramic ultrafiltration greywater laundry wastewater micellization 1 introduction nowadays decentralized greywater treatment systems serve as a viable option for freshwater consumption providing sufficient potable and non potable water to relatively small communities 1 2 greywater is defined as wastewater generated in showers baths kitchen sinks dishwashers and washing machines without the input from toilets i e blackwater in households 1 these inputs attain greater treatment potential than blackwater owing to its larger volume and relatively less polluted nature nonetheless it contains high concentration of xenobiotics originating from many household cleaning products 3 laundry wastewater accounts for 30 to 40 of total greywater and 5 1 to 18 4 of the total annual water consumption per household 4 laundry greywater is heavily polluted with inorganics e g suspended solids phosphates and sodium salts and with even more often organic contaminants including fog fat oil and grease detergents emulsifiers and so forth 1 the biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod loadings of laundry wastewater are reported in the range of 23 1300 mg l and 791 15 000 mg l respectively 5 6 surfactants are the most important contributors of organic loading in industrial commercial and domestic laundry wastewater table s1 of the appendix a when discharged without proper treatment the toxicity of the surfactants poses a long term threat on aquatic environments 7 9 recently laundry wastewater was also identified as a major source for synthetic and natural microfibers 10 11 therefore this paper presents a preliminary study on removing surfactant from domestically produced laundry wastewater to examine its potential as a valuable resource for water reclamation researchers have suggested biological treatment processes as cost effective alternatives with surfactant retention rates of 20 to 76 12 16 the presence of surfactants in biological wastewater treatment plants can reduce the microbial degradation kinetics and cause incomplete and inefficient processes the results exceed the guideline values for the effluent water quality and average hydraulic retention time hrt 17 in addition higher surfactant concentrations cause stable foams in aerobic and anaerobic treatments in conventional wastewater treatment plants 8 16 18 19 thus many researchers have investigated various physical and chemical treatment methods to mitigate the surfactant concentration in domestic wastewater anionic surfactants achieve retention rates of more than 95 through electrochemical oxidation flocculation or adsorption processes 20 21 however these processes expand the demand for more chemical additives which as a result increases sludge production 22 physical treatment specifically membrane filtration is a promising technology for decentralized greywater treatment systems it exhibits a small footprint and enables easy retrofit and upgrade of a treatment plant accordingly many studies have experimented with polymeric membranes of various pore sizes to remove anionic surfactants 23 since surfactants are organic substances with relatively low molecular weights smaller membrane pores that enable nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro seems more suitable than microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes 24 however the direct use of nf and ro leads to extensive membrane fouling which significantly decreases water permeation flux to as much as 1 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 21 and thereby increase the cost of membrane cleaning preventing long term stable operations than with mf and uf membranes furthermore membranes with small pore sizes require high applied pressure above 25 0 bar 21 25 27 many researchers have reported that polymeric uf membranes which are cost effective at low pressure can remove low molecular weight surfactants 23 28 as a result of the filtration of the polymeric uf membrane with 10 kda of polysulfone up to approximately 80 of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds surfactant was effectively removed from a 5 0 mg l concentration feed at 1 2 bar operation 23 which is comparable to 62 73 obtained from ro membrane filtration 27 however the surfactant retention rates remarkedly decreased as surfactant concentrations increased 23 this implies that polymeric uf membranes are generally inadequate for long term operation of wastewater generated from domestic and commercial sources which contains moderate to high concentrations of surfactant as listed in table s1 of the appendix a compared to polymeric uf membranes ceramic uf membranes are chemically stable and thus preferred in treating a wide range of surfactant concentrations from the perspective of retention rates the ceramic membrane exhibited higher sds retention rates compared to polymeric membrane most importantly the permeability produced by ceramic uf membrane is significantly higher than those of polymeric uf membrane 21 29 30 although the membrane pore size is not exactly the same the permeability reached 50 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 using ceramic uf membrane 29 whereas polymeric uf membranes only ranged between 4 2 and 29 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 while treating approximately 300 mg l of sds 23 compared to polymeric uf membranes ceramic uf membranes are preferred because shorter hrts due to the higher water permeation flux are essential in decentralized greywater treatment systems in addition they are suitable for treating greywater containing a variety of strong chemicals from household detergents 21 in this study the anionic surfactant retention rate of commercially available ceramic uf membranes was investigated they are the most common chemicals in laundry wastewater first a surfactant retention experiment was conducted to identify the most suitable ceramic uf membranes and pore size in respect to three different surfactant concentrations second the effects of the independent operating parameters including the initial surfactant concentration transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature on the surfactant retention rate were systematically investigated finally the retention performance for the anionic surfactants was investigated to comprehensively study the electrostatic interaction under various ph and ionic strength conditions in different electrolyte solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of ceramic uf membranes the physical characteristics of the ceramic membranes used in this study are summarized in table 1 commercially available ceramic uf and fine uf membranes with four different pore sizes 1 5 15 and 150 kda from sterlitech corp kent wa were used to investigate the effect of the membrane pore size on the surfactant retention efficiency according to the manufacturer the 1 and 5 kda tio2 ceramic membranes are defined as fine uf and the 15 and 150 kda zro2 membranes are defined as uf membranes the actual pore sizes of the ceramic uf membranes were determined by measuring the rejection rate for polyethylene glycol peg sigma aldrich oakville ontario canada and polyethylene oxides peo sigma aldrich st louis mo with several different molecular weights ranging from 300 da to 600 kda the molecular weight cut off mwco of a membrane refers to the minimal molecular weight of organic solutes i e peg and peo in this study in which 90 of the solute can be retained the ceramic uf membranes were filtered with 1 g l peg and peo solutions at 4 0 bar for 2 h with a diaphragm booster pump cs 0580q hl cse co ltd south korea 31 the retention rates for peg or peo were determined by measuring the non purgeable organic carbon npoc concentration in the feed and the permeate with a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu corp kyoto japan the chemical compositions and surface charges of ceramic uf membranes of two different materials were measured to identify the retention mechanisms energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis was performed with fe sem aurgia carl zeiss germany to determine the surface elemental composition of the ceramic uf membranes the membrane surface charges were analyzed through zeta potential measurements with a zeta potential analyzer elsz 2000 otsuka electronics co ltd osaka japan that uses dynamic light scattering to capture the electrophoretic mobility of particles the surface charge was measured in the micro electrophoresis mode which involves the zeta potential analysis of fine membrane particles to prepare the samples the ceramic uf membrane was powdered with a ceramic mortar and the average size of the powdered fine membrane particles was analyzed with a particle size distribution analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical ltd malvern united kingdom the average particle size was approximately 10 μm 2 2 anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs c18h29nao3s sigma aldrich france was selected as the representative substance for evaluating the anionic surfactant retention efficiency of different types of ceramic uf membranes the determined sdbs concentrations were 100 500 and 1000 mg l based on the critical micelle concentration cmc 1 9 mmol l 677 1 mg l sdbs in this study fig s1 of the appendix a which represents their dynamic phase change from monomers below the cmc to micelles above the cmc most importantly 100 mg l sdbs concentration is meant to represent the concentration of anionic surfactant produced from domestic laundry wastewater as shown in table s1 of the appendix a although 500 and 1000 mg l sdbs concentrations are rarely observed in domestic laundry wastewater it proposes an instance of detergent spikes common in commercial laundries the cmc was determined based on a conductometric method whereby the sdbs concentration at which a sudden declining electric conductivity trend indicates the point of phase change 32 the feed sdbs concentration was linearly proportional to the measured toc concentration fig s2 of the appendix a thus the retention rate was determined by measuring the toc concentrations in the feed and permeate samples in the filtration experiments to investigate the effect of the ionic strength on the surfactant retention rate the ionic concentrations were adjusted with sodium chloride nacl 99 w w and calcium chloride cacl2 96 w w from samchun chemical co ltd seoul south korea every solution was prepared with deionized di water direct q 3 water purification system millipore corp billerica ma 2 3 ceramic uf membrane filtration system the schematic of the bench scale ceramic uf membrane filtration system is presented in fig 1 the retention characteristics of the ceramic uf membranes were studied with a dead end ceramic disc holder sterlitech corp kent wa the commercially available ceramic uf membranes with effective membrane surface areas of 13 1 cm2 were placed in between two viton rubber o rings and tightly sealed with screws the new membrane was stored in di water for 24 h and compressed at 3 0 bar for stabilization before starting each filtration experiment afterwards a prepared feed solution was inserted with a gear pump labscitech inc corona ca and the permeate was automatically weighed with an electronic scale gx 4000 a d company ltd tokyo japan the working volume and stirring speed of the feed vessel were 1 0 l and 100 rpm respectively subsequently retention experiments with the anionic surfactant were conducted to determine the removal mechanism of the ceramic uf membranes the retention efficiencies for the anionic surfactants were studied at tmps of 1 5 and 3 0 bar temperatures of 25 and 55 c ph values of 4 10 and ionic strengths of 1 100 mm after each filtration experiment the ceramic membrane was chemically cleaned according to the modified version of the cleaning regime recommended by the manufacturer fouled ceramic uf membranes were removed from the disc holder 3 h after the filtration experiments and soaked in a 0 5 m naoh solution heated to 50 c for 15 min to desorb foulants then the membranes were adequately flushed with di water for 10 min this soak and flush process was repeated with 0 0075 m h3po4 solution to ensure identical experimental conditions permeate flux was determined to provide an estimation of the flux recovery which is the calculation of how much flux is recovered due to chemical cleaning 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ceramic membrane properties on surfactant removal efficiency the effects of the ceramic membrane properties with four different pore sizes 1 5 15 and 150 kda on the removal efficiency for anionic surfactants was investigated to identify the most suitable ceramic uf membrane fig 2 the relatively accurate membrane pore sizes were assumed to be the molecular weights of the organic solutes i e peg and peo achieving a 90 removal rate in this study the aforementioned molecular weights of peg and peo were used to estimate the pore sizes of the commercially available ceramic uf membranes which are 1 5 15 and 150 kda according to the manufacturer fig 3 the mwcos in daltons were converted to metric size nm with the einstein stokes diameter equation for peg and peo 33 the computed nominal pore sizes of the commercially available ceramic uf membranes are listed in table 2 as expected the sdbs removal rate increased with decreasing pore size of the ceramic uf membranes at the initial sdbs concentrations other studies showed increases of approximately 50 to 65 for pore sizes that decreased from 30 to 5 kda at concentrations above the cmc 34 when the surfactant concentration exceeds the cmc individual monomers self aggregate into spherical or rod like forms i e micelles and become thermodynamically soluble in liquids however the hydrodynamic diameter of the sdbs micelles 2 9 nm 35 is still smaller than the pore size of the 5 kda membrane approximately 11 4 nm thus the sdbs retention rates are expected to be low regardless of the initial concentrations nonetheless other researchers have reported that a significant amount of surfactant can be removed even when the molecular weight is sufficiently low such that it can penetrate the pores of the 5 kda membrane 36 these uf membranes can occasionally retain surfactant molecules via the size exclusion effect because pores that are smaller than the nominal pore size presumably the minimal pore sizes could filter them therefore the ceramic membrane with 1 kda attaining the lowest nominal pore size was better than the 5 15 and 150 kda ceramic uf membranes although the retention rate of sdbs increased with decreasing pore size it is worth noting that the retention rates of the 5 and 15 kda membranes are relatively similar despite the different pore sizes a possible explanation is the different chemical compositions of the ceramic uf membranes as shown in fig s3 of the appendix a this is consistent with the study of medina et al 37 who showed that the adsorption capacity of zro2 ceramic membranes is higher than that of tio2 ceramic membranes when exposed to 1 mm sdbs solution at a neutral ph this can be because the isoelectric point of charge of zro2 ceramic membranes phiep 5 5 6 6 is greater than that of tio2 ceramic membranes phiep 5 2 6 3 hence zro2 ceramic membranes are slightly more positive and can thereby better attract sdbs via electrostatic interaction all ceramic uf membranes exhibited an increase in the retention efficiency with increasing initial concentration because the surfactants underwent multiple phase changes at a low surfactant concentration the surfactants can access the pores more easily because the majority exists as free monomers that can penetrate larger membrane pores 38 39 however at concentrations just below the cmc there is an important phase in which the monomeric surfactants transition into pre micelles 40 as the pre micelle concentration increases the blockage of intermediate pores at early stages of the uf filtration process decreases the porosity of the uf membranes 41 42 in fact decreased membrane porosity often leads to decreased membrane permeability and increased ion retention 43 this suggests that pore blockage improves the retention efficiency such as demonstrated by the results the 500 mg l sdbs furthermore all ceramic uf membranes showed the highest removal rates when the initial sdbs concentration was 1000 mg l at concentrations above the cmc the pre micelles convert to micelles that can retain free monomers in the concentration polarization layer this micelle induced concentration polarization layer due to long term deposition of micelles leads to the formation of a pre sieving layer that can promote sdbs retention 3 2 effect of transmembrane pressure on surfactant removal efficiency fig 4 a shows the sdbs retention rate of the 1 kda ceramic uf membrane under different tmp conditions at various initial sdbs concentrations with increasing initial sdbs concentration the retention rate increased to 21 6 50 3 and 65 2 at a tmp of 3 0 bar and to 18 0 21 8 and 33 5 at a tmp of 1 5 bar at sdbs concentrations 100 mg l and 500 mg l below cmc the sdbs retention rate was relatively low this can be explained by the fact that surfactants mainly exist as free monomers which are essentially difficult to remove with 1 kda ceramic membranes regardless of the tmp by contrast at a relatively higher sdbs concentration 1000 mg l especially above cmc the sdbs retention rate at a tmp of 3 0 bar was significantly improved in addition larger molecules such as pre micelles and micelles occurring at higher surfactant concentrations are assumed to be better rejected a higher tmp can compress the concentration polarization layer into a sieve like structure that gives rise to the pre sieving effect consequently increasing the filterability of the membrane against surfactants 44 as this layer thickens with increasing concentration more filterable layers are built thus more sdbs surfactants are filtered by the layer this was evident in fig 4 b in which the normalized flux after 200 min of 1000 mg l sdbs filtration at 3 0 bar was remarkedly reduced to 0 24 whereas 1 5 bar was slightly decreased to 0 67 the greater flux decline is presumed to be the outcome of greater membrane resistance that was developed by concentration polarization and pore clogging at 3 0 bar operation 45 therefore the sdbs retention rate increased progressively with increasing initial sdbs concentration at a high tmp while it increased relatively smoothly at a low tmp for this reason micellization induced by surfactant concentration and concentration polarization induced by the applied pressure had obvious effects on the retention efficiency of the ceramic uf membrane as surfactant concentration and tmp increased 3 3 effect of temperature on surfactant removal efficiency in this study the ceramic uf filtration experiments were conducted at room temperature 24 9 2 7 c and high temperature 53 5 2 0 c at a tmp of 3 0 bar this is the expected temperature range of discharged laundry wastewater greywater normally has a temperature range of 15 35 c the high temperatures can originate from warm water used in washing machines therefore the surfactant removal mechanism should be investigated according to the temperature of the solutions in general the intermolecular forces between molecules weakens with increasing temperature and thereby decreases the viscosity of a solution in accordance to darcy s laws this effectively increases the permeate flux at constant tmp 28 mainly because of the decreasing drag force of solutes 46 which in this case are surfactants at the same time high temperature facilitates surfactant desorption and increases the concentration of the feed 25 46 as a result this increases the permeate sdbs concentration as more surfactants are transferred due to high permeability in fact the initial permeate flux at high and room temperature were each 47 0 l m 2 h 1 and 30 6 l m 2 h 1 indicating that high temperatures are associated with higher water permeability due to the relatively lower viscosity subsequently the relative retention efficiency of high initial sdbs concentration at high temperature to room temperature decreased fig 5 a induced micellization becomes interrupted at high temperature because the structured water molecules surrounding the hydrophobic groups break down to reduce the hydrodynamic radius 34 this allows the size of surfactant aggregates to decrease which then facilitates the infiltration of sdbs increasing the permeate sdbs concentration fig 5 b presents the normalized flux of 1000 mg l sdbs at two different temperature conditions the normalized flux at room temperature was rapidly decreased to 0 24 for initial 200 min filtration while the high temperature operation showed a relatively slight reduction of normalized flux up to 0 39 during the same filtration time although the concentration was high enough to cause considerable fouling the effect of concentration polarization was significantly reduced at higher temperature because it is less likely for sdbs to accumulate on the membrane surface hence the sdbs retention rate at room temperature was higher than at high temperature conditions with increasing initial sdbs concentration taken together these observations suggest that the treatment and filtration performance are sufficiently acceptable as compared to that of other ceramic and polymeric membrane filtrations conducted at similar operational conditions table 3 although the highly permeable property of ceramic membranes causes surfactant retention rates to be equivalent or slightly lower than polymeric membranes ceramic membrane filtration performances were distinctly superior to polymeric membranes in this respect ceramic uf membrane is a promising competitive material for the treatment of surfactant containing wastewater 3 4 effect of solution chemistry ph and ionic strength on surfactant removal efficiency we demonstrated the sdbs retention performance of the 1 kda ceramic uf membranes at a ph range of 4 10 to comprehensively investigate the electrostatic interaction between the ceramic membranes and solutes fig 6 in general the surface charge of a ceramic membrane depends on the ph of the bulk solution thus the ph conditions can exert repulsive or attractive forces that interfere with the transfer of surfactants 48 we observed a lower sdbs permeate concentration at high ph because the zeta potential of the 1 kda ceramic uf membrane decreased with increasing ph fig 7 hence the anionic surfactants are repelled by the membrane surface due to the collision of identical charges above the isoelectric point of the ceramic membrane phiep 3 9 this implies that at a higher ph presumably above ph 4 the membrane charges become mostly negative and the subsequent charge repulsion increases the sdbs retention rate furthermore fig 8 presents the sdbs retention performance at inorganic salt nacl and cacl2 concentrations of 1 10 and 100 mm the sdbs retention rate increased significantly with increasing ionic strength this was pronounced with divalent ions than with monovalent ions compared to the result without electrolyte additives approximately 21 6 the sdbs retention rate increased significantly from 43 5 at 1 mm to 57 1 at 100 mm of cacl2 by contrast it increased only slightly from 12 6 at 1 mm to 28 5 at 100 mm nacl interestingly the sdbs retention rate at 0 mm of nacl was slightly higher than those at 1 mm and 10 mm of nacl this could be explained by that na electrolyte was responsible for decreasing the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule chain of an anionic polymer leading to greater transfer of sdbs through membrane pores 49 however at a higher ionic strength the salting out effect caused the charge repulsion between surfactant heads to decrease because surfactants are inclined to form micelles this decreased the cmc and increased the micelle aggregation number which overall increased the hydrodynamic size of surfactant aggregates at higher salt concentrations 50 52 the extent of size growth is greater with ca2 ions because divalent ions typically have higher ion specificity that enables them to screen negative charges faster than monovalent ions 53 54 hence ca2 ions can effectively weaken charge repulsion between surfactant heads and promote micellization that consequently increases sdbs retention rates in addition a few studies have stated that the greater affinity of ca2 ions to negatively charged membrane surfaces and the subsequent cation bridging could have increased sdbs retention rate via adsorption 53 besides these precipitation during cacl2 addition experiments could have also influenced the retention rate according to noïk et al 55 ca2 ions are more likely to become supersaturated than na ions at identical concentrations of inorganic salts it is probable that precipitates induced by ca2 decreased the membrane porosity resulting in lower sdbs concentration in the permeate 34 the result in this study is consistent with the results in previous research showing that the ion retention rate increases with increasing valency of salt used for removing surfactants with ceramic mf membranes 56 57 therefore cacl2 increased the sdbs retention rate to a greater extent than nacl because of its ion specificity and precipitation capacity 4 conclusions commercially available ceramic uf membranes with different pore sizes were investigated to evaluate the retention mechanism of low molecular weight anionic surfactants which are always present in laundry wastewater because the hydrodynamic diameter of surfactants is generally smaller than the typical pore size of ceramic uf membranes a high retention rate cannot be expected nonetheless the retention rate of sdbs a typical anionic surfactant in the bench scale ceramic membrane filtration system increased with decreasing pore size increasing tmp and decreasing temperature accordingly the ceramic uf membrane of 1 kda was better than other ceramic uf membranes and the solution chemistry further improved the retention mechanism increasing ph and ionic strength interacted with electrostatic repulsion and benefited the ceramic uf filtration system these results would greatly help to improve the relatively lower retention rate of surfactant concentration that is typically lower than cmc in real laundry wastewater treatments furthermore the results can be used as guidance for designing decentralized greywater

13293,decentralized greywater treatment is gaining increasing recognition as an alternative for natural water supplies laundry wastewater in relatively large amounts of greywater is considered as a valuable resource with high reuse potential however organic pollutants with low molecular weights e g anionic surfactants that originate from laundry additives should be effectively removed because anionic surfactants are widely used to produce detergents the retention of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs a typical anionic surfactant in laundry wastewater was evaluated with a bench scale ceramic ultrafiltration uf membrane filtration system the results demonstrate that sdbs can be successfully retained with a ceramic uf membrane with a nominal pore size of 1 kda 4 0 nm by carefully controlling several operating parameters the dynamic phase changes of the surfactant that depend on its concentration affect the sdbs retention performances regardless of the operating parameters at a high transmembrane pressure tmp and room temperature the sdbs micelles that form on the membrane surface cause a pre sieving effect induced by concentration polarization thereby increasing the sdbs retention as the solution ph increased electrostatic repulsion between the solute and membrane surface induced higher sdbs retention rates the retention rate also increased significantly with increasing ionic strength which was especially pronounced with divalent ions than with monovalent ions because higher ion specificity could reduce the charge repulsion and induce their micellization these electrostatic and adsorptive interaction could demonstrate a better understanding of surfactant retention mechanisms consequently ceramic uf membranes have the potential of treating laundry wastewater attaining moderately high concentrations of surfactants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anionic surfactant ceramic ultrafiltration greywater laundry wastewater micellization 1 introduction nowadays decentralized greywater treatment systems serve as a viable option for freshwater consumption providing sufficient potable and non potable water to relatively small communities 1 2 greywater is defined as wastewater generated in showers baths kitchen sinks dishwashers and washing machines without the input from toilets i e blackwater in households 1 these inputs attain greater treatment potential than blackwater owing to its larger volume and relatively less polluted nature nonetheless it contains high concentration of xenobiotics originating from many household cleaning products 3 laundry wastewater accounts for 30 to 40 of total greywater and 5 1 to 18 4 of the total annual water consumption per household 4 laundry greywater is heavily polluted with inorganics e g suspended solids phosphates and sodium salts and with even more often organic contaminants including fog fat oil and grease detergents emulsifiers and so forth 1 the biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod loadings of laundry wastewater are reported in the range of 23 1300 mg l and 791 15 000 mg l respectively 5 6 surfactants are the most important contributors of organic loading in industrial commercial and domestic laundry wastewater table s1 of the appendix a when discharged without proper treatment the toxicity of the surfactants poses a long term threat on aquatic environments 7 9 recently laundry wastewater was also identified as a major source for synthetic and natural microfibers 10 11 therefore this paper presents a preliminary study on removing surfactant from domestically produced laundry wastewater to examine its potential as a valuable resource for water reclamation researchers have suggested biological treatment processes as cost effective alternatives with surfactant retention rates of 20 to 76 12 16 the presence of surfactants in biological wastewater treatment plants can reduce the microbial degradation kinetics and cause incomplete and inefficient processes the results exceed the guideline values for the effluent water quality and average hydraulic retention time hrt 17 in addition higher surfactant concentrations cause stable foams in aerobic and anaerobic treatments in conventional wastewater treatment plants 8 16 18 19 thus many researchers have investigated various physical and chemical treatment methods to mitigate the surfactant concentration in domestic wastewater anionic surfactants achieve retention rates of more than 95 through electrochemical oxidation flocculation or adsorption processes 20 21 however these processes expand the demand for more chemical additives which as a result increases sludge production 22 physical treatment specifically membrane filtration is a promising technology for decentralized greywater treatment systems it exhibits a small footprint and enables easy retrofit and upgrade of a treatment plant accordingly many studies have experimented with polymeric membranes of various pore sizes to remove anionic surfactants 23 since surfactants are organic substances with relatively low molecular weights smaller membrane pores that enable nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro seems more suitable than microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes 24 however the direct use of nf and ro leads to extensive membrane fouling which significantly decreases water permeation flux to as much as 1 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 21 and thereby increase the cost of membrane cleaning preventing long term stable operations than with mf and uf membranes furthermore membranes with small pore sizes require high applied pressure above 25 0 bar 21 25 27 many researchers have reported that polymeric uf membranes which are cost effective at low pressure can remove low molecular weight surfactants 23 28 as a result of the filtration of the polymeric uf membrane with 10 kda of polysulfone up to approximately 80 of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds surfactant was effectively removed from a 5 0 mg l concentration feed at 1 2 bar operation 23 which is comparable to 62 73 obtained from ro membrane filtration 27 however the surfactant retention rates remarkedly decreased as surfactant concentrations increased 23 this implies that polymeric uf membranes are generally inadequate for long term operation of wastewater generated from domestic and commercial sources which contains moderate to high concentrations of surfactant as listed in table s1 of the appendix a compared to polymeric uf membranes ceramic uf membranes are chemically stable and thus preferred in treating a wide range of surfactant concentrations from the perspective of retention rates the ceramic membrane exhibited higher sds retention rates compared to polymeric membrane most importantly the permeability produced by ceramic uf membrane is significantly higher than those of polymeric uf membrane 21 29 30 although the membrane pore size is not exactly the same the permeability reached 50 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 using ceramic uf membrane 29 whereas polymeric uf membranes only ranged between 4 2 and 29 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 while treating approximately 300 mg l of sds 23 compared to polymeric uf membranes ceramic uf membranes are preferred because shorter hrts due to the higher water permeation flux are essential in decentralized greywater treatment systems in addition they are suitable for treating greywater containing a variety of strong chemicals from household detergents 21 in this study the anionic surfactant retention rate of commercially available ceramic uf membranes was investigated they are the most common chemicals in laundry wastewater first a surfactant retention experiment was conducted to identify the most suitable ceramic uf membranes and pore size in respect to three different surfactant concentrations second the effects of the independent operating parameters including the initial surfactant concentration transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature on the surfactant retention rate were systematically investigated finally the retention performance for the anionic surfactants was investigated to comprehensively study the electrostatic interaction under various ph and ionic strength conditions in different electrolyte solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of ceramic uf membranes the physical characteristics of the ceramic membranes used in this study are summarized in table 1 commercially available ceramic uf and fine uf membranes with four different pore sizes 1 5 15 and 150 kda from sterlitech corp kent wa were used to investigate the effect of the membrane pore size on the surfactant retention efficiency according to the manufacturer the 1 and 5 kda tio2 ceramic membranes are defined as fine uf and the 15 and 150 kda zro2 membranes are defined as uf membranes the actual pore sizes of the ceramic uf membranes were determined by measuring the rejection rate for polyethylene glycol peg sigma aldrich oakville ontario canada and polyethylene oxides peo sigma aldrich st louis mo with several different molecular weights ranging from 300 da to 600 kda the molecular weight cut off mwco of a membrane refers to the minimal molecular weight of organic solutes i e peg and peo in this study in which 90 of the solute can be retained the ceramic uf membranes were filtered with 1 g l peg and peo solutions at 4 0 bar for 2 h with a diaphragm booster pump cs 0580q hl cse co ltd south korea 31 the retention rates for peg or peo were determined by measuring the non purgeable organic carbon npoc concentration in the feed and the permeate with a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu corp kyoto japan the chemical compositions and surface charges of ceramic uf membranes of two different materials were measured to identify the retention mechanisms energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis was performed with fe sem aurgia carl zeiss germany to determine the surface elemental composition of the ceramic uf membranes the membrane surface charges were analyzed through zeta potential measurements with a zeta potential analyzer elsz 2000 otsuka electronics co ltd osaka japan that uses dynamic light scattering to capture the electrophoretic mobility of particles the surface charge was measured in the micro electrophoresis mode which involves the zeta potential analysis of fine membrane particles to prepare the samples the ceramic uf membrane was powdered with a ceramic mortar and the average size of the powdered fine membrane particles was analyzed with a particle size distribution analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical ltd malvern united kingdom the average particle size was approximately 10 μm 2 2 anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs c18h29nao3s sigma aldrich france was selected as the representative substance for evaluating the anionic surfactant retention efficiency of different types of ceramic uf membranes the determined sdbs concentrations were 100 500 and 1000 mg l based on the critical micelle concentration cmc 1 9 mmol l 677 1 mg l sdbs in this study fig s1 of the appendix a which represents their dynamic phase change from monomers below the cmc to micelles above the cmc most importantly 100 mg l sdbs concentration is meant to represent the concentration of anionic surfactant produced from domestic laundry wastewater as shown in table s1 of the appendix a although 500 and 1000 mg l sdbs concentrations are rarely observed in domestic laundry wastewater it proposes an instance of detergent spikes common in commercial laundries the cmc was determined based on a conductometric method whereby the sdbs concentration at which a sudden declining electric conductivity trend indicates the point of phase change 32 the feed sdbs concentration was linearly proportional to the measured toc concentration fig s2 of the appendix a thus the retention rate was determined by measuring the toc concentrations in the feed and permeate samples in the filtration experiments to investigate the effect of the ionic strength on the surfactant retention rate the ionic concentrations were adjusted with sodium chloride nacl 99 w w and calcium chloride cacl2 96 w w from samchun chemical co ltd seoul south korea every solution was prepared with deionized di water direct q 3 water purification system millipore corp billerica ma 2 3 ceramic uf membrane filtration system the schematic of the bench scale ceramic uf membrane filtration system is presented in fig 1 the retention characteristics of the ceramic uf membranes were studied with a dead end ceramic disc holder sterlitech corp kent wa the commercially available ceramic uf membranes with effective membrane surface areas of 13 1 cm2 were placed in between two viton rubber o rings and tightly sealed with screws the new membrane was stored in di water for 24 h and compressed at 3 0 bar for stabilization before starting each filtration experiment afterwards a prepared feed solution was inserted with a gear pump labscitech inc corona ca and the permeate was automatically weighed with an electronic scale gx 4000 a d company ltd tokyo japan the working volume and stirring speed of the feed vessel were 1 0 l and 100 rpm respectively subsequently retention experiments with the anionic surfactant were conducted to determine the removal mechanism of the ceramic uf membranes the retention efficiencies for the anionic surfactants were studied at tmps of 1 5 and 3 0 bar temperatures of 25 and 55 c ph values of 4 10 and ionic strengths of 1 100 mm after each filtration experiment the ceramic membrane was chemically cleaned according to the modified version of the cleaning regime recommended by the manufacturer fouled ceramic uf membranes were removed from the disc holder 3 h after the filtration experiments and soaked in a 0 5 m naoh solution heated to 50 c for 15 min to desorb foulants then the membranes were adequately flushed with di water for 10 min this soak and flush process was repeated with 0 0075 m h3po4 solution to ensure identical experimental conditions permeate flux was determined to provide an estimation of the flux recovery which is the calculation of how much flux is recovered due to chemical cleaning 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ceramic membrane properties on surfactant removal efficiency the effects of the ceramic membrane properties with four different pore sizes 1 5 15 and 150 kda on the removal efficiency for anionic surfactants was investigated to identify the most suitable ceramic uf membrane fig 2 the relatively accurate membrane pore sizes were assumed to be the molecular weights of the organic solutes i e peg and peo achieving a 90 removal rate in this study the aforementioned molecular weights of peg and peo were used to estimate the pore sizes of the commercially available ceramic uf membranes which are 1 5 15 and 150 kda according to the manufacturer fig 3 the mwcos in daltons were converted to metric size nm with the einstein stokes diameter equation for peg and peo 33 the computed nominal pore sizes of the commercially available ceramic uf membranes are listed in table 2 as expected the sdbs removal rate increased with decreasing pore size of the ceramic uf membranes at the initial sdbs concentrations other studies showed increases of approximately 50 to 65 for pore sizes that decreased from 30 to 5 kda at concentrations above the cmc 34 when the surfactant concentration exceeds the cmc individual monomers self aggregate into spherical or rod like forms i e micelles and become thermodynamically soluble in liquids however the hydrodynamic diameter of the sdbs micelles 2 9 nm 35 is still smaller than the pore size of the 5 kda membrane approximately 11 4 nm thus the sdbs retention rates are expected to be low regardless of the initial concentrations nonetheless other researchers have reported that a significant amount of surfactant can be removed even when the molecular weight is sufficiently low such that it can penetrate the pores of the 5 kda membrane 36 these uf membranes can occasionally retain surfactant molecules via the size exclusion effect because pores that are smaller than the nominal pore size presumably the minimal pore sizes could filter them therefore the ceramic membrane with 1 kda attaining the lowest nominal pore size was better than the 5 15 and 150 kda ceramic uf membranes although the retention rate of sdbs increased with decreasing pore size it is worth noting that the retention rates of the 5 and 15 kda membranes are relatively similar despite the different pore sizes a possible explanation is the different chemical compositions of the ceramic uf membranes as shown in fig s3 of the appendix a this is consistent with the study of medina et al 37 who showed that the adsorption capacity of zro2 ceramic membranes is higher than that of tio2 ceramic membranes when exposed to 1 mm sdbs solution at a neutral ph this can be because the isoelectric point of charge of zro2 ceramic membranes phiep 5 5 6 6 is greater than that of tio2 ceramic membranes phiep 5 2 6 3 hence zro2 ceramic membranes are slightly more positive and can thereby better attract sdbs via electrostatic interaction all ceramic uf membranes exhibited an increase in the retention efficiency with increasing initial concentration because the surfactants underwent multiple phase changes at a low surfactant concentration the surfactants can access the pores more easily because the majority exists as free monomers that can penetrate larger membrane pores 38 39 however at concentrations just below the cmc there is an important phase in which the monomeric surfactants transition into pre micelles 40 as the pre micelle concentration increases the blockage of intermediate pores at early stages of the uf filtration process decreases the porosity of the uf membranes 41 42 in fact decreased membrane porosity often leads to decreased membrane permeability and increased ion retention 43 this suggests that pore blockage improves the retention efficiency such as demonstrated by the results the 500 mg l sdbs furthermore all ceramic uf membranes showed the highest removal rates when the initial sdbs concentration was 1000 mg l at concentrations above the cmc the pre micelles convert to micelles that can retain free monomers in the concentration polarization layer this micelle induced concentration polarization layer due to long term deposition of micelles leads to the formation of a pre sieving layer that can promote sdbs retention 3 2 effect of transmembrane pressure on surfactant removal efficiency fig 4 a shows the sdbs retention rate of the 1 kda ceramic uf membrane under different tmp conditions at various initial sdbs concentrations with increasing initial sdbs concentration the retention rate increased to 21 6 50 3 and 65 2 at a tmp of 3 0 bar and to 18 0 21 8 and 33 5 at a tmp of 1 5 bar at sdbs concentrations 100 mg l and 500 mg l below cmc the sdbs retention rate was relatively low this can be explained by the fact that surfactants mainly exist as free monomers which are essentially difficult to remove with 1 kda ceramic membranes regardless of the tmp by contrast at a relatively higher sdbs concentration 1000 mg l especially above cmc the sdbs retention rate at a tmp of 3 0 bar was significantly improved in addition larger molecules such as pre micelles and micelles occurring at higher surfactant concentrations are assumed to be better rejected a higher tmp can compress the concentration polarization layer into a sieve like structure that gives rise to the pre sieving effect consequently increasing the filterability of the membrane against surfactants 44 as this layer thickens with increasing concentration more filterable layers are built thus more sdbs surfactants are filtered by the layer this was evident in fig 4 b in which the normalized flux after 200 min of 1000 mg l sdbs filtration at 3 0 bar was remarkedly reduced to 0 24 whereas 1 5 bar was slightly decreased to 0 67 the greater flux decline is presumed to be the outcome of greater membrane resistance that was developed by concentration polarization and pore clogging at 3 0 bar operation 45 therefore the sdbs retention rate increased progressively with increasing initial sdbs concentration at a high tmp while it increased relatively smoothly at a low tmp for this reason micellization induced by surfactant concentration and concentration polarization induced by the applied pressure had obvious effects on the retention efficiency of the ceramic uf membrane as surfactant concentration and tmp increased 3 3 effect of temperature on surfactant removal efficiency in this study the ceramic uf filtration experiments were conducted at room temperature 24 9 2 7 c and high temperature 53 5 2 0 c at a tmp of 3 0 bar this is the expected temperature range of discharged laundry wastewater greywater normally has a temperature range of 15 35 c the high temperatures can originate from warm water used in washing machines therefore the surfactant removal mechanism should be investigated according to the temperature of the solutions in general the intermolecular forces between molecules weakens with increasing temperature and thereby decreases the viscosity of a solution in accordance to darcy s laws this effectively increases the permeate flux at constant tmp 28 mainly because of the decreasing drag force of solutes 46 which in this case are surfactants at the same time high temperature facilitates surfactant desorption and increases the concentration of the feed 25 46 as a result this increases the permeate sdbs concentration as more surfactants are transferred due to high permeability in fact the initial permeate flux at high and room temperature were each 47 0 l m 2 h 1 and 30 6 l m 2 h 1 indicating that high temperatures are associated with higher water permeability due to the relatively lower viscosity subsequently the relative retention efficiency of high initial sdbs concentration at high temperature to room temperature decreased fig 5 a induced micellization becomes interrupted at high temperature because the structured water molecules surrounding the hydrophobic groups break down to reduce the hydrodynamic radius 34 this allows the size of surfactant aggregates to decrease which then facilitates the infiltration of sdbs increasing the permeate sdbs concentration fig 5 b presents the normalized flux of 1000 mg l sdbs at two different temperature conditions the normalized flux at room temperature was rapidly decreased to 0 24 for initial 200 min filtration while the high temperature operation showed a relatively slight reduction of normalized flux up to 0 39 during the same filtration time although the concentration was high enough to cause considerable fouling the effect of concentration polarization was significantly reduced at higher temperature because it is less likely for sdbs to accumulate on the membrane surface hence the sdbs retention rate at room temperature was higher than at high temperature conditions with increasing initial sdbs concentration taken together these observations suggest that the treatment and filtration performance are sufficiently acceptable as compared to that of other ceramic and polymeric membrane filtrations conducted at similar operational conditions table 3 although the highly permeable property of ceramic membranes causes surfactant retention rates to be equivalent or slightly lower than polymeric membranes ceramic membrane filtration performances were distinctly superior to polymeric membranes in this respect ceramic uf membrane is a promising competitive material for the treatment of surfactant containing wastewater 3 4 effect of solution chemistry ph and ionic strength on surfactant removal efficiency we demonstrated the sdbs retention performance of the 1 kda ceramic uf membranes at a ph range of 4 10 to comprehensively investigate the electrostatic interaction between the ceramic membranes and solutes fig 6 in general the surface charge of a ceramic membrane depends on the ph of the bulk solution thus the ph conditions can exert repulsive or attractive forces that interfere with the transfer of surfactants 48 we observed a lower sdbs permeate concentration at high ph because the zeta potential of the 1 kda ceramic uf membrane decreased with increasing ph fig 7 hence the anionic surfactants are repelled by the membrane surface due to the collision of identical charges above the isoelectric point of the ceramic membrane phiep 3 9 this implies that at a higher ph presumably above ph 4 the membrane charges become mostly negative and the subsequent charge repulsion increases the sdbs retention rate furthermore fig 8 presents the sdbs retention performance at inorganic salt nacl and cacl2 concentrations of 1 10 and 100 mm the sdbs retention rate increased significantly with increasing ionic strength this was pronounced with divalent ions than with monovalent ions compared to the result without electrolyte additives approximately 21 6 the sdbs retention rate increased significantly from 43 5 at 1 mm to 57 1 at 100 mm of cacl2 by contrast it increased only slightly from 12 6 at 1 mm to 28 5 at 100 mm nacl interestingly the sdbs retention rate at 0 mm of nacl was slightly higher than those at 1 mm and 10 mm of nacl this could be explained by that na electrolyte was responsible for decreasing the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule chain of an anionic polymer leading to greater transfer of sdbs through membrane pores 49 however at a higher ionic strength the salting out effect caused the charge repulsion between surfactant heads to decrease because surfactants are inclined to form micelles this decreased the cmc and increased the micelle aggregation number which overall increased the hydrodynamic size of surfactant aggregates at higher salt concentrations 50 52 the extent of size growth is greater with ca2 ions because divalent ions typically have higher ion specificity that enables them to screen negative charges faster than monovalent ions 53 54 hence ca2 ions can effectively weaken charge repulsion between surfactant heads and promote micellization that consequently increases sdbs retention rates in addition a few studies have stated that the greater affinity of ca2 ions to negatively charged membrane surfaces and the subsequent cation bridging could have increased sdbs retention rate via adsorption 53 besides these precipitation during cacl2 addition experiments could have also influenced the retention rate according to noïk et al 55 ca2 ions are more likely to become supersaturated than na ions at identical concentrations of inorganic salts it is probable that precipitates induced by ca2 decreased the membrane porosity resulting in lower sdbs concentration in the permeate 34 the result in this study is consistent with the results in previous research showing that the ion retention rate increases with increasing valency of salt used for removing surfactants with ceramic mf membranes 56 57 therefore cacl2 increased the sdbs retention rate to a greater extent than nacl because of its ion specificity and precipitation capacity 4 conclusions commercially available ceramic uf membranes with different pore sizes were investigated to evaluate the retention mechanism of low molecular weight anionic surfactants which are always present in laundry wastewater because the hydrodynamic diameter of surfactants is generally smaller than the typical pore size of ceramic uf membranes a high retention rate cannot be expected nonetheless the retention rate of sdbs a typical anionic surfactant in the bench scale ceramic membrane filtration system increased with decreasing pore size increasing tmp and decreasing temperature accordingly the ceramic uf membrane of 1 kda was better than other ceramic uf membranes and the solution chemistry further improved the retention mechanism increasing ph and ionic strength interacted with electrostatic repulsion and benefited the ceramic uf filtration system these results would greatly help to improve the relatively lower retention rate of surfactant concentration that is typically lower than cmc in real laundry wastewater treatments furthermore the results can be used as guidance for designing decentralized greywater

cartridges included 1 μm nominal activated carbon 1 μm nominal polypropylene 1 μm nominal polyester 1 μm absolute pleated paper and 2 μm nominal silver impregnated carbon the data from 120 test runs duplicate filters 24 replicate runs per filter type indicated that the surrogate particles log10 reduction values lrvs were 3 93 4 54 in the 1 μm activated carbon filters 1 95 2 94 in the 2 μm silver impregnated carbon filters and 1 0 in the 1 μm polypropylene 1 μm polyester and 1 μm pleated paper filters to achieve an lrv 3 which is a requirement of domestic drinking water treatment units for protozoan reduction 1 μm activated carbon filters are recommended to satisfy protozoan removal requirements when using the other four filter types tested additional treatment for example water boiling or ultraviolet disinfection is necessary keywords drinking water point of use filter cryptosporidium surrogate log10 reduction value 1 introduction the contamination of non reticulated drinking water supplies by cryptosporidium parvum and or cryptosporidium hominis which are the major causative agents of severe gastrointestinal illness poses a major health risk to rural communities cryptosporidium oocysts which are shed in the faeces of infected humans and animals are often found in the source waters of non reticulated water supplies that comprise surface 1 bore 2 and roof 3 waters contamination of drinking water due to insufficient in house treatment has caused numerous cryptosporidiosis outbreaks worldwide 4 7 new zealand has a higher incidence of drinking waterborne cryptosporidiosis than other developed countries 4 8 9 cryptosporidium oocysts are frequently found in the surface waters of agricultural catchments 10 and cryptosporidiosis rates are associated with high livestock densities in new zealand and the widespread use of surface water for drinking water sources that supply 60 of its population 8 about 944 000 people 18 6 of the total population in new zealand rely on non reticulated water supplies 11 point of use pou filtration is a major means of treating household drinking water from non reticulated water supplies 12 especially in developing communities 13 pou filtration systems are commonly installed under sinks and consist of one or more filter housings that hold disposable filter cartridges although a wide range of pou filter cartridges and whole systems rated adequate for microbial removal are commercially available many householders choose to use low cost and easy to operate filter cartridges such as those made of activated carbon polypropylene polyester and pleated paper to remove cryptosporidium oocysts efficiently by filtration it is essential to use filter cartridges that have effective pore sizes that are smaller than the oocysts which are 3 9 5 9 μm in diameter 14 however many commercial suppliers do not provide information that describes the cartridges absolute pore sizes and only nominal pore sizes are given a nominal rating is less robust than an absolute rating for example an absolute pore size rating of 1 μm implies that almost all particles 1 μm will be removed while a nominal pore size rating of 1 μm indicates that most particles 1 μm will be removed but some particles will pass through thus the actual effectiveness of filter cartridges that are rated using nominal pore sizes for oocyst removal is unknown misunderstandings about cartridge pore sizes can lead to uninformed and inappropriate choices of filter cartridges for household drinking water treatment working with cryptosporidium oocysts poses health risks and their detection is expensive a new cryptosporidium surrogate has been developed using glycoprotein coated carboxylated polystyrene microspheres 15 and these modified microparticles mimic the size density and shape of oocysts as well as their surface charge and surface macromolecules in different filtration media the new surrogate closely mimicked the filtration behaviour of cryptosporidium oocysts and their reductions were in the same orders of magnitude while the reductions of unmodified oocyst sized microspheres differed from oocysts reductions by 1 2 orders of magnitude 15 16 the results from a pilot scale study involving conventional coagulation and filtration through sand anthracite dual media 17 showed that the new surrogate also matched the oocysts coagulation and filtration log10 reduction values lrvs more closely than clostridium spores chlorella algae and bacteria as the glycoprotein coated carboxylated polystyrene microspheres have been validated satisfactorily alongside cryptosporidium in previous studies as mentioned above they were used in this study to assess five commonly used pou filters in relation to their efficiencies at removing this cryptosporidium surrogate 2 materials and methods a full scale pou filter test rig fig 1 was custom built for this study it was designed by lutra ltd wellington new zealand and constructed by aqua installation maintenance ltd wellington new zealand the test rig replicated the function of pou drinking water filters that are commonly installed under sinks in households the test rig comprised two parts namely a water supply pump pad fig 1a and the main treatment pad fig 1b the water pump pad held a self priming carrier pump model 8090 902 248 shurflo mexico that pumped supply water through the treatment system and an accumulator model 181 201 shurflo mexico that reduced pulsations and maintained an even flow and pressure profile the main pad housed a self priming dosing pump model dda 7 5 16 ar pv t c f 31u2u2i grundfos holding a s denmark that spiked the surrogate solutions an inline mixer that mixed the streams from the carrier and dosing pumps the filter housing units the pressure and flow gauges the pressure and flow regulating valves the solenoid valves the filter isolation valves and the power switches commercially available pou domestic filter cartridges commonly used in rural communities overseas and in new zealand including 1 μm nominal activated carbon 1 μm nominal polypropylene 1 μm nominal polyester 1 μm absolute pleated paper and 2 μm nominal silver impregnated carbon were purchased from local filter retailers these filter cartridges were made overseas and all were 25 4 cm 10 in long although the silver impregnated carbon filter cartridge s pore size was larger than the pore sizes of the other filter cartridges selected silver impregnated carbon filter media are generally effective for contaminant removal and a 2 μm pore size is smaller than an oocyst s diameter therefore it was included in this study the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate was synthesised by covalently coupling 4 50 μm carboxylated blue polystyrene microspheres polysciences inc warrington usa with α1 acid glycoprotein sigma aldrich using the method described in pang et al 15 the surrogate s mean zeta potential was 18 8 0 70 mv in 1 mm sodium chloride ph 7 as determined using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments malvern uk the surrogate stocks were kept in the dark at 4 c until use two identical filter cartridges in parallel were tested simultaneously to provide replicate experimental results filtration experiments were conducted with pressures flow rates average water volumes treated per day and usage frequencies that closely simulated typical household use conditions the filter test rig was operated under a pressure of 40 psi pounds per square inch or 2 76 bar as recommended by the united states environmental protection agency 18 the flow rate through each filter was set at 1 8 l min which was within the filters operational flow rate ranges specified by the manufacturers and was typical for households before the surrogate injections the filters were conditioned by flushing them continuously with tap water for 10 min while a steady flow rate was established in accordance with the manufacturers instructions in each experiment the filters were run intermittently every 30 min for 1 min at a flow rate of 1 8 l min and this was repeated 12 times to produce 21 6 l of filtered water per day per filter this was based on the estimated minimum volume of drinking water needed for a household which is 20 l day 19 the tap water used in the experiments had a ph of 6 8 and an electrical conductivity of 118 μs cm as measured by using a hach hq40d portable multi parameter meter before a filtration experiment the surrogate solution was freshly prepared and stirred gently overnight in a cold room until use on the next day for each challenge experiment a total of 2 107 3 107 surrogate particles were injected across two filters over 12 runs table 1 that is 106 surrogate particles per filter per run when testing pou devices for protozoan reduction the use of high influent concentrations is recommended to quantify the lrvs properly 18 20 the surrogate solution was applied through the dosing pump at a flow rate of 42 41 0 25 ml min and 4 104 6 104 surrogate particles ml a total of 120 test runs 24 replicate runs per filter type were conducted on the five selected filters and 12 effluent samples were taken from each filter these experiments were carried out on the laboratory bench because the surrogate particles do not pose a microbiological hazard to analyse the samples the surrogate particles were captured by filtering the water samples through whatman nuclepore polycarbonate filters 2 μm pore size under a vacuum the filters were then imaged by using epifluorescence microscopy leica microsystems germany at 20 images sample and 100 magnification the lowest count level was 1 particle 20 image views giving a detection limit of 13 8 microparticles l the image data were enumerated using imagej software 21 the filtration efficiencies of the pous were evaluated by determining the lrvs from the number of surrogate particles injected n 0 and the number of surrogate particles recovered in the filter effluent n where the lrv log10 n 0 n assuming that data are normally distributed students t tests are commonly used to determine whether the means of two groups differ significantly as the lrv frequencies showed approximately normal distributions plots not shown two sample student s t tests with unequal variances were performed to compare differences between the mean lrvs of the different filters a value of p 0 05 was considered significantly different 3 results and discussion the test rig maintained constant pressures and flow rates throughout the experiments the results from the duplicate experiments fig 2 were very similar p 0 05 which suggests that the experimental results were reproducible the surrogate s lrvs remained relatively constant during the filtration experiments which indicated that the filters performances regarding surrogate removal were stable temporally compared with the other filters the carbon filters displayed greater lrv variations because of data noise associated with the low surrogate concentrations in the carbon filter effluent despite processing the entire 1 8 l volume the results from examinations of 20 images sample at 100 magnification showed that the effluent from the 1 μm carbon filters only contained 0 4 surrogate particles which was close to the detection limit of microscopic count section 2 when surrogate particles were not detected the lrv could not be determined exactly fig 2 but it could be estimated as 5 9 based on the number of surrogate particles injected into each filter per run based on the lrvs table 1 fig 2 the surrogate removal efficiencies were in the order of 1 μm nominal activated carbon 2 μm nominal silver impregnated carbon 1 μm absolute pleated paper 1 μm nominal polypropylene 1 μm nominal polyester filters these differences were significant p 0 05 the 1 μm carbon filters surrogate removal efficiencies were significantly higher p 0 00001 than those of the other filters and their lrvs were consistently 3 lrv 3 93 4 54 in contrast the surrogate removal efficiencies of the 2 μm silver impregnated carbon filters lrvs 1 95 2 94 pleated paper lrvs 0 39 0 90 polypropylene lrvs 0 04 0 66 and polyester lrvs 0 00 0 35 filters were lower and they failed to meet the guideline lrv of 3 99 9 reduction that is required for protozoan reduction in domestic water treatment units by the australian new zealand and american standards 18 20 notably the pleated paper filters were marketed as having an absolute pore size of 1 μm but we observed the breakthrough of 4 5 μm surrogate particles in the filter effluent as expected the 2 μm silver impregnated carbon filters removed the surrogate less effectively than the 1 μm carbon filters because of their larger nominal pore size compared with the 1 μm nominal carbon filters the 2 μm nominal silver impregnated carbon filters would contain a greater fraction of pores that are larger than the surrogate microparticles note that the lrvs determined in this study are conservative because the experiments were conducted using new filters which is the most vulnerable stage for protozoan breakthrough in a filter s lifespan when pou filters have been in use for some time biofilms develop that can improve oocyst attachment 22 and subsequently facilitate their removal to some degree however biofilms grown in pou filters can harbour bacteria that reduce the quality of the filtered water 23 in addition mature biofilm sloughing can release biofilm associated oocysts 24 and other harmful microorganisms into the bulk water thereby posing a health risk high surrogate particle concentrations were seeded in the experiments section 2 to ensure that the lrvs could be measured properly in reality the protozoan concentrations in source waters are orders of magnitude lower the findings from a new zealand survey showed that the cryptosporidium concentrations in surface waters were mostly 10 oocysts 100 l and that the highest concentration was 120 oocysts 100 l 25 the findings from a us survey showed that the average cryptosporidium concentration in surface water was 43 oocysts 100 l 26 likewise medema and schijven 27 showed that the average cryptosporidium concentration in river water in the netherlands was a few oocysts per litre however if we had used low input concentrations in the current study we would have encountered difficulties quantifying the lrvs for the reason described earlier in this paper the australian new zealand standard 20 specifies that for appliances claiming protozoan reduction removal the appliance shall reduce the number of 4 6 μm particles from an influent challenge level of 104 particles ml by 99 9 i e lrv 3 an influent concentration of 104 particles ml for 3 μm microspheres is also recommended by the usepa 18 for testing pou appliances 4 conclusions and recommendation the results from our experiments showed that the 1 μm carbon filters tested were very effective at removing the oocyst surrogate within the study s time frame however the study s findings showed the 1 μm polypropylene 1 μm polyester 1 μm pleated paper and 2 μm silver impregnated carbon filters were ineffective at removing the oocyst surrogate to a satisfactory level this information provides guidance for selecting the most efficacious pou filters for cryptosporidium removal thereby contributing to the improved safety of non reticulated water supplies a multi barrier approach to treatment could be implemented through the use of ultraviolet irradiation in conjunction with the filter if a filter other than the 1 μm carbon filter is used boiling the water or ultraviolet irradiation should be implemented to achieve the necessary lrv our research findings also highlight the need for manufacturers and commercial suppliers to provide accurate information about filter pore sizes and to present the results from particle removal
