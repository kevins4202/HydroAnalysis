18635,previous research has focused on dissolved organic carbon doc as a surrogate for soluble microbial products smps and found that temperature has a significant influence on the production of smp based doc sdoc during biological processes little is known about the smp based dissolved organic nitrogen sdon although some nitrogenous organic matter has been identified as an important part of smps this study investigated the effect of temperature 8 c 15 c and 25 c on the characterization of smps in an activated sludge system with special emphasis on sdon results showed the positive effect of reduced temperature on sdon production fluorescence spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry showed the produced sdon at 8 c and 15 c exhibits more lability than at 25 c this was also supported by the algal bioassay indicating the sdon produced at low temperature is highly bioavailable and prone to stimulate algae and microorganisms in addition principal component analysis demonstrated that the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon is different from that of sdoc overall this study highlights the importance of sdon control during biological processes at a low temperature to reduce the potential impact of effluent smps on receiving waters or wastewater reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic nitrogen don soluble microbial products smps dissolved organic carbon doc low temperature wastewater 1 introduction conventionally activated sludge has been the most commonly used biological process used to treat municipal wastewater soluble microbial products smps which are released by microorganisms during substrate metabolism biomass growth and biomass decay constitute a major part of the residual organic matter in the effluent from biological wastewater treatment plants kunacheva and stuckey 2014 xie et al 2016 the presence of smps in effluent not only affects the current discharge standards of the treated wastewater effluent but also becomes a constraint to wastewater reuse jarusutthirak and amy 2006 fonseca et al 2007 ni et al 2011 previous studies have revealed considerable variability in the production of smps in response to process parameters barker and stuckey 1999 wang and zhang 2010 environmental temperature is an important factor influencing the production of smps xu et al 2011 evaluated the effects of substrate concentration aeration rate temperature and ammonia concentration on smp production in batch activated sludge reactors and found that the influential priorities of these factors were temperature substrate concentration aeration rate ammonia concentration according to the published literature the amount of smp production increases when temperature decreases see kang et al 2014 as a review although the amount of smps in the biological processes studied at different temperatures was well quantified the knowledge regarding the chemical characterization of smps remains unknown it is important to clearly identify the chemical components of smps in order to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the biological metabolism that produces these compounds at different temperatures and the potential implications following its discharge in receiving waters or for reuse smps are heterogeneous mixture of various dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved organic nitrogen don and other organic compounds michael kordatou et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 don analysis is more analytically challenging than doc analysis pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 saunders et al 2017 therefore most research has focused on smp based doc sdoc or total organic carbon as a surrogate for smps liang et al 2007 shen et al 2012 duan et al 2014 maqbool et al 2017 yang et al 2017 little is known about the smp based don sdon although the nitrogenous organic matter e g amino acids nucleic acids proteins and humic acids have been identified as important parts of smps kunacheva and stuckey 2014 le and stuckey 2017 zhang et al 2017 recently don in wastewater has become a concern due to its impacts on eutrophication qin et al 2015 membrane fouling chen et al 2015 and potential formation of harmful nitrogenous disinfection byproducts hu et al 2017 thus it has become increasingly apparent that a better understanding is needed of the effect temperature has on the characterization of sdon the complex and diverse structure of don requires a multi method analytical characterization a method to overcome the uncertainties of classic don determination is the use of fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms this ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry mass precision 0 0001 amu at m z 400 is capable of distinguishing between new production and degradative loss of individual organic compounds kujawinski 2011 enabling the assessment of the change of don during the biological process at the molecular level mesfioui et al 2012 hu et al 2017 chang et al 2018 additionally fluorescence excitation emission matrices coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac could analyze the fluorescent composition of bulk don osburn et al 2016 hua et al 2018 using these approaches the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of smps in an activated sludge system with special emphasis on sdon distinct don or doc compounds are preferentially produced and used during biomass metabolism heinz et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 hence don and doc changes are not necessarily coupled during the biological process we hypothesized that the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon is different than that of sdoc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedures and sample collection six identical lab scale sequencing batch reactors were operated at three different temperatures each reactor consisted of a 3 l polymethyl methacrylate container with a liquid volume of 2 l duplicate reactors were used for low temperatures i e 8 c and 15 c petropoulos et al 2017 and room temperature typically between 23 c and 26 c with average level of 25 c each reactor was inoculated with seed sludge collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing china the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of each reactor were approximately 3000 mg l at the beginning of each temperature studied the initial concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 and total phosphorus tp in the influent synthetic wastewater were maintained at approximately 300 mg l 20 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively jiang et al 2017 the composition of the synthetic wastewater is based on the previous study jiang et al 2017 the influent ph was maintained between 7 2 and 7 6 dissolved oxygen concentration in each reactor was maintained at approximately 4 5 mg l by controlling air flow rates the hydraulic retention time hrt was 24 h and the sludge retention time srt was maintained at approximately 20 days by sludge discharging jarusutthirak and amy 2007 each reactor was continuously conducted with a 12 h cycle containing 4 h denitrification 6 h nitrification and 2 h settling each reactor was run for greater than four srts 95 days prior to monitoring sdon and sdoc to ensure the establishment of steady state conditions effluent samples were collected and analyzed for the concentration of sdon and sdoc every 10 days for 30 days after each reactor became stable each sample was tested in triplicate among them samples collected from two representative sampling periods were also used for sdon and sdoc chemical characterization analyses 2 2 sdon and sdoc concentration measurement in this study sdon and sdoc is designated as organic matter passing through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter anpel laboratory technologies shanghai china sdoc was measured by a multi n c 3100 total organic carbon toc analyzer analytik ag jena germany sdon was calculated as the difference between total dissolved nitrogen tdn and the sum of inorganic nitrogen species i e nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 simsek et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 edokpa et al 2018 each sample was tested in triplicate 2 3 fluorescence spectra analysis fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem were measured with a fluoromax 4 fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba france by scanning the emission spectra from 300 to 550 nm at an excitation wavelength from 240 to 400 nm all samples were diluted at the same multiples in order to ensure no uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 exceeded 0 3 cm 1 murphy et al 2011 and were then used for eem analysis a total of 12 eem spectral data were subjected to the parallel factor analysis parafac which was performed using the dreem toolbox for matlab mathworks inc natick ma usa hu and ren 2016 with the residual analysis six parafac components were identified by eem parafac modeling fig s1 in the supporting information 2 4 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass fticr ms analysis 2 4 1 method of measurement sdon and sdoc were extracted and concentrated by the solid phase extraction spe cartridge functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin supelco analytical bellefonte pennsylvania usa and then dissolved in 100 lc ms methanol merck lichrosolv darmstadt germany yekta et al 2012 spe extracted sdon and sdoc were analyzed for molecular compositions by using a 9 4 t fticr ms instrument bruker germany coupled with a standard bruker electrospray ionization esi source the general mass distribution of compounds that were ionized in all samples was in the range of 200 700 m z mesfioui et al 2014 because of sample limitation no internal standard which might have swamped the sdon and sdoc signals was added yekta et al 2012 details of the setting parameters of the instrument and methodologies for mass calibration and processing can be found in our previous study hu et al 2018 2 4 2 the limitation of the method it should be mentioned that we used functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin to enrich and desalt sdon and sdoc since esi fticr ms analysis requires salt free samples therefore only functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin extractable sdon and sdoc molecules are included in the mass spectra comparison of different spe methods in a previous study dittmar et al 2008 showed that functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin was the most efficient and reproducible for organic matter especially nitrogenous organic compound extraction among all the methods tested therefore functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin was widely chosen to extract don and doc in wastewater mesfioui et al 2012 2014 hu et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 in previous organic matter molecular characteristics studies using fticr ms 2 5 algal bioassay the bioavailability of sdon bioavailable sdon sdon was determined with a 14 day algal growth bioassay liu et al 2012 hu et al 2018 each bioassay treatment was conducted in duplicate in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask at ambient temperature in a temperature controlled laboratory 22 25 c 1 5 ml of algal seeds selenastrum capricornutum obtained from the fachb collection chinese academy of sciences and 1 ml mixed culture bacteria collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent were added to 100 ml sdon samples in the erlenmeyer flask the bioavailable sdon concentrations relied on the change of sdon in the sample before and after the incubation period liu et al 2012 2 6 wastewater analysis tdn and no3 were analyzed by dionex ics 1100 ion chromatography dionex sunnyvale ca usa hu et al 2016 nh4 no2 mlss and cod were analyzed according to standard methods epa of china

statistical analyses student s t test t test was conducted by the ibm spss 19 0 ibm armonk new york a p value of 0 05 was accepted as indicating significance the principal component analysis pca was conducted by the paleontological statistics software past version 3 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of activated sludge systems under different temperature basic performance parameters of the activated sludge reactors at three different temperatures 8 c 15 c and 25 c under steady state conditions are summarized in table s1 in the supporting information complete cod degradation was achieved in bioreactors under all temperature conditions in which effluent cod concentrations were less than 14 4 mg l there was no no2 accumulation in any of the bioreactors 0 1 mg l with respect to nh4 average removal efficiencies were greater than 99 5 for all temperatures tested indicating that full nitrification of nh4 had occurred in all bioreactors with respect to no3 the effluent concentrations at 8 c 4 7 0 2 mg l and 15 c 4 0 0 1 mg l were higher than those at 25 c 3 6 0 2 mg l the higher no3 levels at low temperature versus the ambient temperature was also reported by previous research lu et al 2014 signifying the roles of low temperature in the suppression of denitrification 3 2 effect of temperature on the concentration of sdon the concentration of sdon in bioreactor effluent at different temperature under steady state conditions are shown in fig 1 the average effluent sdon concentration ranged from 0 91 mg l to 1 30 mg l in a previous study eom et al 2017 found the concentration of total don from two conventional activated sludge systems and a biological nutrient removal system ranged from 2 1 to 3 8 mg l therefore the sdon produced by microorganisms may account for an important part of the effluent total don in biological process clearly temperature had a significant effect on the production of sdon in the activated sludge systems the highest sdon content was observed at 8 c 1 01 1 30 mg l with an average level of 1 17 mg l followed by 1 00 1 21 mg l at 15 c with an average level of 1 10 mg l the ambient temperature condition 25 c led to the lowest sdon content in the effluent 0 91 0 97 mg l with an average level of 0 93 mg l fig 1 the nitrogenous organic matter e g amino acids nucleic acids proteins and humic acids have been identified as important parts of smps kunacheva and stuckey 2014 le and stuckey 2017 as a result smps released by biomass during the biological process contributed to the organic nitrogen in the effluent simsek et al 2016 previous study indicated that microbes suffering from the stressful conditions were induced to produce more smps during the utilization of substrate wang and zhang 2010 in addition under the stressful conditions some cells might be decomposed or lysed wang and zhang 2010 therefore one possible explanation for the high sdon concentrations at low temperature could be the higher production of nitrogenous organic compounds by the microbes and or the decomposed or lysed cells when the activated sludge encountered stressful conditions the removal and formation of nitrate are dominated by the microbial metabolism on the nitrogen recycle and the nitrogen cycle includes processes involving the converting between don and din simsek et al 2012 thus the suppression of denitrification may be associated with the transformation of don and din in the microbial metabolism 3 3 effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon the behavior and potential biological effects of effluent don once released in the environment is related to differences in its chemical characteristics qin et al 2015 consequently the fluorescent components and molecular characteristics of sdon in bioreactor effluent at different temperatures were also investigated with the purpose of facilitating a better understanding of the impact of temperature on sdon and the potential implications following its discharge in the environment 3 3 1 fluorescent components with the parafac a six component c1 c6 model was established based on the residual analysis fig s1 in the supporting information hu and ren 2016 the eem for the six components are shown as fig 2 a component c1 shows an excitation emission ex em maxima at 275 325 nm which is similar to a protein like component ou et al 2014 components c2 c3 c4 c5 and c6 had ex em maxima at 250 400 nm 250 280 and 350 425 nm 250 450 nm 250 480 nm and 270 510 nm respectively which can be assigned to humic like components maie et al 2007 murphy et al 2011 yang et al 2015 fluorescent components of sdon produced at different temperatures differed significantly as shown in fig 2b the percentage of component c1 protein like component from effluent at 8 c 19 3 23 5 with average level of 21 3 and 15 c 19 0 23 6 with average level of 20 4 was slightly higher than those at 25 c 13 0 15 5 with average level of 14 4 p 0 05 t test in contrast the percentage of total humic like component c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 from effluent at 8 c 76 5 80 7 with average level of 78 7 and 15 c 76 4 81 6 with average level of 79 8 was slightly lower than those at 25 c 84 5 0 87 0 with average level of 85 6 p 0 05 t test previous research suggested that compounds derived from proteins are bioavailable while compounds derived from humic substances tend to be resistant to biodegradation liu et al 2012 yang et al 2015 this componential characterization indicated that the produced sdon at low temperature i e 8 c and 15 c is more labile than that at room temperature i e 25 c 3 3 2 molecular composition chemical class regions from van krevelen diagrams are used to depict sdon qualitative characterizations of molecular data that comprise ultrahigh resolution fticr ms spectra fig 3 a the van krevelen diagram shows clustered elemental formulae according to their functional group compositions into major biochemical compounds classes that have characteristic h c and o c ratios d andrilli et al 2015 these compound classes include lipids o c 0 0 2 h c 1 7 2 2 proteins amino sugars o c 0 2 0 6 h c 1 5 2 2 n c 0 05 carbohydrates o c 0 6 1 h c 1 5 2 2 unsaturated hydrocarbons o c 0 0 1 h c 0 7 1 5 lignin o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 modified aromaticity index aimod 0 67 tannins o c 0 6 1 h c 0 5 1 5 aimod 0 67 and condensed aromatics o c 0 1 h c 0 3 0 7 aimod 0 67 antony et al 2014 although these class assignments are not definitive i e a tannins like formula is not necessarily derived from tannins they provide insight into the general compound classes present in each sample maizel and remucal 2017 approximately 19 8 29 1 of formulas containing n from all samples fell within the protein amino sugars like regions n containing compounds derived from proteins and amino sugars should be common in wastewater maizel and remucal 2017 hu et al 2018 it is interesting to note that n containing formulas also fall within the carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons tannins lignin and condensed aromatics like regions fig 3 the location of the n containing formulas observed here agrees with past studies kunacheva and stuckey 2014 kunacheva et al 2017 indicating that the composition of smps is extremely complex and they are mixtures of a variety of unknown compounds that do not simply belong to a specific well defined group formulas types of sdon produced at different temperature differed significantly fig 3b the sdon produced at 25 c had 34 4 unique formulas within the lipid protein amino sugars and carbohydrates like regions and 65 6 within the unsaturated hydrocarbons tannins condensed aromatics and lignin like regions compared to the sdon produced at 25 c more unique formulas can be found within the lipid protein amino sugars and carbohydrates like regions from the sdon produced at 15 c 37 6 and 8 c 42 4 p 0 05 t test previous research has shown that organic constituents above the van krevelen region at h c 1 5 correspond to more labile material whereas organic constituents below the van krevelen region h c 1 5 exhibit a less labile and more recalcitrant character d andrilli et al 2015 hence compared to the sdon produced at 25 c the sdon produced at 8 c and 15 c containing more lipid h c 1 7 2 2 protein amino sugars h c 1 5 2 2 and carbohydrates like h c 1 5 2 2 formulas are considered to be more labile in conclusion based on the eem parafac results fig 2 and ft icrms results fig 3 the produced sdon at low temperatures 8 c and 15 c exhibited more labile than that at room temperature 25 c this conclusion was further confirmed by the algal bioassay experiment the results from this experiment are provided in the following section 3 4 bioavailability of sdon produced at different temperature the bioavailability of sdon in bioreactor effluent at 25 c 15 c and 8 c were 55 3 4 1 61 5 6 6 and 65 8 3 0 respectively fig 4 based on the t test the bioavailability of sdon in bioreactor effluent at 15 c p 0 045 and 8 c p 0 011 were significantly higher than that at 25 c the bioavailability of sdon is an important issue because bioavailable nitrogen containing organic compounds can be utilized by natural algae and microorganisms which can lead to oxygen consumption and thereby support eutrophication in waters or promote microorganism growth in water distribution systems during the wastewater reclamation processes michael kordatou et al 2015 hounshell et al 2017 edokpa et al 2018 therefore the produced sdon at low temperature should be control to minimize its negative impact on receiving water quality or reclaimed water quality these algal bioassay experiment results consist with the sdon chemical characteristics analysis fig 2 and 3 indicate that the produced sdon at low temperature exhibit more labile than that at room temperature and can have further unfavorable effects on wastewater discharge and reuse previous studies have demonstrated the negative influences of low temperature to suppress microbial metabolism and accelerate cell lysis sipler and bronk 2015 furthermore a considerable portion of intracellular compounds are consisted of labile materials such as proteases proteins and amino acid inner cell of microbes hammes et al 2010 kujawinski 2011 and can generated from the broken cells after the cell lysis thus the releasing of nitrogenous compounds with the potential to simulate the algal growth could be the reason why higher sdon bioavailability was observed under cold conditions an omics approach including metagenomic and metabolomic approaches is needed to prove this viewpoint 3 5 comparison of the effect of temperature on the concentrations and chemical characterization of sdon and sdoc the ratios of the concentration of sdon to that of sdoc in bioreactor effluent at 25 c 15 c and 8 c were 0 33 0 02 0 35 0 03 and 0 31 0 03 respectively as shown by fig s2 in the supporting information this indicates that the changes in sdon and sdoc concentrations at different temperature are not coupled to compare the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon and sdoc a principal component analysis pca based on the classes of effluent sdon and sdoc fluorescent components and molecular composition was conducted fig 5 the first component pc1 and second component pc2 accounted for 62 5 and 16 5 of the total variance in the types of sdon chemical characterization respectively table s2 in the supporting information together they explained 79 0 of the total variance of the data set the pc1 and pc2 accounted for 45 0 and 21 6 of the total variance in the types of sdoc chemical characterization respectively table s2 in the supporting information together they explained 66 6 of the total variance of the data set remarkably the data points of the effluent sdon produced at different temperature presented more distinctly different loadings than that of sdoc for example the pca scores of sdon produced at 15 c on both pc1 ranging from 0 49 to 3 64 and pc2 ranging from 2 70 to 7 22 were greater than that of the sdon produced at 8 c ranging from 11 65 to 2 62 for pc1 and 4 39 to 1 40 for pc2 as shown in fig s4 in the supporting information however the pca scores of sdoc produced at 15 c and 8 c were not distinctly separated the pca scores of sdoc produced at 15 c on pc1 and pc2 ranged from 0 08 to 3 21 and 4 33 to 5 89 respectively the pca scores of sdoc produced at 8 c on pc1 and pc2 ranged from 10 02 to 0 98 and 2 72 to 1 87 respectively these results confirmed our previous hypothesis that the temperature effect on the chemical characterization of sdon is different from the temperature effect on sdoc an explanation of these differences points to the differences in the chemical characteristics of the sdon and sdoc compounds such as the molecular composition molecular weight hu et al 2017 hydrophobicity liu et al 2012 and functional groups hu et al 2016 which would affect their utilization by biomass altogether sdon and sdoc changes were not necessarily coupled during the activated sludge process and the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon was different from that of sdoc 3 6 implication don analysis is more analytically challenging to quantify than doc pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 saunders et al 2017 therefore most studies of smp formations rely on sdoc measurements liang et al 2007 shen et al 2012 duan et al 2014 maqbool et al 2017 yang et al 2017 little is known about the quantification and qualification of sdon in smps and the effect of temperature on the characterization of the sdon interestingly by the results of the pca we found that the chemical characterization of sdon and sdoc is dissimilarly influenced by temperature fig 5 in these circumstances previous research focusing on sdoc as a surrogate for smps would partially explain the effect of temperature on the production of smps during biological processes and their effect on receiving waters or wastewater reuse importantly the production of sdon increased consistently with a drop in temperature from 25 c to 8 c fig 1 chemical characteristics analysis combined with an algal bioassay showed the sdon produced at low temperature is highly bioavailable and prone to stimulate algae and microorganisms figs 2 4 the bioavailability of don is an important issue because bioavailable nitrogen containing organic compounds can be bioavailable to algae and microorganisms which has adverse effect on the quality of receiving waters and wastewater reclamation processes michael kordatou et al 2015 edokpa et al 2018 therefore in addition to contributing to the cod of the effluent regarded as sdoc wang and chen 2018 the production of smps regarded as sdon during the biological process at a low temperature can have further unfavorable effects on wastewater discharge and reuse overall this is the first study focusing on the effect of temperature on the characterization of sdon and highlights the importance of sdon control during biological processes at a low temperature to reduce the potential impact of effluent smps on receiving waters or wastewater reuse in the context of the impact of low temperature on microbial activity strategies on enhancing microbial activity e g magnetic field niu et al 2013 may be favorable to reduce the proportion of cell death and strengthen the stability of microbes under cold conditions this may be a possible solution to decrease sdon associated with sdoc at low temperature additionally the distinct differences of the characteristics between sdon and sdoc are useful for the further development of the flexibility in wastewater treatment controlling strategies more feasible strategies on regulating effluent quality can be designed with regard to the effluent with different sdon sdoc for example sdon including more labile components lipid protein amino sugars and carbohydrates like formulas were observed in the effluent at low temperature for high proportion of sdon sdoc it is more feasible to focus on regulating the gene expression associated with the production and excretion of proteins or amino acids 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effect of temperature 8 c 15 c and 25 c on the characterization of smps in an activated sludge system with special emphasis on sdon the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the average effluent sdon concentration ranged from 0 91 mg l to 1 30 mg l results showed the positive effect of reduced temperature on sdon production based on the eem parafac and ft icrms results the produced sdon at low temperatures 8 c and 15 c exhibited more labile than that at room temperature 25 c which was further confirmed by the algal bioassay experiment the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon was different from that of sdoc it is necessary to control sdon during biological processes at a low temperature to reduce the potential impact of effluent smps on receiving waters or wastewater reuse notes the authors declare no

a liquid volume of 2 l duplicate reactors were used for low temperatures i e 8 c and 15 c petropoulos et al 2017 and room temperature typically between 23 c and 26 c with average level of 25 c each reactor was inoculated with seed sludge collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing china the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of each reactor were approximately 3000 mg l at the beginning of each temperature studied the initial concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 and total phosphorus tp in the influent synthetic wastewater were maintained at approximately 300 mg l 20 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively jiang et al 2017 the composition of the synthetic wastewater is based on the previous study jiang et al 2017 the influent ph was maintained between 7 2 and 7 6 dissolved oxygen concentration in each reactor was maintained at approximately 4 5 mg l by controlling air flow rates the hydraulic retention time hrt was 24 h and the sludge retention time srt was maintained at approximately 20 days by sludge discharging jarusutthirak and amy 2007 each reactor was continuously conducted with a 12 h cycle containing 4 h denitrification 6 h nitrification and 2 h settling each reactor was run for greater than four srts 95 days prior to monitoring sdon and sdoc to ensure the establishment of steady state conditions effluent samples were collected and analyzed for the concentration of sdon and sdoc every 10 days for 30 days after each reactor became stable each sample was tested in triplicate among them samples collected from two representative sampling periods were also used for sdon and sdoc chemical characterization analyses 2 2 sdon and sdoc concentration measurement in this study sdon and sdoc is designated as organic matter passing through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter anpel laboratory technologies shanghai china sdoc was measured by a multi n c 3100 total organic carbon toc analyzer analytik ag jena germany sdon was calculated as the difference between total dissolved nitrogen tdn and the sum of inorganic nitrogen species i e nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 simsek et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 edokpa et al 2018 each sample was tested in triplicate 2 3 fluorescence spectra analysis fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem were measured with a fluoromax 4 fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba france by scanning the emission spectra from 300 to 550 nm at an excitation wavelength from 240 to 400 nm all samples were diluted at the same multiples in order to ensure no uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 exceeded 0 3 cm 1 murphy et al 2011 and were then used for eem analysis a total of 12 eem spectral data were subjected to the parallel factor analysis parafac which was performed using the dreem toolbox for matlab mathworks inc natick ma usa hu and ren 2016 with the residual analysis six parafac components were identified by eem parafac modeling fig s1 in the supporting information 2 4 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass fticr ms analysis 2 4 1 method of measurement sdon and sdoc were extracted and concentrated by the solid phase extraction spe cartridge functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin supelco analytical bellefonte pennsylvania usa and then dissolved in 100 lc ms methanol merck lichrosolv darmstadt germany yekta et al 2012 spe extracted sdon and sdoc were analyzed for molecular compositions by using a 9 4 t fticr ms instrument bruker germany coupled with a standard bruker electrospray ionization esi source the general mass distribution of compounds that were ionized in all samples was in the range of 200 700 m z mesfioui et al 2014 because of sample limitation no internal standard which might have swamped the sdon and sdoc signals was added yekta et al 2012 details of the setting parameters of the instrument and methodologies for mass calibration and processing can be found in our previous study hu et al 2018 2 4 2 the limitation of the method it should be mentioned that we used functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin to enrich and desalt sdon and sdoc since esi fticr ms analysis requires salt free samples therefore only functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin extractable sdon and sdoc molecules are included in the mass spectra comparison of different spe methods in a previous study dittmar et al 2008 showed that functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin was the most efficient and reproducible for organic matter especially nitrogenous organic compound extraction among all the methods tested therefore functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin was widely chosen to extract don and doc in wastewater mesfioui et al 2012 2014 hu et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 in previous organic matter molecular characteristics studies using fticr ms 2 5 algal bioassay the bioavailability of sdon bioavailable sdon sdon was determined with a 14 day algal growth bioassay liu et al 2012 hu et al 2018 each bioassay treatment was conducted in duplicate in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask at ambient temperature in a temperature controlled laboratory 22 25 c 1 5 ml of algal seeds selenastrum capricornutum obtained from the fachb collection chinese academy of sciences and 1 ml mixed culture bacteria collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent were added to 100 ml sdon samples in the erlenmeyer flask the bioavailable sdon concentrations relied on the change of sdon in the sample before and after the incubation period liu et al 2012 2 6 wastewater analysis tdn and no3 were analyzed by dionex ics 1100 ion chromatography dionex sunnyvale ca usa hu et al 2016 nh4 no2 mlss and cod were analyzed according to standard methods epa of china

statistical analyses student s t test t test was conducted by the ibm spss 19 0 ibm armonk new york a p value of 0 05 was accepted as indicating significance the principal component analysis pca was conducted by the paleontological statistics software past version 3 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of activated sludge systems under different temperature basic performance parameters of the activated sludge reactors at three different temperatures 8 c 15 c and 25 c under steady state conditions are summarized in table s1 in the supporting information complete cod degradation was achieved in bioreactors under all temperature conditions in which effluent cod concentrations were less than 14 4 mg l there was no no2 accumulation in any of the bioreactors 0 1 mg l with respect to nh4 average removal efficiencies were greater than 99 5 for all temperatures tested indicating that full nitrification of nh4 had occurred in all bioreactors with respect to no3 the effluent concentrations at 8 c 4 7 0 2 mg l and 15 c 4 0 0 1 mg l were higher than those at 25 c 3 6 0 2 mg l the higher no3 levels at low temperature versus the ambient temperature was also reported by previous research lu et al 2014 signifying the roles of low temperature in the suppression of denitrification 3 2 effect of temperature on the concentration of sdon the concentration of sdon in bioreactor effluent at different temperature under steady state conditions are shown in fig 1 the average effluent sdon concentration ranged from 0 91 mg l to 1 30 mg l in a previous study eom et al 2017 found the concentration of total don from two conventional activated sludge systems and a biological nutrient removal system ranged from 2 1 to 3 8 mg l therefore the sdon produced by microorganisms may account for an important part of the effluent total don in biological process clearly temperature had a significant effect on the production of sdon in the activated sludge systems the highest sdon content was observed at 8 c 1 01 1 30 mg l with an average level of 1 17 mg l followed by 1 00 1 21 mg l at 15 c with an average level of 1 10 mg l the ambient temperature condition 25 c led to the lowest sdon content in the effluent 0 91 0 97 mg l with an average level of 0 93 mg l fig 1 the nitrogenous organic matter e g amino acids nucleic acids proteins and humic acids have been identified as important parts of smps kunacheva and stuckey 2014 le and stuckey 2017 as a result smps released by biomass during the biological process contributed to the organic nitrogen in the effluent simsek et al 2016 previous study indicated that microbes suffering from the stressful conditions were induced to produce more smps during the utilization of substrate wang and zhang 2010 in addition under the stressful conditions some cells might be decomposed or lysed wang and zhang 2010 therefore one possible explanation for the high sdon concentrations at low temperature could be the higher production of nitrogenous organic compounds by the microbes and or the decomposed or lysed cells when the activated sludge encountered stressful conditions the removal and formation of nitrate are dominated by the microbial metabolism on the nitrogen recycle and the nitrogen cycle includes processes involving the converting between don and din simsek et al 2012 thus the suppression of denitrification may be associated with the transformation of don and din in the microbial metabolism 3 3 effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon the behavior and potential biological effects of effluent don once released in the environment is related to differences in its chemical characteristics qin et al 2015 consequently the fluorescent components and molecular characteristics of sdon in bioreactor effluent at different temperatures were also investigated with the purpose of facilitating a better understanding of the impact of temperature on sdon and the potential implications following its discharge in the environment 3 3 1 fluorescent components with the parafac a six component c1 c6 model was established based on the residual analysis fig s1 in the supporting information hu and ren 2016 the eem for the six components are shown as fig 2 a component c1 shows an excitation emission ex em maxima at 275 325 nm which is similar to a protein like component ou et al 2014 components c2 c3 c4 c5 and c6 had ex em maxima at 250 400 nm 250 280 and 350 425 nm 250 450 nm 250 480 nm and 270 510 nm respectively which can be assigned to humic like components maie et al 2007 murphy et al 2011 yang et al 2015 fluorescent components of sdon produced at different temperatures differed significantly as shown in fig 2b the percentage of component c1 protein like component from effluent at 8 c 19 3 23 5 with average level of 21 3 and 15 c 19 0 23 6 with average level of 20 4 was slightly higher than those at 25 c 13 0 15 5 with average level of 14 4 p 0 05 t test in contrast the percentage of total humic like component c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 from effluent at 8 c 76 5 80 7 with average level of 78 7 and 15 c 76 4 81 6 with average level of 79 8 was slightly lower than those at 25 c 84 5 0 87 0 with average level of 85 6 p 0 05 t test previous research suggested that compounds derived from proteins are bioavailable while compounds derived from humic substances tend to be resistant to biodegradation liu et al 2012 yang et al 2015 this componential characterization indicated that the produced sdon at low temperature i e 8 c and 15 c is more labile than that at room temperature i e 25 c 3 3 2 molecular composition chemical class regions from van krevelen diagrams are used to depict sdon qualitative characterizations of molecular data that comprise ultrahigh resolution fticr ms spectra fig 3 a the van krevelen diagram shows clustered elemental formulae according to their functional group compositions into major biochemical compounds classes that have characteristic h c and o c ratios d andrilli et al 2015 these compound classes include lipids o c 0 0 2 h c 1 7 2 2 proteins amino sugars o c 0 2 0 6 h c 1 5 2 2 n c 0 05 carbohydrates o c 0 6 1 h c 1 5 2 2 unsaturated hydrocarbons o c 0 0 1 h c 0 7 1 5 lignin o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 modified aromaticity index aimod 0 67 tannins o c 0 6 1 h c 0 5 1 5 aimod 0 67 and condensed aromatics o c 0 1 h c 0 3 0 7 aimod 0 67 antony et al 2014 although these class assignments are not definitive i e a tannins like formula is not necessarily derived from tannins they provide insight into the general compound classes present in each sample maizel and remucal 2017 approximately 19 8 29 1 of formulas containing n from all samples fell within the protein amino sugars like regions n containing compounds derived from proteins and amino sugars should be common in wastewater maizel and remucal 2017 hu et al 2018 it is interesting to note that n containing formulas also fall within the carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons tannins lignin and condensed aromatics like regions fig 3 the location of the n containing formulas observed here agrees with past studies kunacheva and stuckey 2014 kunacheva et al 2017 indicating that the composition of smps is extremely complex and they are mixtures of a variety of unknown compounds that do not simply belong to a specific well defined group formulas types of sdon produced at different temperature differed significantly fig 3b the sdon produced at 25 c had 34 4 unique formulas within the lipid protein amino sugars and carbohydrates like regions and 65 6 within the unsaturated hydrocarbons tannins condensed aromatics and lignin like regions compared to the sdon produced at 25 c more unique formulas can be found within the lipid protein amino sugars and carbohydrates like regions from the sdon produced at 15 c 37 6 and 8 c 42 4 p 0 05 t test previous research has shown that organic constituents above the van krevelen region at h c 1 5 correspond to more labile material whereas organic constituents below the van krevelen region h c 1 5 exhibit a less labile and more recalcitrant character d andrilli et al 2015 hence compared to the sdon produced at 25 c the sdon produced at 8 c and 15 c containing more lipid h c 1 7 2 2 protein amino sugars h c 1 5 2 2 and carbohydrates like h c 1 5 2 2 formulas are considered to be more labile in conclusion based on the eem parafac results fig 2 and ft icrms results fig 3 the produced sdon at low temperatures 8 c and 15 c exhibited more labile than that at room temperature 25 c this conclusion was further confirmed by the algal bioassay experiment the results from this experiment are provided in the following section 3 4 bioavailability of sdon produced at different temperature the bioavailability of sdon in bioreactor effluent at 25 c 15 c and 8 c were 55 3 4 1 61 5 6 6 and 65 8 3 0 respectively fig 4 based on the t test the bioavailability of sdon in bioreactor effluent at 15 c p 0 045 and 8 c p 0 011 were significantly higher than that at 25 c the bioavailability of sdon is an important issue because bioavailable nitrogen containing organic compounds can be utilized by natural algae and microorganisms which can lead to oxygen consumption and thereby support eutrophication in waters or promote microorganism growth in water distribution systems during the wastewater reclamation processes michael kordatou et al 2015 hounshell et al 2017 edokpa et al 2018 therefore the produced sdon at low temperature should be control to minimize its negative impact on receiving water quality or reclaimed water quality these algal bioassay experiment results consist with the sdon chemical characteristics analysis fig 2 and 3 indicate that the produced sdon at low temperature exhibit more labile than that at room temperature and can have further unfavorable effects on wastewater discharge and reuse previous studies have demonstrated the negative influences of low temperature to suppress microbial metabolism and accelerate cell lysis sipler and bronk 2015 furthermore a considerable portion of intracellular compounds are consisted of labile materials such as proteases proteins and amino acid inner cell of microbes hammes et al 2010 kujawinski 2011 and can generated from the broken cells after the cell lysis thus the releasing of nitrogenous compounds with the potential to simulate the algal growth could be the reason why higher sdon bioavailability was observed under cold conditions an omics approach including metagenomic and metabolomic approaches is needed to prove this viewpoint 3 5 comparison of the effect of temperature on the concentrations and chemical characterization of sdon and sdoc the ratios of the concentration of sdon to that of sdoc in bioreactor effluent at 25 c 15 c and 8 c were 0 33 0 02 0 35 0 03 and 0 31 0 03 respectively as shown by fig s2 in the supporting information this indicates that the changes in sdon and sdoc concentrations at different temperature are not coupled to compare the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon and sdoc a principal component analysis pca based on the classes of effluent sdon and sdoc fluorescent components and molecular composition was conducted fig 5 the first component pc1 and second component pc2 accounted for 62 5 and 16 5 of the total variance in the types of sdon chemical characterization respectively table s2 in the supporting information together they explained 79 0 of the total variance of the data set the pc1 and pc2 accounted for 45 0 and 21 6 of the total variance in the types of sdoc chemical characterization respectively table s2 in the supporting information together they explained 66 6 of the total variance of the data set remarkably the data points of the effluent sdon produced at different temperature presented more distinctly different loadings than that of sdoc for example the pca scores of sdon produced at 15 c on both pc1 ranging from 0 49 to 3 64 and pc2 ranging from 2 70 to 7 22 were greater than that of the sdon produced at 8 c ranging from 11 65 to 2 62 for pc1 and 4 39 to 1 40 for pc2 as shown in fig s4 in the supporting information however the pca scores of sdoc produced at 15 c and 8 c were not distinctly separated the pca scores of sdoc produced at 15 c on pc1 and pc2 ranged from 0 08 to 3 21 and 4 33 to 5 89 respectively the pca scores of sdoc produced at 8 c on pc1 and pc2 ranged from 10 02 to 0 98 and 2 72 to 1 87 respectively these results confirmed our previous hypothesis that the temperature effect on the chemical characterization of sdon is different from the temperature effect on sdoc an explanation of these differences points to the differences in the chemical characteristics of the sdon and sdoc compounds such as the molecular composition molecular weight hu et al 2017 hydrophobicity liu et al 2012 and functional groups hu et al 2016 which would affect their utilization by biomass altogether sdon and sdoc changes were not necessarily coupled during the activated sludge process and the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon was different from that of sdoc 3 6 implication don analysis is more analytically challenging to quantify than doc pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 saunders et al 2017 therefore most studies of smp formations rely on sdoc measurements liang et al 2007 shen et al 2012 duan et al 2014 maqbool et al 2017 yang et al 2017 little is known about the quantification and qualification of sdon in smps and the effect of temperature on the characterization of the sdon interestingly by the results of the pca we found that the chemical characterization of sdon and sdoc is dissimilarly influenced by temperature fig 5 in these circumstances previous research focusing on sdoc as a surrogate for smps would partially explain the effect of temperature on the production of smps during biological processes and their effect on receiving waters or wastewater reuse importantly the production of sdon increased consistently with a drop in temperature from 25 c to 8 c fig 1 chemical characteristics analysis combined with an algal bioassay showed the sdon produced at low temperature is highly bioavailable and prone to stimulate algae and microorganisms figs 2 4 the bioavailability of don is an important issue because bioavailable nitrogen containing organic compounds can be bioavailable to algae and microorganisms which has adverse effect on the quality of receiving waters and wastewater reclamation processes michael kordatou et al 2015 edokpa et al 2018 therefore in addition to contributing to the cod of the effluent regarded as sdoc wang and chen 2018 the production of smps regarded as sdon during the biological process at a low temperature can have further unfavorable effects on wastewater discharge and reuse overall this is the first study focusing on the effect of temperature on the characterization of sdon and highlights the importance of sdon control during biological processes at a low temperature to reduce the potential impact of effluent smps on receiving waters or wastewater reuse in the context of the impact of low temperature on microbial activity strategies on enhancing microbial activity e g magnetic field niu et al 2013 may be favorable to reduce the proportion of cell death and strengthen the stability of microbes under cold conditions this may be a possible solution to decrease sdon associated with sdoc at low temperature additionally the distinct differences of the characteristics between sdon and sdoc are useful for the further development of the flexibility in wastewater treatment controlling strategies more feasible strategies on regulating effluent quality can be designed with regard to the effluent with different sdon sdoc for example sdon including more labile components lipid protein amino sugars and carbohydrates like formulas were observed in the effluent at low temperature for high proportion of sdon sdoc it is more feasible to focus on regulating the gene expression associated with the production and excretion of proteins or amino acids 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effect of temperature 8 c 15 c and 25 c on the characterization of smps in an activated sludge system with special emphasis on sdon the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the average effluent sdon concentration ranged from 0 91 mg l to 1 30 mg l results showed the positive effect of reduced temperature on sdon production based on the eem parafac and ft icrms results the produced sdon at low temperatures 8 c and 15 c exhibited more labile than that at room temperature 25 c which was further confirmed by the algal bioassay experiment the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of sdon was different from that of sdoc it is necessary to control sdon during biological processes at a low temperature to reduce the potential impact of effluent smps on receiving waters or wastewater reuse notes the authors declare no

18636,a partial nitritation pn anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process in sequencing batch reactor sbr was successfully developed to treat high strength ammonium wastewater the feed distribution in the sbr cycle and sub cycles was considered as the main operating strategy and was optimized using a response surface methodology rsm based optimization technique in the sbr cycle the maximum nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 79 0 01 kg m 3 d 1 was achieved by applying a feed distribution strategy that considered the kinetic characteristics of anammox and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob however this strategy negatively affected the nitrogen removal efficiency nre due to alkalinity loss therefore the feed distribution in the sbr sub cycles with respect to the nre and the nrr was further studied the nitrogen removal performance was optimized in the optimum region and an nre of 88 and an nrr of 0 84 kg m 3 d 1 were achieved the optimized model was verified in confirmation test the rsm based optimization results provide insights into the feed distribution strategy for achieving single stage pn anammox sbr operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox sequencing batch reactor optimization response surface methodology nitrogen removal rate nitrogen removal efficiency 1 introduction various wastewaters produced by human activities have resulted in an imbalanced nitrogen cycle leading to many natural disasters such as eutrophication in the water system canfield et al 2010 hence more stringent regulation of effluent nitrogen levels are required at point sources such as wastewater treatment plants wwtp czerwionka et al 2012 reject water taken from anaerobic digesters in wwtps is considered a major factor that has increased effluent nitrogen levels van kempen et al 2001 this wastewater contains a relatively high ammonium concentration 700 800 mg n l 1 which contributes 10 30 of the nitrogen load of wwtps with its flow rate accounting for 2 of wwtps influent janus 1996 van loosdrecht and salem 2006 moreover the co digestion systems used to further enhance the bio energy production rate tend to increase nitrogen levels in the reject water aÄdaÄ and sponza 2005 therefore the nitrogen compounds in the reject water classified as a sidestream need to be treated through a separate treatment facility to decrease nitrogen loads in wwtps abma et al 2010 in the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process ammonium nitrogen in wastewater is directly converted anaerobically to nitrogen gas with nitrite as an electron acceptor strous et al 1997a the anammox process coupled with partial nitritation pn has been currently regarded as a promising technology in terms of energy minimization for nitrogen removal strous et al 1997b the economic benefits of pn anammox pn a have been reported by many researchers ali and okabe 2015 chamchoi et al 2008 cho et al 2017 choi et al 2017 egli et al 2001 more than one hundred full scale plants have been operated since the first anammox plant was installed at rotterdam in 2002 jetten et al 2002 lackner et al 2014 to date various reactor configurations such as sequencing batch reactors sbrs attached growth biofilm reactors moving bed biofilm reactors and upflow granular sludge reactors based on biofilm and granule technology have been developed to overcome the major challenges such as the low growth rate and high nitrite toxic effect of anammox bacteria for full scale implementation dapena mora et al 2004 lackner and horn 2013 among them a sbr based single stage pn a technology is widely employed in full scale plants for the treatment of ammonium rich wastewater ganiguÃ© et al 2010 especially for sbrs the operating strategies and regime are crucial to maintain stable performance of the single stage pn a process lackner and horn 2013 several research groups have developed sbr operating strategies known as demon innerebner et al 2007 oland kuai and verstraete 1998 and canon nielsen et al 2005 these have been mainly applied to treat reject water taken from digestion or co digestion systems and the resulting benefits to the wwtps have been reported koch et al 2015 as the major operating strategy for sbr operation feed distribution with interval aeration has been mostly utilized to maintain low nitrite concentration as it has a toxic effect on anammox activity choi et al 2018 lackner and horn 2012 lotti et al 2012 wett et al 2007 the demon configuration is the most popular having been used in more than 80 of all sbr systems lackner et al 2014 demon sbrs use a patented ph based feed control to keep the nitrite concentration below 5 mg l 1 wett 2006 in addition a high nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 71 kg m 3 d 1 with a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 79 was achieved wett et al 2013 on the other hand other studies have shown that not only does it not provide an insight into the feed distribution but the attained nrr was relatively low lackner et al 2012a reported that the sbr cycle was divided into four or six sub cycles with interval feeding and that the maximum nrr was 0 45 kg m 3 d 1 although the nre was more than 90 on going full scale experience of anammox plants has facilitated stable nre higher than 75 using various strategies for sbr technology but only a few studies have been conducted to improve the nrr response surface methodology rsm is a combination of statistical and mathematical techniques that are useful for developing improving and optimizing a process the rsm technique can extract important parameters from a number of factors and then examine their interactive effects on dependent variables the rsm technique has been widely used to develop various bioprocesses such as enzyme production food technology and environmental biotechnology kalil et al 2001 manivannan and rajasimman 2011 in addition rsm is also used for the optimization of operating conditions in biological processes the volumetric exchange ratio and the anaerobic aerobic time ratio in a two step feeding sbr system have been considered as the main operating parameters and optimum boundaries were proposed based on the removal performance wu et al 2015 in this study an rsm based optimization technique was applied for improving nitrogen removal performance nrr and nre in single stage sbr with pn a for this purpose the independent variables on the feed distribution in the sbr cycle and sub cycles were analyzed the alkalinity stripping effect and the difference in the kinetic characteristics between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox were used as factors to determine the criteria for feed distribution this study aim to provide insights into the feed distribution strategies in single stage sbr with pn a 2 materials and method 2 1 synthetic wastewater and seed sludge synthetic wastewater was used in this study and nitrogen and alkalinity concentrations similar to those of an anaerobic digester supernatant were prepared in order to replicate typical digester characteristics 0 8 g l 1 of ammonium nitrogen as nh4 2so4 and 2 85 g l 1 of caco3 as nahco3 the mineral media were 0 027 g of kh2po4 0 1 g of mgcl 6h2o 0 18 g of cacl2 2h2o and 1 ml of trace elements i and ii in 1 l of water trace elements were used according to van de graaf et al 1996 glucose was used as an organic source to control influent c n ratio influent ph was 7 8 0 2 and was not further controlled the seed sludge of aob and anammox was taken from the lab scale reactor the nrr of the anammox reactor was 1 1 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 at a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 1 3 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 for anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia sp enriched sludge was inoculated in the reactor the pn performance under the nlr of 1 6 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 showed a nitrite production rate of 0 7 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 the heterotrophic denitrifiers were taken from the a2o process of gyeongsan wwtp in korea the ratio of anammox aob denitrifiers seeded in the reactor was 1 1 0 1 with a volatile suspended solids vss concentration of 7250 mg l 1 and total suspended solids tss of 8026 mg l 1 2 2 reactor configuration and start up the sbr with a working volume of 8 l was operated to carry out single stage pn a in an incubator with the temperature maintained at 30 c dissolved oxygen do concentration was strictly limited to less than 0 3 mg o 2 l 1 by hach ldo probe ph aph 250 v ph electrode and oxidation reduction potential orp aor 450 v orp electrode were monitored online the sbr cycle consisting of several sub cycles containing a feeding phase anoxic phase and aerobic phase was controlled by a programmable logic controller the sbr cycling conditions at each period are shown in supplementary information after completion of these sub cycles another post mixing phase of 30 min followed the cycle ended with a 40 min settling phase and a 10 min withdrawal phase for effluent discharge the lengths of each phase were determined based on the nitrite concentration produced by pn or remaining after anammox reaction the hydraulic retention time hrt was controlled by monitoring the reaction rate of pn and anammox 2 3 optimization of the feed distribution 2 3 1 nrr based feed distribution strategy the main aim in this part was to investigate the operating parameters affecting nrr and to optimize the feed distribution strategy in the sbr cycle the experiment consisted of the periods i to v and period i was further divided into periods i i and i ii as shown in table 1 the purpose of period i was to estimate the potential coexistence of anammox and denitrification bacteria by controlling the influent carbon nitrogen codcr nh4 n ratio from 0 to 0 5 and to investigate the variation of nrr for periods i to v the nh4 n concentration mg l 1 supplied after the sub feeding phase at each sub cycle was controlled up to 20 mg l 1 to 140 mg l 1 by adjusting the number of sub cycles from eleven to one 2 3 2 nitrogen removal performance based feed distribution strategy the feed distribution strategy based on nrr was investigated through the aforementioned operating strategy in this part the influent supplied only in the anoxic phase of the sub cycles was divided and injected into both the anoxic section and the aerobic section the number of feed distributions variable a and the ratio of influent injected variable b at the sub aerobic phase with respect to the nre and the nrr were further evaluated as main parameters the interactive effect of variable b on variable a was considered for the following reasons in single stage pn a the major microorganisms primarily involved in nitrogen removal are anammox bacteria and aob the growth rate and activity distribution of aob follow the typical monod equation regmi et al 2014 however the kinetic parameters of anammox bacteria are mainly determined dependent on substrate inhibition effects especially for nitrite therefore the haldane edwards and aiba model has been developed as the kinetic inhibition model for the substrate jin et al 2013 the difference in the kinetic characteristics of the two microorganisms should be considered in formulation the operating strategy for a single stage sbr system a representative strategy would be the influent distribution strategy to control residual substrate concentration in the sbr process rsm is a mathematical and statistical technique for analyzing the effect of several independent variables on reactor performance yu et al 2014 this statistical tool has mainly been used to optimize the bioreactor process and thus enhance the removal performance of contaminants by minimizing the number of experiments the rsm used in the present study was a central composite face centered design ccfd examining two different factors a and b by design expert software version 11 0 stat ease inc minneapolis usa and the experimental design plan of ccfd is shown in the supplementary information the design consisted of 2 k factorial points augmented by 2 k axial points and a center point where k is the number of variables the two variables were coded in 1 for factorial points and 0 for central points for a comprehensive analysis of single stage pn a the following seven dependent responses were either directly measured or calculated effluent ammonium concentration effluent nitrate concentration nre nrr chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency total phosphorus removal efficiency and alkalinity removal efficiency the coefficient of the quadratic equation model is expressed as follows 1 y Î² 0 i 1 k Î² i x i i 1 k Î² i i x i 2 i 1 j i 1 Î² i j x i x j Îµ where i and j are the linear and quadratic coefficients respectively Î² is the regression coefficient x i and x j are independent variables and Îµ is an error value three dimensional plots and their respective contour plots were obtained based on the effect of the levels of the two factors from these three dimensional plots the model equation was used to predict the optimum range considering the two variables 2 4 aerobic and anoxic specific activity tests specific anammox activity saa specific oxygen utilization rate sour and specific nitrate utilization rate snur were tested for measuring the substrate consumption rate by anammox aob and denitrifiers as shown in the supplementary information the molar ratio of alkalinity hco3 to nh4 n consumed by aob and the oxygen demand required to maintain constant do concentration 0 3 mg o2 l 1 depending on the amount of influent supplied was further investigated the sludge taken from the reactor was sieved using 100 to limit the anammox effect on ammonium removal most of the anammox activity was distributed in granule size larger than 100 as shown in the supplementary information and the sludge was mixed with the effluent the reactor volume and sludge concentration for the batch test were 5 l and 6290 vss mg l 1 respectively the batch tests were performed by replacing 5 10 20 and 40 of the prepared wastewater with the wastewater in the reactor 2 5 analytical methods samples were prepared by filtering through a 0 45 syringe filter the nh4 n concentration was measured by kjeldahl nitrogen analysis kjeltec 1035 sweden no3 n concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex 120 usa no2 n and alkalinity as caco3 levels were analyzed according to standard method 3 results and discussion 3 1 nrr based feed distribution strategy the concentration of residual ammonium after each feeding phase was controlled by regulating the number of sub cycles from eleven in period i to one in period v and about 50 of the ammonium introduced into the reactor was converted to nitrite by pn in the aerobic phase therefore the hrt was controlled according to the concentration of residual nitrite after the anoxic and aerobic phases based on this operating strategy the nitrogen removal performance is presented in fig 1 a the performance for nitrogen removal is shown in more detail in the supplementary information after the stabilization of the single stage pn a the nitrate gradually accumulated and the average concentration in period i i was 51 8 8 5 mg l 1 however the nitrate was sharply decreased to 8 9 0 8 mg l 1 by controlling the influent c n ratio which increased the nre from 84 8 1 4 to 88 9 2 3 and which in turn increased the nrr at an nlr of 0 59 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 from 0 50 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 to 0 53 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 these results indicate that the nitrate produced as a by product of anammox reaction according to eq 2 may reduce the nre in the anammox process strous et al 1998 this problem can be solved by the coexistence of anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in a single stage sbr process the effluent nitrate concentration was maintained below 9 mg l 1 even at influent c n ratio of 0 5 in other words raising the influent c n ratio above 0 5 has no effect on the nre however denitrifiers have been reported to outcompete anammox bacteria for nitrite consumption under the c n condition higher than 2 chamchoi et al 2008 therefore proper pretreatment is required to treat nitrogenous wastewaters with a high c n ratio such as food wastewaters livestock manures and municipal wastewaters 2 nh4 1 32no2 0 066hco3 0 13h 1 02n2 0 256no3 0 066ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03h2o from period ii the amount of influent introduced at each sub cycle was controlled by regulating the number of sub cycles from eleven to one based on the increase in ammonium concentration before and after the feeding phase at each sub cycle the most important result was that the nrr increased steadily to a maximum in period iv with 0 84 days of hrt this results can be interpreted based on the data shown in fig 1b and the variation of the ratio of anoxic to aerobic phases the length of the anoxic phase required for anammox was relatively decreased up to period iv compared to that of the aerobic phase but then increased in period v the saa distribution also showed the same trend of increase and decrease the nitrite concentration at the beginning of the anoxic phase was determined by the residual ammonium concentration after the feeding phase therefore the concentration was regulated approximately from 10 mg no2 n l 1 in period i to 70 mg no2 n l 1 in period v this concentration range was used as a reference of substrate concentration for the saa test the nrr was the highest at the operating conditions of period iv in which the saa was the maximum initial nitrite concentration of 50 mg l 1 the effect of nitrite inhibition on anammox activity has been reported lotti et al 2012 and the kinetic value as an operating parameter has been calculated by the substrate inhibition model in contrast in the present study the aob activity increased as the substrate concentration increased as shown in fig 2 b and was found to be suitable for general monod models the calculated knh4 and sourmax for aob were 21 1 mg n l 1 and 0 15 mg o2 mgvss 1 h 1 respectively which were similar with reported values dan 2014 the kinetic difference between the two major microorganisms was clearly reflected in the increasing and decreasing tendency of the nrr these results revealed the saa to be more important than the aob activity as an operating parameter to control the nrr in the single stage sbr system generally an influent nlr control strategy can be used to improve the nrr in a biological nitrogen removal reactor carrera et al 2003 ruiz et al 2006 in the sbr process particularly the strategy of controlling the volumetric exchange rate ver is a representative strategy schwarzenbeck et al 2005 wilderer et al 2001 currently the demon configuration is the most widely used single stage sbr technology in the world lackner et al 2014 demon has adopted an operating strategy maintaining a nitrite concentration 5 mg l 1 since nitrite inhibitory effect was observed at 10 mg l 1 wett 2007 in contrast to the previous studies only the microbial kinetic characteristics not the nlr and the ver were considered to be influential operating factors affecting the nrr this study suggests that the nitrite concentration need to be maintained at about 50 mg l 1 for the activity of anammox bacteria at each anoxic phase this differentiated approach for nitrite concentration nitrite has been considered as an inhibitory factor for anammox processes will help further expand the insights into the single stage pn a in the sbr process 3 2 effect of ammonium oxidation rate aor by aob the ammonium concentration in the effluent was gradually increased from 65 3 1 7 mg l 1 in period i to 160 5 4 8 mg l 1 in period v with increasing effluent ph the profile of nitrogen compounds ph and alkalinity are shown in the supplementary information this decreased the total nre from 86 4 2 8 to 79 2 0 04 at the same time the air flow rate necessary to keep the do concentration less than 0 3 mg l 1 also gradually increased from 1 l min 1 in period i to 4 5 l min 1 in period v in this system the major aerobic reaction to achieve successful nitrogen removal was pn by aob which indicated that the change of oxygen demand according to operating conditions was closely related to the activity for aob based on eq 3 aob require approximately 2 mol of hco3 per 1 mol of nh4 n with the production of hydrogen ions being the only mechanism acting to decrease ph in the single stage pn a process 3 nh4 1 5o2 no2 h2o 2h the effect of the feed distribution strategy on aor by aob was investigated via batch test as shown in fig 2a since the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was maintained at 0 6 0 2 mg l 1 throughout the experiment period the decrease of aor by anammox was not considered the increase of residual substrate concentration with increasing exchange ratio gradually increased the necessary air flow rate required to maintain constant do concentration and the specific activity for aob in addition the alkalinity bicarbonate to ammonium molar ratio consumed by nitritation also increased from 2 09 to 2 54 these results show that the rate of alkalinity loss gradually increased the residual concentration of ammonium and alkalinity after the feeding phase was controlled by regulating the number of sub cycles as a result of this operating strategy increasing the residual substrate concentration in the reactor improved the nrr by increasing the specific activity for aob and anammox while the effect of alkalinity stripping degraded the ammonium oxidation efficiency are in the single stage sbr process the exchange between the liquid and gas phases occurs at the water surface and at the boundary of the air bubbles in case of pressurized aeration the low partial pressure of co2 in the aerated liquid atmospheric co2 concentration 0 035 limits the co2 concentration of the solution according to henry s law thus the rising air bubbles strip more inorganic carbon than they can transfer into the water wett and rauch 2003 with above phenomena the amount of stripped carbon dioxide has been reported to increase in proportion to the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide and the air flow rate mansourizadeh and ismail 2011 alkalinity balance depends on the equilibrium between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate bicarbonate plays an important role as an inorganic carbon source of autotrophic microorganisms in a nitrogen removal system and its concentration depends on ph based chemical equilibrium blackburne et al 2007 strategies for increasing the available alkalinity concentration to improve the nitrification rate have been studied wett and rauch 2003 the nitrification rate was tripled when the ph was increased from 7 0 to 7 3 because the portion of alkalinity able to be stripped was reduced from 19 to 10 5 in the present study the feed distribution strategy in the sbr cycle and sub cycles which was introduced in the next chapter was developed to minimize the negative influence of alkalinity loss 3 3 feed distribution strategy to improve nre the operating parameters affecting nrr and nre while following the aforementioned operating strategies were investigated in order to further improve the nrr the operating strategy for minimizing the alkalinity loss was further studied as the main strategy the influent that was injected only in the feeding phase of the sub cycles was divided and injected in the aerobic phase in order to consider two variables the amount of feed distribution at the aerobic phase and the ratio of influent injected into the aerobic phase at each sub cycle simultaneously the rsm technique was used 3 3 1 statistical analysis the relationship between the two variables and the seven responses was analyzed by rsm the different degree polynomial models i e linear two factor interaction 2fi quadratic and so on were used for data fitting and the results were then analyzed by anova to assess the goodness of fit table 2 illustrates the final quadratic equation attained by eliminating statistically insignificant variables and their interaction and presents other statistical parameters the model showed that the first order effects a and b interaction effect ab and the second order effects a2 and b2 were significant for all quadratic equations with very low probability value 0 0001 except those defining the cod removal efficiency tp removal efficiency and alkalinity removal efficiency in the case of the cod removal efficiency a linear model was fitted to the experimental data at the 95 confidence level the square of the correlation coefficient for each response was computed as the coefficient of determination r2 which is calculated as the sum of the square due to regression to the total sum of the square the r2 value for the fitted quadratic model was close to 1 and showed reasonable agreement with adjusted r2 adequate precision was determined by the signal to noise ratio or by a measure of the range of predicted responses relative to the associated error the value should be no less than 4 the value was found desirable for all models moreover the low values of the coefficient of variation cv 0 0005 1 37 indicate good precision and experimental reliability the adequacy of the models was tested through f tests the lack of fit f statistic was not significant as the p value was greater than 0 05 the press statistic is defined as the sum of the squares of the prediction residuals and gives a good indication of the predictive power of the model goodness 3 3 2 effect of ammonium removal the individual effect of variables a and b on ammonium concentration in the effluent was found by perturbation plot fig 3 which provides silhouette views of the response surface this plot is more useful when examining the effect on one factor rather than the interaction effect moreover a steep slope or curvature in a variable shows that the response is more sensitive than that of a flat line as shown in fig 3a variable a was very sensitive to ammonium removal and was closer to a quadratic effect than variable b the interaction effect of the variables is presented in fig 3b and c as a 3d surface graph and contour plot respectively considering all experiment results variables a and b affected the ammonium removal almost independently the effect of variable a on ammonium removal tended to exacerbate initially and reversed as the ratio of influent injected at the aerobic phase of sub cycles increased in contrast an increase of the amount of influent injected at the aerobic phase steadily improved the ammonium removal efficiency when the variables a and b were 0 47 and 5 respectively the effluent ammonium concentration was minimized at 91 3 mg l 1 throughout the experiment the influent ammonium concentration was maintained at 800 5 3 8 mg l 1 this indicated that variable a has an optimum point for maximizing the ammonium removal efficiency while variable b had only a positive effect the feed distribution strategies in the single stage sbr process has been mainly applied in the anoxic phase to utilize organic matters in reject water for denitrification as carbon source in addition it could enhance aeration efficiency for nitrification du et al 2019 lackner and horn 2012 yang et al 2016 even if the influent was fed into the sbr process during aerobic phase no clear criteria could be provided ali et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the effect of feeding strategies at each sbr sub cycle was identified in terms of the ammonium removal efficiency associated with the alkalinity loss as mentioned in section 3 2 the decrease of ammonium removal efficiency with increasing residual ammonium concentration after the feeding phase was caused by alkalinity loss this disadvantage was overcome effectively by distributing the influent into the aerobic and anaerobic phases based on the number of sub cycles determined on the basis of the specific activity of microorganisms this indicated that the alkalinity concentration at the beginning of the aerobic phase and the ratio of alkalinity loss were highly correlated 3 3 3 effect of nitrate removal the effect of variables a and b on the effluent nitrate concentration was investigated and the perturbation contour and 3d surface graph obtained from the equation presented in table 2 are shown in fig 4 variable a tended to initially lower the effluent nitrate concentration but generally had a negative effect whereas the effect of variable b was negligible in the anammox process nitrate produced as a by product of anammox reaction according to eq 2 may be one of the factors that deteriorate the nre as mentioned in section 3 1 this deterioration was removed effectively by controlling the proper c n ratio in the influent for the reduction of nitrate by denitrifiers thereby improving nrr generally the c n ratio for nitrate removal has been reported to range from 3 to 5 carrera et al 2004 this means that even an influent c n ratio as low as 0 5 is sufficient to remove the nitrate therefore in the single stage pn a process the concentration of organic matters introduced in the anoxic phase should be maintained in proportion to the nitrate concentration that can be removed under anoxic condition the residual organic matter in the aerobic phase cannot be utilized for nitrogen removal and will be completely oxidized by aerobic organic oxidizing bacteria accordingly unlike the effect of variable b variable a has a large effect on the residual nitrate concentration in the effluent 3 3 4 effect of nre and nrr three dimensional and contour plots for nre and nrr obtained from the equation presented in table 2 are shown in fig 5 the curvatures of the graphs imply that there is a relatively strong interaction between the variables which is verified by anova analysis at the highest variable a the lowest values of nre and nrr were computed to be 77 9 and 0 73 kg m3 d 1 with a decrease of variable b respectively at this point the ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the effluent were maximized for a constant variable b the nitrogen removal performance presented a certain tendency based on variable a of 0 43 and the maximized nre and nrr were 88 0 and 0 84 kg m 3 d 1 respectively at the highest value of variable b the major advantage of the sbr process is operational flexibility such as the feed distribution as a typical driving strategy for the single stage pn a process in this study denitrification nitritation anammox and co2 stripping in single stage sbr were optimized with seven dependent responses in fact the rsm technique has been rarely used in the single stage system with deammonification but is well applied in this study as a result the nitrogen removal performance better than the reported values can be achieved gong et al 2007 lackner et al 2014 li et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 this finding was verified through both statistical technique and experimental data previously the feed distribution studies in the sbr process have been conducted to investigate the individual effects of specific operating parameters the number of sub cycle aeration strategies hrt ver ph opr etc have been mainly considered as typical operating parameters graham and jolis 2016 2017 lackner et al 2012b vÃ¡zquez padÃ­n et al 2014 wett et al 1998 yang et al 2015 however there was a limitation in investigating the comprehensive operating parameters considering this point the rsm based optimization technique can be a good alternative for the optimization of single stage sbr with deammonification 3 4 process optimization with chosen responses the best compromise can be found visually by overlaying response contours on the contour plot where the region not meeting the critical specification sweet spot as shown in table 3 was shaded out rastegar et al 2011 graphical optimization produces an overlay plot of the contour graphs to display the area of feasible response values in the factor space fig 6 the optimum operating condition was identified based on four critical responses effluent ammonium concentration effluent nitrate concentration the nre and the nrr these four operating parameters were considered the most influential factors related to the feed distribution strategies for the single stage pn a process based on statistical analysis and experimental results the performance was optimized within the following ranges variable a of 0 33 0 51 and variable b of 3 2 5 the accuracy of the model was further verified by selecting any two points within the optimal range and the reactor was operated to compare actual experimental data with the predicted data 95 pi was defined as 95 of the prediction interval generated from the optimized model these values could help to confirm the experiment data xu et al 2015 as presented in the supplementary information the actual experimental data were shown to fall within the 95 pi range and the findings of this model were in close agreement with the model prediction in this study the rsm based process optimization technique was successfully applied and the interaction effect of independent operating factors was investigated the study findings can be applied effectively in mainstream pn a research the main issue in the mainstream pn a process is to achieve stable pn corbalÃ¡ robles et al 2016 laureni et al 2016 regmi et al 2014 do concentration residual ammonia concentration aeration strategy etc can be considered as the operating factors capable of inhibiting the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob since each factor is independent rather than dependent the rsm based optimization technique may be successfully applied in mainstream pn a research however since the role of each operating factor in the mainstream conditions remain unclear further studies must be performed to apply the rsm based optimization technique to mainstream research 4 conclusion in this study the feeding distribution strategy was optimized in the single stage pn a sbr process the anammox activity was increased by controlling the feed distribution in order to maximize the nrr the feeding strategy in sbr cycle and sub cycles was also evaluated using rsm to investigate the optimum condition for maximizing the nitrogen removal performance as a result the maximum nre and nrr were determined as 88 and 0 84 kg m 3 d 1 respectively this study provides insights into the feed distribution strategies in single stage sbr with pn a

18636,a partial nitritation pn anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process in sequencing batch reactor sbr was successfully developed to treat high strength ammonium wastewater the feed distribution in the sbr cycle and sub cycles was considered as the main operating strategy and was optimized using a response surface methodology rsm based optimization technique in the sbr cycle the maximum nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 79 0 01 kg m 3 d 1 was achieved by applying a feed distribution strategy that considered the kinetic characteristics of anammox and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob however this strategy negatively affected the nitrogen removal efficiency nre due to alkalinity loss therefore the feed distribution in the sbr sub cycles with respect to the nre and the nrr was further studied the nitrogen removal performance was optimized in the optimum region and an nre of 88 and an nrr of 0 84 kg m 3 d 1 were achieved the optimized model was verified in confirmation test the rsm based optimization results provide insights into the feed distribution strategy for achieving single stage pn anammox sbr operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox sequencing batch reactor optimization response surface methodology nitrogen removal rate nitrogen removal efficiency 1 introduction various wastewaters produced by human activities have resulted in an imbalanced nitrogen cycle leading to many natural disasters such as eutrophication in the water system canfield et al 2010 hence more stringent regulation of effluent nitrogen levels are required at point sources such as wastewater treatment plants wwtp czerwionka et al 2012 reject water taken from anaerobic digesters in wwtps is considered a major factor that has increased effluent nitrogen levels van kempen et al 2001 this wastewater contains a relatively high ammonium concentration 700 800 mg n l 1 which contributes 10 30 of the nitrogen load of wwtps with its flow rate accounting for 2 of wwtps influent janus 1996 van loosdrecht and salem 2006 moreover the co digestion systems used to further enhance the bio energy production rate tend to increase nitrogen levels in the reject water aÄdaÄ and sponza 2005 therefore the nitrogen compounds in the reject water classified as a sidestream need to be treated through a separate treatment facility to decrease nitrogen loads in wwtps abma et al 2010 in the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process ammonium nitrogen in wastewater is directly converted anaerobically to nitrogen gas with nitrite as an electron acceptor strous et al 1997a the anammox process coupled with partial nitritation pn has been currently regarded as a promising technology in terms of energy minimization for nitrogen removal strous et al 1997b the economic benefits of pn anammox pn a have been reported by many researchers ali and okabe 2015 chamchoi et al 2008 cho et al 2017 choi et al 2017 egli et al 2001 more than one hundred full scale plants have been operated since the first anammox plant was installed at rotterdam in 2002 jetten et al 2002 lackner et al 2014 to date various reactor configurations such as sequencing batch reactors sbrs attached growth biofilm reactors moving bed biofilm reactors and upflow granular sludge reactors based on biofilm and granule technology have been developed to overcome the major challenges such as the low growth rate and high nitrite toxic effect of anammox bacteria for full scale implementation dapena mora et al 2004 lackner and horn 2013 among them a sbr based single stage pn a technology is widely employed in full scale plants for the treatment of ammonium rich wastewater ganiguÃ© et al 2010 especially for sbrs the operating strategies and regime are crucial to maintain stable performance of the single stage pn a process lackner and horn 2013 several research groups have developed sbr operating strategies known as demon innerebner et al 2007 oland kuai and verstraete 1998 and canon nielsen et al 2005 these have been mainly applied to treat reject water taken from digestion or co digestion systems and the resulting benefits to the wwtps have been reported koch et al 2015 as the major operating strategy for sbr operation feed distribution with interval aeration has been mostly utilized to maintain low nitrite concentration as it has a toxic effect on anammox activity choi et al 2018 lackner and horn 2012 lotti et al 2012 wett et al 2007 the demon configuration is the most popular having been used in more than 80 of all sbr systems lackner et al 2014 demon sbrs use a patented ph based feed control to keep the nitrite concentration below 5 mg l 1 wett 2006 in addition a high nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 71 kg m 3 d 1 with a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 79 was achieved wett et al 2013 on the other hand other studies have shown that not only does it not provide an insight into the feed distribution but the attained nrr was relatively low lackner et al 2012a reported that the sbr cycle was divided into four or six sub cycles with interval feeding and that the maximum nrr was 0 45 kg m 3 d 1 although the nre was more than 90 on going full scale experience of anammox plants has facilitated stable nre higher than 75 using various strategies for sbr technology but only a few studies have been conducted to improve the nrr response surface methodology rsm is a combination of statistical and mathematical techniques that are useful for developing improving and optimizing a process the rsm technique can extract important parameters from a number of factors and then examine their interactive effects on dependent variables the rsm technique has been widely used to develop various bioprocesses such as enzyme production food technology and environmental biotechnology kalil et al 2001 manivannan and rajasimman 2011 in addition rsm is also used for the optimization of operating conditions in biological processes the volumetric exchange ratio and the anaerobic aerobic time ratio in a two step feeding sbr system have been considered as the main operating parameters and optimum boundaries were proposed based on the removal performance wu et al 2015 in this study an rsm based optimization technique was applied for improving nitrogen removal performance nrr and nre in single stage sbr with pn a for this purpose the independent variables on the feed distribution in the sbr cycle and sub cycles were analyzed the alkalinity stripping effect and the difference in the kinetic characteristics between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox were used as factors to determine the criteria for feed distribution this study aim to provide insights into the feed distribution strategies in single stage sbr with pn a 2 materials and method 2 1 synthetic wastewater and seed sludge synthetic wastewater was used in this study and nitrogen and alkalinity concentrations similar to those of an anaerobic digester supernatant were prepared in order to replicate typical digester characteristics 0 8 g l 1 of ammonium nitrogen as nh4 2so4 and 2 85 g l 1 of caco3 as nahco3 the mineral media were 0 027 g of kh2po4 0 1 g of mgcl 6h2o 0 18 g of cacl2 2h2o and 1 ml of trace elements i and ii in 1 l of water trace elements were used according to van de graaf et al 1996 glucose was used as an organic source to control influent c n ratio influent ph was 7 8 0 2 and was not further controlled the seed sludge of aob and anammox was taken from the lab scale reactor the nrr of the anammox reactor was 1 1 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 at a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 1 3 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 for anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia sp enriched sludge was inoculated in the reactor the pn performance under the nlr of 1 6 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 showed a nitrite production rate of 0 7 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 the heterotrophic denitrifiers were taken from the a2o process of gyeongsan wwtp in korea the ratio of anammox aob denitrifiers seeded in the reactor was 1 1 0 1 with a volatile suspended solids vss concentration of 7250 mg l 1 and total suspended solids tss of 8026 mg l 1 2 2 reactor configuration and start up the sbr with a working volume of 8 l was operated to carry out single stage pn a in an incubator with the temperature maintained at 30 c dissolved oxygen do concentration was strictly limited to less than 0 3 mg o 2 l 1 by hach ldo probe ph aph 250 v ph electrode and oxidation reduction potential orp aor 450 v orp electrode were monitored online the sbr cycle consisting of several sub cycles containing a feeding phase anoxic phase and aerobic phase was controlled by a programmable logic controller the sbr cycling conditions at each period are shown in supplementary information after completion of these sub cycles another post mixing phase of 30 min followed the cycle ended with a 40 min settling phase and a 10 min withdrawal phase for effluent discharge the lengths of each phase were determined based on the nitrite concentration produced by pn or remaining after anammox reaction the hydraulic retention time hrt was controlled by monitoring the reaction rate of pn and anammox 2 3 optimization of the feed distribution 2 3 1 nrr based feed distribution strategy the main aim in this part was to investigate the operating parameters affecting nrr and to optimize the feed distribution strategy in the sbr cycle the experiment consisted of the periods i to v and period i was further divided into periods i i and i ii as shown in table 1 the purpose of period i was to estimate the potential coexistence of anammox and denitrification bacteria by controlling the influent carbon nitrogen codcr nh4 n ratio from 0 to 0 5 and to investigate the variation of nrr for periods i to v the nh4 n concentration mg l 1 supplied after the sub feeding phase at each sub cycle was controlled up to 20 mg l 1 to 140 mg l 1 by adjusting the number of sub cycles from eleven to one 2 3 2 nitrogen removal performance based feed distribution strategy the feed distribution strategy based on nrr was investigated through the aforementioned operating strategy in this part the influent supplied only in the anoxic phase of the sub cycles was divided and injected into both the anoxic section and the aerobic section the number of feed distributions variable a and the ratio of influent injected variable b at the sub aerobic phase with respect to the nre and the nrr were further evaluated as main parameters the interactive effect of variable b on variable a was considered for the following reasons in single stage pn a the major microorganisms primarily involved in nitrogen removal are anammox bacteria and aob the growth rate and activity distribution of aob follow the typical monod equation regmi et al 2014 however the kinetic parameters of anammox bacteria are mainly determined dependent on substrate inhibition effects especially for nitrite therefore the haldane edwards and aiba model has been developed as the kinetic inhibition model for the substrate jin et al 2013 the difference in the kinetic characteristics of the two microorganisms should be considered in formulation the operating strategy for a single stage sbr system a representative strategy would be the influent distribution strategy to control residual substrate concentration in the sbr process rsm is a mathematical and statistical technique for analyzing the effect of several independent variables on reactor performance yu et al 2014 this statistical tool has mainly been used to optimize the bioreactor process and thus enhance the removal performance of contaminants by minimizing the number of experiments the rsm used in the present study was a central composite face centered design ccfd examining two different factors a and b by design expert software version 11 0 stat ease inc minneapolis usa and the experimental design plan of ccfd is shown in the supplementary information the design consisted of 2 k factorial points augmented by 2 k axial points and a center point where k is the number of variables the two variables were coded in 1 for factorial points and 0 for central points for a comprehensive analysis of single stage pn a the following seven dependent responses were either directly measured or calculated effluent ammonium concentration effluent nitrate concentration nre nrr chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency total phosphorus removal efficiency and alkalinity removal efficiency the coefficient of the quadratic equation model is expressed as follows 1 y Î² 0 i 1 k Î² i x i i 1 k Î² i i x i 2 i 1 j i 1 Î² i j x i x j Îµ where i and j are the linear and quadratic coefficients respectively Î² is the regression coefficient x i and x j are independent variables and Îµ is an error value three dimensional plots and their respective contour plots were obtained based on the effect of the levels of the two factors from these three dimensional plots the model equation was used to predict the optimum range considering the two variables 2 4 aerobic and anoxic specific activity tests specific anammox activity saa specific oxygen utilization rate sour and specific nitrate utilization rate snur were tested for measuring the substrate consumption rate by anammox aob and denitrifiers as shown in the supplementary information the molar ratio of alkalinity hco3 to nh4 n consumed by aob and the oxygen demand required to maintain constant do concentration 0 3 mg o2 l 1 depending on the amount of influent supplied was further investigated the sludge taken from the reactor was sieved using 100 to limit the anammox effect on ammonium removal most of the anammox activity was distributed in granule size larger than 100 as shown in the supplementary information and the sludge was mixed with the effluent the reactor volume and sludge concentration for the batch test were 5 l and 6290 vss mg l 1 respectively the batch tests were performed by replacing 5 10 20 and 40 of the prepared wastewater with the wastewater in the reactor 2 5 analytical methods samples were prepared by filtering through a 0 45 syringe filter the nh4 n concentration was measured by kjeldahl nitrogen analysis kjeltec 1035 sweden no3 n concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex 120 usa no2 n and alkalinity as caco3 levels were analyzed according to standard method 3 results and discussion 3 1 nrr based feed distribution strategy the concentration of residual ammonium after each feeding phase was controlled by regulating the number of sub cycles from eleven in period i to one in period v and about 50 of the ammonium introduced into the reactor was converted to nitrite by pn in the aerobic phase therefore the hrt was controlled according to the concentration of residual nitrite after the anoxic and aerobic phases based on this operating strategy the nitrogen removal performance is presented in fig 1 a the performance for nitrogen removal is shown in more detail in the supplementary information after the stabilization of the single stage pn a the nitrate gradually accumulated and the average concentration in period i i was 51 8 8 5 mg l 1 however the nitrate was sharply decreased to 8 9 0 8 mg l 1 by controlling the influent c n ratio which increased the nre from 84 8 1 4 to 88 9 2 3 and which in turn increased the nrr at an nlr of 0 59 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 from 0 50 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 to 0 53 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 these results indicate that the nitrate produced as a by product of anammox reaction according to eq 2 may reduce the nre in the anammox process strous et al 1998 this problem can be solved by the coexistence of anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in a single stage sbr process the effluent nitrate concentration was maintained below 9 mg l 1 even at influent c n ratio of 0 5 in other words raising the influent c n ratio above 0 5 has no effect on the nre however denitrifiers have been reported to outcompete anammox bacteria for nitrite consumption under the c n condition higher than 2 chamchoi et al 2008 therefore proper pretreatment is required to treat nitrogenous wastewaters with a high c n ratio such as food wastewaters livestock manures and municipal wastewaters 2 nh4 1 32no2 0 066hco3 0 13h 1 02n2 0 256no3 0 066ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03h2o from period ii the amount of influent introduced at each sub cycle was controlled by regulating the number of sub cycles from eleven to one based on the increase in ammonium concentration before and after the feeding phase at each sub cycle the most important result was that the nrr increased steadily to a maximum in period iv with 0 84 days of hrt this results can be interpreted based on the data shown in fig 1b and the variation of the ratio of anoxic to aerobic phases the length of the anoxic phase required for anammox was relatively decreased up to period iv compared to that of the aerobic phase but then increased in period v the saa distribution also showed the same trend of increase and decrease the nitrite concentration at the beginning of the anoxic phase was determined by the residual ammonium concentration after the feeding phase therefore the concentration was regulated approximately from 10 mg no2 n l 1 in period i to 70 mg no2 n l 1 in period v this concentration range was used as a reference of substrate concentration for the saa test the nrr was the highest at the operating conditions of period iv in which the saa was the maximum initial nitrite concentration of 50 mg l 1 the effect of nitrite inhibition on anammox activity has been reported lotti et al 2012 and the kinetic value as an operating parameter has been calculated by the substrate inhibition model in contrast in the present study the aob activity increased as the substrate concentration increased as shown in fig 2 b and was found to be suitable for general monod models the calculated knh4 and sourmax for aob were 21 1 mg n l 1 and 0 15 mg o2 mgvss 1 h 1 respectively which were similar with reported values dan 2014 the kinetic difference between the two major microorganisms was clearly reflected in the increasing and decreasing tendency of the nrr these results revealed the saa to be more important than the aob activity as an operating parameter to control the nrr in the single stage sbr system generally an influent nlr control strategy can be used to improve the nrr in a biological nitrogen removal reactor carrera et al 2003 ruiz et al 2006 in the sbr process particularly the strategy of controlling the volumetric exchange rate ver is a representative strategy schwarzenbeck et al 2005 wilderer et al 2001 currently the demon configuration is the most widely used single stage sbr technology in the world lackner et al 2014 demon has adopted an operating strategy maintaining a nitrite concentration 5 mg l 1 since nitrite inhibitory effect was observed at 10 mg l 1 wett 2007 in contrast to the previous studies only the microbial kinetic characteristics not the nlr and the ver were considered to be influential operating factors affecting the nrr this study suggests that the nitrite concentration need to be maintained at about 50 mg l 1 for the activity of anammox bacteria at each anoxic phase this differentiated approach for nitrite concentration nitrite has been considered as an inhibitory factor for anammox processes will help further expand the insights into the single stage pn a in the sbr process 3 2 effect of ammonium oxidation rate aor by aob the ammonium concentration in the effluent was gradually increased from 65 3 1 7 mg l 1 in period i to 160 5 4 8 mg l 1 in period v with increasing effluent ph the profile of nitrogen compounds ph and alkalinity are shown in the supplementary information this decreased the total nre from 86 4 2 8 to 79 2 0 04 at the same time the air flow rate necessary to keep the do concentration less than 0 3 mg l 1 also gradually increased from 1 l min 1 in period i to 4 5 l min 1 in period v in this system the major aerobic reaction to achieve successful nitrogen removal was pn by aob which indicated that the change of oxygen demand according to operating conditions was closely related to the activity for aob based on eq 3 aob require approximately 2 mol of hco3 per 1 mol of nh4 n with the production of hydrogen ions being the only mechanism acting to decrease ph in the single stage pn a process 3 nh4 1 5o2 no2 h2o 2h the effect of the feed distribution strategy on aor by aob was investigated via batch test as shown in fig 2a since the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was maintained at 0 6 0 2 mg l 1 throughout the experiment period the decrease of aor by anammox was not considered the increase of residual substrate concentration with increasing exchange ratio gradually increased the necessary air flow rate required to maintain constant do concentration and the specific activity for aob in addition the alkalinity bicarbonate to ammonium molar ratio consumed by nitritation also increased from 2 09 to 2 54 these results show that the rate of alkalinity loss gradually increased the residual concentration of ammonium and alkalinity after the feeding phase was controlled by regulating the number of sub cycles as a result of this operating strategy increasing the residual substrate concentration in the reactor improved the nrr by increasing the specific activity for aob and anammox while the effect of alkalinity stripping degraded the ammonium oxidation efficiency are in the single stage sbr process the exchange between the liquid and gas phases occurs at the water surface and at the boundary of the air bubbles in case of pressurized aeration the low partial pressure of co2 in the aerated liquid atmospheric co2 concentration 0 035 limits the co2 concentration of the solution according to henry s law thus the rising air bubbles strip more inorganic carbon than they can transfer into the water wett and rauch 2003 with above phenomena the amount of stripped carbon dioxide has been reported to increase in proportion to the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide and the air flow rate mansourizadeh and ismail 2011 alkalinity balance depends on the equilibrium between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate bicarbonate plays an important role as an inorganic carbon source of autotrophic microorganisms in a nitrogen removal system and its concentration depends on ph based chemical equilibrium blackburne et al 2007 strategies for increasing the available alkalinity concentration to improve the nitrification rate have been studied wett and rauch 2003 the nitrification rate was tripled when the ph was increased from 7 0 to 7 3 because the portion of alkalinity able to be stripped was reduced from 19 to 10 5 in the present study the feed distribution strategy in the sbr cycle and sub cycles which was introduced in the next chapter was developed to minimize the negative influence of alkalinity loss 3 3 feed distribution strategy to improve nre the operating parameters affecting nrr and nre while following the aforementioned operating strategies were investigated in order to further improve the nrr the operating strategy for minimizing the alkalinity loss was further studied as the main strategy the influent that was injected only in the feeding phase of the sub cycles was divided and injected in the aerobic phase in order to consider two variables the amount of feed distribution at the aerobic phase and the ratio of influent injected into the aerobic phase at each sub cycle simultaneously the rsm technique was used 3 3 1 statistical analysis the relationship between the two variables and the seven responses was analyzed by rsm the different degree polynomial models i e linear two factor interaction 2fi quadratic and so on were used for data fitting and the results were then analyzed by anova to assess the goodness of fit table 2 illustrates the final quadratic equation attained by eliminating statistically insignificant variables and their interaction and presents other statistical parameters the model showed that the first order effects a and b interaction effect ab and the second order effects a2 and b2 were significant for all quadratic equations with very low probability value 0 0001 except those defining the cod removal efficiency tp removal efficiency and alkalinity removal efficiency in the case of the cod removal efficiency a linear model was fitted to the experimental data at the 95 confidence level the square of the correlation coefficient for each response was computed as the coefficient of determination r2 which is calculated as the sum of the square due to regression to the total sum of the square the r2 value for the fitted quadratic model was close to 1 and showed reasonable agreement with adjusted r2 adequate precision was determined by the signal to noise ratio or by a measure of the range of predicted responses relative to the associated error the value should be no less than 4 the value was found desirable for all models moreover the low values of the coefficient of variation cv 0 0005 1 37 indicate good precision and experimental reliability the adequacy of the models was tested through f tests the lack of fit f statistic was not significant as the p value was greater than 0 05 the press statistic is defined as the sum of the squares of the prediction residuals and gives a good indication of the predictive power of the model goodness 3 3 2 effect of ammonium removal the individual effect of variables a and b on ammonium concentration in the effluent was found by perturbation plot fig 3 which provides silhouette views of the response surface this plot is more useful when examining the effect on one factor rather than the interaction effect moreover a steep slope or curvature in a variable shows that the response is more sensitive than that of a flat line as shown in fig 3a variable a was very sensitive to ammonium removal and was closer to a quadratic effect than variable b the interaction effect of the variables is presented in fig 3b and c as a 3d surface graph and contour plot respectively considering all experiment results variables a and b affected the ammonium removal almost independently the effect of variable a on ammonium removal tended to exacerbate initially and reversed as the ratio of influent injected at the aerobic phase of sub cycles increased in contrast an increase of the amount of influent injected at the aerobic phase steadily improved the ammonium removal efficiency when the variables a and b were 0 47 and 5 respectively the effluent ammonium concentration was minimized at 91 3 mg l 1 throughout the experiment the influent ammonium concentration was maintained at 800 5 3 8 mg l 1 this indicated that variable a has an optimum point for maximizing the ammonium removal efficiency while variable b had only a positive effect the feed distribution strategies in the single stage sbr process has been mainly applied in the anoxic phase to utilize organic matters in reject water for denitrification as carbon source in addition it could enhance aeration efficiency for nitrification du et al 2019 lackner and horn 2012 yang et al 2016 even if the influent was fed into the sbr process during aerobic phase no clear criteria could be provided ali et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the effect of feeding strategies at each sbr sub cycle was identified in terms of the ammonium removal efficiency associated with the alkalinity loss as mentioned in section 3 2 the decrease of ammonium removal efficiency with increasing residual ammonium concentration after the feeding phase was caused by alkalinity loss this disadvantage was overcome effectively by distributing the influent into the aerobic and anaerobic phases based on the number of sub cycles determined on the basis of the specific activity of microorganisms this indicated that the alkalinity concentration at the beginning of the aerobic phase and the ratio of alkalinity loss were highly correlated 3 3 3 effect of nitrate removal the effect of variables a and b on the effluent nitrate concentration was investigated and the perturbation contour and 3d surface graph obtained from the equation presented in table 2 are shown in fig 4 variable a tended to initially lower the effluent nitrate concentration but generally had a negative effect whereas the effect of variable b was negligible in the anammox process nitrate produced as a by product of anammox reaction according to eq 2 may be one of the factors that deteriorate the nre as mentioned in section 3 1 this deterioration was removed effectively by controlling the proper c n ratio in the influent for the reduction of nitrate by denitrifiers thereby improving nrr generally the c n ratio for nitrate removal has been reported to range from 3 to 5 carrera et al 2004 this means that even an influent c n ratio as low as 0 5 is sufficient to remove the nitrate therefore in the single stage pn a process the concentration of organic matters introduced in the anoxic phase should be maintained in proportion to the nitrate concentration that can be removed under anoxic condition the residual organic matter in the aerobic phase cannot be utilized for nitrogen removal and will be completely oxidized by aerobic organic oxidizing bacteria accordingly unlike the effect of variable b variable a has a large effect on the residual nitrate concentration in the effluent 3 3 4 effect of nre and nrr three dimensional and contour plots for nre and nrr obtained from the equation presented in table 2 are shown in fig 5 the curvatures of the graphs imply that there is a relatively strong interaction between the variables which is verified by anova analysis at the highest variable a the lowest values of nre and nrr were computed to be 77 9 and 0 73 kg m3 d 1 with a decrease of variable b respectively at this point the ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the effluent were maximized for a constant variable b the nitrogen removal performance presented a certain tendency based on variable a of 0 43 and the maximized nre and nrr were 88 0 and 0 84 kg m 3 d 1 respectively at the highest value of variable b the major advantage of the sbr process is operational flexibility such as the feed distribution as a typical driving strategy for the single stage pn a process in this study denitrification nitritation anammox and co2 stripping in single stage sbr were optimized with seven dependent responses in fact the rsm technique has been rarely used in the single stage system with deammonification but is well applied in this study as a result the nitrogen removal performance better than the reported values can be achieved gong et al 2007 lackner et al 2014 li et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 this finding was verified through both statistical technique and experimental data previously the feed distribution studies in the sbr process have been conducted to investigate the individual effects of specific operating parameters the number of sub cycle aeration strategies hrt ver ph opr etc have been mainly considered as typical operating parameters graham and jolis 2016 2017 lackner et al 2012b vÃ¡zquez padÃ­n et al 2014 wett et al 1998 yang et al 2015 however there was a limitation in investigating the comprehensive operating parameters considering this point the rsm based optimization technique can be a good alternative for the optimization of single stage sbr with deammonification 3 4 process optimization with chosen responses the best compromise can be found visually by overlaying response contours on the contour plot where the region not meeting the critical specification sweet spot as shown in table 3 was shaded out rastegar et al 2011 graphical optimization produces an overlay plot of the contour graphs to display the area of feasible response values in the factor space fig 6 the optimum operating condition was identified based on four critical responses effluent ammonium concentration effluent nitrate concentration the nre and the nrr these four operating parameters were considered the most influential factors related to the feed distribution strategies for the single stage pn a process based on statistical analysis and experimental results the performance was optimized within the following ranges variable a of 0 33 0 51 and variable b of 3 2 5 the accuracy of the model was further verified by selecting any two points within the optimal range and the reactor was operated to compare actual experimental data with the predicted data 95 pi was defined as 95 of the prediction interval generated from the optimized model these values could help to confirm the experiment data xu et al 2015 as presented in the supplementary information the actual experimental data were shown to fall within the 95 pi range and the findings of this model were in close agreement with the model prediction in this study the rsm based process optimization technique was successfully applied and the interaction effect of independent operating factors was investigated the study findings can be applied effectively in mainstream pn a research the main issue in the mainstream pn a process is to achieve stable pn corbalÃ¡ robles et al 2016 laureni et al 2016 regmi et al 2014 do concentration residual ammonia concentration aeration strategy etc can be considered as the operating factors capable of inhibiting the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob since each factor is independent rather than dependent the rsm based optimization technique may be successfully applied in mainstream pn a research however since the role of each operating factor in the mainstream conditions remain unclear further studies must be performed to apply the rsm based optimization technique to mainstream research 4 conclusion in this study the feeding distribution strategy was optimized in the single stage pn a sbr process the anammox activity was increased by controlling the feed distribution in order to maximize the nrr the feeding strategy in sbr cycle and sub cycles was also evaluated using rsm to investigate the optimum condition for maximizing the nitrogen removal performance as a result the maximum nre and nrr were determined as 88 and 0 84 kg m 3 d 1 respectively this study provides insights into the feed distribution strategies in single stage sbr with pn a

18637,the increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms in surface waters may increase the input of algal organic matter aom to the dissolved organic matter pool the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms and noniodinated disinfection byproducts dbps in synthetic waters containing aom extracted from microcystis aeruginosa was investigated in chloramination preformed and in situ formed chloramine nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl respectively and chlorination cl2 processes aom is much more favorable for iodine incorporation than natural organic matter nom for example the formation of i thm from aom is much higher than nom isolate extracted from treated water e g 3 5 times higher in the nh2cl process and thus higher iodine utilization and substitution factors from aom were observed short contact time 2 min chlorination in cl2 nh2cl process leading to the formation of halogenated intermediates favored i thm formation compared with nh2cl process however further increasing chlorine contact time from 5 min to 24 h facilitated the conversion from iodide to iodate and thus i thm formation decreased meanwhile the formation of noniodinated thm4 haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetaldehydes hals increased factors including concentrations of aom and bromide ph and chlorine nitrogen ratios influenced the formation of i thms and noniodinated dbps to evaluate the benefit of mitigating i thm formation over the risk of noniodinated dbp formation measured dbps were weighed against their mammalian cell toxicity indexes increasing the chlorine exposure increased the calculated cytotoxicity based on concentrations of measured i thms and noniodinated dbps since unregulated hans and hals were the controlling agents graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts algal organic matter iodide iodine substitution factor iodinated trihalomethanes 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of blooms of cyanobacteria also referred to blue green algae in surface waters worldwide poses numerous water quality problems paerl and huisman 2008 their concentrations in large reservoirs located in the united states us are likely to increase due to increases in water temperature and nutrient levels chapra et al 2017 as a result algal organic matter aom can be released due to excretion of cyanobacterial cells naturally or physico chemically e g oxidant addition in the algal bloom event qi et al 2016 aom characterized by the protein carbohydrate lipids nucleic acid types of structure henderson et al 2008 her et al 2004 exhibits a hydrophilic character and low aromaticity which is different from terrestrial natural organic matter nom derived from lignin and containing mainly polyphenolic structure leenheer and crouÃ© 2003 therefore the fraction of aom over the bulk dissolved organic matter dom may increase after a conventional treatment train since this hydrophilic organic carbon fraction is recalcitrant to coagulation lee and westerhoff 2006 widrig et al 1996 chlorine cl2 in the form of hypochlorous acid hocl in water disinfection after conventional treatment is a generally used strategy to provide hygienically safe drinking water however chlorine can react with dom to form toxic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps liu and croue 2016 to comply with the current drinking water standards for regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas an increasing number of water utilities in the us have switched disinfection practices from chlorine to chloramine liu et al 2017a seidel et al 2005 one of the unintended consequences is the formation of iodinated dbps i dbps which was derived from the occurrence of iodide i in the source water in fresh waters concentrations of i generally range from 0 5 to 20 Î¼g l liu et al 2014 moran et al 2002 however under certain circumstances such as seawater intrusion blending desalinated seawaters with fresh water source water receiving hydraulic fracturing brines elevated i concentrations up to 100 Î¼g l in the source waters were reported harkness et al 2015 richardson et al 2008 naturally occurring iodide can be quickly oxidized to iodine in the form of hypoiodous acid hoi in water by chlorine and chloramine kumar et al 1986 hoi can be further oxidized by hocl to iodate io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 which is competition with the hoi reactions with nom to form i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 fang et al 2018 hua et al 2006 jones et al 2012 jones et al 2011 liu et al 2017b smith et al 2010 ye et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 chloramine does not further oxidize hoi to the non toxic io3 bichsel and von gunten 2000 leading to the preferential formation of i dbps this was demonstrated by the i dbp occurrence data in finished drinking waters for example a nationwide dbp survey in the us indicated that the median concentration of six iodinated trihalomethanes i thms was 0 4 Î¼g l while a maximum of 19 Î¼g l was found in drinking water disinfected by chloramines chlorine and ammonia were added simultaneously krasner et al 2006 another survey over 23 water supplies in north america also recorded that i thms were highest at plants with short free chlorine contact times 1 min followed by ammonia addition while lowest at a chlorination only plant richardson et al 2008 the formation of i dbps in drinking water became a particular concern because in general they are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogues plewa et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 in addition the formation of i thms can cause taste and odor problems in drinking waters hansson et al 1987 aom was reported to serve as precursors of chlorinated dbps under formation potential conditions fang et al 2010 nguyen et al 2005 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 our previous study indicated that bromine in the form of hypobromous acid hobr in water forming from the reaction between hocl and bromide br which usually coexists with i is prone to react with aom to form brominated dbps bromine substitution factors of dbps thms haas haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetaldehydes hals from aom were higher than those from terrestrial nom liu et al 2018 due to the distinct nature of aom with nom the understanding of how iodine competes for the aom with chlorine and bromine to produce halogenated dbps in chloramination process remains unknown this will determine the formation and speciation of i dbps from chloramination of aom in view of highly toxicological significance of i dbps and increasing occurrence of harmful algal bloom in surface waters the objective of this study is to investigate the formation of i thms and noniodinated thms hans and hals from aom under two chloramination scenarios preformed and in situ produced chloramine defined as nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl process respectively chlorination treatment scenario defined as cl2 process was also studied for comparison the formation of io3 i thms and noniodinated dbps was examined under various water quality parameters such as the type and concentration of dom initial br concentration ph and cl2 n ratio finally the cytotoxicity was calculated based on the measured dbp concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemical solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals or stock solutions using deionized milli q water 18 2

worldwide such as lake taihu in china yang et al 2008 lake nieuwe meer in the netherlands joehnk et al 2008 and lake erie in the us michalak et al 2013 therefore it was selected as the model cyanobacterium species in this study the cyanobacteria culturing and extraction of aom can be found in our previous study liu et al 2018 in addition treated water was blended with aom at different ratios to make the algae impacted waters 50 tw 50 aom and 25 tw 75 aom represent blending ratios of tw aom of 1 1 and 1 3 respectively procedures and dom characteristics are detailed in supplementary

formation of io3 i thms and non iodinated dbps in the dark at room temperature 21 1 c in nh2cl cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes was investigated monochloramine nh2cl stock solution was prepared by adding chlorine stock solution to ammonium chloride nh4cl stock solution dropwise under vigorous stirring at ph 8 8 with molar cl2 n ratios of 0 2 1 0 reactions were initiated by the injection of an aliquot of hocl preformed nh2cl for nh2cl process stock solution to 1 l of dom solution from 0 5 to 4 0 mg c l containing i 0 5 Î¼m i e 63 5 Î¼g l and br 0 5 0 Î¼m i e 0 400 Î¼g l under vigorous stirring for 30 s afterwards reaction solutions were rapidly transferred to 125 ml amber bottles for cl2 nh2cl process after various prechlorination times 2 5 15 and 30 min reaction solutions were quenched by nh4cl under vigorous stirring molar cl2 n ratios of 0 2 1 0 to allow 24 h chloramination this strategy was used to mimic the chloramination disinfection using in situ produced chloramine at water treatment plants after the addition of nh4cl the stirring stopped and bottles were filled with several milliliters of reaction solutions so that no headspace remained and sealed with teflon lined caps for cl2 process no nh4cl was added preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the chlorine demand at each reaction interval and a measurable residual oxidant for 24 h chlorination after 24 h reaction approximately 15 ml of samples were withdrawn and quenched with sodium sulfite for io3 measurement while for dbp analysis samples were quenched immediately with ascorbic acid molar ratio 1 0 the ph was adjusted to 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 with hno3 or naoh solutions in the presence of a 10 0 mm tetraborate or phosphate buffer each experiment was performed in duplicate 2 5 calculations of iodine substitution factor isf iodine utilization factor iuf and cytotoxicity isf is defined as the ratio of the molar concentration of iodine incorporated into a given class of dbps to the total molar concentrations of chlorine bromine and iodine atoms in that class iuf is defined as the ratio of the molar concentration of iodine incorporated into the quantified dbps to the initial i concentrations the calculated cytotoxicity assessment was performed by dividing measured concentrations of each group of dbps by their toxic concentrations lc50 values using quantitative mammalian cell cytotoxicity analyses and assuming that toxicity is additive plewa and wagner 2009 wagner and plewa 2017 yeatts et al 2010 this approach was used to assess toxicity of measured dbps and evaluate the contribution of individual dbps to the total dbp associated toxicity krasner et al 2016 liu et al 2018 plewa et al 2017 smith et al 2010 the detailed information can be found in text s4 5 and table s2 of the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of dom type fig s1 of the supplementary material presents the effect of dom type on hox concentrations at different reaction times which decayed from 2 min to 24 h after 24 h residual hox concentrations ranged from 0 2 to 0 9 mg l as cl2 indicating that there was enough oxidant to allow the formation of dbps fig 1 illustrates concentrations of i thms and thm4 in the presence of various types of dom the formation of io3 and concentrations of hans and hals are presented in figs s2 and s3 of the supplementary material respectively 3 1 1 i thms 3 1 1 1 formation in nh2cl process concentrations of i thms in the presence of rw and tw nom in nh2cl process were 19 7 1 1 representing mean standard deviations in this paper and 23 7 0 7 nm corresponding to 7 3 0 3 and 8 5 0 2 Î¼g l respectively this indicated that tw with a lower reactivity produced higher concentrations of i thms as compared to the higher suva nom isolate under chloramination conditions which is in agreement with the literature allard et al 2015 jones et al 2012 increasing the blending ratio of aom to treated water increased the formation of i thms concentrations of i thms were 23 7 0 7 46 9 1 7 50 9 8 6 and 83 8 8 4 nm corresponding to 8 5 0 2 17 6 0 6 19 2 3 3 and 32 1 3 3 Î¼g l for blending ratios of 0 50 75 and 100 respectively the concentration of i thms formed from aom was 3 5 times higher than nom isolate extracted from treated water indicating that aom can serve as a stronger i thm precursor than nom in nh2cl process the iufs from rw and tw nom were 0 11 and 0 12 respectively which were lower than that of aom i e 0 48 fig s4 of the supplementary material 3 1 1 2 formation in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes interestingly a short free chlorine exposure 2 min followed by ammonia addition enhanced the formation of i thms compared with chloramination using preformed nh2cl concentrations of i thms in 2 min cl2 nh2cl process from rw tw 50 tw 50 aom 25 tw 75 aom and aom were 16 2 1 5 16 4 0 3 37 2 2 7 43 5 2 8 46 7 1 9 nm which were 2 2 1 9 2 1 2 3 and 1 5 times respectively as high as those generated in nh2cl process fig 1a the higher iufs in 2 min chlorination followed by ammonia addition was also observed fig s4 of the supplementary material meanwhile the hoi can be oxidized by hocl or hobr to io3 and io3 concentrations in 2 min prechlorination were in the range of 0 11 0 31 Î¼m fig s2 of the supplementary material the formation of thms is a multi step process through several halogenation reactions fuson and bull 1934 short chlorination time 2 min in the presence of br can lead to the formation of chlorinated or brominated intermediates pan and zhang 2013 after the addition of ammonia chlorine or bromine can be quenched to halamines while hoi does not react with ammonia scheme s1 of the supplementary material therefore in the subsequent chloramination process hoi is the predominate hox species which can react with halogenated intermediates to form chlorinated or brominated i thms fig 1a however further increasing prechlorination time from 5 to 30 min converts most of initial i to io3 and i thm formation decreased not surprisingly with 24 h chlorination concentrations of i thms mainly dcim in the presence of nom isolates were 5 6 0 6 nm and their formation from aom or aom blended waters was not detected the dom type influenced the dbp formation concentrations of i thms formed from rw nom were slightly higher than those from tw nom in 2 5 min cl2 nh2cl processes since dom with high suva is more reactive toward chlorine producing more chlorinated i thms increasing the ratio of aom dom from 0 to 100 significantly increased the formation of i thms because aom serves as a stronger precursor for i thms on the contrary in 15 30 min cl2 nh2cl processes nom with higher suva formed more i thms than aom did iodate yields 90 indicated that the competition of iodine with chlorine bromine for dom was completed during prechlorination period and there is no enough available i in the subsequent chloramination the plot of io3 formation vs hox exposure indicated that increasing the blending ratio of aom decreased the formation rate of io3 fig s5 of the supplementary material 3 1 1 3 speciation in nh2cl process tim was the main species while cdim and bcim were present as minor species and other i thms were even not detected fig 1a on the contrary mixed i thms formed at comparable concentrations with tim in cl2 nh2cl process concentrations of tim decreased as the increasing prechlorination time from 2 to 30 min at 15 and 30 min prechlorination time tim was not detected and mixed i thms predominated 3 1 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals even in nh2cl process significant amounts of i thms formed the formation of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals is low due to the limited hocl exposure fig 1b and fig s3 of the supplementary material increasing the chlorine contact time in cl2 nh2cl process significantly increased the formation of noniodinated thm4 and hans subsequently their formation approached the maximum in cl2 process when compared with thm4 or hans concentrations of hals were low 7 nm because of the instability of brominated hals in water liu et al 2018 nom isolates produced less i thms than aom or blended waters but they formed significantly higher concentrations of thm4 fig 1b during prechlorination of cl2 nh2cl process or cl2 process hocl and hobr are predominant oxidants which are prone to react with dom with high aromaticity forming chlorinated or brominated thms therefore decreasing the dom aromaticity decreased the thm4 formation which agrees well with previous studies ersan et al 2019 liu and croue 2016 however there was no correlation between aromaticity of dom and formation of han and hal because they were formed through different pathways from thm 3 1 3 isf of 10 thms fig 2 shows the isfs from 10 thms measured under various processes from five types of dom at the same doc e g 1 mg l isf reflects the competition of hoi with hocl hobr for various types of dom to form halogenated dbps high isfs 0 8 were observed in nh2cl process because hoi was the predominant hox species increased chlorine contact time from 2 min to 24 h apparently increased the chlorine or bromine exposure and thus decreased isf increasing the blending ratio of aom toward the treated water significantly increased the isf this trend was much clearer in the short chlorine contact time in cl2 nh2cl process which can be related to the fact that aom is more favorable for iodine incorporation than nom aromatic fast reacting moieties and aliphatic carbonyl structures slow reacting moieties are main precursors for thms dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 our previous studies indicated that low molecular weight neutral and acids are the major fraction and humic substances aromatic moieties in aom only account for 20 of doc in comparison to nom with humic substances accounting for approximately 50 liu and croue 2016 liu et al 2018 therefore aliphatic carbonyl structures e g low molecular weight neutral and acids in the aom may be main precursors for i thms iodine outcompetes chlorine and bromine for slow reacting aliphatic carbonyl structures to form i thms this may indicate that iodine reacts much faster with these moieties than chlorine and bromine in addition halogen reacts with organics through oxidation and halogen substitution pathways liu and croue 2016 even though hocl or hobr has a higher redox potential than hoi fig s6 of the supplementary material iodine is a better halogen incorporation agent the electrophilic substitution for electron release to stabilize carbocation is probably more favorable for the iodine atom because it has higher electron density than chlorine or bromine atom and the bond energy of c i is smaller than c cl or c br 3 2 influence of dom concentration in addition to the type of dom i e reactivity the concentration of dom i e the doc of water may also affect the formation of dbps since aom is much more favorable for iodine incorporation than nom aom was selected as the target dom fig 3 presents the formation of i thms thm4 hans and hals iuf and isf under various dom concentrations 0 5 4 0 mgc l to mimic the realistic conditions in water treatment various initial chlorine concentrations were correspondingly adapted and an hox residual 0 2 0 4 mg l as cl2 after 24 h cl2 process can be maintained fig s7 of the supplementary material 3 2 1 i thms 3 2 1 1 formation in nh2cl process concentrations of i thms decreased with increasing aom concentration in nh2cl process ranging from 102 5 9 6 to 9 1 1 2 nm i e 38 6 3 7 to 3 2 0 4 Î¼g l fig 3a as a result the iuf decreased as increasing aom concentrations in nh2cl process hoi was the predominant hox species while hocl hobr formed from the hydrolysis of halamine was minor table s3 of the supplementary material increasing the concentration of aom provided more available reactive sites such as free amino acids serving as precursors for thms fang et al 2010 hong et al 2009 however once the reactive sites of aom were in excess of hoi hoi was quenched to form iodinated intermediates there is no enough hoi to complete the multi step halogenation process for the haloform formation therefore a further increase in the hox exposure may enhance the formation of i thms 3 2 1 2 formation in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 process it was clearly demonstrated in fig 3a that 2 min prechlorination in cl2 nh2cl process enhanced the formation of i thms as compared to nh2cl process especially at higher doc i ratios i e more reactive sites for hoi for example 2 min prechlorination increased the formation of i thms by 0 1 0 6 4 0 and 9 9 times for aom concentrations of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mg c l respectively concentrations of i thms increased as the increasing aom concentration but decreased after the maximum at aom concentration e g 1 0 or 2 0 mg c l at lower doc i ratios increasing the aom concentrations increased reactive sites and the formation of i thms was enhanced when reactive sites of aom were in excess of i i e higher doc i ratios concentrations of i thms decreased due to incomplete iodination increasing prechlorination time from 2 to 30 min reduced the formation of i thms due to enhanced io3 formation fig s8 of the supplementary material for example with 15 min prechlorination 90 of initial i was converted to io3 as shown on the plot of io3 formation vs hox exposure fig s9 of the supplementary material the io3 formation yield decreased as increasing aom concentration since this led to an increasing apparent reaction rate constant between aom and hoi due to the complete formation of io3 from i i thms were not detected 3 2 1 3 speciation since hoi was the predominant hox species in nh2cl process tim was the major species for i thms while bdim bcim and cdim were present as minor species at lower initial concentrations of aom 0 5 2 0 mg c l however at higher initial aom concentration 4 0 mg c l the formation of both tim and mixed i thms is low increasing aom concentration from 0 5 to 4 0 mg c l decreased the concentration of tim because reactive sites of aom were in excess of hoi in cl2 nh2cl process the formation of mixed especially brominated i thms tended to be important owning to the enhanced exposure of hocl hobr in cl2 nh2cl process for example with 15 30 min prechlorination the major i thm formed was dbim and the formation of tim was not detected 3 2 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals in nh2cl process chlorinated or brominated thm4 and hans were not detected and hal concentrations were 3 3 nm 0 5 Î¼g l fig 3b d however concentrations of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals increased as a function of chlorine contact time even though at short chlorine contact times their concentrations were much lower than i thms due to the limited hocl hobr exposure noniodinated thm4 hans and hals were the major species in cl2 process increasing the aom concentration also increased the formation of chlorinated brominated dbps because of increased available reactive sites increased formation of chlorinated species was also noted due to increased hocl br ratio 3 2 3 isf of 10 thms a decreased isf of thms was observed with an increasing chlorine contact time due to the increased chlorine or bromine exposure fig 3f in processes with lower chlorine exposure e g nh2cl process or 2 min cl2 nh2cl process the isf of thms decreased with increasing aom concentration because reactive sites of aom were in excess and hoi may be quenched to iodinated intermediates on the contrary at higher chlorine exposure e g 5 30 min cl2 nh2cl process increasing aom concentrations from 0 5 to 1 0 mgc l increased the isf while a further increase from 1 0 to 4 0 mgc l decreased the isf this is because increasing aom reactive sites favored the chlorination bromination 3 3 influence of initial br concentration fig 4 presents the formation of i thms thm4 hans and hals as well as the iuf and isf at various initial br concentrations an hox residual 0 2 0 5 mg l as cl2 after 24 h chlorination was maintained fig s10 of the supplementary material ensuring that oxidants were available for dbp formation and conversion of i to io3 fig s11 of the supplementary material 3 3 1 i thms 3 3 1 1 formation concentrations of i thms remained stable ranging from 79 8 to 85 8 nm in nh2cl process irrespective of initial br concentration fig 4a it was noted that the major product of br and nh2cl is bromochloramine and the concentration of free bromine is limited in nh2cl process table s3 of the supplementary material which is not enough to compete with hoi to form brominated i thms there was also no significant difference among the iufs at various initial br concentrations fig 4e a low chlorine exposure e g 2 min prechlorination before chloramination generally enhanced the formation of i thms at low initial br concentrations 0 and 0 5 Î¼m a slight enhancement was observed while at high initial br concentrations of 2 5 and 5 0 Î¼m the formation of i thms increased by 61 and 48 respectively also it was noted that increasing initial br concentration from 0 to 2 5 Î¼m increased the i thm formation but from 2 5 to 5 0 Î¼m of initial br concentration the formation of i thms decreased this indicates that br can either enhance or decrease the formation of i thms the reactivity of secondarily formed hobr toward dom brominated i thm formation and hoi io3 formation is 10 times higher than hocl table s3 of the supplementary material criquet et al 2012 westerhoff et al 2004 at lower chlorine exposure where io3 formation is the minor pathway scheme s1 of the supplementary material increasing the initial br concentration favored the formation of brominated intermediates during the prechlorination period thereby increasing the formation of brominated i thms 2 min prechlorination at initial br concentrations 2 5 Î¼m on the other hand at high hox exposure io3 was the major sink for iodine for example at 5 min prechlorination the io3 yields were 47 and 72 for br concentrations of 2 5 and 5 0 Î¼m respectively fig s11 of the supplementary material fig s12 of the supplementary material demonstrated that at the same hox exposure increasing the initial br concentration increased the io3 formation apparently br catalyzed the formation of io3 was the major role at the high chlorine exposure in which enough chlorine is available since second order rate constants for hoi reactions with hobr are at least three orders of magnitude greater than those with hocl table s3 of the supplementary material therefore increasing the initial br concentration decreased concentrations of available i for the following chloramination process thereby diminishing the formation of i thms and the iuf fig 4 due to the formation of io3 in cl2 process i thms 5 9 nm i e 1 3 Î¼g l were only detected for low initial br concentrations 0 and 0 5 Î¼m in which the formation rate of io3 was relatively low 3 3 1 2 speciation in nh2cl process tim was the main i thm species and cdim bdim and bcim were present at low levels due to the low concentration of hocl hobr formed from hydrolysis of halamine this is consistent with previous studies on the chloramination of surface waters or nom isolate allard et al 2015 criquet et al 2012 in cl2 nh2cl process the formation of chlorinated brominated i thms increased depending on the initial br concentration in the absence of br only tim and chlorinated i thms formed and tim was the major species increasing the initial br concentration decreased the formation of tim but increased the formation of brominated i thms fig 4a the formation of mixed i thms e g bdim increased to comparable levels with tim at high initial br concentration 3 3 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals in nh2cl process noniodinated thms hans and hals were formed at low levels due to the low hocl hobr exposure fig 4 increasing the chlorine contact time increased the formation of chlorinated brominated dbps increasing initial br concentration generally increased the formation of thms and hans but it decreased the concentrations of hals from aom because brominated hals were not stable koudjonou and lebel 2006 it was also noted that at short chlorine contact time e g 2 and 5 min in cl2 nh2cl process tbm and dban were measured for initial br concentrations of 2 5 and 5 0 Î¼m however in the absence of br their chlorinated analogues i e tcm and dcan were not detected this indicates that the formation of brominated thms and hans was much faster than their chlorinated species from aom 3 3 3 isf of 10 thms increasing chlorine contact time decreased the isfs fig 4f the formed free bromine from the reaction between br and oxidants can compete with iodine for the aom to form thms therefore increasing initial br concentration enhanced the exposure of free bromine thereby decreasing the isfs 3 4 influence of ph fig 5 shows concentrations of i thms and thm4 under various phs concentrations of residual hox after 24 h chlorination were in the range of 0 1 0 2 mg l as cl2 fig s13 of the supplementary material which were available for the formation of io3 and dbps figs s14 and 15 of the supplementary material respectively 3 4 1 i thms increasing the ph increased the formation of i thms in nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl processes fig 5a for example concentrations of i thms in nh2cl process were 28 5 1 9 85 8 8 3 and 130 9 4 9 nm corresponding to 10 1 0 7 32 1 3 1 and 50 1 1 9 Î¼g l for ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively increasing the ph increased the iuf fig s16a of the supplementary material tim was the main species while mixed i thms were present as minor species in nh2cl process short time 2 min chlorination in cl2 nh2cl process increased the formation of i thms at any phs compared with nh2cl process tim is the main species at short prechlorination times 2 5 min and it was the most influenced species in terms of ph the formation of i thm started decreasing when the chlorine contact time was extended from 5 to 30 min since the formation of io3 tended to be important concentrations of i thms in cl2 process were 8 1 nm i e 2 1 Î¼g l because io3 yields were 97 in 24 h chlorination fig s13 of the supplementary material it was reported that increasing the ph decreased the formation of i thms in chloramination of surface water with high suva 4 2 l mg m attributed to the formation of chlorine from hydrolysis of chloramine jones et al 2012 in contrast for treated water with more hydrophilic fractions suva 1 8 l mg m a slight increase in i thm formation was observed with increasing ph jones et al 2012 as mentioned above aliphatic carbonyl structures in aom may be the main precursors for i thms halogens have higher redox potentials at lower phs fig s6 of the supplementary material however the tim formation was initiated from the enolization of carbonyl functional groups since hoi does not react directly with the carbonyl moiety this is the rate limiting step and can be catalyzed by hydroxide bichsel and von gunten 2000 fuson and bull 1934 the triple iodination on the enol forms a tri iodomethyl group and the subsequent hydrolysis of tri iodocarbonyl yields tim which can be catalyzed by hydroxide ion fuson and bull 1934 it was also reported that tim formation occurs from 3 oxopentanedioic acid with increasing ph zhao et al 2017 therefore base catalyzed enolization and tri iodocarbonyl hydrolysis play important roles in determining ph effects on i thm formation from aom characterized by high hydrophilic fraction 3 4 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals concentrations of noniodinated thms hans and hals were low 5 nm in nh2cl process increasing the chlorine contact time increased the formation of these dbps not surprisingly ph significantly impacts the formation of dbps increasing the ph increased the formation of thm4 fig 5b owning to the base catalyzed enolization and trihalocarbonyl hydrolysis reactions in the short chlorine contact times 2 5 min in cl2 nh2cl process no clear trend was observed because the formation of hans and hals approached method detection limits fig s15 of the supplementary material however in longer chlorine contact times 15 30 min in cl2 nh2cl process or cl2 process concentrations of hans and hals declined as increasing ph from 7 5 to 9 0 because they were not stable under alkaline conditions liu et al 2018 3 4 3 isf of 10 thms increasing the ph increased the isf fig s16b of the supplementary material since tim was the major species which drastically increased as increasing ph the isf is higher at higher ph e g 9 0 probably due to the preferred formation of i thms at alkaline conditions 3 5 influence of cl2 n ratio fig 6 presents concentrations of i thms in the presence of aom under various cl2 n molar ratios 0 2 1 0 i e weight ratios of 1 0 5 0 covering the typical ranges used in water treatment concentrations of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals are presented in fig s17 of the supplementary material 3 5 1 i thms decreasing the cl2 n molar ratios from 1 0 to 0 2 decreased the formation of i thms fig 6 in nh2cl process concentrations of i thms were 135 2 7 5 103 0 1 9 and 85 8 8 3 nm i e 51 0 2 8 38 3 0 8 and 32 1 3 1 Î¼g l for cl2 n molar ratios of 1 0 0 7 and 0 2 respectively as a result the iuf decreased fig s18a of the supplementary material short time 2 min prechlorination significantly increased the formation of i thms at cl2 n molar ratios of 0 2 0 7 compared with nh2cl process in contrast there was only a slight increase when 2 min prechlorination was performed at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 decreasing the cl2 n ratio slightly decreased the formation of i thms and the iuf in cl2 nh2cl process the decreased formation of i thms at lower cl2 n molar ratios was attributed to the decreased trace level of free chlorine from the hydrolysis of chloramine table s3 of the supplementary material as mentioned above the formation of haloform is a multi step process trace level of chlorine may favor the formation of some intermediates enhancing the i thm formation tim was the main species while mixed i thms were minor species in nh2cl process concentration of tim drastically decreased with decreasing cl2 n ratios mixed i thms was formed at comparable levels with tim in 2 5 min cl2 nh2cl process however when chlorine contact time 15 min tim was the minor species and dbim was the main species because of limited i available after the addition of ammonia decreasing cl2 n molar ratios decreased the isf of thms fig s18b of the supplementary material 3 5 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals similarly the formation of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals was 3 3 nm 0 5 Î¼g l in nh2cl process even increasing the chlorine contact time increased the formation of these dbps in cl2 nh2cl process there was no significant difference for the formation of these dbps at varying cl2 n ratios fig s17 of the supplementary material 3 6 evaluation of the calculated cytotoxicity of measured dbps aom forms much higher concentrations of i thms than nom in nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl processes increasing chlorine exposure can be used to mitigate i thm formation in seasonal harmful algal bloom event but this could increase the formation of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals therefore to evaluate the benefit of mitigating i thm formation over the risk of noniodinated dbp formation under these treatment scenarios the theoretical cytotoxicity of measured dbps was calculated by weighing the concentrations of measured dbps against their toxicity index fig 7 3 6 1 influence of dom type i thm was the major dbp formed in nh2cl process which dominates the total calculated toxicity increasing the blending ratio of aom dom increased the calculated toxicity the calculated toxicity of chloraminated water with 2 min perchlorination in cl2 nh2cl process was higher than that of nh2cl process because of the formation of hans when chlorine contact time increases from 5 min to 24 h the theoretical cytotoxicity of measured dbps generally increased since han was major contributor for the total calculated toxicity even based on the weight concentration of i thms was sometimes one order of magnitude higher than noniodinated hans apparently the higher toxicity index of the latter one may offset its low concentration at short chlorine contact time wagner and plewa 2017 even thm contributes to the highest fraction of total dbps formed in cl2 process based on molar concentration the contribution of thm4 to the calculated toxicity is 10 because of its low cytotoxicity index wagner and plewa 2017 on the contrary concentrations of hals were low 10 nm their contribution to the calculated toxicity is even higher than thm4 due to its high toxicity index 3 6 2 influence of dom concentration in nh2cl process increasing the aom concentration decreased the calculated toxicity due to decreasing concentrations of i thms which are the primary forcing agents for calculated toxicity fig 7b in contrast in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes increasing the aom concentration increased the calculated toxicity due to the formation of chlorinated brominated noniodinated hans when chlorine contact time 5 min hans tend to be the major contributor to the calculated toxicity 3 6 3 influence of initial br concentration there was no significant difference for calculated toxicity among varying initial br concentrations in nh2cl process because concentrations of i thms as major dbps formed were comparable due to the low concentration of free bromine fig 7c however in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes increasing initial br concentrations increased the formation of brominated noniodinated hans and thus generally increased the calculated toxicity for example in short chlorine contact time 2 5 min i thms contribute to the major fraction of calculated toxicity at lower initial br concentrations 0 0 5 Î¼m on the contrary contributions from noniodinated hans to the calculated toxicity were in the comparable level with i thm or even higher at initial br concentrations of 2 5 5 0 Î¼m in cl2 process chlorinated brominated hans and hals are the forcing agents for calculated toxicity 3 6 4 influence of ph in nh2cl process increasing the ph increased the calculated toxicity since i thm controls the total calculated toxicity fig 7d in cl2 nh2cl with short chlorine contact time 2 5 min concentrations of hans were low therefore their contribution to the calculated toxicity was comparable with that of i thm this led to the increasing calculated toxicity with increasing ph nevertheless when chlorine contact time 15 min chlorinated brominated hans and hals seem to be the forcing agents for calculated toxicity due to their increased formation with increasing chlorine exposure increasing the ph from 7 5 to 9 0 decreased the concentrations of hans and hals due to their decomposition at ph 9 0 thereby decreasing the calculated toxicity 3 6 5 influence of cl2 n ratio decreasing the cl2 n ratio decreased the formation of i thms and thus decreased the calculated toxicity in nh2cl process where i thm controls the total calculated toxicity fig 7e in cl2 nh2cl with short chlorine contact time 2 5 min i thms were major contributor to the total calculated toxicity while the han induced calculated toxicity was comparable at varying cl2 n ratios therefore decreasing the cl2 n ratio decreased calculated toxicity however due to the insignificant contribution to the calculated toxicity of i thms when chlorine contact time 15 min noniodinated hans and hals were the forcing agents for calculated toxicity which remained stable with varying cl2 n ratios it should be noted that the theoretical cytotoxicity was calculated based on the measured dbps which however only account for partial total organic halogen liu et al 2018 it was known that i dbps as a group are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogues plewa et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 nevertheless only i thms were included among i dbps to evaluate the evolution of the calculated cytotoxicity for other groups of dbps iodinated species were not included due to the reduced biological data future research should be addressed to include all dbps especially i dbps for toxicity calculation and to experimentally evaluate the toxicity of dbp mixture for verification 4 conclusions iodine preferentially reacts with aom the concentration of i thms formed from aom was much higher than nom isolate from the treated water in chloramination even though nom isolate forms much higher thm4 than aom in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 process short time 2 min chlorination in cl2 nh2cl process enhanced the formation of total i thms mainly chlorinated brominated further increasing chlorine contact time from 5 min to 24 h decreased the i thm formation in nh2cl process i thms were the major dbps produced while in cl2 nh2cl process with long chlorine contact time 15 30 min and cl2 process noniodinated thm4 hals and hans were the main groups of dbps formed if dbp concentrations were weighed against their toxicity indexes i thms were the main contributors of calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity in nh2cl process however unregulated hans and hals were the controlling agents in cl2 nh2cl process cl2 15 min and cl2 process declaration of interests the

18637,the increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms in surface waters may increase the input of algal organic matter aom to the dissolved organic matter pool the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms and noniodinated disinfection byproducts dbps in synthetic waters containing aom extracted from microcystis aeruginosa was investigated in chloramination preformed and in situ formed chloramine nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl respectively and chlorination cl2 processes aom is much more favorable for iodine incorporation than natural organic matter nom for example the formation of i thm from aom is much higher than nom isolate extracted from treated water e g 3 5 times higher in the nh2cl process and thus higher iodine utilization and substitution factors from aom were observed short contact time 2 min chlorination in cl2 nh2cl process leading to the formation of halogenated intermediates favored i thm formation compared with nh2cl process however further increasing chlorine contact time from 5 min to 24 h facilitated the conversion from iodide to iodate and thus i thm formation decreased meanwhile the formation of noniodinated thm4 haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetaldehydes hals increased factors including concentrations of aom and bromide ph and chlorine nitrogen ratios influenced the formation of i thms and noniodinated dbps to evaluate the benefit of mitigating i thm formation over the risk of noniodinated dbp formation measured dbps were weighed against their mammalian cell toxicity indexes increasing the chlorine exposure increased the

from 0 5 to 20 Î¼g l liu et al 2014 moran et al 2002 however under certain circumstances such as seawater intrusion blending desalinated seawaters with fresh water source water receiving hydraulic fracturing brines elevated i concentrations up to 100 Î¼g l in the source waters were reported harkness et al 2015 richardson et al 2008 naturally occurring iodide can be quickly oxidized to iodine in the form of hypoiodous acid hoi in water by chlorine and chloramine kumar et al 1986 hoi can be further oxidized by hocl to iodate io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 which is competition with the hoi reactions with nom to form i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 fang et al 2018 hua et al 2006 jones et al 2012 jones et al 2011 liu et al 2017b smith et al 2010 ye et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 chloramine does not further oxidize hoi to the non toxic io3 bichsel and von gunten 2000 leading to the preferential formation of i dbps this was demonstrated by the i dbp occurrence data in finished drinking waters for example a nationwide dbp survey in the us indicated that the median concentration of six iodinated trihalomethanes i thms was 0 4 Î¼g l while a maximum of 19 Î¼g l was found in drinking water disinfected by chloramines chlorine and ammonia were added simultaneously krasner et al 2006 another survey over 23 water supplies in north america also recorded that i thms were highest at plants with short free chlorine contact times 1 min followed by ammonia addition while lowest at a chlorination only plant richardson et al 2008 the formation of i dbps in drinking water became a particular concern because in general they are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogues plewa et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 in addition the formation of i thms can cause taste and odor problems in drinking waters hansson et al 1987 aom was reported to serve as precursors of chlorinated dbps under formation potential conditions fang et al 2010 nguyen et al 2005 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 our previous study indicated that bromine in the form of hypobromous acid hobr in water forming from the reaction between hocl and bromide br which usually coexists with i is prone to react with aom to form brominated dbps bromine substitution factors of dbps thms haas haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetaldehydes hals from aom were higher than those from terrestrial nom liu et al 2018 due to the distinct nature of aom with nom the understanding of how iodine competes for the aom with chlorine and bromine to produce halogenated dbps in chloramination process remains unknown this will determine the formation and speciation of i dbps from chloramination of aom in view of highly toxicological significance of i dbps and increasing occurrence of harmful algal bloom in surface waters the objective of this study is to investigate the formation of i thms and noniodinated thms hans and hals from aom under two chloramination scenarios preformed and in situ produced chloramine defined as nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl process respectively chlorination treatment scenario defined as cl2 process was also studied for comparison the formation of io3 i thms and noniodinated dbps was examined under various water quality parameters such as the type and concentration of dom initial br concentration ph and cl2 n ratio finally the cytotoxicity was calculated based on the measured dbp concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemical solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals or stock solutions using deionized milli q water 18 2 mÏ cm millipore the descriptions of all standards and reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supplementary material two hydrophobic nom isolates were previously extracted from raw and treated water rw and tw respectively the raw water was collected from a water treatment plant in south carolina us before any treatment while treated water was collected after coagulation flocculation and sedimentation from the same plant but prior to any oxidant addition the procedure for the extraction of isolates can be found in a previous study kitis et al 2001 the specific uv absorbance suva values of rw and tw nom were 4 0 and 2 5 l m mg respectively detailed information is present in table s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 cyanobacteria culturing and preparation of dom solutions microcystis aeruginosa is among the most problematic cyanobacterium species in fresh water it was the main species responsible for severe harmful blooms of cyanobacteria in large lakes worldwide such as lake taihu in china yang et al 2008 lake nieuwe meer in the netherlands joehnk et al 2008 and lake erie in the us michalak et al 2013 therefore it was selected as the model cyanobacterium species in this study the cyanobacteria culturing and extraction of aom can be found in our previous study liu et al 2018 in addition treated water was blended with aom at different ratios to make the algae impacted waters 50 tw 50 aom and 25 tw 75 aom represent blending ratios of tw aom of 1 1 and 1 3 respectively procedures and dom characteristics are detailed in supplementary

information on analytical methods of total dissolved organic carbon doc total dissolved nitrogen concentrations of hypohalous acid hox the sum of hocl hobr and hoi anions cl br i etc io3 and dbps can be found in text s3 of supplementary material 2 4 experimental setup and procedures the role of dom type dom concentration initial br concentrations ph and chlorine nitrogen cl2 n ratio on the formation of io3 i thms and non iodinated dbps in the dark at room temperature 21 1 c in nh2cl cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes was investigated monochloramine nh2cl stock solution was prepared by adding chlorine stock solution to ammonium chloride nh4cl stock solution dropwise under vigorous stirring at ph 8 8 with molar cl2 n ratios of 0 2 1 0 reactions were initiated by the injection of an aliquot of hocl preformed nh2cl for nh2cl process stock solution to 1 l of dom solution from 0 5 to 4 0 mg c l containing i 0 5 Î¼m i e 63 5 Î¼g l and br 0 5 0 Î¼m i e 0 400 Î¼g l under vigorous stirring for 30 s afterwards reaction solutions were rapidly transferred to 125 ml amber bottles for cl2 nh2cl process after various prechlorination times 2 5 15 and 30 min reaction solutions were quenched by nh4cl under vigorous stirring molar cl2 n ratios of 0 2 1 0 to allow 24 h chloramination this strategy was used to mimic the chloramination disinfection using in situ produced chloramine at water treatment plants after the addition of nh4cl the stirring stopped and bottles were filled with several milliliters of reaction solutions so that no headspace remained and sealed with teflon lined caps for cl2 process no nh4cl was added preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the chlorine demand at each reaction interval and a measurable residual oxidant for 24 h chlorination after 24 h reaction approximately 15 ml of samples were withdrawn and quenched with sodium sulfite for io3 measurement while for dbp analysis samples were quenched immediately with ascorbic acid molar ratio 1 0 the ph was adjusted to 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 with hno3 or naoh solutions in the presence of a 10 0 mm tetraborate or phosphate buffer each experiment was performed in duplicate 2 5 calculations of iodine substitution factor isf iodine utilization factor iuf and cytotoxicity isf is defined as the ratio of the molar concentration of iodine incorporated into a given class of dbps to the total molar concentrations of chlorine bromine and iodine atoms in that class iuf is defined as the ratio of the molar concentration of iodine incorporated into the quantified dbps to the initial i concentrations the calculated cytotoxicity assessment was performed by dividing measured concentrations of each group of dbps by their toxic concentrations lc50 values using quantitative mammalian cell cytotoxicity analyses and assuming that toxicity is additive plewa and wagner 2009 wagner and plewa 2017 yeatts et al 2010 this approach was used to assess toxicity of measured dbps and evaluate the contribution of individual dbps to the total dbp associated toxicity krasner et al 2016 liu et al 2018 plewa et al 2017 smith et al 2010 the detailed information can be found in text s4 5 and table s2 of the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of dom type fig s1 of the supplementary material presents the effect of dom type on hox concentrations at different reaction times which decayed from 2 min to 24 h after 24 h residual hox concentrations ranged from 0 2 to 0 9 mg l as cl2 indicating that there was enough oxidant to allow the formation of dbps fig 1 illustrates concentrations of i thms and thm4 in the presence of various types of dom the formation of io3 and concentrations of hans and hals are presented in figs s2 and s3 of the supplementary material respectively 3 1 1 i thms 3 1 1 1 formation in nh2cl process concentrations of i thms in the presence of rw and tw nom in nh2cl process were 19 7 1 1 representing mean standard deviations in this paper and 23 7 0 7 nm corresponding to 7 3 0 3 and 8 5 0 2 Î¼g l respectively this indicated that tw with a lower reactivity produced higher concentrations of i thms as compared to the higher suva nom isolate under chloramination conditions which is in agreement with the literature allard et al 2015 jones et al 2012 increasing the blending ratio of aom to treated water increased the formation of i thms concentrations of i thms were 23 7 0 7 46 9 1 7 50 9 8 6 and 83 8 8 4 nm corresponding to 8 5 0 2 17 6 0 6 19 2 3 3 and 32 1 3 3 Î¼g l for blending ratios of 0 50 75 and 100 respectively the concentration of i thms formed from aom was 3 5 times higher than nom isolate extracted from treated water indicating that aom can serve as a stronger i thm precursor than nom in nh2cl process the iufs from rw and tw nom were 0 11 and 0 12 respectively which were lower than that of aom i e 0 48 fig s4 of the supplementary material 3 1 1 2 formation in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes interestingly a short free chlorine exposure 2 min followed by ammonia addition enhanced the formation of i thms compared with chloramination using preformed nh2cl concentrations of i thms in 2 min cl2 nh2cl process from rw tw 50 tw 50 aom 25 tw 75 aom and aom were 16 2 1 5 16 4 0 3 37 2 2 7 43 5 2 8 46 7 1 9 nm which were 2 2 1 9 2 1 2 3 and 1 5 times respectively as high as those generated in nh2cl process fig 1a the higher iufs in 2 min chlorination followed by ammonia addition was also observed fig s4 of the supplementary material meanwhile the hoi can be oxidized by hocl or hobr to io3 and io3 concentrations in 2 min prechlorination were in the range of 0 11 0 31 Î¼m fig s2 of the supplementary material the formation of thms is a multi step process through several halogenation reactions fuson and bull 1934 short chlorination time 2 min in the presence of br can lead to the formation of chlorinated or brominated intermediates pan and zhang 2013 after the addition of ammonia chlorine or bromine can be quenched to halamines while hoi does not react with ammonia scheme s1 of the supplementary material therefore in the subsequent chloramination process hoi is the predominate hox species which can react with halogenated intermediates to form chlorinated or brominated i thms fig 1a however further increasing prechlorination time from 5 to 30 min converts most of initial i to io3 and i thm formation decreased not surprisingly with 24 h chlorination concentrations of i thms mainly dcim in the presence of nom isolates were 5 6 0 6 nm and their formation from aom or aom blended waters was not detected the dom type influenced the dbp formation concentrations of i thms formed from rw nom were slightly higher than those from tw nom in 2 5 min cl2 nh2cl processes since dom with high suva is more reactive toward chlorine producing more chlorinated i thms increasing the ratio of aom dom from 0 to 100 significantly increased the formation of i thms because aom serves as a stronger precursor for i thms on the contrary in 15 30 min cl2 nh2cl processes nom with higher suva formed more i thms than aom did iodate yields 90 indicated that the competition of iodine with chlorine bromine for dom was completed during prechlorination period and there is no enough available i in the subsequent chloramination the plot of io3 formation vs hox exposure indicated that increasing the blending ratio of aom decreased the formation rate of io3 fig s5 of the supplementary material 3 1 1 3 speciation in nh2cl process tim was the main species while cdim and bcim were present as minor species and other i thms were even not detected fig 1a on the contrary mixed i thms formed at comparable concentrations with tim in cl2 nh2cl process concentrations of tim decreased as the increasing prechlorination time from 2 to 30 min at 15 and 30 min prechlorination time tim was not detected and mixed i thms predominated 3 1 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals even in nh2cl process significant amounts of i thms formed the formation of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals is low due to the limited hocl exposure fig 1b and fig s3 of the supplementary material increasing the chlorine contact time in cl2 nh2cl process significantly increased the formation of noniodinated thm4 and hans subsequently their formation approached the maximum in cl2 process when compared with thm4 or hans concentrations of hals were low 7 nm because of the instability of brominated hals in water liu et al 2018 nom isolates produced less i thms than aom or blended waters but they formed significantly higher concentrations of thm4 fig 1b during prechlorination of cl2 nh2cl process or cl2 process hocl and hobr are predominant oxidants which are prone to react with dom with high aromaticity forming chlorinated or brominated thms therefore decreasing the dom aromaticity decreased the thm4 formation which agrees well with previous studies ersan et al 2019 liu and croue 2016 however there was no correlation between aromaticity of dom and formation of han and hal because they were formed through different pathways from thm 3 1 3 isf of 10 thms fig 2 shows the isfs from 10 thms measured under various processes from five types of dom at the same doc e g 1 mg l isf reflects the competition of hoi with hocl hobr for various types of dom to form halogenated dbps high isfs 0 8 were observed in nh2cl process because hoi was the predominant hox species increased chlorine contact time from 2 min to 24 h apparently increased the chlorine or bromine exposure and thus decreased isf increasing the blending ratio of aom toward the treated water significantly increased the isf this trend was much clearer in the short chlorine contact time in cl2 nh2cl process which can be related to the fact that aom is more favorable for iodine incorporation than nom aromatic fast reacting moieties and aliphatic carbonyl structures slow reacting moieties are main precursors for thms dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 our previous studies indicated that low molecular weight neutral and acids are the major fraction and humic substances aromatic moieties in aom only account for 20 of doc in comparison to nom with humic substances accounting for approximately 50 liu and croue 2016 liu et al 2018 therefore aliphatic carbonyl structures e g low molecular weight neutral and acids in the aom may be main precursors for i thms iodine outcompetes chlorine and bromine for slow reacting aliphatic carbonyl structures to form i thms this may indicate that iodine reacts much faster with these moieties than chlorine and bromine in addition halogen reacts with organics through oxidation and halogen substitution pathways liu and croue 2016 even though hocl or hobr has a higher redox potential than hoi fig s6 of the supplementary material iodine is a better halogen incorporation agent the electrophilic substitution for electron release to stabilize carbocation is probably more favorable for the iodine atom because it has higher electron density than chlorine or bromine atom and the bond energy of c i is smaller than c cl or c br 3 2 influence of dom concentration in addition to the type of dom i e reactivity the concentration of dom i e the doc of water may also affect the formation of dbps since aom is much more favorable for iodine incorporation than nom aom was selected as the target dom fig 3 presents the formation of i thms thm4 hans and hals iuf and isf under various dom concentrations 0 5 4 0 mgc l to mimic the realistic conditions in water treatment various initial chlorine concentrations were correspondingly adapted and an hox residual 0 2 0 4 mg l as cl2 after 24 h cl2 process can be maintained fig s7 of the supplementary material 3 2 1 i thms 3 2 1 1 formation in nh2cl process concentrations of i thms decreased with increasing aom concentration in nh2cl process ranging from 102 5 9 6 to 9 1 1 2 nm i e 38 6 3 7 to 3 2 0 4 Î¼g l fig 3a as a result the iuf decreased as increasing aom concentrations in nh2cl process hoi was the predominant hox species while hocl hobr formed from the hydrolysis of halamine was minor table s3 of the supplementary material increasing the concentration of aom provided more available reactive sites such as free amino acids serving as precursors for thms fang et al 2010 hong et al 2009 however once the reactive sites of aom were in excess of hoi hoi was quenched to form iodinated intermediates there is no enough hoi to complete the multi step halogenation process for the haloform formation therefore a further increase in the hox exposure may enhance the formation of i thms 3 2 1 2 formation in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 process it was clearly demonstrated in fig 3a that 2 min prechlorination in cl2 nh2cl process enhanced the formation of i thms as compared to nh2cl process especially at higher doc i ratios i e more reactive sites for hoi for example 2 min prechlorination increased the formation of i thms by 0 1 0 6 4 0 and 9 9 times for aom concentrations of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mg c l respectively concentrations of i thms increased as the increasing aom concentration but decreased after the maximum at aom concentration e g 1 0 or 2 0 mg c l at lower doc i ratios increasing the aom concentrations increased reactive sites and the formation of i thms was enhanced when reactive sites of aom were in excess of i i e higher doc i ratios concentrations of i thms decreased due to incomplete iodination increasing prechlorination time from 2 to 30 min reduced the formation of i thms due to enhanced io3 formation fig s8 of the supplementary material for example with 15 min prechlorination 90 of initial i was converted to io3 as shown on the plot of io3 formation vs hox exposure fig s9 of the supplementary material the io3 formation yield decreased as increasing aom concentration since this led to an increasing apparent reaction rate constant between aom and hoi due to the complete formation of io3 from i i thms were not detected 3 2 1 3 speciation since hoi was the predominant hox species in nh2cl process tim was the major species for i thms while bdim bcim and cdim were present as minor species at lower initial concentrations of aom 0 5 2 0 mg c l however at higher initial aom concentration 4 0 mg c l the formation of both tim and mixed i thms is low increasing aom concentration from 0 5 to 4 0 mg c l decreased the concentration of tim because reactive sites of aom were in excess of hoi in cl2 nh2cl process the formation of mixed especially brominated i thms tended to be important owning to the enhanced exposure of hocl hobr in cl2 nh2cl process for example with 15 30 min prechlorination the major i thm formed was dbim and the formation of tim was not detected 3 2 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals in nh2cl process chlorinated or brominated thm4 and hans were not detected and hal concentrations were 3 3 nm 0 5 Î¼g l fig 3b d however concentrations of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals increased as a function of chlorine contact time even though at short chlorine contact times their concentrations were much lower than i thms due to the limited hocl hobr exposure noniodinated thm4 hans and hals were the major species in cl2 process increasing the aom concentration also increased the formation of chlorinated brominated dbps because of increased available reactive sites increased formation of chlorinated species was also noted due to increased hocl br ratio 3 2 3 isf of 10 thms a decreased isf of thms was observed with an increasing chlorine contact time due to the increased chlorine or bromine exposure fig 3f in processes with lower chlorine exposure e g nh2cl process or 2 min cl2 nh2cl process the isf of thms decreased with increasing aom concentration because reactive sites of aom were in excess and hoi may be quenched to iodinated intermediates on the contrary at higher chlorine exposure e g 5 30 min cl2 nh2cl process increasing aom concentrations from 0 5 to 1 0 mgc l increased the isf while a further increase from 1 0 to 4 0 mgc l decreased the isf this is because increasing aom reactive sites favored the chlorination bromination 3 3 influence of initial br concentration fig 4 presents the formation of i thms thm4 hans and hals as well as the iuf and isf at various initial br concentrations an hox residual 0 2 0 5 mg l as cl2 after 24 h chlorination was maintained fig s10 of the supplementary material ensuring that oxidants were available for dbp formation and conversion of i to io3 fig s11 of the supplementary material 3 3 1 i thms 3 3 1 1 formation concentrations of i thms remained stable ranging from 79 8 to 85 8 nm in nh2cl process irrespective of initial br concentration fig 4a it was noted that the major product of br and nh2cl is bromochloramine and the concentration of free bromine is limited in nh2cl process table s3 of the supplementary material which is not enough to compete with hoi to form brominated i thms there was also no significant difference among the iufs at various initial br concentrations fig 4e a low chlorine exposure e g 2 min prechlorination before chloramination generally enhanced the formation of i thms at low initial br concentrations 0 and 0 5 Î¼m a slight enhancement was observed while at high initial br concentrations of 2 5 and 5 0 Î¼m the formation of i thms increased by 61 and 48 respectively also it was noted that increasing initial br concentration from 0 to 2 5 Î¼m increased the i thm formation but from 2 5 to 5 0 Î¼m of initial br concentration the formation of i thms decreased this indicates that br can either enhance or decrease the formation of i thms the reactivity of secondarily formed hobr toward dom brominated i thm formation and hoi io3 formation is 10 times higher than hocl table s3 of the supplementary material criquet et al 2012 westerhoff et al 2004 at lower chlorine exposure where io3 formation is the minor pathway scheme s1 of the supplementary material increasing the initial br concentration favored the formation of brominated intermediates during the prechlorination period thereby increasing the formation of brominated i thms 2 min prechlorination at initial br concentrations 2 5 Î¼m on the other hand at high hox exposure io3 was the major sink for iodine for example at 5 min prechlorination the io3 yields were 47 and 72 for br concentrations of 2 5 and 5 0 Î¼m respectively fig s11 of the supplementary material fig s12 of the supplementary material demonstrated that at the same hox exposure increasing the initial br concentration increased the io3 formation apparently br catalyzed the formation of io3 was the major role at the high chlorine exposure in which enough chlorine is available since second order rate constants for hoi reactions with hobr are at least three orders of magnitude greater than those with hocl table s3 of the supplementary material therefore increasing the initial br concentration decreased concentrations of available i for the following chloramination process thereby diminishing the formation of i thms and the iuf fig 4 due to the formation of io3 in cl2 process i thms 5 9 nm i e 1 3 Î¼g l were only detected for low initial br concentrations 0 and 0 5 Î¼m in which the formation rate of io3 was relatively low 3 3 1 2 speciation in nh2cl process tim was the main i thm species and cdim bdim and bcim were present at low levels due to the low concentration of hocl hobr formed from hydrolysis of halamine this is consistent with previous studies on the chloramination of surface waters or nom isolate allard et al 2015 criquet et al 2012 in cl2 nh2cl process the formation of chlorinated brominated i thms increased depending on the initial br concentration in the absence of br only tim and chlorinated i thms formed and tim was the major species increasing the initial br concentration decreased the formation of tim but increased the formation of brominated i thms fig 4a the formation of mixed i thms e g bdim increased to comparable levels with tim at high initial br concentration 3 3 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals in nh2cl process noniodinated thms hans and hals were formed at low levels due to the low hocl hobr exposure fig 4 increasing the chlorine contact time increased the formation of chlorinated brominated dbps increasing initial br concentration generally increased the formation of thms and hans but it decreased the concentrations of hals from aom because brominated hals were not stable koudjonou and lebel 2006 it was also noted that at short chlorine contact time e g 2 and 5 min in cl2 nh2cl process tbm and dban were measured for initial br concentrations of 2 5 and 5 0 Î¼m however in the absence of br their chlorinated analogues i e tcm and dcan were not detected this indicates that the formation of brominated thms and hans was much faster than their chlorinated species from aom 3 3 3 isf of 10 thms increasing chlorine contact time decreased the isfs fig 4f the formed free bromine from the reaction between br and oxidants can compete with iodine for the aom to form thms therefore increasing initial br concentration enhanced the exposure of free bromine thereby decreasing the isfs 3 4 influence of ph fig 5 shows concentrations of i thms and thm4 under various phs concentrations of residual hox after 24 h chlorination were in the range of 0 1 0 2 mg l as cl2 fig s13 of the supplementary material which were available for the formation of io3 and dbps figs s14 and 15 of the supplementary material respectively 3 4 1 i thms increasing the ph increased the formation of i thms in nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl processes fig 5a for example concentrations of i thms in nh2cl process were 28 5 1 9 85 8 8 3 and 130 9 4 9 nm corresponding to 10 1 0 7 32 1 3 1 and 50 1 1 9 Î¼g l for ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively increasing the ph increased the iuf fig s16a of the supplementary material tim was the main species while mixed i thms were present as minor species in nh2cl process short time 2 min chlorination in cl2 nh2cl process increased the formation of i thms at any phs compared with nh2cl process tim is the main species at short prechlorination times 2 5 min and it was the most influenced species in terms of ph the formation of i thm started decreasing when the chlorine contact time was extended from 5 to 30 min since the formation of io3 tended to be important concentrations of i thms in cl2 process were 8 1 nm i e 2 1 Î¼g l because io3 yields were 97 in 24 h chlorination fig s13 of the supplementary material it was reported that increasing the ph decreased the formation of i thms in chloramination of surface water with high suva 4 2 l mg m attributed to the formation of chlorine from hydrolysis of chloramine jones et al 2012 in contrast for treated water with more hydrophilic fractions suva 1 8 l mg m a slight increase in i thm formation was observed with increasing ph jones et al 2012 as mentioned above aliphatic carbonyl structures in aom may be the main precursors for i thms halogens have higher redox potentials at lower phs fig s6 of the supplementary material however the tim formation was initiated from the enolization of carbonyl functional groups since hoi does not react directly with the carbonyl moiety this is the rate limiting step and can be catalyzed by hydroxide bichsel and von gunten 2000 fuson and bull 1934 the triple iodination on the enol forms a tri iodomethyl group and the subsequent hydrolysis of tri iodocarbonyl yields tim which can be catalyzed by hydroxide ion fuson and bull 1934 it was also reported that tim formation occurs from 3 oxopentanedioic acid with increasing ph zhao et al 2017 therefore base catalyzed enolization and tri iodocarbonyl hydrolysis play important roles in determining ph effects on i thm formation from aom characterized by high hydrophilic fraction 3 4 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals concentrations of noniodinated thms hans and hals were low 5 nm in nh2cl process increasing the chlorine contact time increased the formation of these dbps not surprisingly ph significantly impacts the formation of dbps increasing the ph increased the formation of thm4 fig 5b owning to the base catalyzed enolization and trihalocarbonyl hydrolysis reactions in the short chlorine contact times 2 5 min in cl2 nh2cl process no clear trend was observed because the formation of hans and hals approached method detection limits fig s15 of the supplementary material however in longer chlorine contact times 15 30 min in cl2 nh2cl process or cl2 process concentrations of hans and hals declined as increasing ph from 7 5 to 9 0 because they were not stable under alkaline conditions liu et al 2018 3 4 3 isf of 10 thms increasing the ph increased the isf fig s16b of the supplementary material since tim was the major species which drastically increased as increasing ph the isf is higher at higher ph e g 9 0 probably due to the preferred formation of i thms at alkaline conditions 3 5 influence of cl2 n ratio fig 6 presents concentrations of i thms in the presence of aom under various cl2 n molar ratios 0 2 1 0 i e weight ratios of 1 0 5 0 covering the typical ranges used in water treatment concentrations of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals are presented in fig s17 of the supplementary material 3 5 1 i thms decreasing the cl2 n molar ratios from 1 0 to 0 2 decreased the formation of i thms fig 6 in nh2cl process concentrations of i thms were 135 2 7 5 103 0 1 9 and 85 8 8 3 nm i e 51 0 2 8 38 3 0 8 and 32 1 3 1 Î¼g l for cl2 n molar ratios of 1 0 0 7 and 0 2 respectively as a result the iuf decreased fig s18a of the supplementary material short time 2 min prechlorination significantly increased the formation of i thms at cl2 n molar ratios of 0 2 0 7 compared with nh2cl process in contrast there was only a slight increase when 2 min prechlorination was performed at cl2 n molar ratio of 1 0 decreasing the cl2 n ratio slightly decreased the formation of i thms and the iuf in cl2 nh2cl process the decreased formation of i thms at lower cl2 n molar ratios was attributed to the decreased trace level of free chlorine from the hydrolysis of chloramine table s3 of the supplementary material as mentioned above the formation of haloform is a multi step process trace level of chlorine may favor the formation of some intermediates enhancing the i thm formation tim was the main species while mixed i thms were minor species in nh2cl process concentration of tim drastically decreased with decreasing cl2 n ratios mixed i thms was formed at comparable levels with tim in 2 5 min cl2 nh2cl process however when chlorine contact time 15 min tim was the minor species and dbim was the main species because of limited i available after the addition of ammonia decreasing cl2 n molar ratios decreased the isf of thms fig s18b of the supplementary material 3 5 2 noniodinated thm4 hans and hals similarly the formation of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals was 3 3 nm 0 5 Î¼g l in nh2cl process even increasing the chlorine contact time increased the formation of these dbps in cl2 nh2cl process there was no significant difference for the formation of these dbps at varying cl2 n ratios fig s17 of the supplementary material 3 6 evaluation of the calculated cytotoxicity of measured dbps aom forms much higher concentrations of i thms than nom in nh2cl and cl2 nh2cl processes increasing chlorine exposure can be used to mitigate i thm formation in seasonal harmful algal bloom event but this could increase the formation of noniodinated thm4 hans and hals therefore to evaluate the benefit of mitigating i thm formation over the risk of noniodinated dbp formation under these treatment scenarios the theoretical cytotoxicity of measured dbps was calculated by weighing the concentrations of measured dbps against their toxicity index fig 7 3 6 1 influence of dom type i thm was the major dbp formed in nh2cl process which dominates the total calculated toxicity increasing the blending ratio of aom dom increased the calculated toxicity the calculated toxicity of chloraminated water with 2 min perchlorination in cl2 nh2cl process was higher than that of nh2cl process because of the formation of hans when chlorine contact time increases from 5 min to 24 h the theoretical cytotoxicity of measured dbps generally increased since han was major contributor for the total calculated toxicity even based on the weight concentration of i thms was sometimes one order of magnitude higher than noniodinated hans apparently the higher toxicity index of the latter one may offset its low concentration at short chlorine contact time wagner and plewa 2017 even thm contributes to the highest fraction of total dbps formed in cl2 process based on molar concentration the contribution of thm4 to the calculated toxicity is 10 because of its low cytotoxicity index wagner and plewa 2017 on the contrary concentrations of hals were low 10 nm their contribution to the calculated toxicity is even higher than thm4 due to its high toxicity index 3 6 2 influence of dom concentration in nh2cl process increasing the aom concentration decreased the calculated toxicity due to decreasing concentrations of i thms which are the primary forcing agents for calculated toxicity fig 7b in contrast in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes increasing the aom concentration increased the calculated toxicity due to the formation of chlorinated brominated noniodinated hans when chlorine contact time 5 min hans tend to be the major contributor to the calculated toxicity 3 6 3 influence of initial br concentration there was no significant difference for calculated toxicity among varying initial br concentrations in nh2cl process because concentrations of i thms as major dbps formed were comparable due to the low concentration of free bromine fig 7c however in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 processes increasing initial br concentrations increased the formation of brominated noniodinated hans and thus generally increased the calculated toxicity for example in short chlorine contact time 2 5 min i thms contribute to the major fraction of calculated toxicity at lower initial br concentrations 0 0 5 Î¼m on the contrary contributions from noniodinated hans to the calculated toxicity were in the comparable level with i thm or even higher at initial br concentrations of 2 5 5 0 Î¼m in cl2 process chlorinated brominated hans and hals are the forcing agents for calculated toxicity 3 6 4 influence of ph in nh2cl process increasing the ph increased the calculated toxicity since i thm controls the total calculated toxicity fig 7d in cl2 nh2cl with short chlorine contact time 2 5 min concentrations of hans were low therefore their contribution to the calculated toxicity was comparable with that of i thm this led to the increasing calculated toxicity with increasing ph nevertheless when chlorine contact time 15 min chlorinated brominated hans and hals seem to be the forcing agents for calculated toxicity due to their increased formation with increasing chlorine exposure increasing the ph from 7 5 to 9 0 decreased the concentrations of hans and hals due to their decomposition at ph 9 0 thereby decreasing the calculated toxicity 3 6 5 influence of cl2 n ratio decreasing the cl2 n ratio decreased the formation of i thms and thus decreased the calculated toxicity in nh2cl process where i thm controls the total calculated toxicity fig 7e in cl2 nh2cl with short chlorine contact time 2 5 min i thms were major contributor to the total calculated toxicity while the han induced calculated toxicity was comparable at varying cl2 n ratios therefore decreasing the cl2 n ratio decreased calculated toxicity however due to the insignificant contribution to the calculated toxicity of i thms when chlorine contact time 15 min noniodinated hans and hals were the forcing agents for calculated toxicity which remained stable with varying cl2 n ratios it should be noted that the theoretical cytotoxicity was calculated based on the measured dbps which however only account for partial total organic halogen liu et al 2018 it was known that i dbps as a group are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogues plewa et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 nevertheless only i thms were included among i dbps to evaluate the evolution of the calculated cytotoxicity for other groups of dbps iodinated species were not included due to the reduced biological data future research should be addressed to include all dbps especially i dbps for toxicity calculation and to experimentally evaluate the toxicity of dbp mixture for verification 4 conclusions iodine preferentially reacts with aom the concentration of i thms formed from aom was much higher than nom isolate from the treated water in chloramination even though nom isolate forms much higher thm4 than aom in cl2 nh2cl and cl2 process short time 2 min chlorination in cl2 nh2cl process enhanced the formation of total i thms mainly chlorinated brominated further increasing chlorine contact time from 5 min to 24 h decreased the i thm formation in nh2cl process i thms were the major dbps produced while in cl2 nh2cl process with long chlorine contact time 15 30 min and cl2 process noniodinated thm4 hals and hans were the main groups of dbps formed if dbp concentrations were weighed against their toxicity indexes i thms were the main contributors of calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity in nh2cl process however unregulated hans and hals were the controlling agents in cl2 nh2cl process cl2 15 min and cl2 process declaration of interests the

18638,with the rapid construction of dams worldwide reservoir system has become a representation of modern aquatic environment however the profiles of antibiotic resistance genes args and associated factor influencing their dynamics in modern aquatic environment e g water phase sediment phase and soil phase are largely unknown here we comprehensively characterized the diversity abundance distribution of args in a large drinking water reservoir using high throughput quantitative pcr as well as ranked the factors e g mobile genetic elements mges bacteria community bacterial biomass antibiotics and basic properties influencing the profiles of args on the basis of structural equation models sems water phase was prone to harbor more diverse args as compared to sediment phase and soil phase and soil phase in drawdown area was a potential reservoir and hotspot for args environmental media partially affected the arg diversity in modern aquatic environment while it observably influenced the distributions of args and mges and their co occurrence patterns the pathways for the proliferation and spread of args in water phase were both the horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt while the dominant pathways in sediment phase and soil phase were the hgt and vgt respectively the sems demonstrated that mges contributed the most to drive the arg dynamics in both water phase and sediment phase while the most dominant factor for this in soil phase was bacterial community overall environmental media exerted a bottleneck in driving the dynamics of args in modern aquatic environment probably via diversifying the mges bacterial community bacterial biomass antibiotics and basic properties graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes high throughput qpcr modern aquatic environment structural equation model mobile genetic elements bacterial community 1 introduction microbial mass movements around the world lead to a cruel fact that antibiotic resistance does not respect regional or national boundaries thus antibiotic resistance is recognized as a globally major health challenge of the 21st century li et al 2015 zhu et al 2017a although antibiotic resistance itself is an ancient phenomenon naturally occurring widespread in the environment d costa et al 2011 human activities could aggravate this notorious phenomenon by accelerating the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args chen et al 2013b vikesland et al 2017 since args were considered as emerging pollutants in 2006 pruden et al 2006 abundant args have been frequently found in various environments e g freshwater sediment air and soil han et al 2018 hu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 currently plentiful args their bacterial hosts and probably coupled with antibiotic residues from households hospitals and livestock farms are ultimately released into aquatic environments via various waste streams vikesland et al 2017 consequently aquatic environment are increasingly recognized as ideal settings for the acquisition and dissemination of args and merit more attention marti et al 2014 taylor et al 2011 as one of the most precious resources to life on earth aquatic environment provides irreplaceable functions in the global biogeochemical process and socio economic maintenance noteworthily there was an accelerating trend in the construction of dams reservoirs over the last decades and approximately 50 000 large dams have been built in the management and control of water resources worldwide lehner et al 2011 it is well known that these dams could alter hydrological characteristics and disrupt ecological connectivity for natural aquatic environment tang et al 2016 for instance this would prolong the hydraulic retention time promote the deposition of particulate deposits and potentially form the drawdown area in reservoir system chen et al 2017b su et al 2019 it is noteworthy that drawdown area actually serves as a transitional zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and plays an important role in maintaining geochemical process and biological diversity bao et al 2015b su et al 2019 generally the dams represent the most significant disturbance by anthropic activities to global watershed herein reservoir system could be regarded as the most typical modern water environment lehner et al 2011 tang et al 2016 it is widely accepted that reservoir system should consists of waters sediments and drawdown area bao et al 2015a jia and liu 2017 nonetheless previous researches mainly focused on the nutrient cycles heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in some reservoirs mwanamoki et al 2014 su et al 2019 yan et al 2018 on the other hand some limited conclusions associated with args were obtained from individual water phase or sediment phase of reservoirs but their quantitative methods for the args were based on conventional quantitative pcr which only covered limited arg targets yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 as a result the occurrence and distribution of args in reservoir system remained poorly characterized especially in reservoirs supplying drinking water source furthermore when faced with the current ubiquitous resistance problem it is very necessary to uncover the mechanism of arg dynamics and evaluate the dominant factors influencing their dynamics previous reports suggested that antibiotic resistance among different microorganisms can be acquired by horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt and the hgt via mobile genetic elements mges may be the dominant factor in the proliferation and spread of args blair et al 2015 dantas and sommer 2014 zheng et al 2018 agreed with this proposal that mges were identified as the key factor driving the arg alterations in a peri urban river wu et al 2017 also found that arg dynamics were more associated with mges in leachates nevertheless recent studies suggested that bacterial community contributed the most to args profiles in the sludge and soil phase zhang et al 2016b 2018 zhao et al 2017 demonstrated that the profile and dissemination of args were dominantly driven by nutrients including total nitrogen and total organic carbon contents in mariculture sediments based on the summary of previous literature it can be found that the dominant factors influencing the arg profiles in different environments are discrepant to some extent that is to say the current volume of studies on the determination of crucial factors influencing the args profiles is far from adequate taken together more comprehensive investigations about the dominant factors influencing arg profiles and corresponding mechanisms of their dynamics in reservoir system will be of great significance for a better understanding of the args in modern aquatic environment to achieve this goal an ideal reservoir system south china was chosen to reveal broader profiles of args in modern aquatic environment high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr with validated primer sets targeting multiple types of args and mges was used to obtain a comprehensive detection for args chen et al 2019 moreover bacterial community compositions and antibiotic concentrations were determined by illumina sequencing and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry respectively in view of these this study aims to 1 comprehensively investigate the effects of environmental media on the diversity abundance and distribution of args in the reservoir system 2 address how these potential factors e g mges bacteria community bacterial biomass antibiotics and nutrients shape the profiles of args as well as elucidate the key mechanism driving the arg dynamics in modern aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2

the 285 targeted args a total of 225 unique args were detected across the samples the shannon index diversity of args in the water phase was significantly higher than that in the sediment and soil phase kruskal wallis kw test p 0 05 while there was no significant differences between the sediment and soil phase kw test p 0 05 fig s3 venn diagram analysis revealed that 125 args which accounted for 55 6 of the total detected args were shared among the three environmental compartments fig 2 a additionally the unique subtypes in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase included 32 args 11 args and 5 args respectively more information about the shared and unique arg subtypes were shown in detail in the bipartite network analysis fig s4 the absolute abundances of 16s rrna args and mges in the water phase ranged from 1 9 109 to 3 6 1010 copies l 6 6 107 to 3 3 109 copies l and 6 7 106 to 4 3 108 copies l respectively fig s5 fig 2b similarly the corresponding abundances were in the ranges of 1 4 109 9 4 109 copies g 5 3 107 4 3 108 copies g and 1 4 108 7 3 108 copies g for the sediment phase fig s5 fig 2c and 5 6 109 3 6 1010 copies g 1 5 109 1 5 1010 copies g and 1 3 107 8 3 107 copies g for the soil phase fig s5 fig 2d the most dominant arg types were multidrug rgs in both the water phase and sediment phase whereas beta lactamase rgs was the most dominant arg type in the soil phase in addition the absolute abundances of args of the water phase or sediment phase exhibited non significant differences along with the seasonal variations kw test p 0 05 while its abundance in the soil phase was dramatically higher than that in the sediment kw test p 0 01 the absolute abundance of args correlated significantly with both 16s rrna pearson s r 0 67 p 0 01 and mges pearson s r 0 88 p 0 01 in the water phase however the absolute abundance of args only correlated significantly with mges in the sediment phase pearson s r 0 73 p 0 01 and 16s rrna in the soil phase pearson s r 0 90 p 0 05 table s4 in addition the absolute abundance of args and mges did not show significant correlations between the water phase and paired sediment phase pearson s correlation p 0 05 data not shown similarly the relative abundances of args and mges were also compared among the three environmental compartments fig s6 the relative abundance of total args in the soil phase was obviously higher than that in the water and sediment phase tukey s post hoc test p 0 01 but no significant difference was found between the water and sediment phase tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 in contrast the sediment phase had the highest relative abundance of total mges followed by the water phase then the soil phase tukey s post hoc test p 0 01 3 2 distribution patterns of args and mges the heatmap exhibited a more detailed pattern based on the relative abundances of arg and mge subtypes fig s7 furthermore the distribution patterns of args and mges were explored using the pcoa with one way permanova fig 3 environmental media had significant effects on the distribution patterns of args and mges permanova pseudo f 9 12 p 0 0001 permanova pseudo f 35 27 p 0 0001 table s5 and pcoa based on bray curtis distance for the args fig 3a and mges fig 3b showed obvious separations among the water phase sediment phase and soil phase in contrast the distribution patterns of args and mges exhibited no distinct differences according to the seasonal factor permanova pseudo f 1 37 p 0 1986 permanova pseudo f 1 17 p 0 3033 table s5 based on the pcoa analysis procrustes analysis was conducted to match the profiles of args and mges fig s8 the explanatory variables accounted for 40 2 and the correlations between the first two axes were significantly positive r 0 50 and 0 92 respectively in addition a mantel test confirmed that the distribution pattern of args was significantly correlated with mges based on bray curtis distance r 0 48 p 0 0001 permutations n 9999 the co occurrence pattern of arg subtypes and mges based on their modularity classes was investigated using the network analysis which consisted of 130 nodes and 881 edges with a clustering coefficient of 0 67 and a modularity index of 0 50 fig 4 the most frequently connected node in each network modularity was defined as the hub in the following descriptions based on these its entire network could be divided into four major modules module i iv and the corresponding hub genes were pikr2 module i aacc4 module ii tetg 01 module iii and ermb module iv respectively meanwhile each module contained multiple arg types e g mlsb aminoglycosides and multidrug as shown in fig s9 in addition inti 1 co occurring with 10 args e g blaoxy erm 36 and aacc was also observed in the network fig 4 on the other hand it should be noted that the co occurrence patterns of arg subtypes and mges for each environmental compartment were obviously different for instance the nodes and edges for the water phase sediment phase and soil phase were 163 and 817 fig s10 141 and 2829 fig s11 and 129 and 1382 fig s12 respectively correspondingly their sequential hub genes were mpha 01 mtrc 01 and ampc 04 3 3 basic properties and antibiotic residues basic properties for the water phase sediment phase and soil phase were analysed and listed in detail in tables s6 and s7 pcoa based on bray curtis distance for the basic properties showed that the three environmental compartments were significantly separated from each other permanova p 0 001 fig s13 moreover detailed information about the antibiotic residues in the three environmental compartments were also analysed and presented in fig s14 the total concentrations in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase were in the range of 193 6 569 2 ng l 115 1 278 2 ng g and 2 8 63 2 ng g respectively fig 5 a for the water phase fluoroquinolone class was the most predominant type of antibiotics however the most predominant type of antibiotics was tetracycline class in both the sediment and soil phase similarly pcoa based on bray curtis distance for their component proportions showed that there were significant differences in the antibiotic compositions among the water phase sediment phase and soil phase permanova p 0 05 fig 5b strikingly the concentrations of total antibiotics or their predominant type of antibiotics did not correlate with the absolute abundance of total args or their predominant arg types in the three environmental compartments pearson s correlation p 0 05 data not shown 3 4 characterization of bacterial community and its relationship with args a total of 1 384 804 high quality sequences were obtained with 39566 sequences per sample on average and these sequences were clustered into 6780 otus at 3 dissimilarity cutoff the relative abundances of main genus in each sample were showed in detail in fig s15 one way anova permanova revealed that the environmental media could significantly influence the grouped bacterial communities permanova pseudo f 47 96 p 0 0001 table s5 pcoa based on bray curtis distance for the bacterial community further showed that there had distinct differences among the water phase sediment phase and soil phase permanova p 0 001 fig 6 a the procrustes analysis and mantel test were also used to explore whether the arg profile was correlated with bacterial community genus the procrustes analysis revealed its explanatory variables could account for 43 7 and the correlations between the first two axes were significantly positive r 0 53 and 0 88 respectively fig 6b moreover the mantel test also showed that the distribution pattern of args was significantly correlated with the bacterial community on the basis of bray curtis distance r 0 43 p 0 0001 permutations n 9999 3 5 sems rank

312 fig 7c noteworthily it could be found that the coefficients in terms of standardized total effects for each factor influencing the arg profiles among the water phase sediment phase and soil phase were conflicting to various degrees 4 discussion as more and more dams are continuously constructed worldwide reservoir system ubiquitously exists in current watershed and becomes the most typical form of modern aquatic environment however little attention is systematically given toward the args contents in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase drawdown area of drinking water reservoir to the best of our knowledge this study provided the most comprehensive insights into the environmental media in influencing the variations and profiles of args in modern aquatic environment by using the ht qpcr 4 1 diversity and absolute abundance of args in the environmental compartments the present study was performed seasonally in a large drinking water reservoir system according to the factor of environmental media and all the samples were then grouped into three environmental compartments e g water phase sediment phase and soil phase as shown in fig 2a more than half of the total detected args were shared among the environmental compartments indicating that these 125 args are widespread and persistent in the aquatic environment at the same time unique args in the water phase 32 args sediment phase 11 args and soil phase 5 args suggest that these genes might be primordial genes in their corresponding phase among the environmental compartments the highest shannon index of args was in the water phase indicating that the water phase was prone to harbor more diverse args this finding was consistent with a previous study that the detected number of args in water phase was obviously more than that in sediment phase in the beijiang river jiang et al 2018 although the result of one way kruskal wallis anova Ï2 13 74 p 0 01 indicated that environmental media played significant roles influencing the diversities of args in the environmental compartments table s5 the fact that there had no difference in the diversities of args between the sediment phase and soil phase should not be negligible to this end these results support the idea that environmental media could partially affect the arg diversity in the aquatic environment unfortunately it is difficult to fully compare data obtained in the absolute abundances of args in different aquatic environments as different researchers probably choose different detection methods for args for instance although ht qpcr and metagenomics are capable of covering a large number of args many current researchers commonly use conventional quantitative pcr only covering a small number of specific args yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 as a result our study made some comparisons among the obtained information for args using the ht qpcr for the water phase args detected in absolute abundances ranged from 107 to 109 copies l which were dramatically lower than those in the zhangxi river 108 to 1010 copies l zheng et al 2018 jiulong river 108 to 1011 copies l ouyang et al 2015 and wen rui tang river 1010 to 1011 copies l zhou et al 2017 however their absolute abundances in this study were comparable to those found in some representatives of chinese lakes and reservoirs 106 to 109 copies l liu et al 2018 as we know many rivers are considered as long term polluted aquatic environment receiving direct anthropogenic effluents with various args and these waste discharges derived from multiple sources usually contain higher absolute abundance of args xiong et al 2014 in contrast most reservoirs are located within relatively pristine natural areas which have lower anthropogenic activities and receive less exogenous input of args as compared to river watershed liu et al 2018 additionally absolute abundances of args for the sediment phase were in the range of 107 108 copies g which were almost equivalent to those in the surface sediments from maricultures dalian china han et al 2017 and the estuaries of coastal china zhu et al 2017b since the maricultures and estuaries were strongly influenced by intensive human activities here it can be inferred that anthropogenic activities might not be the dominant factor influencing the absolute abundance of args in sediment phase strikingly the absolute abundances of args of the water phase or sediment phase did not change seasonally indicating that seasonal hydrological conditions might play a less role in impacting their absolute abundances in the reservoir however it was obvious that the absolute abundances of args in the soil phase was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sediment phase and it also had the higher relative abundances of total args compared to the water and sediment phases these results suggested that the soil phase in drawdown area could be a potential pool and hotspot for the development of args in modern aquatic environment considering the fact that there was no investigation focusing on the args in drawdown area more attentions should be given in order to cope with this insufficient in the future research especially in some larger drinking water reservoirs 4 2 distribution and co occurrence patterns of args and mges in modern aquatic environment the results of relative abundances of args and mges in the three phases indicated that the soil phase is more susceptible to harbor the args and the sediment phase is more likely to obtain mges the distribution patterns of args and mges did not change along with the seasonal variations indicating that season factor might play a less role in impacting their distribution patterns table s5 in contrast the pcoa with one way permanova according to the factor of environmental media on the distribution patterns of args and mges suggested that environmental media could significantly influence their distribution patterns table s5 fig 3 this finding could also be partially consolidated by the inconsistencies for the most dominant arg types among the environmental compartments at the same time combined with the fact that the values of pseudo f f in the distribution patterns of args and mges according to the environmental media were remarkably higher than those according to the season factor therefore it can be concluded that environmental media exert more effects on the distributions of args and mges in modern aquatic environment the clustering coefficient and modularity index of the network analysis indicated that the non random co occurrence patterns had an obvious modular structure barberan et al 2012 the identified four major modules further suggested that these genes in each module might have similar environmental fate across different phases on the other hand it also implied that the co occurrence genes might exhibit different co selection potentials among the modules in aquatic environment pal et al 2015 additionally our results supported the view that the hub gene of each module could be regarded as an indicator for the related co occurring args and mges in the corresponding module li et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 as we know the inti 1 has been suggested as an environmental marker of anthropogenic pollution because of its unparalleled advantages gillings et al 2015 consequently the co occurrence patterns between the inti 1 and co occurred genes e g blaoxy erm 36 and aacc suggest that the inti 1 is likely to acquire and disseminate these related arg subtypes as gene cassettes which are allocthonous in the aquatic environment and may be ultimately derived from human waste or their domestic livestock zhu et al 2017b previous studies also confirm the above finding such as the demonstrations that the blaoxy erm 36 and aacc were frequently detected in activated sludge livestock manure and its organic fertilizer at greater abundance an et al 2018 qian et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 in addition it should be noted that the co occurrence characteristics were markedly different among the three phases suggesting that environmental media can influence the co occurrence patterns between the arg subtypes and mges and therefore contribute to their distinct discrepancies in modern aquatic environment accordingly the mpha 01 mtrc 01 and ampc 04 in each co occurrence pattern could also be used as corresponding indicators for the co occurring args and mges in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase respectively zhu et al 2017b 4 3 factors influencing the profiles of args in modern aquatic environment horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt are fundamental biological pathways by which microorganism is able to enrich and acquire antibiotic resistance in its evolutionary process dantas and sommer 2014 numerous studies have suggested that the quantified 16s rrna gene could be used to evaluate the bacterial biomass which plays an important role in the vgt of args guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b also it is well known that mges could play a key role in the hgt of args dantas and sommer 2014 in our study the significant correlations for the absolute abundances in the water phase indicated that the vgt and hgt could together aid the proliferation and spread of args however inconsistent findings were obtained in the sediment phase and soil phase the correlation analysis results suggested that the hgt played a more role in facilitating the spread of args in the sediment phase in line with previous findings in various sediments chen et al 2015 zhu et al 2017b but the vgt might be the dominant way to promote the proliferation of args in the soil phase noteworthily no significant correlations in the absolute abundance of args or mges could be found between the water phase and paired sediment phase implying that the exchange and migration of args and mges between the two phases may be very weak chen et al 2013a taken together these findings further suggested that environmental media could obviously influence the occurrence characteristics of args and mges in the absolute abundance in modern aquatic environment and thus led to these discrepancies among the phases nevertheless on the whole both the procrustes analysis and mantel test suggested that the distribution of mges still played a crucial role in shaping the arg profile in modern aquatic environment the occurrences of antibiotics showed that the dominant types of antibiotics among the phases were not consistent meanwhile the pcoa analysis also revealed that the antibiotic compositions among the phases were obviously different although different application patterns of antibiotics and physicochemical properties might lead to these differences chen et al 2018 luo et al 2011 these results in our study highlighted that environmental media could also influence the occurrence characteristics of antibiotics and their biogeochemical process in aquatic environment it has been demonstrated that antibiotic residue has a chance to directly exert selective pressure for the induction and propagation of args saleeby et al 2003 however no significant correlation were found between the occurrence levels of antibiotics and args in each phase suggesting that the antibiotics play a less role in stimulating the propagation of args in aquatic environment probably this finding is conflicting to the preconception that continued increase in antibiotic residues is a dominant factor in increasing the abundance of args there are two possible explanations for this noticeable confliction first the residue concentrations of antibiotics are relatively low at the level of ng l or ng g in our environmental compartments wu et al 2018 it is quite likely that the low concentrations of antibiotics in aquatic environment are not enough to drastically promote the proliferation and spread of args bengtsson palme and joakim larsson 2016 this proposal could partly be consolidated by previous laboratory studies which demonstrated that some specific antibiotics maintaining considerable roles in the emergence and dissemination of args were often observed at the level of more than Î¼g l beaber et al 2004 saleeby et al 2003 van den bergh et al 2016 second antibiotic residues may only exert a small amount of selective pressure for the occurrence of args in the aquatic environment other residual chemicals could also provide the selection or co selection effect for elevating the occurrence of args such as heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and triclosan chen et al 2017a hu et al 2017 webber et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 nevertheless the less role of antibiotics on the args should not be overlooked in modern aquatic environment as modern aquatic environment is continuously exposed to antibiotic emission with the increasing level of antibiotic accumulation it is reasonable to believe that the role of antibiotics in the spread of args will become increasingly important as the carrier of args microorganisms play an important role in their proliferation and transmission it is highly likely that high bacterial biomass and diverse bacterial community are related with a higher probability of transfer for the args bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 based on converting the normal unit copies l of the absolute abundance of 16s rrna into copies g in water phase subsequent comparison results among the phases indicate that the soil phase has the most bacterial biomass followed by the sediment phase then the water phase dantas and sommer 2014 additionally our results based on the pcoa suggested that significant shifts of bacterial communities occurred along the variation of environmental media the reason for this may be due to fundamental differences in the microgeochemical environments and ecological niches xia et al 2014 coincidentally this finding is consistent with previous studies in other aquatic environments jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in general these results further demonstrated that environmental media could significantly influence both the bacterial biomass and bacterial community in modern aquatic environment similarly on the whole both the procrustes analysis and mantel test also confirmed the importance of bacterial community on the dynamic profile of args in this environment zhang et al 2016a 2016b as mentioned above several factors e g mges antibiotics and bacterial community have the potential to drive the variations of args to varying degrees meanwhile considering the fact that there has significant differences in the arg profiles among the phases thus it is a more reasonable and scientific choice to establish three sems to cope with the underlying mechanisms of arg dynamics in the phases respectively as delineated by the standardized total effects from sems the factors with the maximum coefficients for the water phase and sediment phase were all the mges suggesting that mges contributed the most to drive the arg dynamics in these environmental compartments via the hgt this also implied that arg profiles in the water phase and sediment phase were more closely associated with the inherent molecular biological mechanism of microorganisms blair et al 2015 dantas and sommer 2014 however the factor with the maximum coefficient in the soil phase was bacterial community indicating that bacterial community played the most dominant role in shaping the arg profiles this finding was well in accordance with previous concepts obtained in terrestrial soil phase han et al 2018 xiang et al 2018 given this it could be concluded that the mechanism of arg dynamic in the soil phase of drawdown area might be similar to that in terrestrial soil phase rather than the water phase or sediment phase in addition a consistent phenomenon was observed that the coefficients of basic properties in the three phases were all negative implying that low level of basic properties might accelerate the dissemination of args in aquatic environment actually the basic properties in this study could be regarded as nutrients for bacteria and our result also indicated that the environmental media could markedly change the basic properties previous finding suggested that poor nutrient conditions resulted in the decline of fitness cost of args and thus strengthened their persistence and competitive advantage lin et al 2018 at the same time guo et al 2018 suggested that cyanobacterial blooms rich nutrient conditions appeared to have stronger inhibitory effect on the proliferation of args in other words these recent findings could consolidate our proposal but more attention should be paid to better expound this interesting phenomenon in future research most importantly the differences in the coefficients of standardized total effects for each factor influencing the arg profiles among the phases indicated that the mechanisms of arg dynamics were complex and diverse in aquatic environment combined with the fact that environmental media could significantly influence all the factors imported in sems as mentioned above our study highlights that environmental media exert a bottleneck in driving the dynamics of args in modern aquatic environment probably via diversifying the mges bacterial community bacterial biomass antibiotics and basic properties nevertheless we also believe that there has material migration microbial movement and gene exchange among multiple phases under certain environmental conditions su et al 2019 xiong et al 2015 zhu et al 2017a in summary these findings in this present study support the concept that we need to comprehensively consider multiple environmental media when facing the problem of args in modern aquatic environment but the mechanism of arg dynamics for each environmental medium should be treated specifically 5 conclusion this study uncovered the comprehensive profiles of args and their dynamic mechanisms in a typical modern aquatic environment main conclusions obtained from the present work are as follows environmental media partially affected the arg diversity in aquatic environment and water phase was prone to harbor more diverse args compared with sediment phase and soil phase soil phase in drawdown area acted as a potential pool and hotspot for the development of args environmental media could significantly influence the distributions of args and mges and their co occurrence patterns both the vgt and hgt could aid the proliferation and spread of args in water phase while this process was completed in sediment phase and soil phase through the hgt and vgt respectively mges contributed the most to drive the arg dynamics in both water phase and sediment phase while the most dominant factor for this in soil phase was bacterial community environmental media could exert a bottleneck in driving the dynamics of args probably via diversifying the mges bacterial community bacterial biomass antibiotics and basic properties acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support from the national

18638,with the rapid construction of dams worldwide reservoir system has become a representation of modern aquatic environment however the profiles of antibiotic resistance genes args and associated

soil phase and soil phase in drawdown area was a potential reservoir and hotspot for args environmental media partially affected the arg diversity in modern aquatic environment while it observably influenced the distributions of args and mges and their co occurrence patterns the pathways for the proliferation and spread of args in water phase were both the horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt while the dominant pathways in sediment phase and soil phase were the hgt and vgt respectively the sems demonstrated that mges contributed the most to drive the arg dynamics in both water phase and sediment phase while the most dominant factor for this in soil phase was bacterial community overall environmental media exerted a bottleneck in driving the dynamics of args in modern aquatic environment probably via diversifying the mges bacterial community bacterial biomass antibiotics and basic properties graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes high throughput qpcr modern aquatic environment structural equation model mobile genetic elements bacterial community 1 introduction microbial mass movements around the world lead to a cruel fact that antibiotic resistance does not respect regional or national boundaries thus antibiotic resistance is recognized as a globally major health challenge of the 21st century li et al 2015 zhu et al 2017a although antibiotic resistance itself is an ancient phenomenon naturally occurring widespread in the environment d costa et al 2011 human activities could aggravate this notorious phenomenon by accelerating the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args chen et al 2013b vikesland et al 2017 since args were considered as emerging pollutants in 2006 pruden et al 2006 abundant args have been frequently found in various environments e g freshwater sediment air and soil han et al 2018 hu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 currently plentiful args their bacterial hosts and probably coupled with antibiotic residues from households hospitals and livestock farms are ultimately released into aquatic environments via various waste streams vikesland et al 2017 consequently aquatic environment are increasingly recognized as ideal settings for the acquisition and dissemination of args and merit more attention marti et al 2014 taylor et al 2011 as one of the most precious resources to life on earth aquatic environment provides irreplaceable functions in the global biogeochemical process and socio economic maintenance noteworthily there was an accelerating trend in the construction of dams reservoirs over the last decades and approximately 50 000 large dams have been built in the management and control of water resources worldwide lehner et al 2011 it is well known that these dams could alter hydrological characteristics and disrupt ecological connectivity for natural aquatic environment tang et al 2016 for instance this would prolong the hydraulic retention time promote the deposition of particulate deposits and potentially form the drawdown area in reservoir system chen et al 2017b su et al 2019 it is noteworthy that drawdown area actually serves as a transitional zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and plays an important role in maintaining geochemical process and biological diversity bao et al 2015b su et al 2019 generally the dams represent the most significant disturbance by anthropic activities to global watershed herein reservoir system could be regarded as the most typical modern water environment lehner et al 2011 tang et al 2016 it is widely accepted that reservoir system should consists of waters sediments and drawdown area bao et al 2015a jia and liu 2017 nonetheless previous researches mainly focused on the nutrient cycles heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in some reservoirs mwanamoki et al 2014 su et al 2019 yan et al 2018 on the other hand some limited conclusions associated with args were obtained from individual water phase or sediment phase of reservoirs but their quantitative methods for the args were based on conventional quantitative pcr which only covered limited arg targets yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 as a result the occurrence and distribution of args in reservoir system remained poorly characterized especially in reservoirs supplying drinking water source furthermore when faced with the current ubiquitous resistance problem it is very necessary to uncover the mechanism of arg dynamics and evaluate the dominant factors influencing their dynamics previous reports suggested that antibiotic resistance among different microorganisms can be acquired by horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt and the hgt via mobile genetic elements mges may be the dominant factor in the proliferation and spread of args blair et al 2015 dantas and sommer 2014 zheng et al 2018 agreed with this proposal that mges were identified as the key factor driving the arg alterations in a peri urban river wu et al 2017 also found that arg dynamics were more associated with mges in leachates nevertheless recent studies suggested that bacterial community contributed the most to args profiles in the sludge and soil phase zhang et al 2016b 2018 zhao et al 2017 demonstrated that the profile and dissemination of args were dominantly driven by nutrients including total nitrogen and total organic carbon contents in mariculture sediments based on the summary of previous literature it can be found that the dominant factors influencing the arg profiles in different environments are discrepant to some extent that is to say the current volume of studies on the determination of crucial factors influencing the args profiles is far from adequate taken together more comprehensive investigations about the dominant factors influencing arg profiles and corresponding mechanisms of their dynamics in reservoir system will be of great significance for a better understanding of the args in modern aquatic environment to achieve this goal an ideal reservoir system south china was chosen to reveal broader profiles of args in modern aquatic environment high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr with validated primer sets targeting multiple types of args and mges was used to obtain a comprehensive detection for args chen et al 2019 moreover bacterial community compositions and antibiotic concentrations were determined by illumina sequencing and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry respectively in view of these this study aims to 1 comprehensively investigate the effects of environmental media on the diversity abundance and distribution of args in the reservoir system 2 address how these potential factors e g mges bacteria community bacterial biomass antibiotics and nutrients shape the profiles of args as well as elucidate the key mechanism driving the arg dynamics in modern aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2

positive results should have at least two or more positive technical replicates raw data analysis about the relative and absolute abundances of args and mges were processed in accordance with our

adopted to rank the factor influencing the args dynamics through amos 21 software spss inc usa according to our previous investigation chen et al 2019 3 results 3 1 diversity and abundance of args of the 285 targeted args a total of 225 unique args were detected across the samples the shannon index diversity of args in the water phase was significantly higher than that in the sediment and soil phase kruskal wallis kw test p 0 05 while there was no significant differences between the sediment and soil phase kw test p 0 05 fig s3 venn diagram analysis revealed that 125 args which accounted for 55 6 of the total detected args were shared among the three environmental compartments fig 2 a additionally the unique subtypes in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase included 32 args 11 args and 5 args respectively more information about the shared and unique arg subtypes were shown in detail in the bipartite network analysis fig s4 the absolute abundances of 16s rrna args and mges in the water phase ranged from 1 9 109 to 3 6 1010 copies l 6 6 107 to 3 3 109 copies l and 6 7 106 to 4 3 108 copies l respectively fig s5 fig 2b similarly the corresponding abundances were in the ranges of 1 4 109 9 4 109 copies g 5 3 107 4 3 108 copies g and 1 4 108 7 3 108 copies g for the sediment phase fig s5 fig 2c and 5 6 109 3 6 1010 copies g 1 5 109 1 5 1010 copies g and 1 3 107 8 3 107 copies g for the soil phase fig s5 fig 2d the most dominant arg types were multidrug rgs in both the water phase and sediment phase whereas beta lactamase rgs was the most dominant arg type in the soil phase in addition the absolute abundances of args of the water phase or sediment phase exhibited non significant differences along with the seasonal variations kw test p 0 05 while its abundance in the soil phase was dramatically higher than that in the sediment kw test p 0 01 the absolute abundance of args correlated significantly with both 16s rrna pearson s r 0 67 p 0 01 and mges pearson s r 0 88 p 0 01 in the water phase however the absolute abundance of args only correlated significantly with mges in the sediment phase pearson s r 0 73 p 0 01 and 16s rrna in the soil phase pearson s r 0 90 p 0 05 table s4 in addition the absolute abundance of args and mges did not show significant correlations between the water phase and paired sediment phase pearson s correlation p 0 05 data not shown similarly the relative abundances of args and mges were also compared among the three environmental compartments fig s6 the relative abundance of total args in the soil phase was obviously higher than that in the water and sediment phase tukey s post hoc test p 0 01 but no significant difference was found between the water and sediment phase tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 in contrast the sediment phase had the highest relative abundance of total mges followed by the water phase then the soil phase tukey s post hoc test p 0 01 3 2 distribution patterns of args and mges the heatmap exhibited a more detailed pattern based on the relative abundances of arg and mge subtypes fig s7 furthermore the distribution patterns of args and mges were explored using the pcoa with one way

bray curtis distance for the args fig 3a and mges fig 3b showed obvious separations among the water phase sediment phase and soil phase in contrast the distribution patterns of args and mges exhibited no distinct differences according to the seasonal factor permanova pseudo f 1 37 p 0 1986 permanova pseudo f 1 17 p 0 3033 table s5 based on the pcoa analysis procrustes analysis was conducted to match the profiles of args and mges fig s8 the explanatory variables accounted for 40 2 and the correlations between the first two axes were significantly positive r 0 50 and 0 92 respectively in addition a mantel test confirmed that the distribution pattern of args was significantly correlated with mges based on bray curtis distance r 0 48 p 0 0001 permutations n 9999 the co occurrence pattern of arg subtypes and mges based on their modularity classes was investigated using the network analysis which consisted of 130 nodes and 881 edges with a clustering coefficient of 0 67 and a modularity index of 0 50 fig 4 the most frequently connected node in each network modularity was defined as the hub in the following descriptions based on these its entire network could be divided into four major modules module i iv and the corresponding hub genes were pikr2 module i aacc4 module ii tetg 01 module iii and ermb module iv respectively meanwhile each module contained multiple arg types e g mlsb aminoglycosides and multidrug as shown in fig s9 in addition inti 1 co occurring with 10 args e g blaoxy erm 36 and aacc was also observed in the network fig 4 on the other hand it should be noted that the co occurrence patterns of arg subtypes and mges for each environmental compartment were obviously different for instance the nodes and edges for the water phase sediment phase and soil phase were 163 and 817 fig s10 141 and 2829 fig s11 and 129 and 1382 fig s12 respectively correspondingly their sequential hub genes were mpha 01 mtrc 01 and ampc 04 3 3 basic properties and antibiotic residues basic properties for the water phase sediment phase and soil phase were analysed and listed in detail in tables s6 and s7 pcoa based on bray curtis distance for the basic properties showed that the three environmental compartments were significantly separated from each other permanova p 0 001 fig s13 moreover detailed information about the antibiotic residues in the three environmental compartments were also analysed and presented in fig s14 the total concentrations in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase were in the range of 193 6 569 2 ng l 115 1 278 2 ng g and 2 8 63 2 ng g respectively fig 5 a for the water phase fluoroquinolone class was the most predominant type of antibiotics however the most predominant type of antibiotics was tetracycline class in both the sediment and soil phase similarly pcoa based on bray curtis distance for their component proportions showed that there were significant differences in the antibiotic compositions among the water phase sediment phase and soil phase permanova p 0 05 fig 5b strikingly the concentrations of total antibiotics or their predominant type of antibiotics did not correlate with the absolute abundance of total args or their predominant arg types in the three environmental compartments pearson s correlation p 0 05 data not shown 3 4 characterization of bacterial community and its relationship with args a total of 1 384 804 high quality sequences were obtained with 39566 sequences per sample on average and these sequences were clustered into 6780 otus at 3 dissimilarity cutoff the relative abundances of main genus in each sample were showed in detail in fig s15 one way anova permanova revealed that the environmental media could significantly influence the grouped bacterial communities permanova pseudo f 47 96 p 0 0001 table s5 pcoa based on bray curtis distance for the bacterial community further showed that there had distinct differences among the water phase sediment phase and soil phase permanova p 0 001 fig 6 a the procrustes analysis and mantel test were also used to explore whether the arg profile was correlated with bacterial community genus the procrustes analysis revealed its explanatory variables could account for 43 7 and the correlations between the first two axes were significantly positive r 0 53 and 0 88 respectively fig 6b moreover the mantel test also showed that the distribution pattern of args was significantly correlated with the bacterial community on the basis of bray curtis distance r 0 43 p 0 0001 permutations n 9999 3 5 sems rank

form of modern aquatic environment however little attention is systematically given toward the args contents in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase drawdown area of drinking water reservoir to the best of our knowledge this study provided the most comprehensive insights into the environmental media in influencing the variations and profiles of args in modern aquatic environment by using the ht qpcr 4 1 diversity and absolute abundance of args in the environmental compartments the present study was performed seasonally in a large drinking water reservoir system according to the factor of environmental media and all the samples were then grouped into three environmental compartments e g water phase sediment phase and soil phase as shown in fig 2a more than half of the total detected args were shared among the environmental compartments indicating that these 125 args are widespread and persistent in the aquatic environment at the same time unique args in the water phase 32 args sediment phase 11 args and soil phase 5 args suggest that these genes might be primordial genes in their corresponding phase among the environmental compartments the highest shannon index of args was in the water phase indicating that the water phase was prone to harbor more diverse args this finding was consistent with a previous study that the detected number of args in water phase was obviously more than that in sediment phase in the beijiang river jiang et al 2018 although the result of one way kruskal wallis anova Ï2 13 74 p 0 01 indicated that environmental media played significant roles influencing the diversities of args in the environmental compartments table s5 the fact that there had no difference in the diversities of args between the sediment phase and soil phase should not be negligible to this end these results support the idea that environmental media could partially affect the arg diversity in the aquatic environment unfortunately it is difficult to fully compare data obtained in the absolute abundances of args in different aquatic environments as different researchers probably choose different detection methods for args for instance although ht qpcr and metagenomics are capable of covering a large number of args many current researchers commonly use conventional quantitative pcr only covering a small number of specific args yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 as a result our study made some comparisons among the obtained information for args using the ht qpcr for the water phase args detected in absolute abundances ranged from 107 to 109 copies l which were dramatically lower than those in the zhangxi river 108 to 1010 copies l zheng et al 2018 jiulong river 108 to 1011 copies l ouyang et al 2015 and wen rui tang river 1010 to 1011 copies l zhou et al 2017 however their absolute abundances in this study were comparable to those found in some representatives of chinese lakes and reservoirs 106 to 109 copies l liu et al 2018 as we know many rivers are considered as long term polluted aquatic environment receiving direct anthropogenic effluents with various args and these waste discharges derived from multiple sources usually contain higher absolute abundance of args xiong et al 2014 in contrast most reservoirs are located within relatively pristine natural areas which have lower anthropogenic activities and receive less exogenous input of args as compared to river watershed liu et al 2018 additionally absolute abundances of args for the sediment phase were in the range of 107 108 copies g which were almost equivalent to those in the surface sediments from maricultures dalian china han et al 2017 and the estuaries of coastal china zhu et al 2017b since the maricultures and estuaries were strongly influenced by intensive human activities here it can be inferred that anthropogenic activities might not be the dominant factor influencing the absolute abundance of args in sediment phase strikingly the absolute abundances of args of the water phase or sediment phase did not change seasonally indicating that seasonal hydrological conditions might play a less role in impacting their absolute abundances in the reservoir however it was obvious that the absolute abundances of args in the soil phase was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sediment phase and it also had the higher relative abundances of total args compared to the water and sediment phases these results suggested that the soil phase in drawdown area could be a potential pool and hotspot for the development of args in modern aquatic environment considering the fact that there was no investigation focusing on the args in drawdown area more attentions should be given in order to cope with this insufficient in the future research especially in some larger drinking water reservoirs 4 2 distribution and co occurrence patterns of args and mges in modern aquatic environment the results of relative abundances of args and mges in the three phases indicated that the soil phase is more susceptible to harbor the args and the sediment phase is more likely to obtain mges the distribution patterns of args and mges did not change along with the seasonal variations indicating that season factor might play a less role in impacting their distribution patterns table s5 in contrast the pcoa with one way permanova according to the factor of environmental media on the distribution patterns of args and mges suggested that environmental media could significantly influence their distribution patterns table s5 fig 3 this finding could also be partially consolidated by the inconsistencies for the most dominant arg types among the environmental compartments at the same time combined with the fact that the values of pseudo f f in the distribution patterns of args and mges according to the environmental media were remarkably higher than those according to the season factor therefore it can be concluded that environmental media exert more effects on the distributions of args and mges in modern aquatic environment the clustering coefficient and modularity index of the network analysis indicated that the non random co occurrence patterns had an obvious modular structure barberan et al 2012 the identified four major modules further suggested that these genes in each module might have similar environmental fate across different phases on the other hand it also implied that the co occurrence genes might exhibit different co selection potentials among the modules in aquatic environment pal et al 2015 additionally our results supported the view that the hub gene of each module could be regarded as an indicator for the related co occurring args and mges in the corresponding module li et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 as we know the inti 1 has been suggested as an environmental marker of anthropogenic pollution because of its unparalleled advantages gillings et al 2015 consequently the co occurrence patterns between the inti 1 and co occurred genes e g blaoxy erm 36 and aacc suggest that the inti 1 is likely to acquire and disseminate these related arg subtypes as gene cassettes which are allocthonous in the aquatic environment and may be ultimately derived from human waste or their domestic livestock zhu et al 2017b previous studies also confirm the above finding such as the demonstrations that the blaoxy erm 36 and aacc were frequently detected in activated sludge livestock manure and its organic fertilizer at greater abundance an et al 2018 qian et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 in addition it should be noted that the co occurrence characteristics were markedly different among the three phases suggesting that environmental media can influence the co occurrence patterns between the arg subtypes and mges and therefore contribute to their distinct discrepancies in modern aquatic environment accordingly the mpha 01 mtrc 01 and ampc 04 in each co occurrence pattern could also be used as corresponding indicators for the co occurring args and mges in the water phase sediment phase and soil phase respectively zhu et al 2017b 4 3 factors influencing the profiles of args in modern aquatic environment horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt are fundamental biological pathways by which microorganism is able to enrich and acquire antibiotic resistance in its evolutionary process dantas and sommer 2014 numerous studies have suggested that the quantified 16s rrna gene could be used to evaluate the bacterial biomass which plays an important role in the vgt of args guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b also it is well known that mges could play a key role in the hgt of args dantas and sommer 2014 in our study the significant correlations for the absolute abundances in the water phase indicated that the vgt and hgt could together aid the proliferation and spread of args however inconsistent findings were obtained in the sediment phase and soil phase the correlation analysis results suggested that the hgt played a more role in facilitating the spread of args in the sediment phase in line with previous findings in various sediments chen et al 2015 zhu et al 2017b but the vgt might be the dominant way to promote the proliferation of args in the soil phase noteworthily no significant correlations in the absolute abundance of args or mges could be found between the water phase and paired sediment phase implying that the exchange and migration of args and mges between the two phases may be very weak chen et al 2013a taken together these findings further suggested that environmental media could obviously influence the occurrence characteristics of args and mges in the absolute abundance in modern aquatic environment and thus led to these discrepancies among the phases nevertheless on the whole both the procrustes analysis and mantel test suggested that the distribution of mges still played a crucial role in shaping the arg profile in modern aquatic environment the occurrences of antibiotics showed that the dominant types of antibiotics among the phases were not consistent meanwhile the pcoa analysis also revealed that the antibiotic compositions among the phases were obviously different although different application patterns of antibiotics and physicochemical properties might lead to these differences chen et al 2018 luo et al 2011 these results in our study highlighted that environmental media could also influence the occurrence characteristics of antibiotics and their biogeochemical process in aquatic environment it has been demonstrated that antibiotic residue has a chance to directly exert selective pressure for the induction and propagation of args saleeby et al 2003 however no significant correlation were found between the occurrence levels of antibiotics and args in each phase suggesting that the antibiotics play a less role in stimulating the propagation of args in aquatic environment probably this finding is conflicting to the preconception that continued increase in antibiotic residues is a dominant factor in increasing the abundance of args there are two possible explanations for this noticeable confliction first the residue concentrations of antibiotics are relatively low at the level of ng l or ng g in our environmental compartments wu et al 2018 it is quite likely that the low concentrations of antibiotics in aquatic environment are not enough to drastically promote the proliferation and spread of args bengtsson palme and joakim larsson 2016 this proposal could partly be consolidated by previous laboratory studies which demonstrated that some specific antibiotics maintaining considerable roles in the emergence and dissemination of args were often observed at the level of more than Î¼g l beaber et al 2004 saleeby et al 2003 van den bergh et al 2016 second antibiotic residues may only exert a small amount of selective pressure for the occurrence of args in the aquatic environment other residual chemicals could also provide the selection or co selection effect for elevating the occurrence of args such as heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and triclosan chen et al 2017a hu et al 2017 webber et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 nevertheless the less role of antibiotics on the args should not be overlooked in modern aquatic environment as modern aquatic environment is continuously exposed to antibiotic emission with the increasing level of antibiotic accumulation it is reasonable to believe that the role of antibiotics in the spread of args will become increasingly important as the carrier of args microorganisms play an important role in their proliferation and transmission it is highly likely that high bacterial biomass and diverse bacterial community are related with a higher probability of transfer for the args bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 based on converting the normal unit copies l of the absolute abundance of 16s rrna into copies g in water phase subsequent comparison results among the phases indicate that the soil phase has the most bacterial biomass followed by the sediment phase then the water phase dantas and sommer 2014 additionally our results based on the pcoa suggested that significant shifts of bacterial communities occurred along the variation of environmental media the reason for this may be due to fundamental differences in the microgeochemical environments and ecological niches xia et al 2014 coincidentally this finding is consistent with previous studies in other aquatic environments jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in general these results further demonstrated that environmental media could significantly influence both the bacterial biomass and bacterial community in modern aquatic environment similarly on the whole both the procrustes analysis and mantel test also confirmed the importance of bacterial community on the dynamic profile of args in this environment zhang et al 2016a 2016b as mentioned above several factors e g mges antibiotics and bacterial community have the potential to drive the variations of args to varying degrees meanwhile considering the fact that there has significant differences in the arg profiles among the phases thus it is a more reasonable and scientific choice to establish three sems to cope with the underlying mechanisms of arg dynamics in the phases respectively as delineated by the standardized total effects from sems the factors with the maximum coefficients for the water phase and sediment phase were all the mges suggesting that mges contributed the most to drive the arg dynamics in these environmental compartments via the hgt this also implied that arg profiles in the water phase and sediment phase were more closely associated with the inherent molecular biological mechanism of microorganisms blair et al 2015 dantas and sommer 2014 however the factor with the maximum coefficient in the soil phase was bacterial community indicating that bacterial community played the most dominant role in shaping the arg profiles this finding was well in accordance with previous concepts obtained in terrestrial soil phase han et al 2018 xiang et al 2018 given this it could be concluded that the mechanism of arg dynamic in the soil phase of drawdown area might be similar to that in terrestrial soil phase rather than the water phase or sediment phase in addition a consistent phenomenon was observed that the coefficients of basic properties in the three phases were all negative implying that low level of basic properties might accelerate the dissemination of args in aquatic environment actually the basic properties in this study could be regarded as nutrients for bacteria and our result also indicated that the environmental media could markedly change the basic properties previous finding suggested that poor nutrient conditions resulted in the decline of fitness cost of args and thus strengthened their persistence and competitive advantage lin et al 2018 at the same time guo et al 2018 suggested that cyanobacterial blooms rich nutrient conditions appeared to have stronger inhibitory effect on the proliferation of args in other words these recent findings could consolidate our proposal but more attention should be paid to better expound this interesting phenomenon in future research most importantly the differences in the coefficients of standardized total effects for each factor influencing the arg profiles among the phases indicated that the mechanisms of arg dynamics were complex and diverse in aquatic environment combined with the fact that environmental media could significantly influence all the factors imported in sems as mentioned above our study highlights that environmental media exert a bottleneck in driving the dynamics of args in modern aquatic environment probably via diversifying the mges bacterial community bacterial biomass antibiotics and basic properties nevertheless we also believe that there has material migration microbial movement and gene exchange among multiple phases under certain environmental conditions su et al 2019 xiong et al 2015 zhu et al 2017a in summary these findings in this present study support the concept that we need to comprehensively consider multiple environmental media when facing the problem of args in modern aquatic environment but the mechanism of arg dynamics for each environmental medium should be treated specifically 5 conclusion this study uncovered the comprehensive profiles of args and their dynamic mechanisms in a typical modern aquatic environment main conclusions obtained from the present work are as follows environmental media partially affected the arg diversity in aquatic environment and water phase was prone to harbor more diverse args compared with sediment phase and soil phase soil phase in drawdown area acted as a potential pool and hotspot for the development of args environmental media could significantly influence the distributions of args and mges and their co occurrence patterns both the vgt and hgt could aid the proliferation and spread of args in water phase while this process was completed in sediment phase and soil phase through the hgt and vgt respectively mges contributed the most to drive the arg dynamics in both water phase and sediment phase while the most dominant factor for this in soil phase was bacterial community environmental media could exert a bottleneck in driving the dynamics of args probably via diversifying the mges bacterial community bacterial biomass antibiotics and basic properties acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support from the national

18639,fertilized agroecosystems may show considerable leaching of the mobile nitrogen n compound no3 which pollutes groundwater and causes eutrophication of downstream waterbodies riparian buffer zones positioned between terrestrial and aquatic environments effectively remove no3 and serve as a hotspot for n2o emissions however microbial processes governing no3 reduction in riparian zones still remain largely unclear this study explored the underlying mechanisms of various n loss processes in riparian soil horizons using isotopic tracing techniques molecular assays and high throughput sequencing both anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and denitrification activity were maximized in the riparian fringe rather than in the central zones denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo process was not detected interestingly both contrasting microbial habitats were separated by a groundwater table which forms an important biogeochemical interface denitrification dominated cumulative n losses in the upper unsaturated soil while anammox dominated the lower oxic saturated soil horizons archaeal and bacterial ammonium oxidation that couple dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra with a high cell specific rate promoted anammox even further in oxic subsurface horizons high throughput sequencing and network analysis showed that the anammox rate positively correlated with candidatus kuenenia 4 rather than with the dominant candidatus brocadia the contribution to n loss via anammox increased significantly with the water level which was accompanied by a significant reduction of n2o emission 39 3 10 6 since n loss by anammox does not cause n2o emissions hence water table management in riparian ecotones can be optimized to reduce no3 pollution by shifting from denitrification to the environmentally friendly anammox pathway to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox microbial n loss riparian zone water saturated soil horizon n2o emission 1 introduction nutrient loading of terrestrial freshwater and coastal ecosystems has been occurring on a global scale which is mainly driven by agricultural activities verhoeven et al 2006 technological purification has been shown to be the best choice for the reduction of nutrient fluxes into the environment however nutrient loading as a result of intensive agricultural practices is typically diffuse or originates from non point sources which makes it hard to address the issue technologically riparian zones form the interface areas between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems and have been shown to efficiently prevent pollutant movement from upland areas into streams wang et al 2002 hefting et al 2006 specifically riparian zones serve as sinks for nitrate no3 which is the most common groundwater pollutant and a precursor to nitrous oxide n2o groffman et al 2002 hefting et al 2004 microbe driven n reduction processes are key for the creation of no3 sinks in riparian zones it was previously assumed that microbial heterotrophic denitrification was the main no3 removal pathway for nitrogen gas n2 to the atmosphere burgin and hamilton 2007 however the discovery of both anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo greatly changed this assumption over the past 20 years n cycle studies have been conducted for the last 100 years however knowledge about the complexity of the underlying process remains limited this is particularly true for riparian zones due to their high heterogeneity denitrification has been one of the most studied processes for the reduction of no3 to n2 traditionally denitrification has been assumed to only take place under anoxic and anaerobic conditions however recently reported evidence indicated that denitrification also happens under oxic conditions gao et al 2010 marchant et al 2017 specifically anammox could be an alternative n loss pathway to denitrification which is performed by autotrophic anammox bacteria that directly oxidize nh4 with no2 to n2 without emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o over the past 20 years anammox was widely reported in marine devol 2015 freshwater zhu et al 2015 estuary naeher et al 2015 groundwater smith et al 2015 wang et al 2017 paddy field nie et al 2015 shan et al 2016 and man made ecosystems wang et al 2015 these studies have identified anammox as a significant contributor to n loss moreover in a number of aerobic environments of artificial ecosystems aerobic anoxic anaerobic micro environments can form thus allowing anammox to increase third et al 2001 vÃ¡zquez padÃ­n et al 2011 figueroa et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the complexities of the n cycle were further studied which led to the discovery of the damo process where methane ch4 is used as electron donor to reduce no2 or no3 anaerobically mediated by the bacteria methylomirabilis and or the archaea methanoperedens raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 the damo process links the biogeochemical c and n cycles in a novel way and has been shown to operate in both inland water and wetland ecosystems deutzmann and schink 2011 deutzmann et al 2014 hu et al 2014 these reports significantly promoted the understanding of the global n cycle dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra which is a further no3 reduction process also uses no3 and no2 as substrates under anoxic anaerobic conditions in contrast to denitrification anammox and damo dnra reduces no3 to nh4 instead of n2 dnra is typically considered to be only significant in peripheral environments analogous to dnra several studies also reported high activity of aerobic dnra bacteria even if o2 saturation exceeded 80 shan et al 2016 roberts et al 2014 in these microbe mediated no3 reduction processes nh4 is generated by dnra as an end product which is then used as a substrate for anammox subsequently nh4 is oxidized to no3 by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob thus allowing the recycling of substrates necessary for these microbial processes the symbiotic and competitive mechanisms among denitrification anammox damo and dnra demonstrate the complexity of the n cycle especially in riparian zones overall the discovery of novel microbe mediated n transfer mechanisms with new taxa and functions challenge existing knowledge about the n cycle and spatiotemporal variations in riparian zones this limited understanding warrants further research to better understand the underlying biogeochemical processes in riparian soil profiles the zone around the groundwater table has been identified as an important hotspot for biogeochemical cycles naiman and dÃ©camps 1997 mcclain et al 2003 hancock et al 2005 naeher et al 2015 fluctuations of the groundwater table control water saturation and redox conditions in wetland soils which then drive n cycling and the involved differences in microbial rates hefting et al 2004 in general saturated soils below the groundwater table contain lower oxygen concentrations compared to upper unsaturated soils in a number of riparian zones along lakes however surface water can infiltrate the underlying soil this results in the oxygenation of the saturated soil with groundwater which leads to high oxygen content and long retention times since the organic matter content is lower in deeper soil horizons n loss is predominantly driven by more dominant autotrophic microbial processes zhu et al 2018a in contrast in soil horizons above the groundwater table n loss is dominated by heterotrophic processes due to an increase of organic matter from the litter layer root exudates and microbial residues wang et al 2012a b hefting et al 2004 2006 based on previous studies on microbial n cycles in wetland ecosystems hefting et al 2004 wang et al 2012a b zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2011 2013a b this study proposes that heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic anammox and damo have different degrees of contribution to n loss of riparian zone profiles above and below the groundwater table moreover increased anammox with n loss is accompanied by decreased n2o emissions since n loss via anammox does not lead to n2o emission given this background the objectives of present study are i to explore the distribution and biogeochemistry of denitrification anammox dnra and damo processes in water saturated and water unsaturated riparian soil horizons furthermore to quantify the contribution of each microbial process to the overall n loss no3 removal and mitigation of n2o emission ii to investigate the underlying mechanisms and to provide a complete overview of the nitrite producing or removing processes related to anammox using isotopic tracing q pcr clone high throughput sequencing and molecular ecological network analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site lake baiyangdian is the largest natural freshwater lake group of north china with well developed riparian zones that are an anammox hotspot zhu et al 2013a b increasing sewage and wastewater influx from an upstream city and agricultural runoff led to the eutrophication of the lake the lake baiyangdian group consists of approximately 140 lakes with a total area of 366 km2 at a water level of 10 5 m above the sea level and a water depth of 2 m on

measured as the production rate of 15no2 from 15nh4 under oxic conditions a known quantity of the 15nh4 stock solution was injected to 5 9 8 7 Î¼m and the ratios of 14nh4 15nh4 were calculated incubations were terminated at each time point 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h to assess the 15no2 yield 16 5 mm final concentration of sulfamic acid was added to completely reduce 15no2 to 29n2 granger

ammonium oxidation rates using the corrected ratio of 14nh4 15nh4 for the dnra rate 100 Î¼l of diluted 15no2 stock solution was injected to 0 1 0 4 Î¼m final concentration while the 14no2 15no2 ratio was calculated for the final rate correlation at each time point 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h the reaction was stopped by adding hypobromite with a final concentration equaling that of 15no2 followed by 12 h of incubation to completely convert the produced 15nh4 to 30n2 lam et al 2009 fÃ¼ssel et al 2012 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a b c the produced 30n2 was then used to calculate the dnra rates with the corrected ratio of 14no2 15no2 the no3 reduction rate was measured by adding 100 Î¼l of diluted 15no3 stock solution to a final 4 2 6 7 Î¼m and then 100 Î¼l of saturated mercuric chloride were injected to terminate the reaction at each time point 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h then 16 5 mm final concentration of sulfamic acid was added and incubated for more than 12 h to completely reduce 15no2 to 29n2 granger and sigman 2009 fÃ¼ssel et al 2012 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a b c this was then used to calculate the no3 reduction rates using the actual ratio of 14no3 15no3 atmospheric air was used to generate both standard curve and reference air which were measured together with the incubations of soil samples risgaard petersen et al 2004 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a b c several glass vials 12 ml volume exetainer labco uk were filled with demineralized water without headspace and equilibrated with atmospheric air at in situ temperature subsequently 8 ml of the water was removed and replaced with high purity he 99 9 then 0 30 60 90 and 120 Î¼l of air were injected into the standard curve vials respectively all glass vials were shaken for at least 1 min to achieve equilibrium between water and headspace standard curves were used to linear regress the total signal versus the yield of each 15n n2 then the concentrations of the produced 15n n2 in samples were calculated a linear regression was generated between the labelled 15n n2 concentration shift over time with coefficients r 2 of 0 60 and a significance level of p 0 05 the 15n n2

research chinese academy of sciences 2 5 measurement of the damo rate using the 13c tracer technique the potential damo rates in the riparian zone were determined based on 13c co2 production using the

residual nox and o2 rates were calculated via linear regression of the co2 yield and incubation time the linear correlation exceeded 0 90 and the ratio of 13c co2 to total co2 in the negative controls remained consistent with that of atmospheric air the measurements were performed using irms delta v advantage thermo electron corporation usa with a minimum detectable rate of approximately 0 002 nmol

2 mol l 1 kcl and were analyzed by a continuous flow analyzer seal analytical uk the soil ph was analyzed in a 1 5 soil water w v suspension by a delta 320 ph analyzer mettler toledo usa bao 2000 the total organic matter tom was determined by oxidizing potassium dichromate and sulphuric acid bao 2000 the total nitrogen tn total carbon tc and total sulfur ts were measured by an elemental analyzer system vario el iii analyzer germany after soil cores were dug the do and temperature were immediately analyzed by an optical do sensor 4 5 cm diameter equipped with a ysi model 600 xlmv2 multi probe sonde the sensor was slowly lowered to the soil sample to prevent mixing measurements were processed in triplicate for quality assurance quality control 2 7 measuring n2o concentrations and fluxes the n2o emission flux was measured using the closed chamber technique with triplicate chambers for each sampling test wang et al 2006 the stainless steel chambers consisted of a pedestal and an upper chamber the bottom rim of the pedestal was pushed into the soil and the top rim was filled with water thus creating an airtight seal the upper chamber was equipped with brushless fans driven by two batteries to mix the chamber headspace a temperature probe reported the real time air temperature of the chamber headspace n2o concentrations were immediately detected after sampling using a gas chromatography gc Î¼ecd agilent 4890d usa with a precision of 2 8 one reference gas was measured per six samples n2o flux was calculated using the linear regression of the concentration of the n2o in the chamber headspace to a function of time at the air temperature of the chamber headspace the r 2 values derived from the linear regression exceeded 0 90 2 8 statistical analysis the cell specific rate was calculated by dividing microbial activity by the abundance of corresponding functional genes assuming that i all cells were active and had equal activity levels and that ii all cells had a unique targeting functional gene copy except for aob with an average 2 5 copies per cell jia et al 2009 the resulting data were presented as mean value standard deviation s d pearson s correlation analysis analysis of variance anova and t test analyses were computed using spss software 22 0 for windows spss inc usa the coefficient of variation cv was used to evaluate the variations of anammox bacterial abundance redundancy analysis rda was used to investigate the relationship among the rate and abundance of anammox bacteria and the environmental factors the results were plotted in canoco 4

sampled soil profile in general nh4 and no3 concentrations were not significantly different between the fringe riparian zone a1 a3 and a6 and the central riparian zone a12 fig 2 higher nh4 and no3 concentrations were detected at a3 no2 showed an increasing trend from waterward to landward peaking in the central riparian zone due to the infiltration of lake water containing high oxygen levels 5 mg l 1 the do saturation in subsurface groundwater decreased from the fringe riparian zone 28 06 5 86 at a1 to the central riparian zone 20 57 6 17 at a12 in contrast the vertical distribution from the surface to the subsurface showed that nh4 no2 no3 and tn concentrations were higher in the surface soils 0 20 cm and rapidly decreased with depth anova p 0 05 fig 2 the do saturation in subsurface groundwater also showed a decreasing trend the tom level in the saturated layer soil 4 89 1 00 was lower than in the surface soils above the water level 5 54 1 08 3 2 abundance and activity of anammox damo and denitrifiers the anammox bacteria specific hydrazine synthase hzsb gene was investigated in the top 100 cm of soil from the riparian zone all samples above the groundwater level 40 5 cm depth showed negative results with a detection limit of approximately 103 gene copies g 1 dry soil fig 3 below the groundwater level 40 100 cm depth qpcr assays showed that the abundance of anammox bacteria ranged from 1 75 107 to 6 10 107 copies g 1 0 04 0 62 of the total bacterial 16 s rrna gene in the central riparian zone the abundance of anammox bacteria varied more significantly throughout the soil profile coefficient of variance cv 35 4 fig 3d however the other samples collected from the fringe riparian zone near the lake a1 a3 and a6 fig 3a b and c showed little variation cv 6 1 15 3 the 15n tracing technique fig 3 showed that anammox activity was absent above the groundwater table at 40 cm depth which is consistent with the results based on molecular techniques below the groundwater table anammox activity was detected and ranged from 0 010 0 001 to 0 220 0 001 nmol n g 1 h 1 across all vertical profiles the activity was consistently lowest in the 40 60 cm layer contributing 5 4 23 5 to n loss both anammox activity and its contribution to n loss increased with depth accounting for up to 63 9 furthermore the anammox activity in the central riparian zone was significantly lower than in the three samples collected from the fringe riparian zone independent samples t test t 2 652 df 15 141 p 0 018 the highest anammox activity 0 098 0 047 to 0 220 0 001 nmol n g 1 h 1 was detected at a3 which is consistent with nh4 and no3 distributions these results further showed that anammox plays an important role in n loss in subsurface saturated soil horizons especially in deeper layers in contrast the contributions of anammox were negligible or even absent above the groundwater table in addition pearson correlation analysis showed that neither anammox abundance nor activity were significantly correlated with any physicochemical parameter however the maximal correlation coefficients were all obtained with nox abundance vs no3 r 0 611 p 0 108 and activity vs no2 r 0 635 p 0 091 and no3 r 0 503 p 0 204 table s5 thus nox may be the key factor for controlling the contribution of anammox to n loss in water saturated soils the results of the qpcr assay indicate that both denitrifier nirs and nirk gene copies peaked in the surface soil and decreased with depth the nirs gene copy ranged from 5 30 0 15 106 to 4 17 0 56 107 copies g 1 supplying approximately 0 03 0 40 of the total bacteria nirk ranged from 1 75 0 65 107 to 6 10 0 13 107 copies g 1 which was 0 1 1 4 of the total bacterial abundance in general nirk was consistently higher than nirs at all depths in all tested samples furthermore the average abundances of the nirk and nirs genes were higher in the fringe riparian zone than in the central riparian zone denitrification measured using the 15n tracer method fig 3 was detected in every layer of all samples ranging from 0 012 0 015 to 0 622 0 071 nmol n g 1 h 1 the highest denitrification levels were observed in surface soil samples which decreased with depth denitrification was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of denitrifying genes r 0 855 p 0 001 n 20 furthermore denitrification activity in the central riparian zone was significantly and consistently lower than in the fringe riparian zone anova f 3 671 df 3 p 0 022 with the highest level at a3 p 0 001 fig 3c based on the 13ch4 tracer approach no 13co2 was detected from methane in any of the tested samples even after 26 days of incubation this indicates little to no damo activity which was consistent with the results of molecular analysis where no damo bacterial 16 s rrna and functional genes were detected the specific anammox cellular activity in subsurface saturated soil horizons ranged from 0 005 to 0 168 fmol n cell 1 d 1 fig s2 in contrast cell specific denitrifying activity ranged from 0 012 to 0 122 fmol n cell 1 d 1 in the central riparian zone the cell specific activity of anammox and denitrification were both lower than in the fringe riparian zone especially for the cell specific activity of anammox independent samples t test t 2 866 df 14 701 p 0 012 moreover the cell specific denitrifying rate decreased with depth in contrast to the cell specific anammox rate which also exceeded the denitrification rates the cell specific activities indicate that denitrifiers were more active in water unsaturated soil horizons than in water saturated soils whereas anammox bacteria were more active in saturated soil horizons than in unsaturated soils 3 3 intraspecific microbial characteristic of anammox bacteria high throughput sequencing and molecular ecological network analysis were used to explore the anammox community in the saturated soil layers 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm depths here anammox could play an important role in n loss a total of 77 otus were clustered from a total 298 362 effective sequences these otus belonged to four major anammox genera including candidatus brocadia ca b fulgida 62 2 ca b anammoxidans 34 1 ca jettenia sp 3 5 ca kuenenia sp 0 2 and ca scalindua sp 0 07 fig 4 a fig s3 table s6 the dominant ca brocadia also formed an important link among anammox taxa both in the fringe and center of the riparian zone but it contained different species ca b fulgida otu 75 was the key species in the riparian center while ca b anammoxidans otu 29 was the key species in the fringe zone fig 4 b furthermore rda analysis showed that anammox activity was significantly correlated with ca kuenenia pearson s r 0 714 p 0 047 and ca scalindua r 0 810 p 0 015 and negatively associated with the total anammox abundance r 0 429 p 0 289 and ca brocadia r 0 437 p 0 279 n 8 fig 4c table s5 thus anammox activity in the oxic saturated soil horizons was not necessarily driven by total anammox abundance or by dominant groups but rather by key taxa such as ca kuenenia 3 4 interspecific microbial mechanisms of anammox with other n cycle processes the biogeochemical mechanisms of the n cycle in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons 80 100 cm deep were also investigated here anammox dominated the n loss over denitrification nitrite removing and nitrite producing activities were measured because nitrite has previously been assumed as the key substrate for anammox bacteria fig 5 for no2 producing pathways nh4 oxidation occurred at high rates 3 34 8 45 nmol n g 1 h 1 which was significantly higher than no3 reduction 2 05 2 85 nmol n g 1 h 1 this indicates that the no2 required for anammox and denitrification was mainly provided by nh4 oxidation 54 0 80 4 rather than by no3 reduction for no2 removing processes the no2 oxidation rate was significantly lower than that of the nh4 oxidation rate paired sample t test t 5 737 df 3 p 0 011 the other two no2 removing processes denitrification and anammox were both lower compared to the other processes that produce no2 the total fluxes of no2 production 6 20 10 51 nmol n g 1 h 1 were significantly higher than those of no2 removal 2 47 4 91 nmol n g 1 h 1 in all samples paired sample t test t 10 090 df 3 p 0 002 this suggests that other no2 removing processes may be occurring in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons the dnra rate ranged from 1 50 to 3 11 nmol n g 1 h 1 dnra contributed to approximately 51 0 68 4 of the no2 removing processes followed by no2 oxidation 22 7 46 1 denitrification 0 5 4 0 and anammox 0 9 4 8 dnra and nh4 oxidation activities were also higher in the fringe riparian zone than in the central riparian zone which is consistent with the anammox activity fig 5 at the same time dnra was coupled with high nh4 oxidation activity which provides a significant proportion of the nh4 required for anammox the abundance of dnra and nh4 oxidation related microbes were quantified using qpcr fig 5 here cell number based on gene copy number and activity were used to calculate the cell specific activity table s4 the cell specific activity for dnra ranged from 0 38 to 4 56 fmol n cell 1 d 1 while the cell specific activity of ammonium oxidizers aoa aob ranged from 0 32 to 1 75 fmol n cell 1 d 1 cell specific activities for both dnra and nh4 oxidizers aoa aob in the fringe riparian zone all exceeded the activities in the central riparian zone and were highest at a3 this result was consistent with the obtained anammox distribution clone analysis further assessed the community composition of dnra bacteria symbiotic nitrifiers and anammox bacteria fig s4 for dnra bacteria clone sequences of nrfa gene fragments from the fringe riparian zone clustered with anaerolinea anaeromyxobacteraceae polyangiaceae and myxococcaceae the genera anaeromyxobacteraceae myxococcaceae and polyangiaceae all belonging to myxobacteria delta proteobacteria within the order myxobacteria myxococcaceae and polyangiaceae were identified as aerobic microbes and only anaeromyxobacteraceae was anaerobic sanford et al 2002 the central riparian zone only had anaerolinea which is an anaerobic organism that belongs to the phylum chloroflexi for aoa the entire archaeal amoa gene was most similar to the nitrososphaera cluster belonging to the group 1 1b lineage while nitrosospira was associated with aob 3 5 ecological significance of anammox and n2o emission with water level fluctuation the temporal variability and ecological significance of denitrification and anammox in soils of the riparian zone were investigated in relation to the fluctuation of n2o emission before and after the change of the groundwater level range of 50 60 cm depth in 2015 to 20 30 cm depth in 2017 anammox was also observed to occur after the water level had increased 30 cm depth and its distribution trend in each layer was similar to before the increase in water level fig s5 however the measured potential anammox rate increased significantly compared to before the change of water level paired sample t test t 3 984 df 19 p 0 001 based on soil bulk density and microbial activities the depth integrated anammox and denitrification rates in the soil core were calculated table s7 the anammox and denitrification rates and the contribution of anammox to n loss in the fringe riparian zone all exceeded the activities in the central riparian zone and were consistently highest at a3 before the rise of groundwater level the depth integrated anammox rate ranged within 0 29 3 27 mmol n m 2 d 1 and contributed 10 2 22 5 to the total n loss table s7 this rate was significantly lower than the depth integrated denitrification rate 2 52 11 22 mmol n m 2 d 1 paired sample t test t 4 169 df 3 p 0 025 table s7 the depth integrated anammox rates however increased to 0 62 8 78 mmol n m 2 d 1 after the rise of groundwater level the contribution ratio of anammox to n loss significantly increased to 22 7 52 3 paired sample t test t 5 846 df 3 p 0 010 the highest depth integrated anammox rate was observed at a3 in the fringe zone after the water table increased resulting in the highest contribution of 52 3 to total n loss furthermore n2o fluxes were measured at a high level of 13 2 8 2 mg n m 2 h 1 n 24 in 2015 before the change of water level which was significantly higher in the fringe 22 0 8 2 mg n m 2 h 1 at a1 n 18 than in the central riparian zone 7 2 4 0 mg n m 2 h 1 at a12 n 6 paired sample t test t 5 666 df 5 p 0 030 fig 6 after the groundwater level increased in 2017 the average n2o emission gradually decreased with increasing distance from the water in the fringe riparian zone 11 9 4 2 mg n m 2 h 1 at a1 n 6 to the central riparian zone 4 5 2 5 mg n m 2 h 1 at a12 n 6 the average n2o emission significantly decreased by about 39 3 10 6 to 7 5 4 0 mg n m 2 h 1 n 24 based on these results the change of the water level influenced the relative contribution of n loss processes in the riparian zone and shifted denitrification to anammox plus denitrification with a potential reduction of n2o emissions 4 discussion this study on riparian zones which are hotspots for n2o emissions provides new information on the role of microbes in n cycling wetland management global change and n2o reduction hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 groffman et al 2000 van den heuvel 2010 archaeal and bacterial ammonium oxidation and dnra with high cell specific rates drove anammox activity even in oxic subsurface horizons furthermore water tables in riparian ecotones can be managed and optimized to stimulate n loss and no3 reduction by shifting denitrification to anammox without the threat to increase greenhouse gas emissions however several uncertainties remain for more than two decades anammox was generally assumed to only occur in anaerobic environments jetten et al 1998 however this study showed that anammox actually occurred in all water saturated soil horizons with high oxygen levels 25 65 oxygen saturation this high do could be the result of wetland plants whose reed roots release high levels of oxygen up to 5 7 l m 2 d 1 brix et al 1996 approximately 60 of the reed root volume is distributed below a depth of 40 cm wang and yin 2008 allowing the release of more oxygen into the saturated soil layers moreover since the lake water has a do above 5 mg l 1 its penetration and fluctuation could have maintained aerobic conditions in the saturated riparian soil do 2 mg l 1 however due to large quantities of organic matter and oxygen consuming microorganisms in the soil the soil created an aerobic anoxic anaerobic micro environment which favors anammox bacteria ramakrishnan et al 2000 smith et al 2014 this observation was consistent with the results of anammox zoogloea granular activated sludge with various particle sizes 1 0 6 4 mm in different bioreactors e g the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite canon process third et al 2001 vÃ¡zquez padÃ­n et al 2011 figueroa et al 2012 our previous study on municipal wastewater treatment also demonstrated that anammox can occur under aerobic conditions do 3 mg l 1 wang et al 2015 despite this observation the activity levels of anammox were lower 0 01 0 22 nmol n g 1 h 1 compared to the activity levels of lake sediments 0 1 12 6 nmol n g 1 h 1 zhu et al 2013a b river sediments 0 07 1 2 nmol n g 1 h 1 wang et al 2012a b and paddy field soils 0 27 5 25 nmol n g 1 h 1 yang et al 2015 0 15 0 77 nmol n g 1 h 1 shan et al 2016 moreover anammox activity did not directly correlate with anammox bacterial abundance resulting in a lower cell specific rate 0 005 0 168 fmol n cell 1 d 1 compared to previous studies 5 18 fmol n cell 1 d 1 hou et al 2013 9 5 36 2 fmol n cell 1 d 1 shen et al 2014 anammox rates correlated strongly with the abundances of specific anammox species for example both hts analysis and rda showed that the anammox rate was positively correlated with the relative abundance of kuenenia and negatively correlated with ca brocadia b fulgida and b anammoxidans previous studies reported that ca kuenenia adapt better to high do 0 6 4 mg l 1 than ca b fulgida 0 032 mg l 1 and ca b anammoxidans 2 24 mg l 1 oshiki et al 2016 therefore the high do concentration may have inhibited ca brocadia activity but not that of ca kuenenia despite their presence in low abundances with a finite cell specific rate anammox bacteria ca kuenenia facilitated low anammox activity in aerobic subsurface saturated soil horizons twenty years ago dnra was assumed to be negligible in most subsurface environments tiedje et al 1982 in this study dnra activity was 10 times higher than the activities of anammox and denitrification with consistent community in subsurface saturated soil horizons moreover dnra was responsible for 88 93 of dissimilatory no3 reduction previous studies showed that the dnra rates in various soils significantly correlate to tn c no3 and c n ratios risgaard petersen et al 2004 chen et al 2015 shan et al 2016 usually dnra is considered advantageous over denitrification in no3 limiting conditions since the high c n or no3 ratios stimulate dnra bacteria to utilize electron acceptors i e no3 more efficiently when the c source is abundant tiedje et al 1982 jÃ¸rgensen et al 1989 kraft et al 2014 in this study the no3 levels were in the same range of the reported value 0 8 2 3 mg kg 1 while the c n ratios 25 30 were comparatively higher among the different soils 10 18 shan et al 2016 rysgaard et al 1996 this would promote high dnra partitioning over denitrification in subsurface saturated soil horizons in addition analysis of the dnra nrfa gene fragments of the fringe riparian zone indicated that several aerobic microbes potentially performed dnra which is consistent with recent research results during the last years several studies reported dnra under different oxygenic conditions including slurry intact cores and water columns with more than 80 of oxygen saturation levels roberts et al 2014 song et al 2014 bonaglia et al 2016 moreover the cell specific activity of aerobic subsurface saturated soil 0 38 4 56 fmol n cell 1 d 1 was also higher than previously reported for anoxic estuarine sediments 0 22 0 23 fmol n cell 1 d 1 song et al 2014 recently a number of studies have reported dnra as an important intermediate process of n cycling in the oceanic ecosystem lam et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 the terrestrial aquatic ecosystem wang et al 2018 and soil systems shan et al 2016 zhu et al 2018a b c anammox coupled with dnra plays a strong role in n loss in marine ecosystems such as in the arabian sea jensen et al 2011 the benguela upwelling system kuypers et al 2005 and the black sea lam et al 2009 dnra provides the necessary nh4 for anammox in these nh4 limiting environments however the mechanisms underlying this coupling of anammox dnra processes in riparian subsurface saturated soils horizons differ from those in the marine ecosystem since nh4 was not the limiting factor in the present study the no2 generation by ammonium oxidation 3 3 8 4 nmol n g 1 h 1 was much higher than the no2 consumption by anammox 0 03 0 19 nmol n g 1 h 1 and denitrification 0 09 0 23 nmol n g 1 h 1 under oxic conditions ammonium oxidation produced a no2 surplus for anammox and denitrification the accumulation of which could exert toxic effects on microbial growth bollag et al 1978 moreover a large amount of nh4 was aerobically oxidized leading to less availability for anammox in this study dnra activity was comparable to that of ammonium oxidation and reduced the surplus no2 and eliminated toxic inhibition at the same time dnra also provided the necessary nh4 substrate required for anammox hence based on these results we propose that the coupling of anammox with ammonium oxidation and dnra promoted the high n loss observed in subsurface saturated soil horizons measurement of in situ flux further indicated that n2o flux decreased following an increase in the groundwater level which is associated with a shift from denitrification to anammox as the dominant n loss pathway this verified previous results suggesting that the ecological effect of n2o mitigation can be attributed to anammox our previous studies of the riparian zone in the three gorges reservoir water level fluctuating 145 175 m above sea level twice per year showed that n2o fluxes at the soil water interface during the flooding period were lower than during the non flooding period along with an increase of the abundance of anammox bacteria zhu et al 2015 that study only reported the data on anammox abundance but not on its activity the present study verified the possible n2o mitigation effect of anammox by obtaining information on bacterial abundance activity and the depth integrated rate calculation of anammox other natural factors such as microbial nitrification hydrologic conditions water quality gradients and plants among others could also affect n2o emissions when the conditions change from flooding to non flooding hernandez and mitsch 2006 santoro et al 2011 previous studies showed that the contribution of nitrifier denitrification to n2o release gradually decreased with increasing water levels and do kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013a b this suggests heterotrophic denitrification as the main microbial process producing n2o in this study previous studies which included both process and mechanistic analyses have clearly shown that substantial anammox activity could mitigate undesirable n2o emissions kartal et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 2013a b this n2o mitigation should be attributed to a shift in the dominance of the n loss pathway from a denitrification to an anammox process where anammox bacteria directly oxidized nh4 with no2 to n2 without n2o emissions this suggests that the sites that experience substantial n loss via the anammox process will have lower n2o fluxes than sites that are dominated by denitrification in the field of wetland ecology this result also provides a suggestion for the currently applied management practices in comparison to historical and less anthropogenically influenced systems riparian zones known as productive n cycle ecosystems are important n2o sources that use denitrification as the main contributor hefting et al 2003 wang et al 2012a b this study clearly demonstrated that vertically in the riparian zone denitrification with potential n2o emission dominated the cumulative n losses in the upper unsaturated layers while anammox activity was higher in lower saturated soil horizons moreover contribution of anammox to n loss after increasing water level also increased accompanied by a decrease of n2o emission this result provides valuable information for a more effective riparian environmental management anthropologically induced environmental changes i e groundwater table modification are expected to increase in the future and further change the relative contribution of n loss from denitrification to the more environmentally friendly anammox pathway this could significantly impact the cumulative n budget at a given location thus bridging global change and local management practices 5 conclusions this study investigated the distribution biogeochemistry and microbial mechanisms of denitrification anammox damo and dnra in different riparian soil horizons and quantified the contribution of these microbial processes to n cycle nitrate removal and mitigation of n2o emission the following conclusions can be drawn from this study anammox bacteria were only detected in subsurface saturated soil horizons its activity and contribution to n loss increased with depth in contrast denitrification was observed in every layer of all sampling sites however its abundance and activity decreased with depth little to no damo was observed in the same layers denitrification dominated the n losses in the upper unsaturated soil while anammox dominated in subsurface saturated soil horizons in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons the dominant ca brocadia ca b fulgida 62 2 center and ca b anammoxidans 34 1 fringe also formed an important link between anammox taxa in the riparian center and fringe zone respectively the key substrate no2 for both anammox and denitrification was mainly supplied by nh4 oxidation 54 0 80 4 and dnra 51 0 68 4 consumed a significant proportion of the nh4 required for anammox in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons after the increase of the groundwater level the depth integrated anammox rates increased to 0 62 8 78 mmol n m 2 d 1 and the role to n loss significantly increased up to 52 3 as a result the average n2o emission was significantly decreased by 39 3

18639,fertilized agroecosystems may show considerable leaching of the mobile nitrogen n compound no3 which pollutes groundwater and causes eutrophication of downstream waterbodies riparian buffer zones positioned between terrestrial and aquatic environments effectively remove no3 and serve as a hotspot for n2o emissions however microbial processes governing no3 reduction in riparian zones still remain largely unclear this study explored the underlying mechanisms of various n loss processes in riparian soil horizons using isotopic tracing techniques molecular assays and high throughput sequencing both anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and denitrification activity were maximized in the riparian fringe rather than in the central zones denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo process was not detected interestingly both contrasting microbial habitats were separated by a groundwater table which forms an important biogeochemical interface denitrification dominated cumulative n losses in the upper unsaturated soil while anammox dominated the lower oxic saturated soil horizons archaeal and bacterial ammonium oxidation that couple dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra with a high cell specific rate promoted anammox even further in oxic subsurface horizons high throughput sequencing and network analysis showed that the anammox rate positively correlated with candidatus kuenenia 4 rather than with the dominant candidatus brocadia the contribution to n loss via anammox increased significantly with the water level which was accompanied by a significant reduction of n2o emission 39 3 10 6 since n loss by anammox does not cause n2o emissions hence water table management in riparian ecotones can be optimized to reduce no3 pollution by shifting from denitrification to the environmentally friendly anammox pathway to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox microbial n loss riparian zone water saturated soil horizon n2o emission 1 introduction nutrient loading of terrestrial freshwater and coastal ecosystems has been occurring on a global scale which is mainly driven by agricultural activities verhoeven et al 2006 technological purification has been shown to be the best choice for the reduction of nutrient fluxes into the environment however nutrient loading as a result of intensive agricultural practices is typically diffuse or originates from non point sources which makes it hard to address the issue technologically riparian zones form the interface areas between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems and have been shown to efficiently prevent pollutant movement from upland areas into streams wang et al 2002 hefting et al 2006 specifically riparian zones serve as sinks for nitrate no3 which is the most common groundwater pollutant and a precursor to nitrous oxide n2o groffman et al 2002 hefting et al 2004 microbe driven n reduction processes are key for the creation of no3 sinks in riparian zones it was previously assumed that microbial heterotrophic denitrification was the main no3 removal pathway for nitrogen gas n2 to the atmosphere burgin and hamilton 2007 however the discovery of both anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo greatly changed this assumption over the past 20 years n cycle studies have been conducted for the last 100 years however knowledge about the complexity of the underlying process remains limited this is particularly true for riparian zones due to their high heterogeneity denitrification has been one of the most studied processes for the reduction of no3 to n2 traditionally denitrification has been assumed to only take place under anoxic and anaerobic conditions however recently reported evidence indicated that denitrification also happens under oxic conditions gao et al 2010 marchant et al 2017 specifically anammox could be an alternative n loss pathway to denitrification which is performed by autotrophic anammox bacteria that directly oxidize nh4 with no2 to n2 without emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o over the past 20 years anammox was widely reported in marine devol 2015 freshwater zhu et al 2015 estuary naeher et al 2015 groundwater smith et al 2015 wang et al 2017 paddy field nie et al 2015 shan et al 2016 and man made ecosystems wang et al 2015 these studies have identified anammox as a significant contributor to n loss moreover in a number of aerobic environments of artificial ecosystems aerobic anoxic anaerobic micro environments can form thus allowing anammox to increase third et al 2001 vÃ¡zquez padÃ­n et al 2011 figueroa et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the complexities of the n cycle were further studied which led to the discovery of the damo process where methane ch4 is used as electron donor to reduce no2 or no3 anaerobically mediated by the bacteria methylomirabilis and or the archaea methanoperedens raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 the damo process links the biogeochemical c and n cycles in a novel way and has been shown to operate in both inland water and wetland ecosystems deutzmann and schink 2011 deutzmann et al 2014 hu et al 2014 these reports significantly promoted the understanding of the global n cycle dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra which is a further no3 reduction process also uses no3 and no2 as substrates under anoxic anaerobic conditions in contrast to denitrification anammox and damo dnra reduces no3 to nh4 instead of n2 dnra is typically considered to be only significant in peripheral environments analogous to dnra several studies also reported high activity of aerobic dnra bacteria even if o2 saturation exceeded 80 shan et al 2016 roberts et al 2014 in these microbe mediated no3 reduction processes nh4 is generated by dnra as an end product which is then used as a substrate for anammox subsequently nh4 is oxidized to no3 by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob thus allowing the recycling of substrates necessary for these microbial processes the symbiotic and competitive mechanisms among denitrification anammox damo and dnra demonstrate the complexity of the n cycle especially in riparian zones overall the discovery of novel microbe mediated n transfer mechanisms with new taxa and functions challenge existing knowledge about the n cycle and spatiotemporal variations in riparian zones this limited understanding warrants further research to better understand the underlying biogeochemical processes in riparian soil profiles the zone around the groundwater table has been identified as an important hotspot for biogeochemical cycles naiman and dÃ©camps 1997 mcclain et al 2003 hancock et al 2005 naeher et al 2015 fluctuations of the groundwater table control water saturation and redox conditions in wetland soils which then drive n cycling and the involved differences in microbial rates hefting et al 2004 in general saturated soils below the groundwater table contain lower oxygen concentrations compared to upper unsaturated soils in a number of riparian zones along lakes however surface water can infiltrate the underlying soil this results in the oxygenation of the saturated soil with groundwater which leads to high oxygen content and long retention times since the organic matter content is lower in deeper soil horizons n loss is predominantly driven by more dominant autotrophic microbial processes zhu et al 2018a in contrast in soil horizons above the groundwater table n loss is dominated by heterotrophic processes due to an increase of organic matter from the litter layer root exudates and microbial residues wang et al 2012a b hefting et al 2004 2006 based on previous studies on microbial n cycles in wetland ecosystems hefting et al 2004 wang et al 2012a b zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2011 2013a b this study proposes that heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic anammox and damo have different degrees of contribution to n loss of riparian zone profiles above and below the groundwater table moreover increased anammox with n loss is accompanied by decreased n2o emissions since n loss via anammox does not lead to n2o emission given this background the objectives of present study are i to explore the distribution and biogeochemistry of denitrification anammox dnra and damo processes in water saturated and water unsaturated riparian soil horizons furthermore to quantify the contribution of each microbial process to the overall n loss no3 removal and mitigation of n2o emission ii to investigate the underlying mechanisms and to provide a complete overview of the nitrite producing or removing processes related to anammox using

of north china with well developed riparian zones that are an anammox hotspot zhu et al 2013a b increasing sewage and wastewater influx from an upstream city and agricultural runoff led to the eutrophication of the lake the lake baiyangdian group consists of approximately 140 lakes with a total area of 366 km2 at a water level of 10 5 m above the sea level and a water depth of 2 m on

similar to in situ conditions 5 standard deviation the residual n compounds of the resulting slurries were input to correct the initial ratios of 14n 15n r 14 in related incubation vials risgaard petersen et al 2004 trimmer et al 2006 wang et al 2018 the rates of n cycling processes were determined by adding 15n amended ammonium and no3 na15no3 99 19 15n 15nh4 2so4 99 16 and na15no2 98 17 final concentrations ranged from 5 to 10 of the initial background concentration which minimized over or under estimation of the potential rate the natural abundance of 15n in the soil was very low especially compared to the 15n amended additional substrates therefore all initial n compounds were assumed to be 14n based on isotopic calculation nielsen 1992 trimmer et al 2006 wang et al 2018 three parallel assays were conducted for each sample and each treatment following previously described protocols with modifications granger and sigman 2009 fÃ¼ssel et al 2012 wang et al 2018 zhu et al

with 15nh4 and 14no3 29n2 had accumulated due to anammox production this was used to calculate the anammox process in every soil layer however slurries amended solely with 15no3 produced all of the 15n amended n2 29n2 29n2 and 30n2 while denitrification was the only source of 30n2 both treatments were used to calculate the relevant denitrification processes the ammonium oxidation rate was measured as the production rate of 15no2 from 15nh4 under oxic conditions a known quantity of the 15nh4 stock solution was injected to 5 9 8 7 Î¼m and the ratios of 14nh4 15nh4 were calculated incubations were terminated at each time point 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h to assess the 15no2 yield 16 5 mm final concentration of sulfamic acid was added to completely reduce 15no2 to 29n2 granger

was calculated for the final rate correlation at each time point 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h the reaction was stopped by adding hypobromite with a final concentration equaling that of 15no2 followed by 12 h of incubation to completely convert the produced 15nh4 to 30n2 lam et al 2009 fÃ¼ssel et al 2012 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a b c the produced 30n2 was then used to calculate the dnra rates with the corrected ratio of 14no2 15no2 the no3 reduction rate was measured by adding 100 Î¼l of diluted 15no3 stock solution to a final 4 2 6 7 Î¼m and then 100 Î¼l of saturated mercuric chloride were injected to terminate the reaction at each time point 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h then 16 5 mm final concentration of sulfamic acid was added and incubated for more than 12 h to completely reduce 15no2 to 29n2 granger and sigman 2009 fÃ¼ssel et al 2012 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a b c this was then used to calculate the no3 reduction rates using the actual ratio of 14no3 15no3 atmospheric air was used to generate both standard curve and reference air which were measured together with the incubations of soil samples risgaard petersen et al 2004 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a b c several glass vials 12 ml volume exetainer labco uk were filled with demineralized water without headspace and equilibrated with atmospheric air at in situ temperature subsequently 8 ml of the water was removed and replaced with high purity he 99 9 then 0 30 60 90 and 120 Î¼l of air were injected into the standard curve vials respectively all glass vials were shaken for at least 1 min to achieve equilibrium between water and headspace standard curves were used to linear regress the total signal versus the yield of each 15n n2 then the concentrations of the produced 15n n2 in

n2o emission flux was measured using the closed chamber technique with triplicate chambers for each sampling test wang et al 2006 the stainless steel chambers consisted of a pedestal and an upper chamber the bottom rim of the pedestal was pushed into the soil and the top rim was filled with water thus creating an airtight seal the upper chamber was equipped with brushless fans driven by two batteries to mix the chamber headspace a temperature probe reported the real time air temperature of the chamber headspace n2o concentrations were immediately detected after sampling using a gas chromatography gc Î¼ecd agilent 4890d usa with a precision of 2 8 one reference gas was measured per six samples n2o flux was calculated using the linear regression of the concentration of the n2o in

analysis analysis of variance anova and t test analyses were computed using spss software 22 0 for windows spss inc usa the coefficient of variation cv was used to evaluate the variations of anammox bacterial abundance redundancy analysis rda was used to investigate the relationship among the rate and abundance of anammox bacteria and the environmental factors the results were plotted in canoco 4

sampled soil profile in general nh4 and no3 concentrations were not significantly different between the fringe riparian zone a1 a3 and a6 and the central riparian zone a12 fig 2 higher nh4 and no3 concentrations were detected at a3 no2 showed an increasing trend from waterward to landward peaking in the central riparian zone due to the infiltration of lake water containing high oxygen levels 5 mg l 1 the do saturation in subsurface groundwater decreased from the fringe riparian zone 28 06 5 86 at a1 to the central riparian zone 20 57 6 17 at a12 in contrast the vertical distribution from the surface to the subsurface showed that nh4 no2 no3 and tn concentrations were higher in the surface soils 0 20 cm and rapidly decreased with depth anova p 0 05 fig 2 the do saturation in subsurface groundwater also showed a decreasing trend the tom level in the saturated layer soil 4 89 1 00 was lower than in the surface soils above the water level 5 54 1 08 3 2 abundance and activity of anammox damo and denitrifiers the anammox bacteria specific hydrazine synthase hzsb gene was investigated in the top 100 cm of soil from the riparian zone all samples above the groundwater level 40 5 cm depth showed negative results with a detection limit of approximately 103 gene copies g 1 dry soil fig 3 below the groundwater level 40 100 cm depth qpcr assays showed that the abundance of anammox bacteria ranged from 1 75 107 to 6 10 107 copies g 1 0 04 0 62 of the total bacterial 16 s rrna gene in the central riparian zone the abundance of anammox bacteria varied more significantly throughout the soil profile coefficient of variance cv 35 4 fig 3d however the other samples collected from the fringe riparian zone near the lake a1 a3 and a6 fig 3a b and c showed little variation cv 6 1 15 3 the 15n tracing technique fig 3 showed that anammox activity was absent above the groundwater table at 40 cm depth which is consistent with the results based on molecular techniques below the groundwater table anammox activity was detected and ranged from 0 010 0 001 to 0 220 0 001 nmol n g 1 h 1 across all vertical profiles the activity was consistently lowest in the 40 60 cm layer contributing 5 4 23 5 to n loss both anammox activity and its contribution to n loss increased with depth accounting for up to 63 9 furthermore the anammox activity in the central riparian zone was significantly lower than in the three samples collected from the fringe riparian zone independent samples t test t 2 652 df 15 141 p 0 018 the highest anammox activity 0 098 0 047 to 0 220 0 001 nmol n g 1 h 1 was detected at a3 which is consistent with nh4 and no3 distributions these results further showed that anammox plays an important role in n loss in subsurface saturated soil horizons especially in deeper layers in contrast the contributions of anammox were negligible or even absent above the groundwater table in addition pearson correlation analysis showed that neither anammox abundance nor activity were significantly correlated with any physicochemical parameter however the maximal correlation coefficients were all obtained with nox abundance vs no3 r 0 611 p 0 108 and activity vs no2 r 0 635 p 0 091 and no3 r 0 503 p 0 204 table s5 thus nox may be the key factor for controlling the contribution of anammox to n loss in water saturated soils the results of the qpcr assay indicate that both denitrifier nirs and nirk gene copies peaked in the surface soil and decreased with depth the nirs gene copy ranged from 5 30 0 15 106 to 4 17 0 56 107 copies g 1 supplying approximately 0 03 0 40 of the total bacteria nirk ranged from 1 75 0 65 107 to 6 10 0 13 107 copies g 1 which was 0 1 1 4 of the total bacterial abundance in general nirk was consistently higher than nirs at all depths in all tested samples furthermore the average abundances of the nirk and nirs genes were higher in the fringe riparian zone than in the central riparian zone denitrification measured using the 15n tracer method fig 3 was detected in every layer of all samples ranging from 0 012 0 015 to 0 622 0 071 nmol n g 1 h 1 the highest denitrification levels were observed in surface soil samples which decreased with depth denitrification was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of denitrifying genes r 0 855 p 0 001 n 20 furthermore denitrification activity in the central riparian zone was significantly and consistently lower than in the fringe riparian zone anova f 3 671 df 3 p 0 022 with the highest level at a3 p 0 001 fig 3c based on the 13ch4 tracer approach no 13co2 was detected from methane in any of the tested samples even after 26 days of incubation this indicates little to no damo activity which was consistent with the results of molecular analysis where no damo bacterial 16 s rrna and functional genes were detected the specific anammox cellular activity in subsurface saturated soil horizons ranged from 0 005 to 0 168 fmol n cell 1 d 1 fig s2 in contrast cell specific denitrifying activity ranged from 0 012 to 0 122 fmol n cell 1 d 1 in the central riparian zone the cell specific activity of anammox and denitrification were both lower than in the fringe riparian zone especially for the cell specific activity of anammox independent samples t test t 2 866 df 14 701 p 0 012 moreover the cell specific denitrifying rate decreased with depth in contrast to the cell specific anammox rate which also exceeded the denitrification rates the cell specific activities indicate that denitrifiers were more active in water unsaturated soil horizons than in water saturated soils whereas anammox bacteria were more active in saturated soil horizons than in unsaturated soils 3 3 intraspecific microbial characteristic of anammox bacteria high throughput sequencing and molecular ecological network analysis were used to explore the anammox community in the saturated soil layers 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm depths here anammox could play an important role in n loss a total of 77 otus were clustered from a total 298 362 effective sequences these otus belonged to four major anammox genera including candidatus brocadia ca b fulgida 62 2 ca b anammoxidans 34 1 ca jettenia sp 3 5 ca kuenenia sp 0 2 and ca scalindua sp 0 07 fig 4 a fig s3 table s6 the dominant ca brocadia also formed an important link among anammox taxa both in the fringe and center of the riparian zone but it contained different species ca b fulgida otu 75 was the key species in the riparian center while ca b anammoxidans otu 29 was the key species in the fringe zone fig 4 b furthermore rda analysis showed that anammox activity was significantly correlated with ca kuenenia pearson s r 0 714 p 0 047 and ca scalindua r 0 810 p 0 015 and negatively associated with the total anammox abundance r 0 429 p 0 289 and ca brocadia r 0 437 p 0 279 n 8 fig 4c table s5 thus anammox activity in the oxic saturated soil horizons was not necessarily driven by total anammox abundance or by dominant groups but rather by key taxa such as ca kuenenia 3 4 interspecific microbial mechanisms of anammox with other n cycle processes the biogeochemical mechanisms of the n cycle in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons 80 100 cm deep were also investigated here anammox dominated the n loss over denitrification nitrite removing and nitrite producing activities were measured because nitrite has previously been assumed as the key substrate for anammox bacteria fig 5 for no2 producing pathways nh4 oxidation occurred at high rates 3 34 8 45 nmol n g 1 h 1 which was significantly higher than no3 reduction 2 05 2 85 nmol n g 1 h 1 this indicates that the no2 required for anammox and denitrification was mainly provided by nh4 oxidation 54 0 80 4 rather than by no3 reduction for no2 removing processes the no2 oxidation rate was significantly lower than that of the nh4 oxidation rate paired sample t test t 5 737 df 3 p 0 011 the other two no2 removing processes denitrification and anammox were both lower compared to the other processes that produce no2 the total fluxes of no2 production 6 20 10 51 nmol n g 1 h 1 were significantly higher than those of no2 removal 2 47 4 91 nmol n g 1 h 1 in all samples paired sample t test t 10 090 df 3 p 0 002 this suggests that other no2 removing processes may be occurring in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons the dnra rate ranged from 1 50 to 3 11 nmol n g 1 h 1 dnra contributed to approximately 51 0 68 4 of the no2 removing processes followed by no2 oxidation 22 7 46 1 denitrification 0 5 4 0 and anammox 0 9 4 8 dnra and nh4 oxidation activities were also higher in the fringe riparian zone than in the central riparian zone which is consistent with the anammox activity fig 5 at the same time dnra was coupled with high nh4 oxidation activity which provides a significant proportion of the nh4 required for anammox the abundance of dnra and nh4 oxidation related microbes were quantified using qpcr fig 5 here cell number based on gene copy number and activity were used to calculate the cell specific activity table s4 the cell specific activity for dnra ranged from 0 38 to 4 56 fmol n cell 1 d 1 while the cell specific activity of ammonium oxidizers aoa aob ranged from 0 32 to 1 75 fmol n cell 1 d 1 cell specific activities for both dnra and nh4 oxidizers aoa aob in the fringe riparian zone all exceeded the activities in the central riparian zone and were highest at a3 this result was consistent with the obtained anammox distribution clone analysis further assessed the community composition of dnra bacteria symbiotic nitrifiers and anammox bacteria fig s4 for dnra bacteria clone sequences of nrfa gene fragments from the fringe riparian zone clustered with anaerolinea anaeromyxobacteraceae polyangiaceae and myxococcaceae the genera anaeromyxobacteraceae myxococcaceae and polyangiaceae all belonging to myxobacteria delta proteobacteria within the order myxobacteria myxococcaceae and polyangiaceae were identified as aerobic microbes and only anaeromyxobacteraceae was anaerobic sanford et al 2002 the central riparian zone only had anaerolinea which is an anaerobic organism that belongs to the phylum chloroflexi for aoa the entire archaeal amoa gene was most similar to the nitrososphaera cluster belonging to the group 1 1b lineage while nitrosospira was associated with aob 3 5 ecological significance of anammox and n2o emission with water level fluctuation the temporal variability and ecological significance of denitrification and anammox in soils of the riparian zone were investigated in relation to the fluctuation of n2o emission before and after the change of the groundwater level range of 50 60 cm depth in 2015 to 20 30 cm depth in 2017 anammox was also observed to occur after the water level had increased 30 cm depth and its distribution trend in each layer was similar to before the increase in water level fig s5 however the measured potential anammox rate increased significantly compared to before the change of water level paired sample t test t 3 984 df 19 p 0 001 based on soil bulk density and microbial activities the depth integrated anammox and denitrification rates in the soil core were calculated table s7 the anammox and denitrification rates and the contribution of anammox to n loss in the fringe riparian zone all exceeded the activities in the central riparian zone and were consistently highest at a3 before the rise of groundwater level the depth integrated anammox rate ranged within 0 29 3 27 mmol n m 2 d 1 and contributed 10 2 22 5 to the total n loss table s7 this rate was significantly lower than the depth integrated denitrification rate 2 52 11 22 mmol n m 2 d 1 paired sample t test t 4 169 df 3 p 0 025 table s7 the depth integrated anammox rates however increased to 0 62 8 78 mmol n m 2 d 1 after the rise of groundwater level the contribution ratio of anammox to n loss significantly increased to 22 7 52 3 paired sample t test t 5 846 df 3 p 0 010 the highest depth integrated anammox rate was observed at a3 in the fringe zone after the water table increased resulting in the highest contribution of 52 3 to total n loss furthermore n2o fluxes were measured at a high level of 13 2 8 2 mg n m 2 h 1 n 24 in 2015 before the change of water level which was significantly higher in the fringe 22 0 8 2 mg n m 2 h 1 at a1 n 18 than in the central riparian zone 7 2 4 0 mg n m 2 h 1 at a12 n 6 paired sample t test t 5 666 df 5 p 0 030 fig 6 after the groundwater level increased in 2017 the average n2o emission gradually decreased with increasing distance from the water in the fringe riparian zone 11 9 4 2 mg n m 2 h 1 at a1 n 6 to the central riparian zone 4 5 2 5 mg n m 2 h 1 at a12 n 6 the average n2o emission significantly decreased by about 39 3 10 6 to 7 5 4 0 mg n m 2 h 1 n 24 based on these results the change of the water level influenced the relative contribution of n loss processes in the riparian zone and shifted denitrification to anammox plus denitrification with a potential reduction of n2o emissions 4 discussion this study on riparian zones which are hotspots for n2o emissions provides new information on the role of microbes in n cycling wetland management global change and n2o reduction hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 groffman et al 2000 van den heuvel 2010 archaeal and bacterial ammonium oxidation and dnra with high cell specific rates drove anammox activity even in oxic subsurface horizons furthermore water tables in riparian ecotones can be managed and optimized to stimulate n loss and no3 reduction by shifting denitrification to anammox without the threat to increase greenhouse gas emissions however several uncertainties remain for more than two decades anammox was generally assumed to only occur in anaerobic environments jetten et al 1998 however this study showed that anammox actually occurred in all water saturated soil horizons with high oxygen levels 25 65 oxygen saturation this high do could be the result of wetland plants whose reed roots release high levels of oxygen up to 5 7 l m 2 d 1 brix et al 1996 approximately 60 of the reed root volume is distributed below a depth of 40 cm wang and yin 2008 allowing the release of more oxygen into the saturated soil layers moreover since the lake water has a do above 5 mg l 1 its penetration and fluctuation could have maintained aerobic conditions in the saturated riparian soil do 2 mg l 1 however due to large quantities of organic matter and oxygen consuming microorganisms in the soil the soil created an aerobic anoxic anaerobic micro environment which favors anammox bacteria ramakrishnan et al 2000 smith et al 2014 this observation was consistent with the results of anammox zoogloea granular activated sludge with various particle sizes 1 0 6 4 mm in different bioreactors e g the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite canon process third et al 2001 vÃ¡zquez padÃ­n et al 2011 figueroa et al 2012 our previous study on municipal wastewater treatment also demonstrated that anammox can occur under aerobic conditions do 3 mg l 1 wang et al 2015 despite this observation the activity levels of anammox were lower 0 01 0 22 nmol n g 1 h 1 compared to the activity levels of lake sediments 0 1 12 6 nmol n g 1 h 1 zhu et al 2013a b river sediments 0 07 1 2 nmol n g 1 h 1 wang et al 2012a b and paddy field soils 0 27 5 25 nmol n g 1 h 1 yang et al 2015 0 15 0 77 nmol n g 1 h 1 shan et al 2016 moreover anammox activity did not directly correlate with anammox bacterial abundance resulting in a lower cell specific rate 0 005 0 168 fmol n cell 1 d 1 compared to previous studies 5 18 fmol n cell 1 d 1 hou et al 2013 9 5 36 2 fmol n cell 1 d 1 shen et al 2014 anammox rates correlated strongly with the abundances of specific anammox species for example both hts analysis and rda showed that the anammox rate was positively correlated with the relative abundance of kuenenia and negatively correlated with ca brocadia b fulgida and b anammoxidans previous studies reported that ca kuenenia adapt better to high do 0 6 4 mg l 1 than ca b fulgida 0 032 mg l 1 and ca b anammoxidans 2 24 mg l 1 oshiki et al 2016 therefore the high do concentration may have inhibited ca brocadia activity but not that of ca kuenenia despite their presence in low abundances with a finite cell specific rate anammox bacteria ca kuenenia facilitated low anammox activity in aerobic subsurface saturated soil horizons twenty years ago dnra was assumed to be negligible in most subsurface environments tiedje et al 1982 in this study dnra activity was 10 times higher than the activities of anammox and denitrification with consistent community in subsurface saturated soil horizons moreover dnra was responsible for 88 93 of dissimilatory no3 reduction previous studies showed that the dnra rates in various soils significantly correlate to tn c no3 and c n ratios risgaard petersen et al 2004 chen et al 2015 shan et al 2016 usually dnra is considered advantageous over denitrification in no3 limiting conditions since the high c n or no3 ratios stimulate dnra bacteria to utilize electron acceptors i e no3 more efficiently when the c source is abundant tiedje et al 1982 jÃ¸rgensen et al 1989 kraft et al 2014 in this study the no3 levels were in the same range of the reported value 0 8 2 3 mg kg 1 while the c n ratios 25 30 were comparatively higher among the different soils 10 18 shan et al 2016 rysgaard et al 1996 this would promote high dnra partitioning over denitrification in subsurface saturated soil horizons in addition analysis of the dnra nrfa gene fragments of the fringe riparian zone indicated that several aerobic microbes potentially performed dnra which is consistent with recent research results during the last years several studies reported dnra under different oxygenic conditions including slurry intact cores and water columns with more than 80 of oxygen saturation levels roberts et al 2014 song et al 2014 bonaglia et al 2016 moreover the cell specific activity of aerobic subsurface saturated soil 0 38 4 56 fmol n cell 1 d 1 was also higher than previously reported for anoxic estuarine sediments 0 22 0 23 fmol n cell 1 d 1 song et al 2014 recently a number of studies have reported dnra as an important intermediate process of n cycling in the oceanic ecosystem lam et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 the terrestrial aquatic ecosystem wang et al 2018 and soil systems shan et al 2016 zhu et al 2018a b c anammox coupled with dnra plays a strong role in n loss in marine ecosystems such as in the arabian sea jensen et al 2011 the benguela upwelling system kuypers et al 2005 and the black sea lam et al 2009 dnra provides the necessary nh4 for anammox in these nh4 limiting environments however the mechanisms underlying this coupling of anammox dnra processes in riparian subsurface saturated soils horizons differ from those in the marine ecosystem since nh4 was not the limiting factor in the present study the no2 generation by ammonium oxidation 3 3 8 4 nmol n g 1 h 1 was much higher than the no2 consumption by anammox 0 03 0 19 nmol n g 1 h 1 and denitrification 0 09 0 23 nmol n g 1 h 1 under oxic conditions ammonium oxidation produced a no2 surplus for anammox and denitrification the accumulation of which could exert toxic effects on microbial growth bollag et al 1978 moreover a large amount of nh4 was aerobically oxidized leading to less availability for anammox in this study dnra activity was comparable to that of ammonium oxidation and reduced the surplus no2 and eliminated toxic inhibition at the same time dnra also provided the necessary nh4 substrate required for anammox hence based on these results we propose that the coupling of anammox with ammonium oxidation and dnra promoted the high n loss observed in subsurface saturated soil horizons measurement of in situ flux further indicated that n2o flux decreased following an increase in the groundwater level which is associated with a shift from denitrification to anammox as the dominant n loss pathway this verified previous results suggesting that the ecological effect of n2o mitigation can be attributed to anammox our previous studies of the riparian zone in the three gorges reservoir water level fluctuating 145 175 m above sea level twice per year showed that n2o fluxes at the soil water interface during the flooding period were lower than during the non flooding period along with an increase of the abundance of anammox bacteria zhu et al 2015 that study only reported the data on anammox abundance but not on its activity the present study verified the possible n2o mitigation effect of anammox by obtaining information on bacterial abundance activity and the depth integrated rate calculation of anammox other natural factors such as microbial nitrification hydrologic conditions water quality gradients and plants among others could also affect n2o emissions when the conditions change from flooding to non flooding hernandez and mitsch 2006 santoro et al 2011 previous studies showed that the contribution of nitrifier denitrification to n2o release gradually decreased with increasing water levels and do kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013a b this suggests heterotrophic denitrification as the main microbial process producing n2o in this study previous studies which included both process and mechanistic analyses have clearly shown that substantial anammox activity could mitigate undesirable n2o emissions kartal et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 2013a b this n2o mitigation should be attributed to a shift in the dominance of the n loss pathway from a denitrification to an anammox process where anammox bacteria directly oxidized nh4 with no2 to n2 without n2o emissions this suggests that the sites that experience substantial n loss via the anammox process will have lower n2o fluxes than sites that are dominated by denitrification in the field of wetland ecology this result also provides a suggestion for the currently applied management practices in comparison to historical and less anthropogenically influenced systems riparian zones known as productive n cycle ecosystems are important n2o sources that use denitrification as the main contributor hefting et al 2003 wang et al 2012a b this study clearly demonstrated that vertically in the riparian zone denitrification with potential n2o emission dominated the cumulative n losses in the upper unsaturated layers while anammox activity was higher in lower saturated soil horizons moreover contribution of anammox to n loss after increasing water level also increased accompanied by a decrease of n2o emission this result provides valuable information for a more effective riparian environmental management anthropologically induced environmental changes i e groundwater table modification are expected to increase in the future and further change the relative contribution of n loss from denitrification to the more environmentally friendly anammox pathway this could significantly impact the cumulative n budget at a given location thus bridging global change and local management practices 5 conclusions this study investigated the distribution biogeochemistry and microbial mechanisms of denitrification anammox damo and dnra in different riparian soil horizons and quantified the contribution of these microbial processes to n cycle nitrate removal and mitigation of n2o emission the following conclusions can be drawn from this study anammox bacteria were only detected in subsurface saturated soil horizons its activity and contribution to n loss increased with depth in contrast denitrification was observed in every layer of all sampling sites however its abundance and activity decreased with depth little to no damo was observed in the same layers denitrification dominated the n losses in the upper unsaturated soil while anammox dominated in subsurface saturated soil horizons in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons the dominant ca brocadia ca b fulgida 62 2 center and ca b anammoxidans 34 1 fringe also formed an important link between anammox taxa in the riparian center and fringe zone respectively the key substrate no2 for both anammox and denitrification was mainly supplied by nh4 oxidation 54 0 80 4 and dnra 51 0 68 4 consumed a significant proportion of the nh4 required for anammox in riparian subsurface saturated soil horizons after the increase of the groundwater level the depth integrated anammox rates increased to 0 62 8 78 mmol n m 2 d 1 and the role to n loss significantly increased up to 52 3 as a result the average n2o emission was significantly decreased by 39 3 10 6 and gradually decreased from the fringe riparian zone 11 9 4 2 mg n m 2 h 1 to the central riparian zone 4 5 2 5 mg n m 2 h 1 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known
