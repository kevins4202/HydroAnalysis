19390,capacitive deionization cdi performance metrics can vary widely with operating methods conventional cdi operating methods such as constant current and constant voltage show advantages in either energy or salt removal performance but not both we here develop a theory around and experimentally demonstrate a new operation for cdi that uses sinusoidal forcing voltage or sinusoidal current we use a dynamic system modeling approach and quantify the frequency response amplitude and phase of cdi effluent concentration using a wide range of operating conditions we demonstrate that cdi can be modeled as a linear time invariant system we validate this model with experiments and show that a sinusoid voltage operation can simultaneously achieve high salt removal and strong energy performance thus very likely making it superior to other conventional operating methods based on the underlying coupled phenomena of electrical charge and ionic transfer with bulk advection in cdi we derive and validate experimentally the concept of using sinusoidal voltage forcing functions to achieve resonance type operation for cdi despite the complexities of the system we find a simple relation for the resonant time scale the resonant time period frequency is proportional inversely proportional to the geometric mean of the flow residence time and the electrical rc charging time operation at resonance implies the optimal balance between absolute amount of salt removed in moles and dilution depending on the feed volume processed thus resulting in the maximum average concentration reduction for the desalinated water we further develop our model to generalize the resonant time scale operation and provide responses for square and triangular voltage waveforms as two examples to this end we develop a general tool that uses fourier analysis to construct cdi effluent dynamics for arbitrary input waveforms using this tool we show that most of the salt removal 95 for square and triangular voltage forcing waveforms is achieved by the fundamental fourier sinusoidal mode the frequency of higher fourier modes precludes high flow efficiency for these modes so these modes consume additional energy for minimal additional salt removed this deficiency of higher frequency modes further highlights the advantage of dc offset sinusoidal forcing for cdi operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords water desalination capacitive deionization resonant operation frequency analysis dynamic system modeling performance optimization 1 introduction desalination using capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging and attractive technology for brackish water treatment anderson et al 2010 oren 2008 suss et al 2015 welgemoed and schutte 2005 like many other multi physics problems cdi involves coupling of multiple time scales and phenomena johnson and newman 1971 cdi salt removal dynamics are determined by the interplay between electrical charging discharging which depends on cell ionic and electrical resistances and capacitance coupled with bulk mass transport biesheuvel et al 2009 guyes et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2015 qu et al 2018 moreover cdi is inherently periodic because electrical charging and discharging forcing functions result in periodic salt removal and regeneration phases cdi performance can be evaluated using a recently proposed set of metrics hawks et al 2018b these performance metrics include average concentration reduction volumetric energy consumption and productivity for 50 water recovery owing to the multiphysics nature of cdi the desalination performance can be affected dramatically by the particular choice of operating method most of the previous research on cdi operation has centered around the use of constant current cc and or constant voltage cv and very little attention has been given to other possible operational schemes cc operation has been shown to consume less energy compared to cv given equal amount of salt removal choi 2015 kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 cc can also achieve a controllable quasi steady state effluent concentration hawks et al 2018a jande and kim 2013 zhao et al 2012 conversely cv can achieve faster rates of desalination albeit with a tradeoff in energy consumption wang and lin 2018a 2018b recent research around operational schemes for cdi have proposed mixed cc cv modes garcía quismondo et al 2013 saleem et al 2016 variable flow rate hawks et al 2018a changing feed concentration garcía quismondo et al 2016 and variable forcing function periods mutha et al 2018 generally these studies can be characterized as ad hoc operational strategies geared toward the improvement of one or few metrics at the cost of others we know of no work which combines a theoretical framework and accompanying validation experiments which enables a systematic study of the frequency response of cdi or any model which allows comparison among generalized input waveform shapes in other words to date studies have only explored ad hoc operational schemes such as square waves in applied current or voltage a key step in developing good operation modes for cdi would involve understanding the role of arbitrary periodic forcing functions including frequency and wave shape on the aforementioned desalination performance metrics in this work we show that cdi desalination dynamics can be under appropriate operation conditions modeled as a linear time invariant system further we propose describe and demonstrate a new operation scheme for cdi that uses either a sinusoidal forcing voltage our preferred method in this study or sinusoidal current in particular we highlight several advantages of using a sinusoidal forcing for cdi as compared to conventional operation methods to our knowledge our work is the first to introduce and quantify the performance of a sinusoidal forcing function for cdi this sinusoidal forcing results in an approximately sinusoidal effluent concentration with an amplitude phase and waveform that can be predicted accurately we use theory and experiments to show sinusoidal forcing can be modeled with a dynamic systems approach and that there exists a system inherent and resonant time scale that strongly enhances the desalination performance of cdi while simultaneously achieving good energy performance as an example we analyze and compare this sinusoidal forcing to more traditional constant voltage square wave and triangular voltage waveforms further in appendix a1 we present example engineering design approaches and associated expected performance metrics for cdi operation at resonance finally we present a generalized framework that uses fourier analysis to construct responses for cdi for arbitrary input current voltage forcing functions the tools presented here can be applied to analyzing a wide range of cdi operations quantifying performance and cdi system optimization 2 theory a resonant cdi operation we here formulate a theory around cdi desalination dynamics for a sinusoidal forcing current or voltage for simplicity and without significant loss of applicability we treat the electrical response of the cdi cell as a simple series linear rc circuit with effective r and c values as determined in section 3 2 see hawks et al 2018a ramachandran et al 2018 for details the electrical forcing of the cdi cell results in a desalination response in terms of an effluent concentration versus time again for simplicity we describe the coupling between electrical input and concentration of the output stream using a simple continuous stirred tank reactor cstr model biesheuvel et al 2009 hawks et al 2018a jande and kim 2013 ramachandran et al 2018 for the cdi cell electrical circuit we assume a dc offset sinusoidal forcing voltage given by 1 v t v d c δ v sin ω t where v d c is the constant dc component of applied voltage typically 0 v for good performance see kim et al 2015 for a related discussion δ v is the amplitude of the sinusoid voltage and ω is the forcing frequency under dynamic steady state dss such that the initial condition has sufficiently decayed as per the cdi system s natural response ramachandran et al 2018 current i in the electrical circuit is obtained as see si section s1 for derivation 2 i t c δ v ω 1 ω r c 2 cos ω t arctan ω r c c δ v ω 1 ω r c 2 sin ω t π 2 arctan ω r c we can represent the result in equation 2 as 3 i t δ i sin ω t ϕ i v where the amplitude and the phase of current with respect to voltage are given by δ i c δ v ω 1 ω r c 2 and ϕ i v π 2 arctan ω r c respectively further we describe the dynamics that govern effluent concentration reduction δ c via the mixed reactor model approximation ramachandran et al 2018 as 4 τ d δ c d t δ c i t λ f q where δ c c 0 c t represents an appropriate reduction of the feed concentration c 0 at the effluent q is flow rate f is faraday s constant τ q is the flow residence time scale is the mixed reactor volume and λ λ d l λ c is an effective dynamic charge efficiency λ c and λ d l are respectively the cycle averaged coulombic and edl charge efficiencies see hawks et al 2018a and ramachandran et al 2018 for further details using equation 3 in 4 and solving for effluent concentration reduction under dss we obtain 5 δ c t c δ v ω λ f q 1 ω τ 2 1 ω r c 2 sin ω t π 2 arctan ω r c τ 1 ω 2 τ r c equivalently 6 δ c t δ c a c sin ω t ϕ c v where δ c a c c δ v λ ω f q 1 ω τ 2 1 ω r c 2 is the maximum change in effluent concentration and ϕ c v π 2 arctan ω r c τ 1 ω 2 τ r c is the phase of δ c with respect to v further the phase of δ c with respect to current i is given by ϕ c i arctan ω τ also the average concentration reduction at the effluent is given by δ c a v g 2 δ c a c π and water recovery is 50 note the absolute concentration difference δ c a c depends on extensive versus mass specific intensive cdi cell properties such as r c and cell volume importantly δ c a c is also a function of operational parameters such as q voltage window and forcing frequency ω we find that the basic coupling of rc circuit dynamics and mixed reactor flow directly results in what we here will refer to as a resonant frequency ω r e s this frequency maximizes effluent concentration reduction δ c a c in equation 6 and is simply the inverse geometric mean of the respective circuit and flow time scales 7 ω r e s 1 τ r c furthermore the maximum average concentration reduction δ c a v g r e s achieved at the resonant frequency is given by 8 δ c a v g r e s δ c a v g ω ω r e s 2 c δ v λ π f 1 1 r c τ λ π f δ v r 2 τ r c τ r c for a given cell fixed r c and eq 8 is an expression which can be used to design a sinusoidal operation i e appropriate choice of flowrate and voltage window to achieve a certain desalination depth δ c a v g refer to appendix a1 for a discussion on this design approach and the energy and throughput metrics associated with operation at resonance our rationale behind the term resonant resonance is explained as follows cdi as a periodic dynamic process involves the coupling of several physical phenomena including i electrical charging discharging governed by the rc time scale with ii salt removal at the electrodes and freshwater recovered at the outlet by fluid flow governed by the flow residence time scale τ see fig 1 each of these two time scales affects salt removal and is physically independent of the other the cdi system s average concentration reduction δ c a v g δ c t where the brackets indicate a time average over the desalination phase therefore couples the two time scales in a manner very similar to resonance in a dynamic system hence we refer to the periodic cdi operation at the fundamental frequency ω r e s independent of the forcing function waveform as a resonant operation lastly we note that the dynamic system analysis presented in this section can also be derived using a laplace transform formulation involving transfer functions for the cdi system for readers who may find this more intuitive or familiar we provide such a formulation in section s1 of the si somewhat surprisingly the present work is the first to develop such transfer function formulation for practical operations using cdi 3 materials and methods 3 1 cdi cell design we fabricated and assembled a flow between fbcdi cell using the radial flow architecture described in biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 hemmatifar et al 2016 and ramachandran et al 2018 five pairs of activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca with 5 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and total dry mass of 2 65 g were stacked between 5 cm diameter 130 μm thick titanium sheets which acted as current collectors we used two 180 μm thick non conductive polypropylene circular meshes mcmaster carr los angeles ca between each electrode pair as spacers with an estimated porosity of 59 the spacers had a slightly larger 5 mm diameter than the electrodes and current collectors to prevent electrical short circuits 3 2 experimental methods and extraction of model parameters the experimental setup consisted of the fbcdi cell a 3 l reservoir filled with 20 mm potassium chloride kcl solution which was circulated in a closed loop a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk a flow through conductivity sensor edaq denistone east australia close to the cell outlet and a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh we estimate less than 1 change in reservoir concentration based on adsorption capacity of our cell and thus approximate influent concentration as constant the resistance and capacitance of the cell were characterized using simple galvanostatic charging and these estimates were corroborated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry measurements using a potentiostat galvanostat gamry instruments warminster pa usa see si section s2 for data we estimated a differential cell capacitance of 33 1 8 f equivalently 44 f cm3 and 49 f g and an effective series resistance of 2 85 0 28 ohms resulting in a system rc time scale of 94 s to determine the mixed reactor cell volume we used an exponential fit to the temporal response open circuit flush of the cell as described in hawks et al 2018a and ramachandran et al 2018 and we estimated of 2 1 0 2 ml for simplicity all of the forced sinusoidal triangular and square voltage responses presented in this work are at a constant flowrate of 2 3 ml min corresponding to a residence time scale τ q of 55 s thus the operational and system parameters described here result in a resonant frequency f r e s ω r e s 2 π value of 2 2 mhz using eq 7 and a corresponding resonant time scale t r e s 1 f r e s of 450 s the water recovery was 51 57 for all the cases presented here 4 results and discussion 4 1 cdi as a first order linear time invariant lti dynamic process response to sinusoid voltage forcing we here study the desalination dynamics associated with cdi from a dynamical system modeling viewpoint to this end we subject the cdi cell with a constant flow rate and operate with a sinusoidal voltage forcing further we constrain the voltage of operation within reasonable limits sufficiently low peak voltage such that the coulombic losses are small and a voltage window such that edl charge efficiency can be approximated by a constant value hawks et al 2018a kim et al 2015 ramachandran et al 2018 fig 2 shows a plot of experimental data along with a corresponding prediction by the model c f section 2 plotted is the effluent concentration c versus time for a sinusoidal voltage operation with a voltage window of 0 7 1 1 v and a constant flowrate of 2 3 ml min results are shown for three different frequencies approximately spanning a decade 0 9 2 5 and 8 8 mhz for experimental data a time delay of 4 s was subtracted from the measured time which is associated with the temporal delay associated with transport and dispersion between cell concentration and the downstream conductivity meter for the model we used a constant value of edl charge efficiency of 0 91 determined using data shown for the same voltage window in fig 3 and used an experimentally determined average value of coulombic efficiency of 0 94 a value we found to be nearly constant for the all frequencies shown in fig 2 using the sinusoidal voltage forcing shown in inset of fig 2 we observed that the measured effluent concentration also varies to very good approximation as a sinusoidal in time further our model predicts experimental observations both amplitude and phase of c very well over the range of frequencies presented in fig 2 the observation that a sinusoidal forcing function here voltage or current to a dynamical system here the cdi cell results in a nearly sinusoidal response here the effluent concentration is of course a characteristic of an approximately linear time invariant lti system by definition an lti system is both linear and time invariant i e the output is linearly related to the input and the output for a particular input does not change depending on when the input was applied we thus infer that the desalination dynamics using cdi can be modeled to a good approximation as a first order linear time invariant lti system under the following conditions i constant flowrate with advection dominated transport ii small variation in dynamic edl charge efficiency such that it can be approximated by a constant value and iii high coulombic efficiency close to unity lti systems have well developed tools for system analysis and control franklin et al 1994 and thus can be applied to analyzing cdi systems in section s3 of the si we provide one anecdotal off design sinusoidal input operation of cdi which results in significant distortion of the output concentration namely we show the case of a large variation in edl charge efficiency due to a large voltage window wherein effluent concentration exhibits a significant deviation from a sine wave we hope to further study such deviations from linearity in future work importantly the predictions and experimental data of fig 2 show that the effluent concentration has a frequency dependent amplitude and a distinct phase shift with respect to the forcing voltage waveform an observation which we study further in section 4 2 lastly we note that although we here focus on sinusoidal voltage forcing functions our work with the present model suggests sinusoidal current can also be used to characterize cdi dynamics we hypothesize that sinusoidal applied current can also yield sinusoidal time variation of effluent concentration thus extending the present work we performed some preliminary experiments toward such a study and observed that sinusoidal forcing currents easily lead to deviations from ideal behavior and the model due to unwanted faradaic parasitic reactions this results in an attenuation of concentration reduction in regions of high voltage and a more complex natural response relaxation from the initial condition such sinusoidal forcing also requires non zero dc values for applied current to account for unavoidable faradaic losses we thus prefer a sinusoidal voltage over sinusoidal current forcing as a more controllable and practical operating method 4 2 frequency response bode plot and resonant frequency analysis for cdi in this section we present a frequency analysis of the response of current and effluent concentration in cdi for a forcing sinusoidal voltage fig 3a and b shows measured current and effluent concentration profiles versus time normalized by cycle duration for a sinusoidal voltage forcing with frequencies spanning 0 2 17 7 mhz shown in fig 3a and b are results for two voltage windows see inset of fig 3a with the same δ v of 0 2 v but with v d c values of 0 8 v dashed lines and 0 9 v solid lines fig 3c and e respectively show the frequency dependence of the amplitude and phase of the current response i e bode plots for current fig 3d and f shows the corresponding frequency dependence of average concentration reduction and phase shift in effluent concentration bode plots for δ c note that for data in fig 3c and e we choose the governing rc time scale for current response for normalizing the frequency and for effluent concentration data in fig 3d and f we choose the resonant time scale which governs δ c to normalize frequency 4 2 1 current response from fig 3a we notice that the current response for a sinusoidal forcing voltage to the cdi cell is also sinusoidal to a good approximation over a wide range of frequencies we quantify the amplitude and phase lead of the current response from experiments versus the forcing frequency normalized by the rc frequency in fig 3c and e respectively for calculating amplitude we average the two peak values of current corresponding to charging and discharging after subtracting the dc value corresponding to leakage current at v d c for calculating phase shift of current with respect to forcing voltage from data we averaged the two phase shifts estimated using the time delay normalized by cycle time between the peak values of the sinusoidal current and voltage we further overlay results from the model in fig 3c and e notice in fig 3e that current always leads the forcing voltage in time i e ϕ i v 0 as expected for an rc type electrical circuit in other words the peak in current response occurs before the corresponding peak value of forcing voltage further the phase lead of current with respect to voltage decreases with increasing frequency c f the shift in the sinusoidal current profile to the right in fig 3a at f f r c r c 1 the phase lead of current is 45 note also from fig 3a c and 3e that operationally the current profile amplitude and phase shift is less sensitive to the dc voltage v d c value since it mainly depends on δ v and system parameters r and c from eq 3 also note the good agreement of our model predictions for both amplitude and phase of current especially for the most practically relevant moderate to low frequency range of operation we hypothesize that the deviation of our model predictions from experiments at high frequencies f 3 f r c is due to a deviation from a constant rc linear assumption at these relatively high frequencies the cdi cell electrical response exhibits a transient response better modeled using more complex circuits such as the transmission line response associated with non linear distributed edl capacitances de levie 1963 qu et al 2016 suss et al 2012 4 2 2 effluent concentration response we here follow an averaging procedure similar to that of section 4 2 1 to evaluate the phase and amplitude of the effluent response for the effluent response the only fitting parameter for the model is the product λ λ d l λ c and we determine this product from the aforementioned best fit curve approach to extract cycle averaged coulombic and double layer efficiencies from the experimental data see si section s4 for further details we obtained values of λ 0 8 corresponding to λ d l of 0 91 and λ c of 0 88 and 0 73 corresponding to λ d l of 0 82 and λ c of 0 92 for v d c of 0 9 v and 0 8 v respectively unlike the monotonic variations of phase and amplitude observed for current response in fig 3c and e effluent concentration exhibits a distinctly non monotonic variation in amplitude with changing frequency from fig 3b and d we observe that as frequency increases the amplitude of effluent concentration variation and the average concentration reduction increases reaches a maximum and then decreases further unlike current the effluent concentration profile both leads ϕ c v 0 and lags ϕ c v 0 the forcing voltage at low and high frequencies respectively as shown in fig 3f the special frequency that corresponds to both i maximum amplitude and ii the change in sign of the phase of effluent concentration with respect to the forcing voltage is the resonant frequency f r e s at this resonant frequency the effluent concentration is exactly in phase with the forcing sinusoid voltage function operation at the resonant frequency results in the maximum desalination depth δ c a v g for a given voltage window which is clearly supported by experiments and model results shown in fig 3d also note that δ c a v g drops by 50 for a frequency that is a factor of 5 away from the resonant frequency unlike current the effect of voltage v d c for the same δ v on the amplitude of δ c is significant as shown in fig 3b and d specifically for the same δ v a higher v d c within the faradaic dominant voltage limit of 1 2 v such that coulombic efficiency is close to unity results in a higher edl efficiency and thus cycle averaged charge efficiency this yields higher δ c a v g as per eq 5 conversely the phase shift in effluent concentration is relatively insensitive to v d c fig 3f as with the current response data our effluent amplitude and phase measurements deviate from the model at higher frequencies f 3 f r e s we hypothesize that this is primarily due to the inaccuracy of the mixed flow reactor formulation for cycle times significantly lower than the flow residence time 4 2 3 physical significance of the resonant frequency and operation limiting regimes cdi as a practical dynamic process most often involves two dominant and independent time scales i an rc time electronic time scale associated with electrical circuit properties and ii flow residence time ionic transport time scale in a mixed reactor volume the interplay between these two time scales determines the desalination depth δ c a v g at the effluent to better understand this interplay we here describe operating scenarios corresponding to very high and very low operating frequencies at high frequency operation f f τ and f r c the rapid forcing results in repeated desalination and regeneration salt uptake and rejection from and to approximately the same volume of water contained in the cdi cell further the rc type electrical response of the cell is such that high frequencies incompletely charge the capacitive elements of the cell this wasteful operation consumes energy and leads to low δ c a v g for very low frequencies f f τ and f r c or equivalently long cycle durations the edls are fully charged high edl charge efficiency and freshwater recovery at the effluent is high flow efficiency close to unity c f section 4 3 2 each of which is favorable however in this limiting regime the system can be characterized as suffering from the mitigating effect of overly dilute effluent that is after edl charging the majority of the charging phase is spent flushing feed water through and out of the cell similarly after edl discharge the majority of the discharging phase is again spent flowing feed water both of these phases hence exhibit a low value of the inherently time averaged magnitude of δ c a v g note further that an overly low frequency operation can result in significant faradaic losses also resulting in low δ c a v g a corollary to the discussion above is that for a given cdi cell and flowrate there exist two frequencies f l o w δ c and f h i g h δ c for which δ c a v g in a cycle is the same see fig 3d for example f h i g h δ c results in less than optimal δ c a v g because part of the water desalinated in the charging was re salinated prior to efficient extraction of the liquid in the cell i e poor flow efficiency f l o w δ c operation efficiently extracts processed water from the cell but then overly dilutes the effluent fresh water brine with feedwater during charging discharging hence we can interpret operation at the resonant frequency f r e s when f l o w δ c f h i g h δ c as the optimal tradeoff to achieve maximum δ c a v g between these two effects an operation implying a good balance between properly extracting desalted water versus overly diluting the effluent with feed water in appendix a1 we discuss the variation and limits of desalination performance metrics and practical implications for cdi operation at the resonant frequency 4 3 energy consumption and charge efficiency depend strongly on operating frequency 4 3 1 energy consumption first we study the frequency dependence of the volumetric energy consumption e v assuming 100 electrical energy recovery during discharge defined as 9 e v kwh m 3 t c y c l e i v d t t c y c l e δ c 0 q d t fig 4 a shows the experimental volumetric energy consumption e v for a sinusoidal voltage operation versus frequency of operation for voltage windows of 0 6 1 0 v v d c 0 8 v and δ v 0 2 v and 0 7 1 1 v v d c 0 9 v and δ v 0 2 v e v monotonically decreases as frequency decreases for a fixed δ v a lower v d c compare data for v d c 0 8 v and 0 9 v in fig 4a results in smaller e v but this comes at a price of lower δ c a v g see fig 3d note that e v is very sensitive to even a single decade change in frequency for example for v d c 0 8 v and δ v 0 2 v at f f r e s of 0 1 e v is 0 015 kwh m3 and at f f r e s of 10 e v is 0 15 kwh m3 clearly a careful choice of operating frequency and voltage window is important to ensure good trade off between energy consumption and desalination depth further to account for salt removal in addition to the corresponding energy consumption we show in the inset of fig 4a the energy normalized adsorbed salt enas defined as 10 enas μ mol j t c y c l e δ c 0 q δ c d t t c y c l e i v d t enas is a measure of salt removed in moles per energy consumed in joules per cycle as frequency decreases enas increases reaches a maximum and then decreases importantly note that the maximum enas occurs at a frequency close to slightly less than the resonant frequency f r e s thus again highlighting the importance of operation near the resonant frequency for good overall cdi performance we attribute the decrease in enas at low frequencies to faradaic energy losses which can become a significant source of energy loss for long cycles hemmatifar et al 2018 2016 lastly we note that our estimate for the volumetric energy consumption e v in equation 9 and fig 4 assumed 100 energy recovery during electrical discharge in si section s6 we show the corresponding volumetric energy consumption values assuming 0 recovery of electrical energy with 0 energy recovery we observe the same trends for both e v and enas with frequency and voltage window as compared with 100 energy recovery 4 3 2 charge efficiency we studied the frequency dependence of the conversion of electrical input charge to ions removed as calculated from the effluent stream we quantify this conversion by defining the cycle charge efficiency as 11 λ c y c l e f t c y c l e δ c 0 q δ c d t t c y c l e i 0 i d t previous studies hawks et al 2018a ramachandran et al 2018 have shown that the cycle charge efficiency λ c y c l e can be expressed as a product of three efficiencies as λ c y c l e λ d l λ c λ f l λ λ f l here λ f l is the flow efficiency measure of how well the desalinated or brine water is recovered at the effluent which depends on number of cell volumes of feed flowed during charging and discharging fig 4b shows calculated cycle charge efficiency λ c y c l e values for the same conditions as in fig 4a as frequency decreases cycle charge efficiency initially increases reaches a plateau and then decreases slightly at very low frequency also a larger v d c and fixed δ v results in a higher cycle charge efficiency we hypothesize that these trends are primarily a result of the frequency dependence of flow efficiency λ f l and only a weak function of λ d l or λ c consider that for finite duration charging cycles at a given flow rate e g f f r e s 0 5 or less in fig 4b the calculated coulombic efficiency λ c is high and nearly constant for example we estimated a coulombic efficiency of 0 92 and 0 88 for v d c of 0 8 v and 0 9 v respectively see si section s4 for detailed description of trends in λ c further consider that for a fixed voltage window the edl efficiency λ d l is approximately constant ramachandran et al 2018 for example from the data of fig 3d we estimate λ d l to be 0 8 and 0 91 for v d c of 0 8 v and 0 9 v respectively to support our hypothesis we developed the following analytical expression for flow efficiency λ f l for a sinusoid voltage operation 12 λ f l 1 1 ω τ 2 the associated derivation is given in section s1 of the si we compared the predicted flow efficiency versus frequency based on eq 12 with the corresponding extracted values for flow efficiency values from experimental data λ f l λ c y c l e λ λ c y c l e λ d l λ c see inset of fig 4b note first from the inset of fig 4b that the extracted flow efficiency values from experiments for both v d c cases all collapse onto the same curve further our derived flow efficiency expression eq 12 for sinusoidal voltage operation dashed line in the inset of fig 4b accurately captures the observed variation in data this agreement is consistent with an accurate estimate of the mixed reactor cell volume which is used to evaluate residence time τ in eq 12 4 4 generalization of resonant frequency operation for other conventional operations square and triangular voltage waveforms we here generalize the resonant frequency operation for other conventional forcing waveforms such as square voltage typically referred to as constant voltage operation in cdi and triangular voltage an operation similar to constant current operation we operated the cdi cell with square and triangular voltage waveforms at varying cycle frequencies between 0 7 and 1 1 v see inset of fig 5 a and at a constant flowrate of 2 3 ml min we used this data to study the variation of performance metrics with applied frequency and waveform shape see si section s5 for current and effluent concentration responses versus time we then compare the performance of these two voltage waveforms with the sinusoidal voltage waveform at equivalent operating conditions fig 5a and b and the inset of 5b show the frequency dependent variation of average concentration reduction δ c a v g volumetric energy consumption e v and enas respectively for square triangular and sinusoidal voltage forcing functions to the cdi cell for both enas and e v we here assume 100 energy recovery during discharge we refer the reader to si section s6 for data corresponding to no energy recovery as discussed earlier the upper bound of the voltage window in cdi operation is typically used to avoid significant faradaic reaction losses while the lower bound can be used to maintain sufficiently high edl efficiency hence we here chose to impose the same voltage window 0 7 1 1 v to all three waveforms the data of fig 5a shows that the square triangular and sinusoidal voltage forcing waveforms result in the same general trend for δ c a v g as a function of frequency as frequency increases δ c a v g initially increases reaches a maximum and then decreases at high frequency all three operating waveforms result in peak values of δ c a v g near the resonant frequency indicated by the band of frequencies near f f r e s 1 in fig 5a highlighting the importance of operation near the resonant time scale of the three waveforms considered here the square voltage waveform cv results in the highest δ c a v g followed by sinusoidal less than square wave by 15 and then triangular less than square wave by 43 voltage waveforms however the volumetric energy consumption e v for the triangular voltage wave operation is the lowest followed by sinusoidal around 1 5x of the triangular waveform e v and then square around 4x of the triangular waveform e v voltage waveforms see fig 5b the inset of fig 5b shows measured enas values a measure of salt removal per energy consumed for the three waveforms enas values are nearly the same for the triangular and sinusoidal and their enas values are roughly 2x better than that of the square waveform near the resonant operation we further show in si section s6 that for 0 energy recovery during discharge and near resonant operation enas values are highest for sinusoidal waveform followed by triangular around 90 of sinusoidal waveform enas and square around 80 of sinusoidal waveform enas voltage waveforms respectively we attribute this unique behavior of a sinusoidal voltage operation to its low energy dissipation and therefore potential for more energy recovery similar to that of triangular voltage waveform c f si figs s8 and s9 and efficient salt removal the latter is achieved by suppressing high harmonic fourier modes which have inherently low flow efficiency c f eq 12 together the data of fig 5 and our earlier analysis of sinusoidal operation suggest two important aspects of operational frequency and waveform first operation near the resonant time scale frequency for these three voltage waveforms yields near optimal values of δ c a v g second the sinusoidal waveform achieves high enas comparable to the triangle voltage waveform as well as δ c a v g values much higher than the triangular waveform although we have here considered only these three waveforms we hypothesize these insights span a wide range of both voltage and current forcing function waveforms in cdi in the next section we further support this hypothesis using a fourier mode decomposition of the forcing waveforms 4 5 constructing effluent response for arbitrary forcing functions we here summarize a fourier analysis which we find useful in rationalizing the various merits of cdi control schemes without loss of generality we will assume that periodic forcing of the cdi cell is controlled by voltage although a similar approach can be developed for a current forcing eq 5 in section 2 is the expression for the effluent response for a sinusoidal forcing voltage with frequency ω 2 π f 2 π t any arbitrary voltage forcing v t which is periodic with time period t and phase of zero at t 0 can be decomposed into its fourier series as 13 v t a 0 2 n 1 a n cos n ω t b n sin n ω t with fourier coefficients a n and b n given by 14 a n 2 t 0 t v t cos n ω t d t for n 0 1 2 and 15 b n 2 t 0 t v t sin n ω t d t for n 1 2 each of the term in the summation in eq 13 corresponds to a fourier mode as shown in sections 2 and 4 1 cdi can be modeled accurately as a linear time invariant system under appropriate operating conditions thus obeying linear superposition of effluent responses due to multiple forcing functions we thus here hypothesize that the generalized forced response for an arbitrary forcing function in eq 13 can be obtained using linear superimposition of responses of its fourier components modes section 2 presented the frequency response of cdi for a single sine wave and we can now interpret that response as the response of any one of an arbitrary number of fourier modes we here analyze two special cases of eqs 13 15 corresponding to square and triangular voltage forcing waveforms as shown in the inset of fig 5a the well known fourier modal decompositions for the square v s q t and triangular v t r i t voltage waveforms are given by 16 v s q t v d c 4 δ v π n 1 sin 2 n 1 ω t 2 n 1 and 17 v t r i t v d c 8 δ v π 2 n 1 1 n 1 sin 2 n 1 ω t 2 n 1 2 note that for the triangular wave fourier modes in eq 17 the amplitudes of harmonics decay as 1 2 n 1 2 compared to the 1 2 n 1 decay for the square waveform eq 16 fig 6 shows the measured effluent concentration response for the square fig 6 a c and triangular fig 6 d f voltage forcing for flowrate of 2 3 ml min and an operating frequency spanning 0 43 4 3 mhz in addition we overlay the effluent response obtained by linearly superimposing the effluent response due to the first two and ten non zero fourier modes excluding the dc component i e up to n 2 and n 10 respectively in eqs 16 and 17 for fair comparison with experiments we used cycle averaged edl λ d l 0 91 and coulombic efficiencies λ c 0 91 for cases a b e and f and λ c 0 8 for c and f as per the experimental data as discussed in section 4 3 from fig 6 we observe that the first two fourier modes are sufficient to capture the effluent dynamics to a very good approximation for both the square and triangular voltage waveforms and over a practically relevant operating frequency range spanning over a decade this suggests strongly that the higher harmonics do not contribute significantly to salt removal in fact as we will show in fig 7 inclusion of higher harmonics can sometimes lower δ c a v g compared to just the fundamental sinusoidal mode briefly the higher fourier modes suffer from the drawback of operation at higher fundamental frequency c f section 4 2 3 namely higher modes attempt to force the cell to operate faster than both the rc circuit can respond and faster than water can be recovered from within the cell hence they have inherently inferior flow efficiency and disproportionally consume energy fig 7 shows predicted concentration reduction δ c a v g and energy consumption estimated here as resistive energy loss in a cycle versus the number of fourier modes involved in the summation for the square and triangular waveforms in eqs 16 and 17 respectively from fig 7a and b δ c a v g does not change significantly beyond the inclusion of the first two to five fourier modes this is also apparent in the time variation plots of the effluent concentration presented in the insets of fig 7 addition of a second or higher fourier mode can result in either increased δ c a v g for e g see the triangular voltage case in fig 7a or lower δ c a v g for e g see the square voltage case in fig 7b compared to the first mode alone depending on the operating frequency however the addition of a second and higher fourier mode s in the forcing function always results in an increased energy consumption for example for the square wave inclusion of all the modes here up to n 20 results in a 65 increase in energy consumption over the fundamental mode alone the amplitude of the modes of the triangular waveform decay faster as 1 2 n 1 2 and so their effect on overall energy consumed is less pronounced for example including all modes here up to n 20 increases energy by only 5 relative to the fundamental for both the square and triangular waves approximately 95 of the δ c a v g is achieved by the fundamental sinusoidal fourier mode alone adding higher frequency modes therefore provides only a slight increase or sometimes even a decrease in salt removal as compared to the fundamental mode alone but at the great cost of significant energy consumption this analysis leads us to the hypothesis that for constant flowrate and appropriately voltage thresholded operation of cdi the sinusoidal voltage operation introduced here is likely a near ideal tradeoff between salt removal performance and energy consumption 5 summary and conclusions we developed a model for the frequency response of cdi cells based on a dynamic system approach our study shows that cdi cells with properly designed voltage windows exhibit first order and near linear dynamical system response for the first time we identified an inherent resonant operating frequency for cdi equal to the inverse geometric mean of the rc and flow time scales of the cell we showed using experiments and theory that cdi operation near resonant frequency enables maximum desalination depth further the model enables direct comparison among various input waveforms to a cdi cell in terms of quantitative figures of merit the work strongly suggests that a sinusoidal forcing voltage for cdi is the ideal operational mode to balance the tradeoff of energy consumption and salt removal in constant flow operation we believe that our approach can aid in designing and developing methodologies for optimization in cdi

the strong agreement between experimental observations and model predictions we here theoretically analyze cdi performance for an applied sine wave voltage that is driven at the cell s resonant frequency eq 7 our analyses reveal that energy consumption is minimized and productivity is maximized for a given average concentration reduction when operating at the resonant frequency thus motivating a more detailed examination of resonant operation desalination performance to examine these performance relationships we substitute eq 7 into eqs 2 and 5 and apply the appropriate integration analysis over a cycle to reveal a1 e v r e s c δ v 2 1 1 r c τ and a2 p 2 a τ where e v r e s is the volumetric resistive energy consumption at resonant operation p is the throughput productivity volume of freshwater produced per unit electrode area per unit time and the water recovery is implicitly 50 see hawks et al 2018b for a discussion of these metrics note that the expression for volumetric energy consumption in eq a1 can be expressed in terms of the harmonic mean of the two time scales h τ rc 2τ rc τ rc and this also appears in eq 8 the resonant frequency of operation is still the inverse of the geometric mean of τ and rc moreover the flow efficiency at resonance λ f l r e s is obtained as 20 λ f l r e s 1 1 τ r c figure a1 a and b respectively plot several expected performance relationships that follow from eqs a1 a2 and 8 for operations with fixed voltage window and varying flowrate and fixed flowrate and varying voltage window in particular figure a1a illustrates the non linear tradeoff between concentration reduction and productivity for a fixed voltage window and varying flowrate indicating that a sacrifice in throughput is needed to achieve large concentration reductions and vice versa for resonant operation mode on the other hand for varying voltage window and fixed flowrate higher concentration reduction can be achieved at the expense of energy consumption as seen in figure a1b taking the ratio of eq 8 to eq a1 yields enas 21 δ c a v g r e s e v r e s 2 λ π f δ v this relation shows clearly that more efficient operation higher enas is achieved for lower voltage windows δ v and higher charge efficiencies λ thus for a fixed concentration reduction a lower voltage window operation with higher capacitance electrodes is more efficient than a large voltage window operation with low capacitance electrodes however due to the finite rate at which the cell can be charged a larger cell capacitance for a given geometry does not always give a proportionally larger concentration reduction c f figure a1c figure a1c plots concentration reduction and energy consumption as a function of capacitance or capacity per cdi reactor

19390,capacitive deionization cdi performance metrics can vary widely with operating methods conventional cdi operating methods such as constant current and constant voltage show advantages in either energy or salt removal performance but not both we here develop a theory around and experimentally demonstrate a new operation for cdi that uses sinusoidal forcing voltage or sinusoidal current we use a dynamic system modeling approach and quantify the frequency response amplitude and phase of cdi effluent concentration using a wide range of operating conditions we demonstrate that cdi can be modeled as a linear time invariant system we validate this model with experiments and show that a sinusoid voltage operation can simultaneously achieve high salt removal and strong energy performance thus very likely making it superior to other conventional operating methods based on the underlying coupled phenomena of electrical charge and ionic transfer with bulk advection in cdi we derive and validate experimentally the concept of using sinusoidal voltage forcing functions to achieve resonance type operation for cdi despite the complexities of the system we find a simple relation for the resonant time scale the resonant time period frequency is proportional inversely proportional to the geometric mean of the flow residence time and the electrical rc charging time operation at resonance implies the optimal balance between absolute amount of salt removed in moles and dilution depending on the feed volume processed thus resulting in the maximum average concentration reduction for the desalinated water we further develop our model to generalize the resonant time scale operation and provide responses for square and triangular voltage waveforms as two examples to this end we develop a general tool that uses fourier analysis to construct cdi effluent dynamics for arbitrary input waveforms using this tool we show that most of the salt removal 95 for square and triangular voltage forcing waveforms is achieved by the fundamental fourier sinusoidal mode the frequency of higher fourier modes precludes high flow efficiency for these modes so these modes consume additional energy for minimal additional salt removed this deficiency of higher frequency modes further highlights the advantage of dc offset sinusoidal forcing for cdi operation graphical abstract image 1

coupling of multiple time scales and phenomena johnson and newman 1971 cdi salt removal dynamics are determined by the interplay between electrical charging discharging which depends on cell ionic and electrical resistances and capacitance coupled with bulk mass transport biesheuvel et al 2009 guyes et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2015 qu et al 2018 moreover cdi is inherently periodic because electrical charging and discharging forcing functions result in periodic salt removal and regeneration phases cdi performance can be evaluated using a recently proposed set of metrics hawks et al 2018b these performance metrics include average concentration reduction volumetric energy consumption and productivity for 50 water recovery owing to the multiphysics nature of cdi the desalination performance can be affected dramatically by the particular choice of operating method most of the previous research on cdi operation has centered around the use of constant current cc and or constant voltage cv and very little attention has been given to other possible operational schemes cc operation has been shown to consume less energy compared to cv given equal amount of salt removal choi 2015 kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 cc can also achieve a controllable quasi steady state effluent concentration hawks et al 2018a jande and kim 2013 zhao et al 2012 conversely cv can achieve faster rates

saleem et al 2016 variable flow rate hawks et al 2018a changing feed concentration garcía quismondo et al 2016 and variable forcing function periods mutha et al 2018 generally these studies can be characterized as ad hoc operational strategies geared toward the improvement of one or few metrics at the cost of others we know of no work which combines a theoretical framework and accompanying validation experiments which enables a systematic study of the frequency response of cdi or any model which allows comparison among generalized input waveform shapes in other words to date studies have only explored ad hoc operational schemes such as square waves in applied current or voltage a key step in developing good operation modes for cdi would involve understanding the role of arbitrary periodic forcing functions including frequency and wave shape on the aforementioned desalination performance metrics in this work we show that cdi desalination dynamics can be under appropriate operation conditions modeled as a linear time invariant system further we propose describe and demonstrate a new operation scheme for cdi that uses either a sinusoidal forcing voltage our preferred method in this study or sinusoidal current in particular we highlight several advantages of using a sinusoidal forcing for cdi as compared to conventional operation methods to our knowledge our work is the first to introduce and quantify the performance of a sinusoidal forcing function for cdi this sinusoidal forcing results in an approximately sinusoidal effluent concentration with an amplitude phase and waveform that can be predicted accurately we use theory and experiments to show sinusoidal forcing can be modeled with a dynamic systems approach and that there exists a system inherent and resonant time scale that strongly enhances the desalination performance of cdi while simultaneously achieving good energy performance as an example we analyze and compare this sinusoidal forcing to more traditional constant voltage square wave and triangular voltage waveforms further in appendix a1 we present example engineering design approaches and associated expected performance metrics for cdi operation at resonance finally we present a generalized framework that uses fourier analysis to construct responses for cdi for arbitrary input current voltage forcing functions the tools presented here can be applied to analyzing a wide range of cdi operations quantifying performance and cdi system optimization 2 theory a resonant cdi operation we here formulate a theory around cdi desalination dynamics for a sinusoidal forcing current or voltage for simplicity and without significant loss of applicability we treat the electrical response of the cdi cell as a simple series linear rc circuit with effective r and c values as determined in section 3 2 see hawks et al 2018a ramachandran et al 2018 for details the electrical forcing of the cdi cell results in a desalination response in terms of an effluent concentration versus time again for simplicity we describe the coupling between electrical input and concentration of the output stream using a simple continuous stirred tank reactor cstr model biesheuvel et al 2009 hawks et al 2018a jande and kim 2013 ramachandran et al 2018 for the cdi cell electrical circuit we assume a dc offset sinusoidal forcing voltage given by 1 v t v d c δ v sin ω t where v d c is the constant dc component of applied voltage typically 0 v for good performance see kim et al 2015 for a related discussion δ v is the amplitude of the sinusoid voltage and ω is the forcing frequency under dynamic steady state dss such that the initial condition has sufficiently decayed as per the cdi system s natural response ramachandran et al 2018 current i in the electrical circuit is obtained as see si section s1 for derivation 2 i t c δ v ω 1 ω r c 2 cos ω t arctan ω r c c δ v ω 1 ω r c 2 sin ω t π 2 arctan ω r c we can represent the result in equation 2 as 3 i t δ i sin ω t ϕ i v where the amplitude and the phase of current with respect to voltage are given by δ i c δ v ω 1 ω r c 2 and ϕ i v π 2 arctan ω r c respectively further we describe the dynamics that govern effluent concentration reduction δ c via the mixed reactor model approximation ramachandran et al 2018 as 4 τ d δ c d t δ c i t λ f q where δ c c 0 c t represents an appropriate reduction of the feed concentration c 0 at the effluent q is flow rate f is faraday s constant τ q is the flow residence time scale is the mixed reactor volume and λ λ d l λ c is an effective dynamic charge efficiency λ c and λ d l are respectively the cycle averaged coulombic and edl charge efficiencies see hawks et al 2018a and ramachandran et al 2018 for further details using equation 3 in 4 and solving for effluent concentration reduction under dss we obtain 5 δ c t c δ v ω λ f q 1 ω τ 2 1 ω r c 2 sin ω t π 2 arctan ω r c τ 1 ω 2 τ r c equivalently 6 δ c t δ c a c sin ω t ϕ c v where δ c a c c δ v λ ω f q 1 ω τ 2 1 ω r c 2 is the maximum change in effluent concentration and ϕ c v π 2 arctan ω r c τ 1 ω 2 τ r c is the phase of δ c with respect to v further the phase of δ c with respect to current i is given by ϕ c i arctan ω τ also the average concentration reduction at the effluent is given by δ c a v g 2 δ c a c π and water recovery is 50 note the absolute concentration difference δ c a c depends on extensive versus mass specific intensive cdi cell properties such as r c and cell volume importantly δ c a c is also a function of operational parameters such as q voltage window and forcing frequency ω we find that the basic coupling of rc circuit dynamics and mixed reactor flow directly results in what we here will refer to as a resonant frequency ω r e s this frequency maximizes effluent concentration reduction δ c a c in equation 6 and is simply the inverse geometric mean of the respective circuit and flow time scales 7 ω r e s 1 τ r c furthermore the maximum average concentration reduction δ c a v g r e s achieved at the resonant frequency is given by 8 δ c a v g r e s δ c a v g ω ω r e s 2 c δ v λ π f 1 1 r c τ λ π f δ v r 2 τ r c τ r c for a given cell fixed r c and eq 8 is an expression which can be used to design a sinusoidal operation i e appropriate choice of flowrate and voltage window to achieve a certain desalination depth δ c a v g refer to appendix a1 for a discussion on this design approach and the energy and throughput metrics associated with operation at resonance our rationale behind the term resonant resonance is explained as follows cdi as a periodic dynamic process involves the coupling of several physical phenomena including i electrical charging discharging governed by the rc time scale with ii salt removal at the electrodes and freshwater recovered at the outlet by fluid flow governed by the flow residence time scale τ see fig 1 each of these two time scales affects salt removal and is physically independent of the other the cdi system s average concentration reduction δ c a v g δ c t where the brackets indicate a time average over the desalination phase therefore couples the two time scales in a manner very similar to resonance in a dynamic system hence we refer to the periodic cdi operation at the fundamental frequency ω r e s independent of the forcing function waveform as a resonant operation lastly we note that the dynamic system analysis presented in this section can also be derived using a laplace transform formulation involving transfer functions for the cdi system for readers who may find this more intuitive or familiar we provide such a formulation in section s1 of the si somewhat surprisingly the present work is the first to develop such transfer function formulation for practical operations using cdi 3 materials and methods 3 1 cdi cell design we fabricated and assembled a flow between fbcdi cell using the radial flow architecture described in biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 hemmatifar et al 2016 and ramachandran et al 2018 five pairs of activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca with 5 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and total dry mass of 2 65 g were stacked between 5 cm diameter 130 μm thick titanium sheets which acted as current collectors we used two 180 μm thick non conductive polypropylene circular meshes mcmaster carr los angeles ca between each electrode pair as spacers with an estimated porosity of 59 the spacers had a slightly larger 5 mm diameter than the electrodes and current collectors to prevent electrical short circuits 3 2 experimental methods and extraction of model parameters the experimental setup consisted of the fbcdi cell a 3 l reservoir filled with 20 mm potassium chloride kcl solution which was circulated in a closed loop a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk a flow through conductivity sensor edaq denistone east australia close to the cell outlet and a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh we estimate less than 1 change in reservoir concentration based on adsorption capacity of our cell and thus approximate influent concentration as constant the resistance and capacitance of the cell were characterized using simple galvanostatic charging and these estimates were corroborated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry measurements using a potentiostat galvanostat gamry instruments warminster pa usa see si section s2 for data we estimated a differential cell capacitance of 33 1 8 f equivalently 44 f cm3 and 49 f g and an effective series resistance of 2 85 0 28 ohms resulting in a system rc time scale of 94 s to determine the mixed reactor cell volume we used an exponential fit to the temporal response open circuit flush of the cell as described in hawks et al 2018a and ramachandran et al 2018 and we estimated of 2 1 0 2 ml for simplicity all of the forced sinusoidal triangular and square voltage responses presented in this work are at a constant flowrate of 2 3 ml min corresponding to a residence time scale τ q of 55 s thus the operational and system parameters described here result in a resonant frequency f r e s ω r e s 2 π value of 2 2 mhz using eq 7 and a corresponding resonant time scale t r e s 1 f r e s of 450 s the water recovery was 51 57 for all the cases presented here 4 results and discussion 4 1 cdi as a first order linear time invariant lti dynamic process response to sinusoid voltage forcing we here study the desalination dynamics associated with cdi from a dynamical system modeling viewpoint to this end we subject the cdi cell with a constant flow rate and operate with a sinusoidal voltage forcing further we constrain the voltage of operation within reasonable limits sufficiently low peak voltage such that the coulombic losses are small and a voltage window such that edl charge efficiency can be approximated by a constant value hawks et al 2018a kim et al 2015 ramachandran et al 2018 fig 2 shows a plot of experimental data along with a corresponding prediction by the model c f section 2 plotted is the effluent concentration c versus time for a sinusoidal voltage operation with a voltage window of 0 7 1 1 v and a constant flowrate of 2 3 ml min results are shown for three different frequencies approximately spanning a decade 0 9 2 5 and 8 8 mhz for experimental data a time delay of 4 s was subtracted from the measured time which is associated with the temporal delay associated with transport and dispersion between cell concentration and the downstream conductivity meter for the model we used a constant value of edl charge efficiency of 0 91 determined using data shown for the same voltage window in fig 3 and used an experimentally determined average value of coulombic efficiency of 0 94 a value we found to be nearly constant for the all frequencies shown in fig 2 using the sinusoidal voltage forcing shown in inset of fig 2 we observed that the measured effluent concentration also varies to very good approximation as a sinusoidal in time further our model predicts experimental observations both amplitude and phase of c very well over the range of frequencies presented in fig 2 the observation that a sinusoidal forcing function here voltage or current to a dynamical system here the cdi cell results in a nearly sinusoidal response here the effluent concentration is of course a characteristic of an approximately linear time invariant lti system by definition an lti system is both linear and time invariant i e the output is linearly related to the input and the output for a particular input does not change depending on when the input was applied we thus infer that the desalination dynamics using cdi can be modeled to a good approximation as a first order linear time invariant lti system under the following conditions i constant flowrate with advection dominated transport ii small variation in dynamic edl charge efficiency such that it can be approximated by a constant value and iii high coulombic efficiency close to unity lti systems have well developed tools for system analysis and control franklin et al 1994 and thus can be applied to analyzing cdi systems in section s3 of the si we provide one anecdotal off design sinusoidal input operation of cdi which results in significant distortion of the output concentration namely we show the case of a large variation in edl charge efficiency due to a large voltage window wherein effluent concentration exhibits a significant deviation from a sine wave we hope to further study such deviations from linearity in future work importantly the predictions and experimental data of fig 2 show that the effluent concentration has a frequency dependent amplitude and a distinct phase shift with respect to the forcing voltage waveform an observation which we study further in section 4 2 lastly we note that although we here focus on sinusoidal voltage forcing functions our work with the present model suggests sinusoidal current can also be used to characterize cdi dynamics we hypothesize that sinusoidal applied current can also yield sinusoidal time variation of effluent concentration thus extending the present work we performed some preliminary experiments toward such a study and observed that sinusoidal forcing currents easily lead to deviations from ideal behavior and the model due to unwanted faradaic parasitic reactions this results in an attenuation of concentration reduction in regions of high voltage and a more complex natural response relaxation from the initial condition such sinusoidal forcing also requires non zero dc values for applied current to account for unavoidable faradaic losses we thus prefer a sinusoidal voltage over sinusoidal current forcing as a more controllable and practical operating method 4 2 frequency response bode plot and resonant frequency analysis for cdi in this section we present a frequency analysis of the response of current and effluent concentration in cdi for a forcing sinusoidal voltage fig 3a and b shows measured current and effluent concentration profiles versus time normalized by cycle duration for a sinusoidal voltage forcing with frequencies spanning 0 2 17 7 mhz shown in fig 3a and b are results for two voltage windows see inset of fig 3a with the same δ v of 0 2 v but with v d c values of 0 8 v dashed lines and 0 9 v solid lines fig 3c and e respectively show the frequency dependence of the amplitude and phase of the current response i e bode plots for current fig 3d and f shows the corresponding frequency dependence of average concentration reduction and phase shift in effluent concentration bode plots for δ c note that for data in fig 3c and e we choose the governing rc time scale for current response for normalizing the frequency and for effluent concentration data in fig 3d and f we choose the resonant time scale which governs δ c to normalize frequency 4 2 1 current response from fig 3a we notice that the current response for a sinusoidal forcing voltage to the cdi cell is also sinusoidal to a good approximation over a wide range of frequencies we quantify the amplitude and phase lead of the current response from experiments versus the forcing frequency normalized by the rc frequency in fig 3c and e respectively for calculating amplitude we average the two peak values of current corresponding to charging and discharging after subtracting the dc value corresponding to leakage current at v d c for calculating phase shift of current with respect to forcing voltage from data we averaged the two phase shifts estimated using the time delay normalized by cycle time between the peak values of the sinusoidal current and voltage we further overlay results from the model in fig 3c and e notice in fig 3e that current always leads the forcing voltage in time i e ϕ i v 0 as expected for an rc type electrical circuit in other words the peak in current response occurs before the corresponding peak value of forcing voltage further the phase lead of current with respect to voltage decreases with increasing frequency c f the shift in the sinusoidal current profile to the right in fig 3a at f f r c r c 1 the phase lead of current is 45 note also from fig 3a c and 3e that operationally the current profile amplitude and phase shift is less sensitive to the dc voltage v d c value since it mainly depends on δ v and system parameters r and c from eq 3 also note the good agreement of our model predictions for both amplitude and phase of current especially for the most practically relevant moderate to low frequency range of operation we hypothesize that the deviation of our model predictions from experiments at high frequencies f 3 f r c is due to a deviation from a constant rc linear assumption at these relatively high frequencies the cdi cell electrical response exhibits a transient response better modeled using more complex circuits such as the transmission line response associated with non linear distributed edl capacitances de levie 1963 qu et al 2016 suss et al 2012 4 2 2 effluent concentration response we here follow an averaging procedure similar to that of section 4 2 1 to evaluate the phase and amplitude of the effluent response for the effluent response the only fitting parameter for the model is the product λ λ d l λ c and we determine this product from the aforementioned best fit curve approach to extract cycle averaged coulombic and double layer efficiencies from the experimental data see si section s4 for further details we obtained values of λ 0 8 corresponding to λ d l of 0 91 and λ c of 0 88 and 0 73 corresponding to λ d l of 0 82 and λ c of 0 92 for v d c of 0 9 v and 0 8 v respectively unlike the monotonic variations of phase and amplitude observed for current response in fig 3c and e effluent concentration exhibits a distinctly non monotonic variation in amplitude with changing frequency from fig 3b and d we observe that as frequency increases the amplitude of effluent concentration variation and the average concentration reduction increases reaches a maximum and then decreases further unlike current the effluent concentration profile both leads ϕ c v 0 and lags ϕ c v 0 the forcing voltage at low and high frequencies respectively as shown in fig 3f the special frequency that corresponds to both i maximum amplitude and ii the change in sign of the phase of effluent concentration with respect to the forcing voltage is the resonant frequency f r e s at this resonant frequency the effluent concentration is exactly in phase with the forcing sinusoid voltage function operation at the resonant frequency results in the maximum desalination depth δ c a v g for a given voltage window which is clearly supported by experiments and model results shown in fig 3d also note that δ c a v g drops by 50 for a frequency that is a factor of 5 away from the resonant frequency unlike current the effect of voltage v d c for the same δ v on the amplitude of δ c is significant as shown in fig 3b and d specifically for the same δ v a higher v d c within the faradaic dominant voltage limit of 1 2 v such that coulombic efficiency is close to unity results in a higher edl efficiency and thus cycle averaged charge efficiency this yields higher δ c a v g as per eq 5 conversely the phase shift in effluent concentration is relatively insensitive to v d c fig 3f as with the current response data our effluent amplitude and phase measurements deviate from the model at higher frequencies f 3 f r e s we hypothesize that this is primarily due to the inaccuracy of the mixed flow reactor formulation for cycle times significantly lower than the flow residence time 4 2 3 physical significance of the resonant frequency and operation limiting regimes cdi as a practical dynamic process most often involves two dominant and independent time scales i an rc time electronic time scale associated with electrical circuit properties and ii flow residence time ionic transport time scale in a mixed reactor volume the interplay between these two time scales determines the desalination depth δ c a v g at the effluent to better understand this interplay we here describe operating scenarios corresponding to very high and very low operating frequencies at high frequency operation f f τ and f r c the rapid forcing results in repeated desalination and regeneration salt uptake and rejection from and to approximately the same volume of water contained in the cdi cell further the rc type electrical response of the cell is such that high frequencies incompletely charge the capacitive elements of the cell this wasteful operation consumes energy and leads to low δ c a v g for very low frequencies f f τ and f r c or equivalently long cycle durations the edls are fully charged high edl charge efficiency and freshwater recovery at the effluent is high flow efficiency close to unity c f section 4 3 2 each of which is favorable however in this limiting regime the system can be characterized as suffering from the mitigating effect of overly dilute effluent that is after edl charging the majority of the charging phase is spent flushing feed water through and out of the cell similarly after edl discharge the majority of the discharging phase is again spent flowing feed water both of these phases hence exhibit a low value of the inherently time averaged magnitude of δ c a v g note further that an overly low frequency operation can result in significant faradaic losses also resulting in low δ c a v g a corollary to the discussion above is that for a given cdi cell and flowrate there exist two frequencies f l o w δ c and f h i g h δ c for which δ c a v g in a cycle is the same see fig 3d for example f h i g h δ c results in less than optimal δ c a v g because part of the water desalinated in the charging was re salinated prior to efficient extraction of the liquid in the cell i e poor flow efficiency f l o w δ c operation efficiently extracts processed water from the cell but then overly dilutes the effluent fresh water brine with feedwater during charging discharging hence we can interpret operation at the resonant frequency f r e s when f l o w δ c f h i g h δ c as the optimal tradeoff to achieve maximum δ c a v g between these two effects an operation implying a good balance between properly extracting desalted water versus overly diluting the effluent with feed water in appendix a1 we discuss the variation and limits of desalination performance metrics and practical implications for cdi operation at the resonant frequency 4 3 energy consumption and charge efficiency depend strongly on operating frequency 4 3 1 energy consumption first we study the frequency dependence of the volumetric energy consumption e v assuming 100 electrical energy recovery during discharge defined as 9 e v kwh m 3 t c y c l e i v d t t c y c l e δ c 0 q d t fig 4 a shows the experimental volumetric energy consumption e v for a sinusoidal voltage operation versus frequency of operation for voltage windows of 0 6 1 0 v v d c 0 8 v and δ v 0 2 v and 0 7 1 1 v v d c 0 9 v and δ v 0 2 v e v monotonically decreases as frequency decreases for a fixed δ v a lower v d c compare data for v d c 0 8 v and 0 9 v in fig 4a results in smaller e v but this comes at a price of lower δ c a v g see fig 3d note that e v is very sensitive to even a single decade change in frequency for example for v d c 0 8 v and δ v 0 2 v at f f r e s of 0 1 e v is 0 015 kwh m3 and at f f r e s of 10 e v is 0 15 kwh m3 clearly a careful choice of operating frequency and voltage window is important to ensure good trade off between energy consumption and desalination depth further to account for salt removal in addition to the corresponding energy consumption we show in the inset of fig 4a the energy normalized adsorbed salt enas defined as 10 enas μ mol j t c y c l e δ c 0 q δ c d t t c y c l e i v d t enas is a measure of salt removed in moles per energy consumed in joules per cycle as frequency decreases enas increases reaches a maximum and then decreases importantly note that the maximum enas occurs at a frequency close to slightly less than the resonant frequency f r e s thus again highlighting the importance of operation near the resonant frequency for good overall cdi performance we attribute the decrease in enas at low frequencies to faradaic energy losses which can become a significant source of energy loss for long cycles hemmatifar et al 2018 2016 lastly we note that our estimate for the volumetric energy consumption e v in equation 9 and fig 4 assumed 100 energy recovery during electrical discharge in si section s6 we show the corresponding volumetric energy consumption values assuming 0 recovery of electrical energy with 0 energy recovery we observe the same trends for both e v and enas with frequency and voltage window as compared with 100 energy recovery 4 3 2 charge efficiency we studied the frequency dependence of the conversion of electrical input charge to ions removed as calculated from the effluent stream we quantify this conversion by defining the cycle charge efficiency as 11 λ c y c l e f t c y c l e δ c 0 q δ c d t t c y c l e i 0 i d t previous studies hawks et al 2018a ramachandran et al 2018 have shown that the cycle charge efficiency λ c y c l e can be expressed as a product of three efficiencies as λ c y c l e λ d l λ c λ f l λ λ f l here λ f l is the flow efficiency measure of how well the desalinated or brine water is recovered at the effluent which depends on number of cell volumes of feed flowed during charging and discharging fig 4b shows calculated cycle charge efficiency λ c y c l e values for the same conditions as in fig 4a as frequency decreases cycle charge efficiency initially increases reaches a plateau and then decreases slightly at very low frequency also a larger v d c and fixed δ v results in a higher cycle charge efficiency we hypothesize that these trends are primarily a result of the frequency dependence of flow efficiency λ f l and only a weak function of λ d l or λ c consider that for finite duration charging cycles at a given flow rate e g f f r e s 0 5 or less in fig 4b the calculated coulombic efficiency λ c is high and nearly constant for example we estimated a coulombic efficiency of 0 92 and 0 88 for v d c of 0 8 v and 0 9 v respectively see si section s4 for detailed description of trends in λ c further consider that for a fixed voltage window the edl efficiency λ d l is approximately constant ramachandran et al 2018 for example from the data of fig 3d we estimate λ d l to be 0 8 and 0 91 for v d c of 0 8 v and 0 9 v respectively to support our hypothesis we developed the following analytical expression for flow efficiency λ f l for a sinusoid voltage operation 12 λ f l 1 1 ω τ 2 the associated derivation is given in section s1 of the si we compared the predicted flow efficiency versus frequency based on eq 12 with the corresponding extracted values for flow efficiency values from experimental data λ f l λ c y c l e λ λ c y c l e λ d l λ c see inset of fig 4b note first from the inset of fig 4b that the extracted flow efficiency values from experiments for both v d c cases all collapse onto the same curve further our derived flow efficiency expression eq 12 for sinusoidal voltage operation dashed line in the inset of fig 4b accurately captures the observed variation in data this agreement is consistent with an accurate estimate of the mixed reactor cell volume which is used to evaluate residence time τ in eq 12 4 4 generalization of resonant frequency operation for other conventional operations square and triangular voltage waveforms we here generalize the resonant frequency operation for other conventional forcing waveforms such as square voltage typically referred to as constant voltage operation in cdi and triangular voltage an operation similar to constant current operation we operated the cdi cell with square and triangular voltage waveforms at varying cycle frequencies between 0 7 and 1 1 v see inset of fig 5 a and at a constant flowrate of 2 3 ml min we used this data to study the variation of performance metrics with applied frequency and waveform shape see si section s5 for current and effluent concentration responses versus time we then compare the performance of these two voltage waveforms with the sinusoidal voltage waveform at equivalent operating conditions fig 5a and b and the inset of 5b show the frequency dependent variation of average concentration reduction δ c a v g volumetric energy consumption e v and enas respectively for square triangular and sinusoidal voltage forcing functions to the cdi cell for both enas and e v we here assume 100 energy recovery during discharge we refer the reader to si section s6 for data corresponding to no energy recovery as discussed earlier the upper bound of the voltage window in cdi operation is typically used to avoid significant faradaic reaction losses while the lower bound can be used to maintain sufficiently high edl efficiency hence we here chose to impose the same voltage window 0 7 1 1 v to all three waveforms the data of fig 5a shows that the square triangular and sinusoidal voltage forcing waveforms result in the same general trend for δ c a v g as a function of frequency as frequency increases δ c a v g initially increases reaches a maximum and then decreases at high frequency all three operating waveforms result in peak values of δ c a v g near the resonant frequency indicated by the band of frequencies near f f r e s 1 in fig 5a highlighting the importance of operation near the resonant time scale of the three waveforms considered here the square voltage waveform cv results in the highest δ c a v g followed by sinusoidal less than square wave by 15 and then triangular less than square wave by 43 voltage waveforms however the volumetric energy consumption e v for the triangular voltage wave operation is the lowest followed by sinusoidal around 1 5x of the triangular waveform e v and then square around 4x of the triangular waveform e v voltage waveforms see fig 5b the inset of fig 5b shows measured enas values a measure of salt removal per energy consumed for the three waveforms enas values are nearly the same for the triangular and sinusoidal and their enas values are roughly 2x better than that of the square waveform near the resonant operation we further show in si section s6 that for 0 energy recovery during discharge and near resonant operation enas values are highest for sinusoidal waveform followed by triangular around 90 of sinusoidal waveform enas and square around 80 of sinusoidal waveform enas voltage waveforms respectively we attribute this unique behavior of a sinusoidal voltage operation to its low energy dissipation and therefore potential for more energy recovery similar to that of triangular voltage waveform c f si figs s8 and s9 and efficient salt removal the latter is achieved by suppressing high harmonic fourier modes which have inherently low flow efficiency c f eq 12 together the data of fig 5 and our earlier analysis of sinusoidal operation suggest two important aspects of operational frequency and waveform first operation near the resonant time scale frequency for these three voltage waveforms yields near optimal values of δ c a v g second the sinusoidal waveform achieves high enas comparable to the triangle voltage waveform as well as δ c a v g values much higher than the triangular waveform although we have here considered only these three waveforms we hypothesize these insights span a wide range of both voltage and current forcing function waveforms in cdi in the next section we further support this hypothesis using a fourier mode decomposition of the forcing waveforms 4 5 constructing effluent response for arbitrary forcing functions we here summarize a fourier analysis which we find useful in rationalizing the various merits of cdi control schemes without loss of generality we will assume that periodic forcing of the cdi cell is controlled by voltage although a similar approach can be developed for a current forcing eq 5 in section 2 is the expression for the effluent response for a sinusoidal forcing voltage with frequency ω 2 π f 2 π t any arbitrary voltage forcing v t which is periodic with time period t and phase of zero at t 0 can be decomposed into its fourier series as 13 v t a 0 2 n 1 a n cos n ω t b n sin n ω t with fourier coefficients a n and b n given by 14 a n 2 t 0 t v t cos n ω t d t for n 0 1 2 and 15 b n 2 t 0 t v t sin n ω t d t for n 1 2 each of the term in the summation in eq 13 corresponds to a fourier mode as shown in sections 2 and 4 1 cdi can be modeled accurately as a linear time invariant system under appropriate operating conditions thus obeying linear superposition of effluent responses due to multiple forcing functions we thus here hypothesize that the generalized forced response for an arbitrary forcing function in eq 13 can be obtained using linear superimposition of responses of its fourier components modes section 2 presented the frequency response of cdi for a single sine wave and we can now interpret that response as the response of any one of an arbitrary number of fourier modes we here analyze two special cases of eqs 13 15 corresponding to square and triangular voltage forcing waveforms as shown in the inset of fig 5a the well known fourier modal decompositions for the square v s q t and triangular v t r i t voltage waveforms are given by 16 v s q t v d c 4 δ v π n 1 sin 2 n 1 ω t 2 n 1 and 17 v t r i t v d c 8 δ v π 2 n 1 1 n 1 sin 2 n 1 ω t 2 n 1 2 note that for the triangular wave fourier modes in eq 17 the amplitudes of harmonics decay as 1 2 n 1 2 compared to the 1 2 n 1 decay for the square waveform eq 16 fig 6 shows the measured effluent concentration response for the square fig 6 a c and triangular fig 6 d f voltage forcing for flowrate of 2 3 ml min and an operating frequency spanning 0 43 4 3 mhz in addition we overlay the effluent response obtained by linearly superimposing the effluent response due to the first two and ten non zero fourier modes excluding the dc component i e up to n 2 and n 10 respectively in eqs 16 and 17 for fair comparison with experiments we used cycle averaged edl λ d l 0 91 and coulombic efficiencies λ c 0 91 for cases a b e and f and λ c 0 8 for c and f as per the experimental data as discussed in section 4 3 from fig 6 we observe that the first two fourier modes are sufficient to capture the effluent dynamics to a very good approximation for both the square and triangular voltage waveforms and over a practically relevant operating frequency range spanning over a decade this suggests strongly that the higher harmonics do not contribute significantly to salt removal in fact as we will show in fig 7 inclusion of higher harmonics can sometimes lower δ c a v g compared to just the fundamental sinusoidal mode briefly the higher fourier modes suffer from the drawback of operation at higher fundamental frequency c f section 4 2 3 namely higher modes attempt to force the cell to operate faster than both the rc circuit can respond and faster than water can be recovered from within the cell hence they have inherently inferior flow efficiency and disproportionally consume energy fig 7 shows predicted concentration reduction δ c a v g and energy consumption estimated here as resistive energy loss in a cycle versus the number of fourier modes involved in the summation for the square and triangular waveforms in eqs 16 and 17 respectively from fig 7a and b δ c a v g does not change significantly beyond the inclusion of the first two to five fourier modes this is also apparent in the time variation plots of the effluent concentration presented in the insets of fig 7 addition of a second or higher fourier mode can result in either increased δ c a v g for e g see the triangular voltage case in fig 7a or lower δ c a v g for e g see the square voltage case in fig 7b compared to the first mode alone depending on the operating frequency however the addition of a second and higher fourier mode s in the forcing function always results in an increased energy consumption for example for the square wave inclusion of all the modes here up to n 20 results in a 65 increase in energy consumption over the fundamental mode alone the amplitude of the modes of the triangular waveform decay faster as 1 2 n 1 2 and so their effect on overall energy consumed is less pronounced for example including all modes here up to n 20 increases energy by only 5 relative to the fundamental for both the square and triangular waves approximately 95 of the δ c a v g is achieved by the fundamental sinusoidal fourier mode alone adding higher frequency modes therefore provides only a slight increase or sometimes even a decrease in salt removal as compared to the fundamental mode alone but at the great cost of significant energy consumption this analysis leads us to the hypothesis that for constant flowrate and appropriately voltage thresholded operation of cdi the sinusoidal voltage operation introduced here is likely a near ideal tradeoff between salt removal performance and energy consumption 5 summary and conclusions we developed a model for the frequency response of cdi cells based on a dynamic system approach our study shows that cdi cells with properly designed voltage windows exhibit first order and near linear dynamical system response for the first time we identified an inherent resonant operating frequency for cdi equal to the inverse geometric mean of the rc and flow time scales of the cell we showed using experiments and theory that cdi operation near resonant frequency enables maximum desalination depth further the model enables direct comparison among various input waveforms to a cdi cell in terms of quantitative figures of merit the work strongly suggests that a sinusoidal forcing voltage for cdi is the ideal operational mode to balance the tradeoff of energy consumption and salt removal in constant flow operation we believe that our approach can aid in designing and developing methodologies for optimization in cdi

the strong agreement between experimental observations and model predictions we here theoretically analyze cdi performance for an applied sine wave voltage that is driven at the cell s resonant frequency eq 7 our analyses reveal that energy consumption is minimized and productivity is maximized for a given average concentration reduction when operating at the resonant frequency thus motivating a more detailed examination of resonant operation desalination performance to examine these performance relationships we substitute eq 7 into eqs 2 and 5 and apply the appropriate integration analysis over a cycle to reveal a1 e v r e s c δ v 2 1 1 r c τ and a2 p 2 a τ where e v r e s is the volumetric resistive energy consumption at resonant operation p is the throughput productivity volume of freshwater produced per unit electrode area per unit time and the water recovery is implicitly 50 see hawks et al 2018b for a discussion of these metrics note that the expression for volumetric energy consumption in eq a1 can be expressed in terms of the harmonic mean of the two time scales h τ rc 2τ rc τ rc and this also appears in eq 8 the resonant frequency of operation is still the inverse of the geometric mean of τ and rc moreover the flow efficiency at resonance λ f l r e s is obtained as 20 λ f l r e s 1 1 τ r c figure a1 a and b respectively plot several expected performance relationships that follow from eqs a1 a2 and 8 for operations with fixed voltage window and varying flowrate and fixed flowrate and varying voltage window in particular figure a1a illustrates the non linear tradeoff between concentration reduction and productivity for a fixed voltage window and varying flowrate indicating that a sacrifice in throughput is needed to achieve large concentration reductions and vice versa for resonant operation mode on the other hand for varying voltage window and fixed flowrate higher concentration reduction can be achieved at the expense of energy consumption as seen in figure a1b taking the ratio of eq 8 to eq a1 yields enas 21 δ c a v g r e s e v r e s 2 λ π f δ v this relation shows clearly that more efficient operation higher enas is achieved for lower voltage windows δ v and higher charge efficiencies λ thus for a fixed concentration reduction a lower voltage window operation with higher capacitance electrodes is more efficient than a large voltage window operation with low capacitance electrodes however due to the finite rate at which the cell can be charged a larger cell capacitance for a given geometry does not always give a proportionally larger concentration reduction c f figure a1c figure a1c plots concentration reduction and energy consumption as a function of capacitance or capacity per cdi reactor fluid volume c for a fixed productivity and voltage window we indicate the design point of the cell used for experiments here using a circular symbol the figure shows a somewhat surprising result for a given device geometry including internal fluid volume and operating conditions fixed δ v and flowrate increased capacitance e g due to material improvements initially improves salt removal performance sharply but then concentration reduction and volumetric energy consumption quickly saturates the plots of figure a1 therefore summarize the importance of system level designs for geometry material and operational conditions required for a desired cdi performance fig a1 the relationships at resonance among energy consumption eq a1 concentration reduction eq 8 and productivity eq a2 as a

study showed that abts reacted with bromine or chlorine species hclo or hbro and lead to the formation of green colored products abts which can be photometrically determined pinkernell et al 2000 considering that hclo hbro and hoi were hypohalous acids abts may also be used for determining the content of hoi hence a abts coloring method was developed for determining the variation of hoi with the stopped flow spectrophotometer the value of hoi concentrations determined by i3 method and the abts method is compared in fig 1b when the hoi content ranged from 4 μm to 10 μm the differences between the i3 and abts method determined values were below 4 and the detection limit for hoi was 0 5 μm by abts method and 1 μm by i3 method respectively the slopes of the linear fitting curves obtained from i3 method and abts method were 1 0543 and 1 0404 respectively and the calculated r2 values of the fitting curves were both above 0 998 these results suggest that the difference of the determined hoi content based on abts method and the accurate hoi content was below 6 and the difference of the hoi content determined by i3 method and abts method was below 3 hence abts method could be applied for determining the hoi content in relevant experiments based on the determined data the reaction of hoi with abts was proposed eq 2 and the stoichiometry of the abts hoi reaction was 2 1 which was similar with that of abts hclo and abts hbro reactions pinkernell et al 2000 in this study abts was used not only for determining the content of hoi but also for determining the content of ferrate in the stopped flow system as illustrated in fig 1a chemically ferrate would react with abts and lead to the formation of abts as shown in reaction 1 lee et al 2005 the absorbance of abts formed in the reactions of abts with ferrate hoi and hoi ferrate is shown in fig 1c the determined absorbance of abts formed in the reaction of abts with hoi was 1 93 times higher than that in the reaction of abts with ferrate besides for the abts formed in the reaction of abts with ferrate and hoi in turn the determined absorbance was 2 88 3 times higher than that in ferrate group this suggests that the determined abts content was the sum of abts formed in the reaction of abts with ferrate and hoi after subtracting the amount of ferrate the content of hoi could be calculated accordingly compared with other hoi determination methods the abts coloring method is convenient and easy for operation importantly it can reflect the real time variation of hoi in the reaction process 3 2 reaction kinetics of ferrate with i and hoi the reaction between ferrate and i was investigated based on pseudo first order reaction model and the determined apparent second order rate constants kapp fe vi i as a function of solution ph are shown in fig 2 a generally the reaction is ph dependent and acidic condition is in favor for the oxidation of i with ferrate the rate constants kapp fe vi i decreased from 21600 m 1s 1 to 70 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 0 to 10 0 at ph 7 0 the determined kapp fe vi i was 14300 m 1s 1 the ph dependence of kapp fe vi i could be interpreted by species specific reactions between different species of ferrate with i radina p et al reported that the reaction of ferrate with i was second order kralchevska et al 2016 ferrate has four forms at different ph conditions eqs 15 17 13 d fe vi tot dt k f e v i i fe vi tot i 14 fe vi tot h3fevio4 h2fevio4 hfevio4 fevio4 2 15 h3fevio4 h2fevio4 h pk1 1 5 rush et al 1996 16 h2fevio4 hfevio4 h pk2 3 5 sharma et al 2001 17 hfevio4 fevio4 2 h pk3 7 2 sharma et al 2001 accordingly k f e v i i is given by 18 k f e v i i i 1 2 3 4 k i α i where αi represents the fractions of ferrate vi and i represents the different species of ferrate the species specific second order rate constants could be calculated by using eq 18 to fit k fe vi i at different ph via nonlinear least squares method the fitting results showed the reaction rate constant of hfeo4 with i was 2 3 104 m 1s 1 while the reaction rate constants of other ferrate species h3feo4 h2feo4 and feo4 2 with i were 0 m 1s 1 this revealed that in the reaction of ferrate with i ph 5 0 to 10 0 hfeo4 was the dominant reactive specie compared with the reaction of ferrate with i the reaction of ferrate with hoi was much faster the determined rate constants kapp fe vi hoi decreased from 1 6 105 m 1s 1 to 8 3 102 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 3 to 10 3 fig 2a at ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 the determined kapp fe vi hoi was 7 4 7 5 7 2 and 13 8 times higher than the determined kapp fe vi i respectively these results suggested that ferrate was more reactive with hoi than that with i in comparison the reaction of ferrate with hoi was more complex since the hoi would ionize and disproportionate under different ph conditions the ph dependence of k fe vi hoi was also explained by species specific reactions between different species of ferrate and different species of hoi we showed that the reaction of hoi with ferrate with respect to ferrate and hoi were both first order eq 19 detailed information is shown in supplementary data text s4 19 d hoi tot dt k fe vi hoi hoi tot fe vi tot 20 hoi tot hoi oi 21 hoi oi h pka 10 4 zhao et al 2016 considering the hypoiodous acid would ionize in aqueous solution eq 21 k fe vi hoi is given by 22 k f e v i h o i j 1 2 i 1 2 3 4 k i j α i β j where αi and βj represent the fractions of different ferrate and hoi species respectively i and j represent the respective different species of ferrate and hoi and ki j represent the species specific second order rate constants of the reactions for each i and the corresponding j the species specific second order rate constants could be calculated by using eq 22 to fit k fe vi hoi attained in varied ph via nonlinear least squares method the fitting results showed the rate constants of hfeo4 and feo4 2 with hoi were 1 8 105 m 1s 1 and 7 7 103 m 1s 1 respectively while the rate constants of other ferrate species with hoi or oi were 0 m 1s 1 this indicates that in the reaction of ferrate with hypoiodous acid from ph 5 3 to 10 3 the reactions of hfeo4 and feo4 2 with hoi were the dominant processes the reaction rate constants of ferrate with i and hoi were compared with other chemical oxidants o3 hocl nh2cl peroxymonosulfate pms and kmno4 fig 2b and c the determined rate constants varied largely under different ph conditions at circumneutral ph condition ph 6 5 to 7 5 o3 and hocl were highly reactive with i while kmno4 was not highly reactive with i in comparison the reactivity of ferrate nh2cl and pms with i was mild at circumneutral ph condition for the oxidation of hoi the rate constant of ferrate with hoi was the highest around 1 105 m 1s 1 compared with the other oxidants when the solution ph ranged from 5 0 to 7 5 this indicates that for the reaction with i containing chemicals or waters ferrate would swiftly react with the hoi compared with those of o3 hocl nh2cl pms kmno4 by comparing the reaction rate constants of o3 hocl nh2cl pms kmno4 and ferrate with i and hoi these oxidants could be classified into 3 groups at ph 7 0 the rate constants with i were higher than that with hoi the rate constants with i and hoi were similar and the rate constants with i were lower than that with hoi for o3 hocl and nh2cl their rate constants with i were 106 to 108 magnitudes higher than that with hoi this reveals that in the reaction of these oxidants with i containing waters the newly formed hoi may not be fully degraded in the oxidation process for pms and kmno4 their rate constants with i and hoi were in the same orders of magnitude li et al reported that in the 24 h reaction of pms 15 μm with i 0 5 μm spiked in authentic river water merely 10 nm of i dbps was formed this indicated that the formation potential of i dbps in the reaction of pms or mn vii with i containing waters was low in comparison the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi were 10 20 times higher than that of ferrate with i from ph 5 0 to 8 0 hence compared with o3 hocl nh2cl pms and kmno4 ferrate would swiftly react with hoi formed in the i oxidation process and this property would facilitate relevant applications for the control of i dbps 3 3 the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate with i or hoi by determining the variation of io3 content in the reaction of i 20 μm with different dosages of ferrate from 10 μm to 40 μm at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate with i was calculated fig 3 a the slopes of the fitting curves at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 0 457 0 503 and 0 483 respectively this suggests that for a complete transformation of i to io3 the observed ferrate i molar ratio was around 2 hence the reaction of ferrate with i was formulated as eq 23 23 2fe vi i io3 2fe iii after studying the formation of io3 in the reaction of hoi 40 μm with ferrate from 10 μm to 50 μm at ph 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 the stoichiometry of the reaction of ferrate with hoi was determined fig 3b the slopes of the fitting curves at ph 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 were 0 65 0 66 and 0 68 respectively chemically hoi was unstable in water and would disproportionate into io3 and i the disproportionation kinetics of hoi as a function of solution ph were investigated detailed information is shown in supplementary data text s5 the disproportionation rates of hoi were 14 3 m 1s 1 19 1 m 1s 1 29 4 m 1s 1 and 51 8 m 1s 1 at ph 5 3 6 2 7 2 and 8 1 respectively since the disproportionation rate constants of hoi were 4 5 magnitudes slower than the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi at these ph conditions and the reaction of hoi with ferrate was finished within seconds the effects of hoi disproportionation on the reaction of hoi with ferrate were neglected here in the reduction of ferrate to fe iii 3 moles of electrons were transferred in the oxidation of hoi to io3 4 moles of electrons were transferred if the electrons transferred in the reduction of ferrate were totally used for the oxidation of hoi the theoretical stoichiometry of ferrate with hoi would be 4 3 and the determined δ io3 δ fe vi ratio would be 0 75 then the reaction of ferrate with hoi would follow eq 24 on the other hand if all the newly formed fe iv produced in the reaction of ferrate with hoi were self decomposed rather than continued to participate in the oxidation of hoi the reaction would follow eq 25 and the determined δ io3 δ fe vi would be 0 5 24 4 fe vi 3hoi 4 fe iii 3io3 25 2 fe vi hoi 2 fe iv io3 26 fe vi hoi fe iv io2 27 fe vi io2 fe iv io3 however the determined δ io3 δ fe vi was around 0 65 in the experiment fig 3b higher than 0 5 and lower than 0 75 there were 2 possible explanations for this phenomenon 1 in the reaction of ferrate with hoi part of the newly formed fe iv species further reacted with hoi which makes the δ io3 δ fe vi ratio higher than 0 5 and lower than 0 75 based on the experimental data we speculated that in the reaction of ferrate with hoi at ph 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 reactions 26 and 27 happened and not all the newly formed fe iv species reacted with hoi 2 in the reaction process reactions 24 and 25 happened simultaneously resulting the determined δ io3 δ fe vi lower than 0 75 while higher than 0 5 3 4 evolution of hoi and io3 in the oxidation of i or hoi with ferrate to systematically understand the reaction mechanism the variation of i hoi and io3 in the reaction of i with ferrate from ph 5 0 to 10 0 was determined fig 4 due to the high rate constants the reaction normally finished within seconds under acidic conditions in the reaction processes the concentration of i sharply decreased in the initial milliseconds and then steadily decreased as a function of reaction time in comparison the content of io3 gradually increased in the reaction process for the reaction of i 25 μm with ferrate 50 μm from ph 5 0 to 8 0 the maximum level of hoi around 10 μm was formed in the initial milliseconds and then gradually decreased for the reactions at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 over 70 of i was oxidized into io3 during the reaction and around 20 of i was not fully oxidized by ferrate fig s8 besides i the oxidation of hoi with ferrate was also investigated fig 4 as the ph increased from 5 3 to 10 3 the degradation rates of hoi and the production rates of io3 gradually decreased this was in line with previous data that the second order rate constants of ferrate with hoi were larger under acidic conditions than that under basic conditions 3 5 formation of iodoform and miaa in the presence of ha in above sections we showed that hoi was highly reactive with ferrate and would be oxidized by ferrate within seconds this property is in favor for the control of i dbps formation in the oxidation of i containing water with background nom to further confirm this the formation of iodoform and miaa two typical odorous i dbps in the ferrate oxidation of i containing water in the presence of ha was investigated when high levels of i 20 μm and ha 5 mgc l co exist in water and react with different dosages of ferrate increased from 10 μm to 80 μm no formation of iodoform was observed fig 5 previous study showed that 1 5 10 nm of iodoform would form in the oxidation of natural water containing 0 5 μm of i and 6 2 mgc l of dissolved organic carbon with hocl nh2cl and pms li et al 2017 besides iodoform the formation of miaa was simultaneously determined in the water samples and no formation of miaa was observed these results are in accordance with above analysis that ferrate would swiftly consume hoi and control the formation of i dbps compared with other oxidants in the presence of ha in water gas chromatography electron impact ionization mass spectrum was used to analyze the peaks appeared in the gc chromatograms from retention time 4 min 8 min of the water samples and the mass spectrum result is shown in supplementary data fig s7 these peaks represent volatile substances of humic acid and no i containing compounds were observed 3 6 the effects of ferrate concentration on i or hoi oxidation when 25 μm of i reacted with 30 μm of ferrate 6 2 μm of hoi was formed in the initial milliseconds and then rapidly decreased fig 6 a five seconds later 9 8 μm of io3 was formed in the system and the concentration of hoi was below detection limit 0 5 μm this indicated that when the initial ferrate i molar ratio was near 1 1 40 of i would be oxidized into io3 and there was no accumulation of hoi in the system in comparison when the initial ferrate i molar ratio elevated to 2 1 and 4 1 70 and 100 of i would be transformed into io3 respectively and no accumulation of hoi was observed either the oxidation of i with ferrate would not lead to the accumulation of hoi when the initial ferrate i molar ratio was above 1 1 when 50 μm and 75 μm of ferrate reacted with 40 μm of hoi 66 and 87 of hoi was oxidized within 1 s respectively fig 6b the hoi could not be completely oxidized when initial ferrate concentration was 50 μm in which the hoi ferrate molar ratio was higher than 0 65 the hoi could be completely oxidized when initial ferrate concentration was 75 μm but a complete oxidation of hoi took a much longer time than 1 s when the initial ferrate hoi molar ratio surpassed 2 5 the hoi was completely oxidized within 1 s 3 7 the effects of phosphate concentration on i or hoi oxidation previous studies showed that the concentration of phosphate would influence the abatement of hoi with mn vii zhao et al 2016 the effects of phosphate concentration on i or hoi oxidation by ferrate at ph 7 were explored 10 mm borate buffer was used for studying the ferrate oxidation of i or hoi without phosphate under ph control condition overall when the concentration of phosphate increased from 0 to 100 mm the formation of io3 in the reaction of i with ferrate increased fig 7 a jiang et al reported that phosphate would enhance the stability of ferrate by inhibiting the formation of fe iii colloids jiang et al 2015 this process may decrease the self decay of ferrate and thus facilitate the oxidation of i to io3 besides the formation of io3 the second order reaction rate constants of ferrate with i k fe vi i also elevated with the increase of phosphate concentration fig 7b interestingly although the io3 formation was elevated in the reaction of ferrate with i with the increase of phosphate concentration the abatement of hoi by ferrate decreased with the increase of phosphate concentration fig 7c and the determined second order reaction rate constants also decreased fig 7d edward et al found that oxyanions such as acetate and phosphate might form aqueous complexes with iodine i and reduce its reactivity urbansky et al 1997 in the ferrate oxidation of hoi phosphate may complex with hoi or some intermediate iodine species and enhance their stabilities thus decreased the reactivity of hoi with ferrate in relevant solutions based on these results there were contrary effects of phosphate concentration on the oxidation of i and hoi with ferrate on the one hand phosphate may improve the stability of ferrate and facilitate relevant oxidation processes on the other hand phosphate may complex with i and inhibit its reactivity with ferrate considering that the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi were much higher than that with i fig 2 the inhibiting effects of phosphate on i may be more obvious in ferrate hoi system and thus negatively influenced the abatement of hoi by ferrate in comparison the stabilizing effects of phosphate on ferrate may be dominant for the reaction of ferrate with i and thus enhanced the oxidation of i by ferrate 3 8 the oxidation of i or hoi by ferrate in authentic water authentic water was used to study the oxidation of i or hoi by ferrate fig 8 similar with the formation trend in buffered deionized water when 50 μm of ferrate reacted with 25 μm of i in authentic water 7 4 μm of hoi was formed in the initial 7 milliseconds the hoi content was eliminated in following seconds after ninety seconds of the reaction the concentrations of i io3 and hoi were 12 4 12 6 and 0 μm respectively the determined second order reaction rate constant of i with ferrate in authentic water was 3 7 102 m 1s 1 this rate constant is lower than that in buffered deionized water 1 43 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 2 87 103 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 and 3 27 102 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 we speculated that the increase of solution ph increased to 8 7 after the reaction and the background constituents in authentic water negatively affected the reaction rates of i with ferrate however ferrate oxidation of i was still effective for preventing the accumulation of hoi in authentic water when 60 μm of hoi reacted with 50 μm of ferrate over 75 of hoi was consumed within 20 s in this process 30 5 μm of io3 was formed and the solution ph increased from 7 5 to 8 8 the second order reaction rate constant of hoi with ferrate in authentic water was 4 1 103 m 1s 1 in comparison the reaction rate constants of hoi with ferrate were 1 03 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 2 3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 8 5 and 4 6 103 m 1s 1 at ph 8 8 in buffered deionized water this indicates that compared with the reaction rate of ferrate with i in authentic water the reaction rate of hoi with ferrate was less affected under authentic water background condition this may be because that ferrate was highly reactive with hoi compared with that of i fig 2 this property is in favor for the control of hoi in the reaction of ferrate with i in water treatment based on above data when the initial ferrate i molar ratio surpassed 3 1 all the i in the system could be oxidized to io3 when lower amount of ferrate was applied no hoi would accumulate in the system while not all the i could be oxidized the residual i may further react with disinfectants like chlorine or chloramine and nom in water potentially leading to the formation of i dbps hence for the treatment of i containing water applying high level of ferrate ferrate i molar ratio 3 1 to completely transfer i to stable io3 would be effective for the control of i dbps in drinking water treatment 4 conclusions this study investigated the oxidation of i and hoi with ferrate and examined the formation of iodoform and miaa in the ferrate i ha system following conclusions could be obtained 1 the reaction rate constants of ferrate with i decreased from 2 16 104 m 1s 1 to 70 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 0 to 10 0 the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi decreased from 1 6 105 m 1s 1 to 8 3 102 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 3 to 10 3 ferrate was more reactive with hoi than that with i 2 the reaction stoichiometry of i and hoi with ferrate was 0 5 and 0 65 respectively some newly formed fe iv may react with hoi and lead to the formation of io3 3 no formation of iodoform and miaa was observed in the oxidation of i 20 μm with ferrate from 10 μm to 80 μm in the presence of ha 5 mgc l and no accumulation of hoi was observed in the oxidation of authentic water containing i 25 μm with ferrate 50 μm applying high level of ferrate could effectively transfer i to stable io3 ferrate oxidation has great potential for the control of i dbps in iodine containing water treatment 4 phosphate showed contrary effects on the oxidation of i and hoi with ferrate the reaction rate constants of ferrate with i increased while the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi decreased with the growth of phosphate concentration acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r d

19391,toxic and odorous iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps could form in the chemical oxidation of iodine containing water a critical step for controlling the hazardous i dbps is to convert the iodine species into stable and harmless iodate io3 while inhibiting the accumulation of highly reactive hypoiodous acid hoi herein the oxidation of i and hoi with ferrate was investigated and the formation profile of hoi was determined based on 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts coloring method through a stopped flow spectrophotometer the second order rate constants kapp of ferrate with hoi decreased from 1 6 105 m 1s 1 to 8 3 102 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 3 to 10 3 which were 7 5 7 2 and 13 8 times higher than that of ferrate with i at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively compared with other oxidants such as ozone hypochlorous acid chloramine and potassium permanganate ferrate would swiftly oxidize hoi formed in the i oxidation process for the ferrate oxidation of i containing water hoi was swiftly oxidized to io3 from ph 5 0 to 9 0 phosphate buffer promoted the oxidation of i while inhibited the oxidation of hoi with ferrate when 5 mgc l of humic acids ha existed in the solution no formation of iodoform and monoiodoacetic acid miaa was observed in the oxidation of iodide 20 μm with ferrate from 10 μm to 80 μm these results suggested that ferrate oxidation could be an effective method for the control of i dbps in iodine containing water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts iodide hypoiodous acid iodoform iodinated disinfection byproducts 1 introduction iodine i is a halogen element and ubiquitously presents in natural waters the concentration of i was below 100 μg l in freshwater and ranged from 4 to 60 μg l in seawater elderfield and truesdale 1980 schwehr and santschi 2003 in drinking water treatment i would react with oxidants disinfectants and be transformed into iodine species such as hypoiodous acid hoi iodate io3 iodite and molecular iodine pillar et al 2013 some intermediate iodine species are reactive and can further interact with the background organic constituents resulting in the formation of highly toxic and odorous iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps richardson et al 2008 considering that the global sea levels were rising since 20th century due to glaciers melting and ocean warming nicholls and cazenave 2010 seawater intrusion may become a serious problem in coastal zones in near future werner et al 2013 one of the serious consequences of seawater intrusion is the degradation of coastal aquifers and the increasing of halogen elements such as cl br and i content in freshwater as the population in coastal zone is growing accompanied with the worldwide urbanization exploring the transformation of i in water treatment process can provide valuable information for maintaining drinking water safety hoi is the most common iodine specie formed in the oxidation of i with chlorine cl2 chloramine nh2cl ozone o3 and potassium permanganate kmno4 bichsel and von gunten 1999b magi et al 1997 nagy et al 1988 zhao et al 2016 hoi is highly reactive and can interact with natural organic matter nom leading to the formation of odorous iodotrihalomethanes i thms and other genotoxic cytotoxic and carcinogenic i dbps bichsel and von gunten 1999b pan et al 2016 richardson 2003 ye et al 2013 understanding the fate of hoi in the reaction of i with chemical oxidants is critical for the control of i dbps there were mainly three methods used for determining the content of hoi in water i spectrophotometrically determining the content of i3 at 351 nm formed in the reaction of hoi with i bichsel and von gunten 2000b ii chromatographically determining the content of 4 iodo 2 6 dibromophenol formed in the reaction of hoi with 2 6 dibromophenol zhao et al 2016 and iii chromatographically determining the content of o iodophenol and p

valuable for understanding the reaction mechanism of iodine species with oxidants ferrate fe vi draws extensive interest as a multi functional agent in water treatment it can be used for the peroxidation of source water amano et al 2018 goodwill et al 2015 ma and liu 2002b and inactive pathogen hu et al 2012 and algae fan et al 2018 ma and liu 2002a as a strong oxidant ferrate can be applied for the oxidation of emerging organic pollutants dong et al 2018 kim et al 2015 manoli et al 2017 odor compounds liu et al 2018 and sludge he et al 2018 the ferric particle formed in ferrate reduction process has great potential on adsorbing hazardous ions in source water liu et al 2017 prucek et al 2015 another advantage of ferrate is that less toxic products would form in ferrate oxidation process compared with other oxidants such as o3 hocl nh2cl and permanganate sharma 2010 these characters make ferrate a promising agent for water treatment and the formation of i dbps in the ferrate oxidation of i containing water aroused our interest radina et al systematically investigated the oxidation of iodide with ferrate kralchevska et al 2016 while no study reported the reaction of ferrate with hoi and the formation of i dbps in the oxidation process herein an abts coloring method for determining the variation of hoi content in the reaction of ferrate with i and hoi was developed and the variation of iodine species from ph 5 0 to 10 0 was studied the reaction kinetics of ferrate with i and hoi were investigated and compared with nh2cl hocl o3 kmno4 and peroxymonosulfate pms the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate with i or hoi was determined based on the evolution of iodine species in the reaction processes and the formation of iodoform and miaa was surveyed in the oxidation of i with ferrate in the presence of ha after that the effects of ferrate dosage phosphate buffer concentration and authentic water background constituents on the reaction were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts phenol ki kio3 and humic acid ha article no 53680 cas no 1415 93 6 were purchased from sigma

determined immediately by measuring the solution absorbance at 510 nm ε510nm 1150 m 1cm 1 rush and bielski 1986 the ferrate stock solution was diluted with 1 mm borate buffer and then transferred into the stopped flow instrument with a syringe natural water was collected from the songhua river harbin china with alkalinity of 1 3 mm as hco3 doc 6 2 mgc l and ph 7 5 before experiment water sample was vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter and then stored at 4 c the preparation of buffer solutions used at different ph conditions was listed in supplementary data table s1 2 2

ferrate and hoi leading to the formation of abts the absorbance of abts was recorded at 415 nm the path length of the cuvette was 0 2 cm twelve seconds later the absorbance became stable by setting different pre determined aging periods the variation of abts content in the reaction system could be determined in real time on the other hand single mixing pattern of the stopped flow spectrophotometer was used to determine the absorbance of ferrate at 510 nm in the reaction of ferrate with hoi the path length of the cuvette was 1 cm according to the molar absorption coefficients of ferrate at different ph lee et al 2014 the variation of ferrate level as a function of reaction time was determined lee et al reported that in excess of abts the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate with abts was 1 1 with the formation of abts lee et al 2005 in the study reaction stoichiometry of hoi with abts was determined to be 1 2 detailed result and analysis is shown in results and discussion part 3 1 determining the content of hoi based on abts method 1 fe vi abts abts fe v 2 hoi 2abts 2abts i the amount of abts formed in hoi oxidation process was calculated by subtracting the amount of abts produced by ferrate from the total amount of abts produced in the system 3 abts hoi abts total abts fe vi according to the stoichiometry of 1 2 for the reaction of hoi with abts the concentration of hoi was calculated at different reaction time the reaction of hoi with ferrate was both first order with respect to hoi and ferrate detailed information is shown in supplementary data text s4 the kinetic equation could be expressed as 4 d hoi dt k hoi fe vi 5 ln hoi t hoi 0 k 0 t fe vi dt 0 t fe vi dt was the exposure of ferrate at different reaction time the 0 t fe vi dt value was calculated by determining the concentration of ferrate at different reaction time ln hoi t hoi 0 was plotted as a function of 0 t fe vi dt the slope k of the linear relationship was the second order rate constant in the reaction of ferrate with hoi 2 3 analysis io3 was determined by i3 method both io3 and hoi react with i to form i3 under acidic conditions with i in excess bichsel and von gunten 1999a 6 io3 2i 3h 3hoi 7 i hoi h i2 h2o 8 i2 i i3 9 io3 8i 6h 3i3 3h2o i3 was measured at 351 nm and the molar absorption coefficient was 25700 m 1cm 1 the equilibrium rate constants of eqs 6 8 were k1 9 01 109 k2 2 07 1012 k3 736 respectively bell et al 1982 the concentration of io3 formed in the reaction of ferrate with hoi was also determined by the stopped flow spectrophotometer the differences of determining io3 from hoi were syringe b contained 5 mm ki and 64 mm phosphoric acid syringe d contained hoi setting different pre determined aging periods the concentration of i3 in the system could be obtained at different reaction times the absorbance was recorded at 351 nm and the pathlength of cuvette was 0 2 cm the ph of the reaction solution outflowing from the stopped flow spectrophotometer was 2 5 suggesting the chromogenic reactions were carried out under acidic conditions on the base of the method described above the contents in syringe b were filled with ki to determine the concentration of io3 in the reaction of ferrate with i ferrate reacted with i to form i3 with excess i kralchevska et al 2016 10 2 fe vi 9i 2 fe iii 3i3 according to eqs 7 8 and 10 the concentration of i3 produced by hoi and ferrate could be calculated the concentration of i3 produced by io3 was calculated by subtracting the amount of i3 produced by ferrate and hoi from the total amount of i3 produced in the system 11 i 3 io 3 i 3 tot i 3 fe vi i 3 hoi according to the stoichiometry of eq 9 the concentration of io3 could be calculated detailed information about using the difference method to determine the concentration of io3 is shown in supplementary data text s6 the concentration of iodide was calculated based on the mass balance of iodine 12 i t i 0 hoi t io3 t the concentration of iodide at reaction time t was calculated by using the initial concentration of iodide subtracted the concentrations of hoi and io3 according to epa methods 551 1 and 552 2 a process of liquid liquid extraction with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe without or with acidic methanol derivation followed by gas chromatography and electron capture detection gc ecd gc 6890 agilent was used for determining the content of iodoform and miaa 3 results and discussion 3 1 determining the content of hoi based on abts method bichsel and von gunten developed a hoi determination method based on the reaction of i with hoi as shown in eqs 7 and 8 bichsel and von gunten 2000b the hoi and oi would be completely transformed into i3 when the content of i was in excess this method was extensively used in relevant studies regarding the detection of hoi however this method depends on manual sampling and can hardly be used for determining the real time variation of hoi in rapid reactions previous study showed that abts reacted with bromine or chlorine species hclo or hbro and lead to the formation of green colored products abts which can be photometrically determined pinkernell et al 2000 considering that hclo hbro and hoi were hypohalous acids abts may also be used for determining the content of hoi hence a abts coloring method was developed for determining the variation of hoi with the stopped flow spectrophotometer the value of hoi concentrations determined by i3 method and the abts method is compared in fig 1b when the hoi content ranged from 4 μm to 10 μm the differences between the i3 and abts method determined values were below 4 and the detection limit for hoi was 0 5 μm by abts method and 1 μm by i3 method respectively the slopes of the linear fitting curves obtained from i3 method and abts method were 1 0543 and 1 0404 respectively and the calculated r2 values of the fitting curves were both above 0 998 these results suggest that the difference of the determined hoi content based on abts method and the accurate hoi content was below 6 and the difference of the hoi content determined by i3 method and abts method was below 3 hence abts method could be applied for determining the hoi content in relevant experiments based on the determined data the reaction of hoi with abts was proposed eq 2 and the stoichiometry of the abts hoi reaction was 2 1 which was similar with that of abts hclo and abts hbro reactions pinkernell et al 2000 in this study abts was used not only for determining the content of hoi but also for determining the content of ferrate in the stopped flow system as illustrated in fig 1a chemically ferrate would react with abts and lead to the formation of abts as shown in reaction 1 lee et al 2005 the absorbance of abts formed in the reactions of abts with ferrate hoi and hoi ferrate is shown in fig 1c the determined absorbance of abts formed in the reaction of abts with hoi was 1 93 times higher than that in the reaction of abts with ferrate besides for the abts formed in the reaction of abts with ferrate and hoi in turn the determined absorbance was 2 88 3 times higher than that in ferrate group this suggests that the determined abts content was the sum of abts formed in the reaction of abts with ferrate and hoi after subtracting the amount of ferrate the content of hoi could be calculated accordingly compared with other hoi determination methods the abts coloring method is convenient and easy for operation importantly it can reflect the real time variation of hoi in the reaction process 3 2 reaction kinetics of ferrate with i and hoi the reaction between ferrate and i was investigated based on pseudo first order reaction model and the determined apparent second order rate constants kapp fe vi i as a function of solution ph are shown in fig 2 a generally the reaction is ph dependent and acidic condition is in favor for the oxidation of i with ferrate the rate constants kapp fe vi i decreased from 21600 m 1s 1 to 70 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 0 to 10 0 at ph 7 0 the determined kapp fe vi i was 14300 m 1s 1 the ph dependence of kapp fe vi i could be interpreted by species specific reactions between different species of ferrate with i radina p et al reported that the reaction of ferrate with i was second order kralchevska et al 2016 ferrate has four forms at different ph conditions eqs 15 17 13 d fe vi tot dt k f e v i i fe vi tot i 14 fe vi tot h3fevio4 h2fevio4 hfevio4 fevio4 2 15 h3fevio4 h2fevio4 h pk1 1 5 rush et al 1996 16 h2fevio4 hfevio4 h pk2 3 5 sharma et al 2001 17 hfevio4 fevio4 2 h pk3 7 2 sharma et al 2001 accordingly k f e v i i is given by 18 k f e v i i i 1 2 3 4 k i α i where αi represents the fractions of ferrate vi and i represents the different species of ferrate the species specific second order rate constants could be calculated by using eq 18 to fit k fe vi i at different ph via nonlinear least squares method the fitting results showed the reaction rate constant of hfeo4 with i was 2 3 104 m 1s 1 while the reaction rate constants of other ferrate species h3feo4 h2feo4 and feo4 2 with i were 0 m 1s 1 this revealed that in the reaction of ferrate with i ph 5 0 to 10 0 hfeo4 was the dominant reactive specie compared with the reaction of ferrate with i the reaction of ferrate with hoi was much faster the determined rate constants kapp fe vi hoi decreased from 1 6 105 m 1s 1 to 8 3 102 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 3 to 10 3 fig 2a at ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 the determined kapp fe vi hoi was 7 4 7 5 7 2 and 13 8 times higher than the determined kapp fe vi i respectively these results suggested that ferrate was more reactive with hoi than that with i in comparison the reaction of ferrate with hoi was more complex since the hoi would ionize and disproportionate under different ph conditions the ph dependence of k fe vi hoi was also explained by species specific reactions between different species of ferrate and different species of hoi we showed that the reaction of hoi with ferrate with respect to ferrate and hoi were both first order eq 19 detailed information is shown in supplementary data text s4 19 d hoi tot dt k fe vi hoi hoi tot fe vi tot 20 hoi tot hoi oi 21 hoi oi h pka 10 4 zhao et al 2016 considering the hypoiodous acid would ionize in aqueous solution eq 21 k fe vi hoi is given by 22 k f e v i h o i j 1 2 i 1 2 3 4 k i j α i β j where αi and βj represent the fractions of different ferrate and hoi species respectively i and j represent the respective different species of ferrate and hoi and ki j represent the species specific second order rate constants of the reactions for each i and the corresponding j the species specific second order rate constants could be calculated by using eq 22 to fit k fe vi hoi attained in varied ph via nonlinear least squares method the fitting results showed the rate constants of hfeo4 and feo4 2 with hoi were 1 8 105 m 1s 1 and 7 7 103 m 1s 1 respectively while the rate constants of other ferrate species with hoi or oi were 0 m 1s 1 this indicates that in the reaction of ferrate with hypoiodous acid from ph 5 3 to 10 3 the reactions of hfeo4 and feo4 2 with hoi were the dominant processes the reaction rate constants of ferrate with i and hoi were compared with other chemical oxidants o3 hocl nh2cl peroxymonosulfate pms and kmno4 fig 2b and c the determined rate constants varied largely under different ph conditions at circumneutral ph condition ph 6 5 to 7 5 o3 and hocl were highly reactive with i while kmno4 was not highly reactive with i in comparison the reactivity of ferrate nh2cl and pms with i was mild at circumneutral ph condition for the oxidation of hoi the rate constant of ferrate with hoi was the highest around 1 105 m 1s 1 compared with the other oxidants when the solution ph ranged from 5 0 to 7 5 this indicates that for the reaction with i containing chemicals or waters ferrate would swiftly react with the hoi compared with those of o3 hocl nh2cl pms kmno4 by comparing the reaction rate constants of o3 hocl nh2cl pms kmno4 and ferrate with i and hoi these oxidants could be classified into 3 groups at ph 7 0 the rate constants with i were higher than that with hoi the rate constants with i and hoi were similar and the rate constants with i were lower than that with hoi for o3 hocl and nh2cl their rate constants with i were 106 to 108 magnitudes higher than that with hoi this reveals that in the reaction of these oxidants with i containing waters the newly formed hoi may not be fully degraded in the oxidation process for pms and kmno4 their rate constants with i and hoi were in the same orders of magnitude li et al reported that in the 24 h reaction of pms 15 μm with i 0 5 μm spiked in authentic river water merely 10 nm of i dbps was formed this indicated that the formation potential of i dbps in the reaction of pms or mn vii with i containing waters was low in comparison the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi were 10 20 times higher than that of ferrate with i from ph 5 0 to 8 0 hence compared with o3 hocl nh2cl pms and kmno4 ferrate would swiftly react with hoi formed in the i oxidation process and this property would facilitate relevant applications for the control of i dbps 3 3 the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate with i or hoi by determining the variation of io3 content in the reaction of i 20 μm with different dosages of ferrate from 10 μm to 40 μm at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate with i was calculated fig 3 a the slopes of the fitting curves at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 0 457 0 503 and 0 483 respectively this suggests that for a complete transformation of i to io3 the observed ferrate i molar ratio was around 2 hence the reaction of ferrate with i was formulated as eq 23 23 2fe vi i io3 2fe iii after studying the formation of io3 in the reaction of hoi 40 μm with ferrate from 10 μm to 50 μm at ph 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 the stoichiometry of the reaction of ferrate with hoi was determined fig 3b the slopes of the fitting curves at ph 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 were 0 65 0 66 and 0 68 respectively chemically hoi was unstable in water and would disproportionate into io3 and i the disproportionation kinetics of hoi as a function of solution ph were investigated detailed information is shown in supplementary data text s5 the disproportionation rates of hoi were 14 3 m 1s 1 19 1 m 1s 1 29 4 m 1s 1 and 51 8 m 1s 1 at ph 5 3 6 2 7 2 and 8 1 respectively since the disproportionation rate constants of hoi were 4 5 magnitudes slower than the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi at these ph conditions and the reaction of hoi with ferrate was finished within seconds the effects of hoi disproportionation on the reaction of hoi with ferrate were neglected here in the reduction of ferrate to fe iii 3 moles of electrons were transferred in the oxidation of hoi to io3 4 moles of electrons were transferred if the electrons transferred in the reduction of ferrate were totally used for the oxidation of hoi the theoretical stoichiometry of ferrate with hoi would be 4 3 and the determined δ io3 δ fe vi ratio would be 0 75 then the reaction of ferrate with hoi would follow eq 24 on the other hand if all the newly formed fe iv produced in the reaction of ferrate with hoi were self decomposed rather than continued to participate in the oxidation of hoi the reaction would follow eq 25 and the determined δ io3 δ fe vi would be 0 5 24 4 fe vi 3hoi 4 fe iii 3io3 25 2 fe vi hoi 2 fe iv io3 26 fe vi hoi fe iv io2 27 fe vi io2 fe iv io3 however the determined δ io3 δ fe vi was around 0 65 in the experiment fig 3b higher than 0 5 and lower than 0 75 there were 2 possible explanations for this phenomenon 1 in the reaction of ferrate with hoi part of the newly formed fe iv species further reacted with hoi which makes the δ io3 δ fe vi ratio higher than 0 5 and lower than 0 75 based on the experimental data we speculated that in the reaction of ferrate with hoi at ph 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 reactions 26 and 27 happened and not all the newly formed fe iv species reacted with hoi 2 in the reaction process reactions 24 and 25 happened simultaneously resulting the determined δ io3 δ fe vi lower than 0 75 while higher than 0 5 3 4 evolution of hoi and io3 in the oxidation of i or hoi with ferrate to systematically understand the reaction mechanism the variation of i hoi and io3 in the reaction of i with ferrate from ph 5 0 to 10 0 was determined fig 4 due to the high rate constants the reaction normally finished within seconds under acidic conditions in the reaction processes the concentration of i sharply decreased in the initial milliseconds and then steadily decreased as a function of reaction time in comparison the content of io3 gradually increased in the reaction process for the reaction of i 25 μm with ferrate 50 μm from ph 5 0 to 8 0 the maximum level of hoi around 10 μm was formed in the initial milliseconds and then gradually decreased for the reactions at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 over 70 of i was oxidized into io3 during the reaction and around 20 of i was not fully oxidized by ferrate fig s8 besides i the oxidation of hoi with ferrate was also investigated fig 4 as the ph increased from 5 3 to 10 3 the degradation rates of hoi and the production rates of io3 gradually decreased this was in line with previous data that the second order rate constants of ferrate with hoi were larger under acidic conditions than that under basic conditions 3 5 formation of iodoform and miaa in the presence of ha in above sections we showed that hoi was highly reactive with ferrate and would be oxidized by ferrate within seconds this property is in favor for the control of i dbps formation in the oxidation of i containing water with background nom to further confirm this the formation of iodoform and miaa two typical odorous i dbps in the ferrate oxidation of i containing water in the presence of ha was investigated when high levels of i 20 μm and ha 5 mgc l co exist in water and react with different dosages of ferrate increased from 10 μm to 80 μm no formation of iodoform was observed fig 5 previous study showed that 1 5 10 nm of iodoform would form in the oxidation of natural water containing 0 5 μm of i and 6 2 mgc l of dissolved organic carbon with hocl nh2cl and pms li et al 2017 besides iodoform the formation of miaa was simultaneously determined in the water samples and no formation of miaa was observed these results are in accordance with above analysis that ferrate would swiftly consume hoi and control the formation of i dbps compared with other oxidants in the presence of ha in water gas chromatography electron impact ionization mass spectrum was used to analyze the peaks appeared in the gc chromatograms from retention time 4 min 8 min of the water samples and the mass spectrum result is shown in supplementary data fig s7 these peaks represent volatile substances of humic acid and no i containing compounds were observed 3 6 the effects of ferrate concentration on i or hoi oxidation when 25 μm of i reacted with 30 μm of ferrate 6 2 μm of hoi was formed in the initial milliseconds and then rapidly decreased fig 6 a five seconds later 9 8 μm of io3 was formed in the system and the concentration of hoi was below detection limit 0 5 μm this indicated that when the initial ferrate i molar ratio was near 1 1 40 of i would be oxidized into io3 and there was no accumulation of hoi in the system in comparison when the initial ferrate i molar ratio elevated to 2 1 and 4 1 70 and 100 of i would be transformed into io3 respectively and no accumulation of hoi was observed either the oxidation of i with ferrate would not lead to the accumulation of hoi when the initial ferrate i molar ratio was above 1 1 when 50 μm and 75 μm of ferrate reacted with 40 μm of hoi 66 and 87 of hoi was oxidized within 1 s respectively fig 6b the hoi could not be completely oxidized when initial ferrate concentration was 50 μm in which the hoi ferrate molar ratio was higher than 0 65 the hoi could be completely oxidized when initial ferrate concentration was 75 μm but a complete oxidation of hoi took a much longer time than 1 s when the initial ferrate hoi molar ratio surpassed 2 5 the hoi was completely oxidized within 1 s 3 7 the effects of phosphate concentration on i or hoi oxidation previous studies showed that the concentration of phosphate would influence the abatement of hoi with mn vii zhao et al 2016 the effects of phosphate concentration on i or hoi oxidation by ferrate at ph 7 were explored 10 mm borate buffer was used for studying the ferrate oxidation of i or hoi without phosphate under ph control condition overall when the concentration of phosphate increased from 0 to 100 mm the formation of io3 in the reaction of i with ferrate increased fig 7 a jiang et al reported that phosphate would enhance the stability of ferrate by inhibiting the formation of fe iii colloids jiang et al 2015 this process may decrease the self decay of ferrate and thus facilitate the oxidation of i to io3 besides the formation of io3 the second order reaction rate constants of ferrate with i k fe vi i also elevated with the increase of phosphate concentration fig 7b interestingly although the io3 formation was elevated in the reaction of ferrate with i with the increase of phosphate concentration the abatement of hoi by ferrate decreased with the increase of phosphate concentration fig 7c and the determined second order reaction rate constants also decreased fig 7d edward et al found that oxyanions such as acetate and phosphate might form aqueous complexes with iodine i and reduce its reactivity urbansky et al 1997 in the ferrate oxidation of hoi phosphate may complex with hoi or some intermediate iodine species and enhance their stabilities thus decreased the reactivity of hoi with ferrate in relevant solutions based on these results there were contrary effects of phosphate concentration on the oxidation of i and hoi with ferrate on the one hand phosphate may improve the stability of ferrate and facilitate relevant oxidation processes on the other hand phosphate may complex with i and inhibit its reactivity with ferrate considering that the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi were much higher than that with i fig 2 the inhibiting effects of phosphate on i may be more obvious in ferrate hoi system and thus negatively influenced the abatement of hoi by ferrate in comparison the stabilizing effects of phosphate on ferrate may be dominant for the reaction of ferrate with i and thus enhanced the oxidation of i by ferrate 3 8 the oxidation of i or hoi by ferrate in authentic water authentic water was used to study the oxidation of i or hoi by ferrate fig 8 similar with the formation trend in buffered deionized water when 50 μm of ferrate reacted with 25 μm of i in authentic water 7 4 μm of hoi was formed in the initial 7 milliseconds the hoi content was eliminated in following seconds after ninety seconds of the reaction the concentrations of i io3 and hoi were 12 4 12 6 and 0 μm respectively the determined second order reaction rate constant of i with ferrate in authentic water was 3 7 102 m 1s 1 this rate constant is lower than that in buffered deionized water 1 43 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 2 87 103 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 and 3 27 102 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 we speculated that the increase of solution ph increased to 8 7 after the reaction and the background constituents in authentic water negatively affected the reaction rates of i with ferrate however ferrate oxidation of i was still effective for preventing the accumulation of hoi in authentic water when 60 μm of hoi reacted with 50 μm of ferrate over 75 of hoi was consumed within 20 s in this process 30 5 μm of io3 was formed and the solution ph increased from 7 5 to 8 8 the second order reaction rate constant of hoi with ferrate in authentic water was 4 1 103 m 1s 1 in comparison the reaction rate constants of hoi with ferrate were 1 03 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 2 3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 8 5 and 4 6 103 m 1s 1 at ph 8 8 in buffered deionized water this indicates that compared with the reaction rate of ferrate with i in authentic water the reaction rate of hoi with ferrate was less affected under authentic water background condition this may be because that ferrate was highly reactive with hoi compared with that of i fig 2 this property is in favor for the control of hoi in the reaction of ferrate with i in water treatment based on above data when the initial ferrate i molar ratio surpassed 3 1 all the i in the system could be oxidized to io3 when lower amount of ferrate was applied no hoi would accumulate in the system while not all the i could be oxidized the residual i may further react with disinfectants like chlorine or chloramine and nom in water potentially leading to the formation of i dbps hence for the treatment of i containing water applying high level of ferrate ferrate i molar ratio 3 1 to completely transfer i to stable io3 would be effective for the control of i dbps in drinking water treatment 4 conclusions this study investigated the oxidation of i and hoi with ferrate and examined the formation of iodoform and miaa in the ferrate i ha system following conclusions could be obtained 1 the reaction rate constants of ferrate with i decreased from 2 16 104 m 1s 1 to 70 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 0 to 10 0 the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi decreased from 1 6 105 m 1s 1 to 8 3 102 m 1s 1 as the solution ph varied from 5 3 to 10 3 ferrate was more reactive with hoi than that with i 2 the reaction stoichiometry of i and hoi with ferrate was 0 5 and 0 65 respectively some newly formed fe iv may react with hoi and lead to the formation of io3 3 no formation of iodoform and miaa was observed in the oxidation of i 20 μm with ferrate from 10 μm to 80 μm in the presence of ha 5 mgc l and no accumulation of hoi was observed in the oxidation of authentic water containing i 25 μm with ferrate 50 μm applying high level of ferrate could effectively transfer i to stable io3 ferrate oxidation has great potential for the control of i dbps in iodine containing water treatment 4 phosphate showed contrary effects on the oxidation of i and hoi with ferrate the reaction rate constants of ferrate with i increased while the reaction rate constants of ferrate with hoi decreased with the growth of phosphate concentration acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r d

19392,the shores of the pearl river estuary are home to 35 million people their wastes are discharged into the large river delta front estuary lde one of the most highly polluted systems in the world here we construct a radium reactive transport model to estimate the terrestrial groundwater discharge tgd into the highly urbanized pearl river lde we find the tgd comprises only approximately 0 9 in term of water discharge compared to the river discharge the tgd in the pearl river lde delivers significant chemical fluxes to the coast which are comparable to the fluvial loadings from pearl river and other world major rivers of particular importance is the flux of ammonium because of its considerable role in pearl river estuary eutrophication and hypoxia unlike the ammonium in many other aquifers the ammonium in the pearl river aquifer system is natural and originated from organic matter remineralization by sulfate reduction in the extremely reducing environment the tgd derived nh4 is as much as 5 of the upstream pearl river fluvial loading and 42 of the anthropogenic inputs this high groundwater nh4 flux may greatly intensify the eutrophication shift the trophic states and lead to alarming hypoxia within the affected ecosystems in the pearl river lde the large tgd derived chemical fluxes will lead to deterioration of water and will potentially affect human health keywords the large river delta front estuary lde of pearl river terrestrial groundwater discharge radium ammonium reactive transport model 1 introduction large river delta front estuaries lde represent vital interfaces between continents and the oceans for water and material fluxes basu et al 2001 bianchi and allison 2009 lde cover subaerial and subaqueous delta systems of major rivers including inland areas such as deltaic plain and lowland floodplain and offshore areas that may extend to the continental shelf lde are very productive regions and usually support large human populations and thus are influenced by intensive human activities such irrigation sewage discharge and land reclamations basu et al 2001 fendorf et al 2010 harvey et al 2002 tessler et al 2015 comprised of terrestrial groundwater and circulated seawater submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been widely considered as a significant process in delivering terrestrial chemicals such as nutrients dissolved carbon and trace elements to coastal zones michael et al 2005 moore 1996 2010 slomp and van cappellen 2004 endeavors are made by researchers to partition fresh groundwater discharge and the circulated seawater through approaches of numerical modeling befus et al 2017 michael et al 2005 analytical approximations li et al 1999 and regional water balances basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 based on uraniumthorium u th series disequilibrium researchers have also attempted to quantify key processes within coastal aquifers such as adsorption desorption co precipitation weathering α recoil advective flow and water transit time porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2001 as nuclides in the u th series radium isotopes and 222rn are also capable of providing constraints to quantify these processes luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 isotopes of radium have also been widely used as tracers to quantify sgd and residence time in different coastal environments kiro et al 2013 moore 1996 rodellas et al 2015 however to date there have been limited studies to evaluate ldes groundwater dynamics and quantify the terrestrial groundwater and chemical fluxes based on radium reactive transport models although previous theoretical studies have indicated that radium isotopes and their activity ratios of river and groundwater could be as tracers of groundwater mass transports porcelli 2008 porcelli and swarzenski 2003 in the ldes the aquifer aquitard systems were formed by the periodical quaternary deposition during sea transgression and regression the salts in the marine units will be leached into the basal aquifers leading to the salinization of regional groundwater therefore the terms of terrestrial groundwater discharge tgd rather than fresh submarine groundwater discharge is proposed in this study as the former contains portion of salts leached form marine units larsen et al 2017 the ldes deposits are usually characterized by high organic matter concentration and the groundwater system of the ldes is subject to anoxic condition and relative high salinity due to the leaching of salts from marine units these settings are favorable for the enrichment of chemicals of lde groundwater and their mobility basu et al 2001 polizzotto et al 2008 wang and jiao 2012 therefore the tgd will lead to disproportionate chemical loadings to the coasts what s more although there are many studies focusing on the riverine chemical and sediment fluxes in the lde basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 moore 1997 but studies on groundwater derived chemical fluxes at the scale of lde are very limited this study investigated tgd and the resulting chemical fluxes to the coasts in the lde of the pearl river system this lde is intensively influenced by anthropogenic activities due to the rapid urbanization and the groundwater system of the lde has proven to be the natural reservoir of chemicals such as nh4 however there is no attempt to quantify tgd derived chemicals loadings to the coasts of the pearl river ldes the investigation of tgd in the pearl river ldes advances the understanding of terrestrial groundwater borne chemicals in the lde and is instructive for the ldes management and ecological restoration elsewhere tessler et al 2015 2 methodology 2 1 study area the pearl river located at the north margin of the south china sea scs is the second largest river in china in terms of water discharge the pearl river system has three tributaries namely xijiang river dongjiang river and beijiang river fig 1 a with a discharge of 3 6 1011 m3 yr 1 the three tributaries deliver a sediment loading of 85 106 tons yr 1 into the subaqueous area of the pearl river lde including the three subestuaries modaomen huangmaohai and lingdingyang also referred as pearl river estuary or pre dai et al 2013 harrison et al 2008 however the sediment loads declined to 30 106 since 2006 after the construction of the longtan dam and baise dam at the middle reach of the pearl river wu et al 2012 as the largest tributary xijiang river contributes 77 of the freshwater discharge and about 86 of sediment loadings zhou et al 2006 about 80 of the annual discharge and 95 of the sediment loadings in the pearl river system occur in the summer season harrison et al 2008 the pearl river delta prd forms the subaerial lde which has an area of around 9000 km2 and a population of more than 35 million dai et al 2008 due to rapid urbanization and industrialization since 1950 on average about 40 109 m3 yr 1 industrial wastewater and domestic sewage are discharged into the subaqueous region of the lde abnormally high nh4 concentrations up to 22000 μm and elevated as ba sr and no3 and dip are found in the basal aquifers of the prd jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2012 the regional groundwater also contains high total alkalinity talk mainly due to two reasons 1 limestone dissolution loadings in the upper streams cai et al 2008 wang and jiao 2012 and 2 the degradation of organic matter in the groundwater and aquifer grains jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2012 extremely high nh4 and low dissolved oxygen were observed in the sub estuaries leading to alarming hypoxia and water pollution dai et al 2008 yin and harrison 2008 the enrichments of those pollutants in the subaqueous areas have been attributed to riverine inputs sedimentary release and benthic porewater fluxes cai et al 2008 2015 cheung et al 2003 2 2 field works chemical analysis and data compilations in order to examine the magnitude of tgd and the derived chemical fluxes to the coast a series of sampling activities and field work were conducted from 2006 to 2016 in the prd and hong kong fig 1a systematical groundwater sampling activities were conducted along the cross section between guangzhou and zhongshan fig 1 the quaternary deposit was dominated by four stratigraphic units 1 an old terrestrial unit t2 2 an old marine unit m2 3 a young terrestrial unit t1 and 4 a young marine unit m1 fig 1b jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 groundwater from boreholes piezometers and farm wells and porewater from the sediment cores was sampled from t1 and t2 and analyzed for various geochemical parameters including nutrients nh4 no3 and dissolved inorganic phosphate or dip dissolved carbon doc and talk trace elements as ba and sr and stable and radiogenic isotopes such as 18o and 2h and 222rn and radium isotopes water samples for chemical analysis were filtered with 0 45 μm syringe filters advantec co briefly the sample volumes for stable isotopic analysis anion cation and nutrient are 10 50 50 and 50 ml respectively total alkalinity was measured in situ with titration kits hach co the samples for cation analysis were acidified with hno3 acros co major ion and stable isotope samples were stored under 4 c before analysis and nutrient samples were stored frozen before till analysis radon 222 samples were taken with glass vails 250 ml sealed with robber caps and parafilms before measurement the sampling and storage follow the protocol of rad7 h2o accessory durridge 2001 radon samples were measured with rad7 h2o accessory durridge co within 2 3 days after sampling to avoid significant decay loss for the radium samples 2 5 liters groundwater and 10 liters river water were pumped with a peristaltic pump solinst co and passed through 0 5 μm filter cartridges and then through 20 g mno2 fiber to extract the dissolved radium nuclides moore 1976 short lived radium isotopes 223ra and 224ra were detected with radium delayed coincidence counter radecc system generally 224ra was detected within one week after the sampling a second measurement was conducted within 7 10 days after the sampling to detect 223ra the samples were kept for about 1 month and a third measurement was made to detect 228th and corrected for supported 224ra luo and jiao 2016 luo et al 2014 moore and arnold 1996 moore et al 2006 the fibers were kept for more than one year to allow the ingrowth of 228th supported by 228ra decay a fourth measurement was then made by radecc to detect 228th based on which the initial 228ra was calculated charette et al 2015 luo et al 2018 moore 2008 moore and arnold 1996 the samples were kept sealed for more than three weeks to allow 226ra to reach secular equilibrium with daughter nuclide 222rn and detected with rad7 in air as described by kim et al 2001 and lee et al 2012 the uncertainties of 224ra 223ra 228ra and 226ra were calculated to be 7 15 12 20 10 15 and 15 20 respectively based on the approaches in previous studies garcia solsona et al 2008 liu et al 2017 moore and arnold 1996 stable isotopes were measured with oa icos laser absorption spectrometer los gatos research lgr triple isotope water analyzer tiwa 45ep at state key laboratory of marine geology tongji university shanghai the measurement procedures are described in details in previous studies luo et al 2017a 2017b 3 results 3 1 physio chemical parameters the results of the basic physical and chemical parameters and concentrations of major ions nutrients and talk and other tracer elements are listed in table s1 the piper diagram fig 3 indicates the geochemical evolution of groundwater in the prd the groundwater is normally fresh inland and saline at the coast the inland groundwater mostly belongs to the ca hco3 2 type or nahco3 type and is characterized by low salinity and cl concentration the groundwater type turns into nacl type towards the coastal end of the cross section i i fig 1 exhibiting seawater signals this trend is reasonable as the upper end of the cross section is mainly affected by the xijiang and beijiang rivers which pass through limestone areas in the southwest of china and are highly concentrated in bicarbonates cai et al 2004 dai et al 2008 previous studies have indicated that the saline water in m1 and m2 units is older than the fresh groundwater in the inland end of the cross section wang and jiao 2012 the regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd is driven by the horizontal and vertical hydraulic gradients wang and jiao 2012 yang et al 2014 and has been proven to be a vital process in delivering large chemical fluxes to the coasts basu et al 2001 charette et al 2013 harvey 2002 polizzotto et al 2008 the prd groundwater contains abnormally high nh4 up to 22000 μm elevated as up to 161 μg l 1 due to the remineralization and degradation of sedimentary organic matter and doc table s1 the groundwater is also enriched in ba up to 66 μm table s1 due to the desorption of ba from the aquifer grains under hypersaline environment moore 1997 and sr up to 114 μm table s1 due to the strong carbonate weathering in the pearl river system when its two major tributaries pass through the limestone areas dai et al 2008 moreover the prd groundwater contains talk up to 29000 μm table s1 these highly concentrated chemicals in groundwater potentially supply significant contaminants and solutes to the coastal waters via the tgd 3 2 stable isotopes different groundwater endmembers show distinctive isotopic compositions for river water n 4 18o ranges from 7 5 to 5 7 with an average of 6 7 and 2h from 50 8 to 38 9 with an average of 45 2 for groundwater n 100 18o ranges from 6 6 to 1 6 with an average of 4 9 and 2h from 44 7 to 9 9 with an average of 31 8 the stable 2h and 18o compositions are isotopically depleted in the inland fresh groundwater and enriched in the seaward saline groundwater fig 4a 4c with a regional isotopic relation of δ d 6 24 δ 18o 1 57 fig 4c stable isotopic compositions also show overall linear increase with cl concentrations suggesting regional groundwater is the mixture of isotopically enriched seawater and isotopically depleted fresh groundwater the distributions of stable 2h and 18o isotopic compositions fig 4a c along the sampling cross section i i also suggest that the aquifer system in the subaerial region of the pearl river lde is experiencing the mixing of freshwater groundwater and saline water 3 3 radium isotopes all the radium quartet results in groundwater and river water are shown in table s2 for the inland river water n 21 224ra 223ra 226ra and 228ra range from 15 1 1 1 to 36 1 2 5 dpm 100 l 1 0 to 0 5 0 1 dpm 100 l 1 12 4 to 18 4 dpm 100 l 1 6 3 to 70 5 dpm 100 l 1 with an average of 22 3 1 6 dpm 100 l 1 0 2 0 1 dpm 100 l 1 14 5 4 5 dpm 100 l 1 and 30 3 2 8 dpm 100 l 1 respectively for the groundwater n 4 224ra 223ra 226ra and 228ra range from 15 8 1 1 to 3285 230 dpm 100 l 1 0 to 67 4 8 1 dpm 100 l 1 0 to 1269 218 dpm 100 l 1 5 2 to 2806 199 dpm 100 l 1 with an average of 635 26 dpm 100 l 1 8 7 1 dpm 100 l 1 327 56 dpm 100 l 1 and 475 33 dpm 100 l 1 respectively for better visualization all the radium results are plotted on the semi log coordinates fig 4d f shows the relations of 223ra versus 224ra 224ra versus 228ra and 226ra versus 228ra in groundwater end member generally 223ra 228ra are positively correlated with 224ra with a linear relationship of 224ra 45 3 223ra 239 6 r2 0 76 p 0 05 and 224ra 1 23 228ra 50 7 r2 0 98 p 0 05 respectively 226ra is also positively correlated with 228ra with a linear relationship of 226ra 0 463 228ra 107 6 r2 0 80 p 0 05 in the groundwater end member radium quartet concentrations are usually low at the northwest of the prd and increase toward the coast this spatial trend is similar to that of stable 2h and 18o isotopes and salinity fig 4a c the radium nuclides are plotted versus cl concentration to examine the dominant process in controlling the nuclide occurrence and behaviors radium isotopes are all linearly correlated with the cl concentrations with the relations of 224ra 0 17 cl 161 6 223ra 0 003 cl 0 14 226ra 0 07 cl 132 1 and 228ra 0 14 cl 84 8 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra fig 5 the primary controlling process of radium activities within the prd aquifers is adsorption desorption which is similar to what is reported by kiro et al 2012 and kiro et al 2013 who show that 224ra is linearly correlated with salinity in the aquifers of the dead sea radium quartet activities in the surface water are all less than 1 dpm l 1 due to their high affinity to the particulates in fresh environments 4 discussion 4 1 radium reactive transport model this study derives a radium reactive transport model to quantify the tgd in the ldes the traditional radium models used in the sgd studies have been constructed mostly based on the mass balance by neglecting all the transport and reaction processes within the coastal aquifers these models are advantageous to quantify the total sgd including both fresh components and recirculated components however cannot be used to quantify the reactive transport processes within the coastal aquifer systems the model used in this study however provides the constraints of mean transit time mtt and therefore can be deployed to quantify the net terrestrial groundwater in the ldes as indicated in fig 2 the sources of radionuclide in groundwater include α recoil from parent isotopes in the solid phase weathering decay from parent isotope in dissolve phase and desorption from sorbed phase the sinks of the nuclide in the groundwater include adsorption and precipitation to sorbed phase and radioactive decay after confirming all the sinks and sources of the radionuclide within the groundwater system the concentration of i nuclide in groundwater at a given time t and distance x along the flow line can be written as 1 d c i d t v d c i d x p w p r c a d k 1 f λ p c a d p λ p c p q c i λ i c i k 1 c i under steady regional groundwater flow setting d c i d t 0 d c i d x is the advection term p w dpm l 1 s 1 is the input of nuclide i from weathering p r dpm l 1 s 1 is α recoil rate v m s 1 is darcy flow velocity k 1 s 1 and k 1 s 1 are the adsorption and desorption constants for nuclide i respectively c i dpm l 1 and c p dpm l 1 are the concentrations of nuclide i and its parent isotope in groundwater respectively c a d dpm g 1 and c a d p dpm g 1 are the concentration of nuclide i and its parent isotope in the sorbed phase respectively f is the fraction of nuclide i produced by its parent in sorbed phase and recoiled into groundwater q dpm l 1 s 1 is the precipitation rate of nuclide i λ i s 1 and λ p s 1 are decay constants of nuclide i and its parent isotope respectively alpha recoil is regarded as the main source of nuclide i in groundwater ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 with a ratio of p w p r 10 5 the weathering input for radium nuclide and 222rn is negligible porcelli 2008 thus eq 1 can be reduced to 2 v d c i d x p r c a d k 1 f λ p c a d p λ p c p q c i λ i c i k 1 c i under steady state for the sorbed phase adsorption is balanced by desorption and decay as indicated by the following equation 3 k 1 c i c a d k 1 λ i c a d the partition coefficient of nuclide i between the dissolved phase and sorbed phase are characterized by a dimensionless distribution k i and expressed as krishnaswami et al 1982 ku et al 1992 4 k i c a d c i k 1 k 1 λ i more specifically retardation factor r f i is introduced to represent the nuclide retardation in the form of k i krishnaswami et al 1982 5 r f i c a d c i c i 1 k i r f i is a vital parameter in governing radionuclide i transport in groundwater system as it reflects the migration rate of nuclide i in related to the groundwater flow rate given that nuclide i produced by parent isotopes via recoil in the sorbed phase can be completely released into dissolved phase f 1 eq 2 can be reduced to 6 v d c i d x p r c p λ p r f p q c i λ i c i r f i where r f p is the retardation factor of the parent isotope of nuclide i eq 6 is the governing equation used for the radium quartet and radon transport in groundwater system in this study in the equation λ i c i r f i represents retardation effect of nuclide i p r is the recoil rate c p λ p r f p represents retardation effect of the parent isotope of nuclide i and q c i is the precipitation effect with the boundary condition of c t 0 c 0 radionuclide activities in the recharge rainfall and surface water the analytical solution of eq 6 is written as 7 c i p r λ p c p r f p λ i r f i q 1 e λ i r f i q v x c 0 e λ i r f i q v x the activity of nuclide i a i c i λ can be expressed as 8 a i p r λ p a p r f p λ i r f i q 1 e r f i q λ i x v a 0 e λ i r f i q v x in eq 8 a i is finally the function of water transit time τ w x v considering darcy velocity v is the mean velocity along the flow line the mtt can be obtained by solving this equation 4 2 recoil rate and retardation of radium and radon eq 8 characterizes the radionuclide distribution along the flow line in a groundwater system and can be used to calculate the parameters such as r f τ w v and p r to quantify these parameters some approximations are made for specific radium nuclide as indicated by krishnaswami et al 1982 and tricca et al 2000 224ra and 228ra reach a steady state within a residence time several minutes and a short distance 20 m along the flow line both their residence time and equilibrium distance are significantly low compared to water residence time and the domain of groundwater system in the pearl river ldes therefore both 224ra and 228ra can be assigned to be under steady states similar to the presumption in studies of other local scale coastal groundwater systems luo et al 2000 tricca et al 2000 2001 because the decay constant and adsorption rate of 224ra and 228ra are orders of magnitude larger than precipitation rates in groundwater system precipitation is negligible kiro et al 2013 porcelli 2008 thus eq 8 for 224ra and 228ra can be reduced to 9 a 224 p r 224 r f t 228 h a t 228 h r f r 224 a 10 a 228 p r 228 r f t 232 h a t 232 h r f r 228 a the recoil input for 228th is negligible due to the significant low energy of β recoil from the parent nuclide 228ra thus the solution for 228th can be reduced to r f t 232 h a t 228 h r f t 232 h a r 228 a based on which eqs 9 10 can be reduced to 11 a 224 p r 224 p r 228 r f t 232 h a t 232 h r f r 224 a under secular equilibrium there is p r 224 p r 228 in the solid phase porcelli 2008 hence eq 11 is reduced to 12 a 228 2 p r 224 r f 232 t h a t 232 h r f r 224 a as the desorption rate is much smaller than the adsorption rate or k i 1 luo et al 2000 then eq 8 leads to the approximate identical retardation factor of radium quartet thus r f r 224 a r f r 226 a r f r 228 a r f r a dividing eq 12 with eq 11 leads to 13 a 224 a 228 2 p r 224 r f t 232 h a t 232 h p r 224 r f t 232 h a t 232 h 1 p r 224 p r 224 r f t 232 h a t 232 h according to eq 13 the activity ratio ar of 224ra to 228ra approaches 2 if the aquifer system is dominated by α recoil from the solid phase and approaches 1 if the aquifer system is well weathered with high 232th concentration in the sorbed phase ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 fig 4e shows that the average ratio of 224ra 228ra tends to be 1 23 close to the value recommended by davidson and dickson 1986 which indicates that 224ra and 228ra reach a steady state along the flow line ar of 224ra to 228ra is close to 1 suggesting that the aquifer grains are well weathered as one might expect from the high mean temperature and fast vegetation growth at the lower reach of the pearl river system substituting the slope 1 23 of 224ra versus 228ra into eq 13 one has p r 224 0 3 r f t 232 h this indicates that α recoil input of radium nuclides is less than that derived from the decay of the sorbed 232th and the aquifer grains are well weathered with abundant 232th on the surface coating luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 thus compared to the α recoil radium isotopes in the groundwater are predominantly controlled by the adsorption desorption process as described above the process of adsorption desorption can be characterized by the parameter of retardation factor r f 222rn as an inert gas nuclide won t be adsorbed on the aquifer grains thus r f rn 1 as a result eq 8 for 222rn can be reduced to 14 a 222 r n p r 222 r f r 226 a a r 226 a eq 14 indicates that 222rn in the aquifer is mostly sourced from α recoil and the decay of 226ra in the sorbed and dissolved phases the 238u and 232th compositions of the soil grains within the prd are measured to be 140 37 bq kg and 187 80 bq kg n 796 song et al 2012 respectively leading to p r 226 p r 224 228 0 75 under secular equilibrium substituting this ratio into eqs 9 10 and 14 leads to the solutions of p r 222 p r 224 and r f r a in the form of 222rn 224ra and 228ra concentrations 15 r f r a a 222 r n a 226 r a 0 75 a 224 r a a 228 r a 16 p r 222 0 75 a 222 r n a 224 r a a 228 r a a 226 r a 0 75 a 224 r a a 228 r a 17 p r 224 a 222 r n a 224 r a a 228 r a a 226 r a 0 75 a 224 r a a 228 r a the values of p r 222 p r 224 and r f r a are calculated with the data of a 222 r n a 224 r a a 226 r a and a 228 r a based on eqs 15 17 and the results are listed in table s3 r f ra ranges from 31 2 to 294 with an average of 123 the obtained r f ra is much smaller than the results of groundwater in aquifers in the little lost delta r f 3600 70000 under freshwater dominant environment but much larger than the radium retardation factor in the dead sea coastal aquifer r f 1 86 as one may expect much lower retardation factor of radium under the super high saline environment kiro et al 2012 2013 the alpha recoil rates of 232th series and 238u series are respectively calculated to be from 19 to 214 atoms l 1 min 1 within an average of 78 atoms l 1 min 1 and from 19 to 161 atoms l 1 min 1 with an average of 59 atoms l 1 min 1 table s3 the recoil rate is in line with the results of radionuclides in the aquifers of the little lost river delta suggesting similar physical structures and compositions of the aquifer grains in the two aquifer systems johnson et al 2000 4 3 mtt and tgd along the flow line the precipitation effect for 226ra is not negligible porcelli 2008 under steady state the solution for 226ra reactive transport model is reduced to 18 a r 226 a p r 226 r f t 230 h a t 230 h r f r 226 a q λ 226 thus ar of 226ra to 228ra can be written as 19 a 226 a 228 p r 226 r f t 230 h a t 230 h r f r 226 a q λ 226 p r 224 r f t 232 h a t 232 h r f r 228 a luo et al 2000 indicated that r f 230 t h r f 232 t h due to the strong adsorption rate of the nuclides in the aquifer system hence the ar of 226ra to 228ra tends to equal the α recoil rate of 226ra to that of 228ra which is eventually equal to the activity ratios ars of 238u to 232th in the solid phase under secular equilibrium gill et al 1992 porcelli 2008 thus when the precipitation effect is not considered the ars of a 228 a 226 equals 0 75 in the groundwater under steady state fig 4f shows that the slope of 226ra versus 228ra is 0 46 in groundwater of prd p 0 05 much lower than the ars of 0 75 under steady state precipitation of radium and the unsteady condition would be both the causative factor of much lower slope of 226ra versus 228ra in the groundwater wang and jiao 2012 indicated that the basal aquifer is highly depleted in sulfur as a result of extensive precipitation of caso4 suggesting that the dominant precipitant is caso4 radium isotopes have high affinity to the precipitates of barite baso4 and celestine srso4 with a distribution coefficient of 1 2 and 296 respectively kiro et al 2012 rosenberg et al 2011 zhu 2004 but have significantly low affinity to caso4 precipitates with a distribution coefficient 0 1 ichikuni and musha 1978 which leads to negligible radium precipitation in the prd groundwater system thus the low ratios of ar of 226ra to 228ra would be ascribed to the unsteady state of 226ra between dissolved and solid phases along the flow line therefore the solution of 226ra reactive transport model eq 8 can be reduced to 20 a 226 p r 226 a 230 r f 230 r f 226 1 e r f 226 τ a 0 e r f 226 τ eq 20 provides constraints to quantify the mtt in the prd groundwater system 232th and 230th have strong affinity to the aquifer grains thus r f 232th r f 230th luo et al 2000 a 230 and a 232 in the groundwater are mainly from the weathering of the aquifer grains and ars of a 230 and a 232 may be equal to the ar of a 230 and a 232 in the aquifer grains ivanovich and harmon 1992 porcelli 2008 thus a 230 r f 230 0 75 a 232 r f 232 2 5 p r 224 3 33 p r 226 based on which eq 20 can be approximately written as 21 a 226 4 33 p r 226 r f 226 1 e r f 226 τ λ 226 a 0 e r f 226 τ λ 226 thus mtt can be calculated with the field data of a 0 and a 226 and the obtained p r 226 and r f 226 are presented in table s3 the mtt is calculated to be from 5 7 to 220 yrs within an average of 54 8 yrs as the horizontal hydraulic gradient is quite small wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 and the groundwater recharge rate could be calculated based on groundwater sampling depth and the estimated mtt the mtt of radium isotopes obtained here represents the time spent since it is generated from the grains or rock undergoes reactions such as adsorption desorption and decay and finally reaches the sampling locations the mtt in this study is subject to both transport and reactive processes and the model already integrates the information of both porosity and effective surface areas when parameterizing the reactive parameter of alpha recoil and retardation therefore the variability of mtt in this study is ascribed to the variability of reaction parameters to assess the magnitude of uncertainty of radium reactive transport model the sensitivity of estimated mtt to changes in other variables is examined a sensitivity coefficient f is proposed to evaluate this uncertainty according to langston et al 2013 22 f δ τ r a τ r a δ y i y i where δ τ r a is the amount of change in mtt of radium isotopes from the original value τ r a δ y i is the amount of change in the other variable of y i from the original value y i usually higher f represents larger uncertainty of final mtt estimate the uncertainty mainly stems from radium isotope measurements in different water endmembers alpha recoil rates p r and retardation factors r f of radium in the groundwater system the uncertainties of radium isotope measurement are about 10 15 as indicated in eqs 14 and 15 the uncertainties of p r and r f are also subject to the activities of radium isotopes therefore the final mtt estimate has an uncertainty of 45 60 4 4 the estimations of tgd and the derived chemical loadings as discussed previously basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 the average groundwater recharge rate at a sampling site can be estimated by dividing the sampling depth by the mtt and then multiplying by the porosity h ϕ τ t the groundwater recharge rates are subject to rather high spatial heterogeneity of radium mtt as aforementioned and calculated to be 0 04 0 53 m yr 1 with an average of 0 2 0 14 m yr 1 the median one quartile and three quartile values of aquifer recharge rates are calculated to be 0 18 0 10 and 0 25 mm yr 1 with a subaerial area of 9000 km2 excluding hong kong the tgd was calculated to be 1 8 0 4 4 8 x 109 m3 yr 1 which is about 0 8 0 2 2 1 of the annual discharge of the pearl river system it is possible that the obtained tgd including portion of base flow to the river channels however based on the topographic and geomorphology settings of the pearl river ldes the river channels have bathymetry of only a few meters and are considered to be connected with the groundwater from shallow unconfined aquifer the sampling stations of this study however are predominantly located at the basal aquifers of t1 and t2 jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 therefore the contribution of river base flow to the tgd which is mainly based on sampling in the basal aquifer is considered to be minimal in this study the regional flow direction of the groundwater system is indicated to be from the northwest to the southeast fig 6 a and the groundwater system is experiencing mixing of fresh surface water and saline seawater as shown by the stable isotopes fig 4f h and groundwater pipe diagrams fig 3 nh4 loading is of particular interest as the regional salty groundwater is abnormally enriched in ammonium jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 and is widely distributed in the aquifer system of the pearl river lde extending from inland to the offshore within an area up to 1800 km2 cai et al 2015 jiao et al 2010 kwong and jiao 2016 the high ammonium 10 mg l 1 is suggested to be existential within a vast area of 1800 km2 with the pearl river ldes jiao et al 2010 with the tgd of 0 2 m yr 1 obtained from the radium reactive transport model and the mean nh4 concentration in the high ammonium groundwater 5 9 mm the tgd induced nh4 loading to the surface water is estimated to be 2 4 109 mol yr 1 fig 6e the terrestrial groundwater borne nh4 is nearly 42 of the sewage loading of 5 6 109 mol yr 1 and about 5 of the pearl river fluvial loading of 48 8 109 mol yr 1 fig 6e generally organic matter degradation follows the sequence of aerobic respiration denitrification iron fe and manganese mn oxide reduction sulfate reduction and methanogenesis arndt et al 2013 regnier et al 2011 if nh4 is released from the decaying redfield ratio rr organic matter by o2 oxidation the upper limit of nh4 is calculated to be 0 04 mm in fresh groundwater however nh4 concentration is observed to be much larger than 0 04 mm in fresh groundwater the concentrations of no3 fe and mn oxides are also 2 orders of magnitude low compared to the nh4 concentration huang et al 2018a 2018b jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 indicating insignificant nh4 diagenesis from denitrification and fe mn oxide reduction thus the abnormally high nh4 concentration is predominantly ascribed to the processes of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in the organic matter and slat enriched aquitards larsen et al 2017 wang and jiao 2012 as soon as seawater enters this system organic matter is oxidized by reaction with enriched sulfate fig 6b meanwhile nh4 and sulfide accumulate as sulfate reduction byproducts eq 22 high concentration of so4 2 in saline water allows much more organic carbon can be oxidized compared to a freshwater system jakobsen and postma 1994 this leads to much higher nh4 concentrations in saline groundwater fig 6c the good correlation of sulfate depletion δso4 2 versus nh4 concentrations δso4 2 0 57 cl 0 48 r2 0 57 n 157 fig 6c stresses the hypothesis that high nh4 concentration is mainly ascribed to high so4 2 reduction the fact that the nh4 concentrations are well correlated with the cl concentrations fig 7 further indicates the conservative mixing and transport in the regional groundwater system if the organic matter has a rr of n c of 16 106 the maximum nh4 that can be released by organic matter remineralization is 8 5 mm l when the oceanic so4 2 28 mm is completely depleted according to the following equation fig 6c 23 c h 2 o 106 n h 3 16 h 3 p o 4 53 s o 4 2 106 h c o 3 16 n h 4 h p o 4 2 53 h s 39 h however some nh4 concentrations are found much higher than 8 5 mm which is likely caused by significantly high nh4 in initial fresh groundwater before experiencing sulfate reduction fig 6c and other remineralization processes such as fe mn oxide reduction and methanogenesis as described elsewhere burdige and komada 2013 jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 as suggested by burdige and komada 2013 the stoichiometry of the deep remineralization processes can also be a possible reason for the much higher ammonium concentration in the groundwater in regional groundwater of pearl river lde conditions in the pearl river lde affect other important components namely doc talk as sr and ba in highly reducing saline environments these components have low affinity to the aquifer grains and are highly mobile basu et al 2001 datta et al 2009 dowling et al 2003 moore 1997 polizzotto et al 2008 wang and jiao 2012 allowing their transport towards the coasts using the mean concentrations of these components and ones previously discussed in the regional groundwater table s1 and the estimated tgd the terrestrial groundwater derived chemical fluxes are estimated as shown in fig 8 to put the results in a global context the significant tgd derived chemical fluxes in the pearl river lde are compared with the dissolved constituent loadings of the world largest rivers the tgd derived nh4 loading is mostly larger than the fluvial loadings of the largest rivers to the chinese seas fig 8c and even exceeding the fluvial loadings of the some world largest rivers such as yukon huanghe and kolyma rivers fig 8d the tgd derived talk and doc loadings in the pearl river lde are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the world largest rivers the large tgd derived ba and sr fluxes commensurable in magnitude to their groundwater fluxes in the ganges brahmaputra lde basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 moore 1997 are also in the ranges of the loadings of some of the world largest rivers such as godavari and kolyma rivers fig 8f and g the as flux of tgd also rivals the loadings from the world largest rivers such as yukon huanghe and pearl rivers fig 8h 5 conclusion in conclusion based on the disequilibrium of 226ra between solute and dissolved phases the study develops a radium reactive transport model to estimate the mtt in the pearl river lde thereafter tgd over the pearl river lde is estimated to be 1 8 0 4 4 8 x 109 m3 yr 1 although the tgd is less than 1 of the pear river discharge the tgd derived chemical fluxes are found to be commensurable in magnitude to the loadings of pearl river and most of the largest rivers in the world this study indicates the tgd derived chemical fluxes are significant and would serve as an important component to their oceanic budgets the groundwater bone contaminants within the urbanized ldes are tremendous and required for considerable attention in the future studies the understanding of groundwater borne chemical fluxes and the investigation of contaminant sources are of vital significance in ecosystem reservations environmental protection and the health of the residents in the highly urbanized lde both hydrodynamics and redox condition mediate the biogeochemical processes and chemical exports in the ldes therefore future studies will be conducted to 1 reveal how the groundwater hydrodynamics impacts the biogeochemical cycling and exports based on numerical modeling 2 constrain the diagenetic processes of c n s system based on carbon and nitrogen isotopic approaches and 3 investigate the generation of base flow in the river channels in the pearl river ldes and its contribution to tgd and chemical exports based on natural tracers of 222rn and numerical modeling approaches

19392,the shores of the pearl river estuary are home to 35 million people their wastes are discharged into the large river delta front estuary lde one of the most highly polluted systems in the world here we construct a radium reactive transport model to estimate the terrestrial groundwater discharge tgd into the highly urbanized pearl river lde we find the tgd comprises only approximately 0 9 in term of water discharge compared to the river discharge the tgd in the pearl river lde delivers significant chemical fluxes to the coast which are comparable to the fluvial loadings from pearl river and other world major rivers of particular importance is the flux of ammonium because of its considerable role in pearl river estuary eutrophication and hypoxia unlike the ammonium in many other aquifers the ammonium in the pearl river aquifer system is natural and originated from organic matter remineralization by sulfate reduction in the extremely reducing environment the tgd derived nh4 is as much as 5 of the upstream pearl river fluvial loading and 42 of the anthropogenic inputs this high groundwater nh4 flux may greatly intensify the eutrophication shift the trophic states and lead to alarming hypoxia within the affected ecosystems in the pearl river lde the large tgd derived chemical fluxes will lead to deterioration of water and will potentially affect human health keywords the large river delta front estuary lde of pearl river terrestrial groundwater discharge radium ammonium reactive transport model 1 introduction large river delta front estuaries lde represent vital interfaces between continents and the oceans for water and material fluxes basu et al 2001 bianchi and allison 2009 lde cover subaerial and subaqueous delta systems of major rivers including inland areas such as deltaic plain and lowland floodplain and offshore areas that may extend to the continental shelf lde are very productive regions and usually support large human populations and thus are influenced by intensive human activities such irrigation sewage discharge and land reclamations basu et al 2001 fendorf et al 2010 harvey et al 2002 tessler et al 2015 comprised of terrestrial groundwater and circulated seawater submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been widely considered as a significant process in delivering terrestrial chemicals such as nutrients dissolved carbon and trace elements to coastal zones michael et al 2005 moore 1996 2010 slomp and van cappellen 2004 endeavors are made by researchers to partition fresh groundwater discharge and the circulated seawater through approaches of numerical modeling befus et al 2017 michael et al 2005 analytical approximations li et al 1999 and regional water balances basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 based on uraniumthorium u th series disequilibrium researchers have also attempted to quantify key processes within coastal aquifers such as adsorption desorption co precipitation weathering α recoil advective flow and water transit time porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2001 as nuclides in the u th series radium isotopes and 222rn are also capable of providing constraints to quantify these processes luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 isotopes of radium have also been widely used as tracers to quantify sgd and residence time in different coastal environments kiro et al 2013 moore 1996 rodellas et al 2015 however to date there have been limited studies to evaluate ldes groundwater dynamics and quantify the terrestrial groundwater and chemical fluxes based on radium reactive transport models although previous theoretical studies have indicated that radium isotopes and their activity ratios of river and groundwater could be as tracers of groundwater mass transports porcelli 2008 porcelli and swarzenski 2003 in the ldes the aquifer aquitard systems were formed by the periodical quaternary deposition during sea transgression and regression the salts in the marine units will be leached into the basal aquifers leading to the salinization of regional groundwater therefore the terms of terrestrial groundwater discharge tgd rather than fresh submarine groundwater discharge is proposed in this study as the former contains portion of salts leached form marine units larsen et al 2017 the ldes deposits are usually characterized by high organic matter concentration and the groundwater system of the ldes is subject to anoxic condition and relative high salinity due to the leaching of salts from marine units these settings are favorable for the enrichment of chemicals of lde groundwater and their mobility basu et al 2001 polizzotto et al 2008 wang and jiao 2012 therefore the tgd will lead to disproportionate chemical loadings to the coasts what s more although there are many studies focusing on the riverine chemical and sediment fluxes in the lde basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 moore 1997 but studies on groundwater derived chemical fluxes at the scale of lde are very limited this study investigated tgd and the resulting chemical fluxes to the coasts in the lde of the pearl river system this lde is intensively influenced by anthropogenic activities due to the rapid urbanization and the groundwater system of the lde has proven to be the natural reservoir of chemicals such as nh4 however there is no attempt to quantify tgd derived chemicals loadings to the coasts of the pearl river ldes the investigation of tgd in the pearl river ldes advances the understanding of terrestrial groundwater borne chemicals in the lde and is instructive for the ldes management and ecological restoration elsewhere tessler et al 2015 2 methodology 2 1 study area the pearl river located at the north margin of the south china sea scs is the second largest river in china in terms of water discharge the pearl river system has three tributaries namely xijiang river dongjiang river and beijiang river fig 1 a with a discharge of 3 6 1011 m3 yr 1 the three tributaries deliver a sediment loading of 85 106 tons yr 1 into the subaqueous area of the pearl river lde including the three subestuaries modaomen huangmaohai and lingdingyang also referred as pearl river estuary or pre dai et al 2013 harrison et al 2008 however the sediment loads declined to 30 106 since 2006 after the construction of the longtan dam and baise dam at the middle reach of the pearl river wu et al 2012 as the largest tributary xijiang river contributes 77 of the freshwater discharge and about 86 of sediment loadings zhou et al 2006 about 80 of the annual discharge and 95 of the sediment loadings in the pearl river system occur in the summer season harrison et al 2008 the pearl river delta prd forms the subaerial lde which has an area of around 9000 km2 and a population of more than 35 million dai et al 2008 due to rapid urbanization and industrialization since 1950 on average about 40 109 m3 yr 1 industrial wastewater and domestic sewage are discharged into the subaqueous region of the lde abnormally high nh4 concentrations up to 22000 μm and elevated as ba sr and no3 and dip are found in the basal aquifers of the prd jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2012 the regional groundwater also contains high total alkalinity talk mainly due to two reasons 1 limestone dissolution loadings in the upper streams cai et al 2008 wang and jiao 2012 and 2 the degradation of organic matter in the groundwater and aquifer grains jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2012 extremely high nh4 and low dissolved oxygen were observed in the sub estuaries leading to alarming hypoxia and water pollution dai et al 2008 yin and harrison 2008 the enrichments of those pollutants in the subaqueous areas have been attributed to riverine inputs sedimentary release and benthic porewater fluxes cai et al 2008 2015 cheung et al 2003 2 2 field works chemical analysis and data compilations in order to examine the magnitude of tgd and the derived chemical fluxes to the coast a series of sampling activities and field work were conducted from 2006 to 2016 in the prd and hong kong fig 1a systematical groundwater sampling activities were conducted along the cross section between guangzhou and zhongshan fig 1 the quaternary deposit was dominated by four stratigraphic units 1 an old terrestrial unit t2 2 an old marine unit m2 3 a young terrestrial unit t1 and 4 a young marine unit m1 fig 1b jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 groundwater from boreholes piezometers and farm wells and porewater from the sediment cores was sampled from t1 and t2 and analyzed for various geochemical parameters including nutrients nh4 no3 and dissolved inorganic phosphate or dip dissolved carbon doc and talk trace elements as ba and sr and stable and radiogenic isotopes such as 18o and 2h and 222rn and radium isotopes water samples for chemical analysis were filtered with 0 45 μm syringe filters advantec co briefly the sample volumes for stable isotopic analysis anion cation and nutrient are 10 50 50 and 50 ml respectively total alkalinity was measured in situ with titration kits hach co the samples for cation analysis were acidified with hno3 acros co major ion and stable isotope samples were stored under 4 c before analysis and nutrient samples were stored frozen before till analysis radon 222 samples were taken with glass vails 250 ml sealed with robber caps and parafilms before measurement the sampling and storage follow the protocol of rad7 h2o accessory durridge 2001 radon samples were measured with rad7 h2o accessory durridge co within 2 3 days after sampling to avoid significant decay loss for the radium samples 2 5 liters groundwater and 10 liters river water were pumped with a peristaltic pump solinst co and passed through 0 5 μm filter cartridges and then through 20 g mno2 fiber to extract the dissolved radium nuclides moore 1976 short lived radium isotopes 223ra and 224ra were detected with radium delayed coincidence counter radecc system generally 224ra was detected within one week after the sampling a second measurement was conducted within 7 10 days after the sampling to detect 223ra the samples were kept for about 1 month and a third measurement was made to detect 228th and corrected for supported 224ra luo and jiao 2016 luo et al 2014 moore and arnold 1996 moore et al 2006 the fibers were kept for more than one year to allow the ingrowth of 228th supported by 228ra decay a fourth measurement was then made by radecc to detect 228th based on which the initial 228ra was calculated charette et al 2015 luo et al 2018 moore 2008 moore and arnold 1996 the samples were kept sealed for more than three weeks to allow 226ra to reach secular equilibrium with daughter nuclide 222rn and detected with rad7 in air as described by kim et al 2001 and lee et al 2012 the uncertainties of 224ra 223ra 228ra and 226ra were calculated to be 7 15 12 20 10 15 and 15 20 respectively based on the approaches in previous studies garcia solsona et al 2008 liu et al 2017 moore and arnold 1996 stable isotopes were measured with oa icos laser absorption spectrometer los gatos research lgr triple isotope water analyzer tiwa 45ep at state key laboratory of marine geology tongji university shanghai the measurement procedures are described in details in previous studies luo et al 2017a 2017b 3 results 3 1 physio chemical parameters the results of the basic physical and chemical parameters and concentrations of major ions nutrients and talk and other tracer elements are listed in table s1 the piper diagram fig 3 indicates the geochemical evolution of groundwater in the prd the groundwater is normally fresh inland and saline at the coast the inland groundwater mostly belongs to the ca hco3 2 type or nahco3 type and is characterized by low salinity and cl concentration the groundwater type turns into nacl type towards the coastal end of the cross section i i fig 1 exhibiting seawater signals this trend is reasonable as the upper end of the cross section is mainly affected by the xijiang and beijiang rivers which pass through limestone areas in the southwest of china and are highly concentrated in bicarbonates cai et al 2004 dai et al 2008 previous studies have indicated that the saline water in m1 and m2 units is older than the fresh groundwater in the inland end of the cross section wang and jiao 2012 the regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd is driven by the horizontal and vertical hydraulic gradients wang and jiao 2012 yang et al 2014 and has been proven to be a vital process in delivering large chemical fluxes to the coasts basu et al 2001 charette et al 2013 harvey 2002 polizzotto et al 2008 the prd groundwater contains abnormally high nh4 up to 22000 μm elevated as up to 161 μg l 1 due to the remineralization and degradation of sedimentary organic matter and doc table s1 the groundwater is also enriched in ba up to 66 μm table s1 due to the desorption of ba from the aquifer grains under hypersaline environment moore 1997 and sr up to 114 μm table s1 due to the strong carbonate weathering in the pearl river system when its two major tributaries pass through the limestone areas dai et al 2008 moreover the prd groundwater contains talk up to 29000 μm table s1 these highly concentrated chemicals in groundwater potentially supply significant contaminants and solutes to the coastal waters via the tgd 3 2 stable isotopes different groundwater endmembers show distinctive isotopic compositions for river water n 4 18o ranges from 7 5 to 5 7 with an average of 6 7 and 2h from 50 8 to 38 9 with an average of 45 2 for groundwater n 100 18o ranges from 6 6 to 1 6 with an average of 4 9 and 2h from 44 7 to 9 9 with an average of 31 8 the stable 2h and 18o compositions are isotopically depleted in the inland fresh groundwater and enriched in the seaward saline groundwater fig 4a 4c with a regional isotopic relation of δ d 6 24 δ 18o 1 57 fig 4c stable isotopic compositions also show overall linear increase with cl concentrations suggesting regional groundwater is the mixture of isotopically enriched seawater and isotopically depleted fresh groundwater the distributions of stable 2h and 18o isotopic compositions fig 4a c along the sampling cross section i i also suggest that the aquifer system in the subaerial region of the pearl river lde is experiencing the mixing of freshwater groundwater and saline water 3 3 radium isotopes all the radium quartet results in groundwater and river water are shown in table s2 for the inland river water n 21 224ra 223ra 226ra and 228ra range from 15 1 1 1 to 36 1 2 5 dpm 100 l 1 0 to 0 5 0 1 dpm 100 l 1 12 4 to 18 4 dpm 100 l 1 6 3 to 70 5 dpm 100 l 1 with an average of 22 3 1 6 dpm 100 l 1 0 2 0 1 dpm 100 l 1 14 5 4 5 dpm 100 l 1 and 30 3 2 8 dpm 100 l 1 respectively for the groundwater n 4 224ra 223ra 226ra and 228ra range from 15 8 1 1 to 3285 230 dpm 100 l 1 0 to 67 4 8 1 dpm 100 l 1 0 to 1269 218 dpm 100 l 1 5 2 to 2806 199 dpm 100 l 1 with an average of 635 26 dpm 100 l 1 8 7 1 dpm 100 l 1 327 56 dpm 100 l 1 and 475 33 dpm 100 l 1 respectively for better visualization all the radium results are plotted on the semi log coordinates fig 4d f shows the relations of 223ra versus 224ra 224ra versus 228ra and 226ra versus 228ra in groundwater end member generally 223ra 228ra are positively correlated with 224ra with a linear relationship of 224ra 45 3 223ra 239 6 r2 0 76 p 0 05 and 224ra 1 23 228ra 50 7 r2 0 98 p 0 05 respectively 226ra is also positively correlated with 228ra with a linear relationship of 226ra 0 463 228ra 107 6 r2 0 80 p 0 05 in the groundwater end member radium quartet concentrations are usually low at the northwest of the prd and increase toward the coast this spatial trend is similar to that of stable 2h and 18o isotopes and salinity fig 4a c the radium nuclides are plotted versus cl concentration to examine the dominant process in controlling the nuclide occurrence and behaviors radium isotopes are all linearly correlated with the cl concentrations with the relations of 224ra 0 17 cl 161 6 223ra 0 003 cl 0 14 226ra 0 07 cl 132 1 and 228ra 0 14 cl 84 8 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra fig 5 the primary controlling process of radium activities within the prd aquifers is adsorption desorption which is similar to what is reported by kiro et al 2012 and kiro et al 2013 who show that 224ra is linearly correlated with salinity in the aquifers of the dead sea radium quartet activities in the surface water are all less than 1 dpm l 1 due to their high affinity to the particulates in fresh environments 4 discussion 4 1 radium reactive transport model this study derives a radium reactive transport model to quantify the tgd in the ldes the traditional radium models used in the sgd studies have been constructed mostly based on the mass balance by neglecting all the transport and reaction processes within the coastal aquifers these models are advantageous to quantify the total sgd including both fresh components and recirculated components however cannot be used to quantify the reactive transport processes within the coastal aquifer systems the model used in this study however provides the constraints of mean transit time mtt and therefore can be deployed to quantify the net terrestrial groundwater in the ldes as indicated in fig 2 the sources of radionuclide in groundwater include α recoil from parent isotopes in the solid phase weathering decay from parent isotope in dissolve phase and desorption from sorbed phase the sinks of the nuclide in the groundwater include adsorption and precipitation to sorbed phase and radioactive decay after confirming all the sinks and sources of the radionuclide within the groundwater system the concentration of i nuclide in groundwater at a given time t and distance x along the flow line can be written as 1 d c i d t v d c i d x p w p r c a d k 1 f λ p c a d p λ p c p q c i λ i c i k 1 c i under steady regional groundwater flow setting d c i d t 0 d c i d x is the advection term p w dpm l 1 s 1 is the input of nuclide i from weathering p r dpm l 1 s 1 is α recoil rate v m s 1 is darcy flow velocity k 1 s 1 and k 1 s 1 are the adsorption and desorption constants for nuclide i respectively c i dpm l 1 and c p dpm l 1 are the concentrations of nuclide i and its parent isotope in groundwater respectively c a d dpm g 1 and c a d p dpm g 1 are the concentration of nuclide i and its parent isotope in the sorbed phase respectively f is the fraction of nuclide i produced by its parent in sorbed phase and recoiled into groundwater q dpm l 1 s 1 is the precipitation rate of nuclide i λ i s 1 and λ p s 1 are decay constants of nuclide i and its parent isotope respectively alpha recoil is regarded as the main source of nuclide i in groundwater ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 with a ratio of p w p r 10 5 the weathering input for radium nuclide and 222rn is negligible porcelli 2008 thus eq 1 can be reduced to 2 v d c i d x p r c a d k 1 f λ p c a d p λ p c p q c i λ i c i k 1 c i under steady state for the sorbed phase adsorption is balanced by desorption and decay as indicated by the following equation 3 k 1 c i c a d k 1 λ i c a d the partition coefficient of nuclide i between the dissolved phase and sorbed phase are characterized by a dimensionless distribution k i and expressed as krishnaswami et al 1982 ku et al 1992 4 k i c a d c i k 1 k 1 λ i more specifically retardation factor r f i is introduced to represent the nuclide retardation in the form of k i krishnaswami et al 1982 5 r f i c a d c i c i 1 k i r f i is a vital parameter in governing radionuclide i transport in groundwater system as it reflects the migration rate of nuclide i in related to the groundwater flow rate given that nuclide i produced by parent isotopes via recoil in the sorbed phase can be completely released into dissolved phase f 1 eq 2 can be reduced to 6 v d c i d x p r c p λ p r f p q c i λ i c i r f i where r f p is the retardation factor of the parent isotope of nuclide i eq 6 is the governing equation used for the radium quartet and radon transport in groundwater system in this study in the equation λ i c i r f i represents retardation effect of nuclide i p r is the recoil rate c p λ p r f p represents retardation effect of the parent isotope of nuclide i and q c i is the precipitation effect with the boundary condition of c t 0 c 0 radionuclide activities in the recharge rainfall and surface water the analytical solution of eq 6 is written as 7 c i p r λ p c p r f p λ i r f i q 1 e λ i r f i q v x c 0 e λ i r f i q v x the activity of nuclide i a i c i λ can be expressed as 8 a i p r λ p a p r f p λ i r f i q 1 e r f i q λ i x v a 0 e λ i r f i q v x in eq 8 a i is finally the function of water transit time τ w x v considering darcy velocity v is the mean velocity along the flow line the mtt can be obtained by solving this equation 4 2 recoil rate and retardation of radium and radon eq 8 characterizes the radionuclide distribution along the flow line in a groundwater system and can be used to calculate the parameters such as r f τ w v and p r to quantify these parameters some approximations are made for specific radium nuclide as indicated by krishnaswami et al 1982 and tricca et al 2000 224ra and 228ra reach a steady state within a residence time several minutes and a short distance 20 m along the flow line both their residence time and equilibrium distance are significantly low compared to water residence time and the domain of groundwater system in the pearl river ldes therefore both 224ra and 228ra can be assigned to be under steady states similar to the presumption in studies of other local scale coastal groundwater systems luo et al 2000 tricca et al 2000 2001 because the decay constant and adsorption rate of 224ra and 228ra are orders of magnitude larger than precipitation rates in groundwater system precipitation is negligible kiro et al 2013 porcelli 2008 thus eq 8 for 224ra and 228ra can be reduced to 9 a 224 p r 224 r f t 228 h a t 228 h r f r 224 a 10 a 228 p r 228 r f t 232 h a t 232 h r f r 228 a the recoil input for 228th is negligible due to the significant low energy of β recoil from the parent nuclide 228ra thus the solution for 228th can be reduced to r f t 232 h a t 228 h r f t 232 h a r 228 a based on which eqs 9 10 can be reduced to 11 a 224 p r 224 p r 228 r f t 232 h a t 232 h r f r 224 a under secular equilibrium there is p r 224 p r 228 in the solid phase porcelli 2008 hence eq 11 is reduced to 12 a 228 2 p r 224 r f 232 t h a t 232 h r f r 224 a as the desorption rate is much smaller than the adsorption rate or k i 1 luo et al 2000 then eq 8 leads to the approximate identical retardation factor of radium quartet thus r f r 224 a r f r 226 a r f r 228 a r f r a dividing eq 12 with eq 11 leads to 13 a 224 a 228 2 p r 224 r f t 232 h a t 232 h p r 224 r

and approaches 1 if the aquifer system is well weathered with high 232th concentration in the sorbed phase ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 fig 4e shows that the average ratio of 224ra 228ra tends to be 1 23 close to the value recommended by davidson and dickson 1986 which indicates that 224ra and 228ra reach a steady state along the flow line ar of 224ra to 228ra is close to 1 suggesting that the aquifer grains are well weathered as one might expect from the high mean temperature and fast vegetation growth at the lower reach of the pearl river system substituting the slope 1 23 of 224ra versus 228ra into eq 13 one has p r 224 0 3 r f t 232 h this indicates that α recoil input of radium nuclides is less than that derived from the decay of the sorbed 232th and the aquifer grains are well weathered with abundant 232th on the surface coating luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 thus compared to the α recoil radium isotopes in the groundwater are predominantly controlled by the adsorption desorption process as described above the process of adsorption desorption can be characterized by the parameter of retardation factor r f 222rn as an inert gas nuclide won t be adsorbed on the aquifer grains thus r f rn 1 as a result eq 8 for 222rn can be reduced to 14 a 222 r n p r 222 r f r 226 a a r 226 a eq 14 indicates that 222rn in the aquifer is mostly sourced from α recoil and the decay of 226ra in the sorbed and dissolved phases the 238u and 232th compositions of the soil grains within the prd are measured to be 140 37 bq kg and 187 80 bq kg n 796 song et al 2012 respectively leading to p r 226 p r 224 228 0 75 under secular equilibrium substituting this ratio into eqs 9 10 and 14 leads to the solutions of p r 222 p r 224 and r f r a in the form of 222rn 224ra

in table s3 r f ra ranges from 31 2 to 294 with an average of 123 the obtained r f ra is much smaller than the results of groundwater in aquifers in the little lost delta r f 3600 70000 under freshwater dominant environment but much larger than the radium retardation factor in the dead sea coastal aquifer r f 1 86 as one may expect much lower retardation factor of radium under the super high saline environment kiro et al 2012 2013 the alpha recoil rates of 232th series and 238u series are respectively calculated to be from 19 to 214 atoms l 1 min 1 within an average of 78 atoms l 1 min 1 and from 19 to 161 atoms l 1 min 1 with an average of 59 atoms l 1 min 1 table s3 the recoil rate is in line with the results of radionuclides in the aquifers of the little lost river delta suggesting similar physical structures and compositions of the aquifer grains in the two aquifer systems johnson et al 2000 4 3 mtt and tgd along the flow line the precipitation effect for 226ra is not negligible porcelli 2008 under steady state the solution for 226ra reactive transport model is reduced to 18 a r 226 a p r 226 r f t 230 h a t 230 h r f r 226 a q λ 226 thus ar of 226ra to 228ra can be written as 19 a 226 a 228 p r 226 r f t 230 h a t 230 h r f r 226 a q λ 226 p r 224 r f t 232 h a t 232 h r f r 228 a luo et al 2000 indicated that r f 230 t h r f 232 t h due to the strong adsorption rate of the nuclides in the aquifer system hence the ar of 226ra to 228ra tends to equal the α recoil rate of 226ra to that of 228ra which is eventually equal to the activity ratios ars of 238u to 232th in the solid phase under secular equilibrium gill et al 1992 porcelli 2008 thus when the precipitation effect is not considered the ars of a 228 a 226 equals 0 75 in the groundwater under steady state fig 4f shows that the slope of 226ra versus 228ra is 0 46 in groundwater of prd p 0 05 much lower than the ars of 0 75 under steady state precipitation of radium and the unsteady condition would be both the causative factor of much lower slope of 226ra versus 228ra in the groundwater wang and jiao 2012 indicated that the basal aquifer is highly depleted in sulfur as a result of extensive precipitation of caso4 suggesting that the dominant precipitant is caso4 radium isotopes have high affinity to the precipitates of barite baso4 and celestine srso4 with a distribution coefficient of 1 2 and 296 respectively kiro et al 2012 rosenberg et al 2011 zhu 2004 but have significantly low affinity to caso4 precipitates with a distribution coefficient 0 1 ichikuni and musha 1978 which leads to negligible radium precipitation in the prd groundwater system thus the low ratios of ar of 226ra to 228ra would be ascribed to the unsteady state of 226ra between dissolved and solid phases along the flow line therefore the solution of 226ra reactive transport model eq 8 can be reduced to 20 a 226 p r 226 a 230 r f 230 r f 226 1 e r f 226 τ a 0 e r f 226 τ eq 20 provides constraints to quantify the mtt in the prd groundwater system 232th and 230th have strong affinity to the aquifer grains thus r f 232th r f 230th luo et al 2000 a 230 and a 232 in the groundwater are mainly from the weathering of the aquifer grains and ars of a 230 and a 232 may be equal to the ar of a 230 and a 232 in the aquifer grains ivanovich and harmon 1992 porcelli 2008 thus a 230 r f 230 0 75 a 232 r f 232 2 5 p r 224 3 33 p r 226 based on which eq 20 can be approximately written as 21 a 226 4 33 p r 226 r f 226 1 e r f 226 τ λ 226 a 0 e r f 226 τ λ 226 thus mtt can be calculated with the field data of a 0 and a 226 and the obtained p r 226 and r f 226 are presented in table s3 the mtt is calculated to be from 5 7 to 220 yrs within an average of 54 8 yrs as the horizontal hydraulic gradient is quite small wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 and the groundwater recharge rate could be calculated based on groundwater sampling depth and the estimated mtt the mtt of radium isotopes obtained here represents the time spent since it is generated from the grains or rock undergoes reactions such as adsorption desorption and decay and finally reaches the sampling locations the mtt in this study is subject to both transport and reactive processes and the model already integrates the information of both porosity and effective surface areas when parameterizing the reactive parameter of alpha recoil and retardation therefore the variability of mtt in this study is ascribed to the variability of reaction parameters to assess the magnitude of uncertainty of radium reactive transport model the sensitivity of estimated mtt to changes in other variables is examined a sensitivity coefficient f is proposed to evaluate this uncertainty according to langston et al 2013 22 f δ τ r a τ r a δ y i y i where δ τ r a is the amount of change in mtt of radium isotopes from the original value τ r a δ y i is the amount of change in the other variable of y i from the original value y i usually higher f represents larger uncertainty of final mtt estimate the uncertainty mainly stems from radium isotope measurements in different water endmembers alpha recoil rates p r and retardation factors r f of radium in the groundwater system the uncertainties of radium isotope measurement are about 10 15 as indicated in eqs 14 and 15 the uncertainties of p r and r f are also subject to the activities of radium isotopes therefore the final mtt estimate has an uncertainty of 45 60 4 4 the estimations of tgd and the derived chemical loadings as discussed previously basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 the average groundwater recharge rate at a sampling site can be estimated by dividing the sampling depth by the mtt and then multiplying by the porosity h ϕ τ t the groundwater recharge rates are subject to rather high spatial heterogeneity of radium mtt as aforementioned and calculated to be 0 04 0 53 m yr 1 with an average of 0 2 0 14 m yr 1 the median one quartile and three quartile values of aquifer recharge rates are calculated to be 0 18 0 10 and 0 25 mm yr 1 with a subaerial area of 9000 km2 excluding hong kong the tgd was calculated to be 1 8 0 4 4 8 x 109 m3 yr 1 which is about 0 8 0 2 2 1 of the annual discharge of the pearl river system it is possible that the obtained tgd including portion of base flow to the river channels however based on the topographic and geomorphology settings of the pearl river ldes the river channels have bathymetry of only a few meters and are considered to be connected with the groundwater from shallow unconfined aquifer the sampling stations of this study however are predominantly located at the basal aquifers of t1 and t2 jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 therefore the contribution of river base flow to the tgd which is mainly based on sampling in the basal aquifer is considered to be minimal in this study the regional flow direction of the groundwater system is indicated to be from the northwest to the southeast fig 6 a and the groundwater system is experiencing mixing of fresh surface water and saline seawater as shown by the stable isotopes fig 4f h and groundwater pipe diagrams fig 3 nh4 loading is of particular interest as the regional salty groundwater is abnormally enriched in ammonium jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 and is widely distributed in the aquifer system of the pearl river lde extending from inland to the offshore within an area up to 1800 km2 cai et al 2015 jiao et al 2010 kwong and jiao 2016 the high ammonium 10 mg l 1 is suggested to be existential within a vast area of 1800 km2 with the pearl river ldes jiao et al 2010 with the tgd of 0 2 m yr 1 obtained from the radium reactive transport model and the mean nh4 concentration in the high ammonium groundwater 5 9 mm the tgd induced nh4 loading to the surface water is estimated to be 2 4 109 mol yr 1 fig 6e the terrestrial groundwater borne nh4 is nearly 42 of the sewage loading of 5 6 109 mol yr 1 and about 5 of the pearl river fluvial loading of 48 8 109 mol yr 1 fig 6e generally organic matter degradation follows the sequence of aerobic respiration denitrification iron fe and manganese mn oxide reduction sulfate reduction and methanogenesis arndt et al 2013 regnier et al 2011 if nh4 is released from the decaying redfield ratio rr organic matter by o2 oxidation the upper limit of nh4 is calculated to be 0 04 mm in fresh groundwater however nh4 concentration is observed to be much larger than 0 04 mm in fresh groundwater the concentrations of no3 fe and mn oxides are also 2 orders of magnitude low compared to the nh4 concentration huang et al 2018a 2018b jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 indicating insignificant nh4 diagenesis from denitrification and fe mn oxide reduction thus the abnormally high nh4 concentration is predominantly ascribed to the processes of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in the organic matter and slat enriched aquitards larsen et al 2017 wang and jiao 2012 as soon as seawater enters this system organic matter is oxidized by reaction with enriched sulfate fig 6b meanwhile nh4 and sulfide accumulate as sulfate reduction byproducts eq 22 high concentration of so4 2 in saline water allows much more organic carbon can be oxidized compared to a freshwater system jakobsen and postma 1994 this leads to much higher nh4 concentrations in saline groundwater fig 6c the good correlation of sulfate depletion δso4 2 versus nh4 concentrations δso4 2 0 57 cl 0 48 r2 0 57 n 157 fig 6c stresses the hypothesis that high nh4 concentration is mainly ascribed to high so4 2 reduction the fact that the nh4 concentrations are well correlated with the cl concentrations fig 7 further indicates the conservative mixing and transport in the regional groundwater system if the organic matter has a rr of n c of 16 106 the maximum nh4 that can be released by organic matter remineralization is 8 5 mm l when the oceanic so4 2 28 mm is completely depleted according to the following equation fig 6c 23 c h 2 o 106 n h 3 16 h 3 p o 4 53 s o 4 2 106 h c o 3 16 n h 4 h p o 4 2 53 h s 39 h however some nh4 concentrations are found much higher than 8 5 mm which is likely caused by significantly high nh4 in initial fresh groundwater before experiencing sulfate reduction fig 6c and other remineralization processes such as fe mn oxide reduction and methanogenesis as described elsewhere burdige and komada 2013 jiao et al 2010 wang and jiao 2012 wang et al 2012 as suggested by burdige and komada 2013 the stoichiometry of the deep remineralization processes can also be a possible reason for the much higher ammonium concentration in the groundwater in regional groundwater of pearl river lde conditions in the pearl river lde affect other important components namely doc talk as sr and ba in highly reducing saline environments these components have low affinity to the aquifer grains and are highly mobile basu et al 2001 datta et al 2009 dowling et al 2003 moore 1997 polizzotto et al 2008 wang and jiao 2012 allowing their transport towards the coasts using the mean concentrations of these components and ones previously discussed in the regional groundwater table s1 and the estimated tgd the terrestrial groundwater derived chemical fluxes are estimated as shown in fig 8 to put the results in a global context the significant tgd derived chemical fluxes in the pearl river lde are compared with the dissolved constituent loadings of the world largest rivers the tgd derived nh4 loading is mostly larger than the fluvial loadings of the largest rivers to the chinese seas fig 8c and even exceeding the fluvial loadings of the some world largest rivers such as yukon huanghe and kolyma rivers fig 8d the tgd derived talk and doc loadings in the pearl river lde are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the world largest rivers the large tgd derived ba and sr fluxes commensurable in magnitude to their groundwater fluxes in the ganges brahmaputra lde basu et al 2001 dowling et al 2003 moore 1997 are also in the ranges of the loadings of some of the world largest rivers such as godavari and kolyma rivers fig 8f and g the as flux of tgd also rivals the loadings from the world largest rivers such as yukon huanghe and pearl rivers fig 8h 5 conclusion in conclusion based on the disequilibrium of 226ra between solute and dissolved phases the study develops a radium reactive transport model to estimate the mtt in the pearl river lde thereafter tgd over the pearl river lde is estimated to be 1 8 0 4 4 8 x 109 m3 yr 1 although the tgd is less than 1 of the pear river discharge the tgd derived chemical fluxes are found to be commensurable in magnitude to the loadings of pearl river and most of the largest rivers in the world this study indicates the tgd derived chemical fluxes are significant and would serve as an important component to their oceanic budgets the groundwater bone contaminants within the urbanized ldes are tremendous and required for considerable attention in the future studies the understanding of groundwater borne chemical fluxes and the investigation of contaminant sources are of vital significance in ecosystem reservations environmental protection and the health of the residents in the highly urbanized lde both hydrodynamics and redox condition mediate the biogeochemical processes and chemical exports in the ldes therefore future studies will be conducted to 1 reveal how the groundwater hydrodynamics impacts the biogeochemical cycling and exports based on numerical modeling 2 constrain the diagenetic processes of c n s system based on carbon and nitrogen isotopic approaches and 3 investigate the generation of base flow in the river channels in the pearl river ldes and its contribution to tgd and chemical exports based on natural tracers of 222rn and numerical modeling approaches

19393,p nitrophenol pnp is a toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutant and a usual intermediate in the production of fine chemicals which has posed a significant threat to subsurface environment safety soil aquifer treatment sat is a promising method to remove and remediate contamination in vadose zone with low cost and high efficiency however there are still research gaps for the treatment of recalcitrant contaminants by sat in cold regions such as un robust indigenous microbes and low temperature constraint in vadose zone the bioaugmentation technology was first introduced into sat in order to enhance the removal ability of pnp by sat operated in cold regions in this study a high efficiency pnp degrading bacterium was successfully isolated which can efficiently degrade pnp below 200 mg l 1 with a degradation rate above 99 at 15 c close to the real subsurface temperature in cold regions and added into sat for bioaugmentation the feasibility of bioaugmented sat and associated pnp removal process were investigated by laboratory sand columns along with effects of the sat operative parameters namely pnp loading concentration flow rate and soil saturation level of sat within the range of pnp loading stresses tested 1 200 mg l 1 pnp removal efficiency was optimal at constant flow rate of 219 ml d 1 in unsaturated operating condition of sat under 15 c among all the investigated experimental conditions longer hydraulic residence time increased the pnp removal rate although the accumulated mass removed reduced and the removal efficiencies remained constant in unsaturated operating condition of sat it is found from the comparison between the pnp removals via both unsaturated and saturated columns that slight difference only in the removal rate of pnp was observed and the highly efficient bioaugmented sat can completely degrade pnp of 10 mg l 1 within 5 wetting drying cycles under both scenarios graphical abstract image 1 keywords p nitrophenol

toxicity and mutagenic potential and most deleterious effects to ecosystem pnp has been blacklisted for priority contaminants by usepa since 1980 yue et al 2018 zhao and kong 2018 zheng et al 2009 pnp can be found as a common contaminant in natural environment because of its extensive and frequent occurrence in the synthesis and application of pharmaceuticals dyes pesticides industrial solvents and explosives sahoo et al 2011 wang et al 2017 yue et al 2018 zhao and kong 2018 owing to the recalcitrance of pnp in subsurface environment pnp wastewater could easily penetrate vadose zone soil with rainfall or irrigation sahoo et al 2011 and then transport quite a long distance in groundwater system zheng et al 2009 therefore to control pnp s dispersion for further contamination it is better to eliminate pnp at or close to the sources in the vadose zone before it enters into groundwater soil aquifer treatment sat an in situ remediation technology working mainly in the natural vadose zone is proved to be a cost effective and environmental friendly wastewater treatment and reclamation system whilst undertaking groundwater artificial recharge essandoh et al 2011 zucker et al 2015 the specific contamination removal mechanisms in sat are shown in fig 1 wastewater is supplied to an infiltration tank excavated in soil of good permeability a series of natural physical chemical and biological reactions could then take place leading to great reduction of inorganic and dissolved organic contaminants during the process of wastewater permeating through the vadose zone ak and gunduz 2013 mienis and arye 2018 sopilniak et al 2018 removal efficiency could be further improved by enhanced methods in the vadose zone of sat system such as improving adsorption capacity of sat via adding special materials e g steel slag cha et al 2006 enhancing infiltration regime of sat via rapid flooding nadav et al 2012 and so on to ensure water safety groundwater in aquifer beneath the vadose zone would generally be withdrawn for further use such as unrestricted irrigation or industrial purposes months or years later onesios and bouwer 2012 sat has been employed in many subtropical regions around the world with the purpose of treated wastewater s reclamation such as california us south france and tel aviv israel arye et al 2011 brissaud et al 1991 mienis and arye 2018 nadav et al 2012 quanrud et al 2003 in recent years many laboratory studies were carried out on the removal of some recalcitrant organic contaminants in wastewater using sat at room temperature apart from easily degradable contaminants guizani et al 2011 hübner et al 2014 for example onesios and bouwer 2012 attempted to remove 14 ppcps pharmaceuticals and personal care products by sat system and the results showed near 95 reductions in 10 of 14 ppcps were obtained in laboratory soil column tests and the biofilm was detected to take effect on the sat capacity enhancement until nearly 256 days of in situ microorganism growth onesios and bouwer 2012 the sat soil columns have also been used by essandoh et al 2012 for estrogens removal both in unsaturated and saturated operating conditions the removal efficiencies were improved by increased transport length in unsaturated zone the improved removal efficiencies were also obtained at lower flow rates in both unsaturated and saturated conditions essandoh et al 2012 among all the removal mechanisms of sat shown in fig 1 adsorption and biodegradation are considered as the major ones for dissolved organic compounds essandoh et al 2012 2013 mienis and arye 2018 moreover biodegradation is normally the dominant removal mechanism for recalcitrant contaminants ak and gunduz 2013 most biodegradation in the sat systems were achieved by acclimatizing the microorganisms existing in soil or wastewater essandoh et al 2012 2013 mienis and arye 2018 onesios and bouwer 2012 however such process would take too long time and may be much difficult to work on toxic organic contaminants of high concentration as pnp is toxic to most microbes rare indigenous microorganisms in soil and wastewater are capable of degrading pnp rodrigues et al 2017 therefore it is difficult to cleanup pnp in wastewater by conventional sat biological treatment attempts in enhancing the pnp elimination artificially have been made in terms of synthesized material adsorption chen et al 2013b three liquid phase extraction yu et al 2009 fenton oxidation rodrigues et al 2017 and biological degradation subashchandrabose et al 2017 since the adsorption capacity is generally limited with balance of desorption and the extraction and fenton oxidation need to be performed under rather harsh experimental condition besides all the above methods are costly whereas the bio removal capacity has been accelerated by artificially introducing specific strains or a consortium of microorganisms the removal of toxic and recalcitrant organics can be persistent with easy operation and low cost li et al 2017 zheng et al 2009 thus bioaugmentation is a promising approach to cleanup targeted pollutants in soil with the crux of the achievement of efficient and environment friendly degradation microorganism chi et al 2013 figdore et al 2018 so far several microbes capable of degrading pnp have been successfully isolated salehi et al 2011 zhang et al 2015b zheng et al 2009 but their preferable temperature for growth is in a range of 25 35 c which is inconsistent with the actual subsurface environment temperature especially in cold region normally 8 20 c zhang et al 2009 if these microbes were introduced into real vadose zone for wastewater purification the microbial activities would be destined to decline or even loss therefore the isolation of effective microbes at low temperature becomes the main constraint of sat for the pnp efficient biodegradation as revealed by literature review above little has been done for the applicability of sat operated at low temperature which is the restrained but not the only factor affecting biodegradation capacity of sat for treatment of organic contaminants in cold region in addition the un robustness of the indigenous microbes in vadose zone or wastewater needs to be overcome for the engineering considerations therefore we first introduce the bioaugmentation technology into sat operated at low temperature in order to rapidly and efficiently remove the recalcitrant contaminants the objectives of this paper were thus to 1 isolate a special strain of bacterium that could biodegrade pnp rapidly and efficiently at real subsurface temperature for the bioaugmented sat 2 investigate the removal process and efficiency of pnp in bioaugmented sat 3 determine the effects of pnp loading concentration flow rate and soil saturation level of sat on the removal efficiency based on characteristics of soil and contaminant 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial screening and identification a long term parathion pesticides applied soil was sampled to isolate the high efficiency pnp degrading bacterium short as hepd bacterium for adding to the bioaugmented sat short as bio sat the soil sample was collected from the surface layer top 5 cm of the agricultural soil yanji china the topsoil temperature varied from 10 to 20 c daily during the period of the sample collection the pure strain screening was undertaken as following steps 1 5 g soil was added to 100 ml sterile mineral salt medium msm containing 200 mg l 1 pnp as the sole carbon source in a 250 ml conical flask plus 1 ml trace elements solution after aerobic incubation in an orbital shaking incubator was carried out at 120 rpm at 30 c for 7 days in dark the aliquot of 5 ml was transferred to 100 ml fresh msm containing 200 mg l 1 pnp this step was repeated six times to complete the enrichment culture then 10 ml of the culture was centrifuged 10000 rpm 10 min the supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was collected 2 the cell pellet was washed with fresh msm 100 ml and incubated in the orbital shaker incubator for 7 days 120 rpm culture temperature was decreased gradually from 30 to 10 c for each acclimation cycle and ultimately the culture was kept at 10 c for repeated cultures the enrichment culture lasted until the yellow of solution pnp color faded 3 the mixed bacteria solution obtained by the enrichment was streaked onto beef extract peptone medium in parallel with the msm pnp of 100 mg l 1 with 2 weight volume agar for isolation and purification of the degrading bacterium the composition of msm was 3 8

were of analytical grade purchased from sangon chemical co shanghai china the isolated pure strain was identified by the 16s rdna gene analysis the bacterial total dna was extracted with a dna extraction kit takara japan two universal primers 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 f primer and 1492r 5 ggttaccttgttacgactt 3 r primer were used for the amplification of the 16s rdna gene via polymerase chain reaction pcr the pcr was performed on fluorescence quantitative pcr instrument bio rad america the products were purified and sequenced by sangon chemical co shanghai china the 16s rdna sequence obtained was compared with known sequences in genbank nih usa by blast for homology the homologous sequence and the measured sequence were compared by multiple sequence alignment using clustal x 2 2 biodegradation protocol biodegradation experiments were carried out using the hepd bacterium isolated the initial od600 reflecting the bacterial cell density of the inoculum was 0 002 batch experiments were all performed in triplicate at different temperatures 10 35 c and initial pnp stresses 10 300 mg l 1 and abiotic control flasks were maintained by adding hgcl2 200 mg l 1 bacteriostatic agent as control during incubation 5 ml samples were removed from flasks at appropriate intervals for determination of the pnp remaining concentration the amount of nitrogen released and the bacterial growth at the end of biodegradation total organic carbon toc concentration was analyzed to investigate whether pnp was mineralized the temperature of sat topsoil where the active and significant removal or transformation of dissolved organic matter occurs essandoh et al 2011 suzuki et al 2015 is closely related to air temperature chen et al 2013a according to existing reports the air temperature at actual sat operation site is 12 30 c but the data available for subsurface temperature is rather scarce quanrud et al 2003 nadav et al 2012 which reflects the neglect on study about the effect of subsurface temperature on sat operation we are located in a cold region northeast china n 43 88 e 125 35 with air temperature ranging from 25 to 33 c so we speculated that the topsoil temperature here is rather lower than that of above subtropical regions the data on china soil temperature showed that the average topsoil temperature of northeast region cold region was between 8 and 20 c zhang et al 2009 therefore we have selected 15 c as a typical subsurface temperature of sat topsoil at cold region and it was also set as the test temperature for subsequent column tests all the degradation experiments were performed at this temperature except for the investigation of effects of temperature on degradation ability aiming at assessing the degradation capacity of the strain at a typical subsurface temperature in cold region 2 3 pnp initial stress selection for sat simulation the allowable concentration of pnp in natural waters is restricted by epa to less than 10 ng l 1 zheng et al 2009 however pnp concentration detected in discharged wastewater ranges from 10 to 500 mg l 1 which has been much higher than the limit value wang et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 most existed studies on pnp biodegradation showed that the microbial activities would be weakened or even disappear when the pnp concentration is above 150 mg l 1 due to its high toxicity rodrigues et al 2017 zheng et al 2009 therefore initial pnp concentrations of 1 10 200 mg l 1 were selected in sat experiments for comparison to examine the impact of light intermediate and heavy pollution stresses the pnp artificial wastewater was prepared by dilution in deionized water of a stock solution only containing 1000 mg pnp purity 99 0 analytical grade sangon china in 1 l of ultrapure water the stock solution was prepared weekly and kept in fridge at 4 c after sterilization before supplied to columns there was no change in pnp concentration after storage within the range of measurement errors standard deviation 2 08 mg l 1 2 4 sand medium river sand was selected as the sat medium due to its good permeability and natural characteristics some physical and chemical properties of the soil were characterized and given in table 1 the applied sand was immersed in naoh solution 0 1 mol l 1 continuously for three days to remove surface impurities followed by thoroughly rinsing with ultrapure water and autoclaved sterilization 121 c 20 min prior to packing columns 2 5 column setup for sat breakthrough according to the sat conceptual model shown in fig 1 the flow beneath the infiltration could be generalized as 1d flow and thus sand columns 2 2 cm i d 16 cm bed depth ptfe were applied for the sat simulation in this study the column setup shown in fig 2 was used for study on the sat breakthroughs one water inlet and one outlet were designed in the both caps of column respectively and sampling ports were not provided in side both the top and bottom of column were filled with a gravel diameter 2 mm layer of 0 5 cm thickness as well as a stainless steel mesh of 200 meshes covering between the gravel layer and soil acting as a buffer zone to ensure a uniform water pass through the entire section at column inlet and prevent clogging of column outlet and ptfe gaskets were fixed between the column body and caps to prevent leakage columns were sterilized by a 10 bleach solution for 24 h followed by rinsing with ultrapure water before packing the columns were packed with the above sterilized dry river sand in layers to ensure the sands distributed uniformly in column all columns were fed with identical artificial wastewater all the latex tubes peristaltic pump tubes tanks and beaker used were sterile as well 2 6 sat simulation scenarios different sat operation modes continuous and intermittent flooding lead to different saturation conditions in vadose zone soil therefore both saturated and unsaturated columns were designed to reflect breakthroughs of pnp within vadose zone with different saturation levels different pnp initial loading stresses and flow setting were also investigated fig 2 both saturated and unsaturated columns were performed following wetting drying cycle to control the aerobic conditions as well as prevent the clogging of vadose zone kopchynski et al 1996 thus the biological activity could be better maintained saturated condition was achieved by continuous feeding the artificial pnp wastewater from the column bottom against gravity and the water table was always kept above the sand surface while unsaturated columns were supplied from the top with the same wastewater which were controlled by one injection peristaltic pump contacted to the top and one discharge pump at the bottom fig 2 despite of the different flow directions the total injected pnp solution volume of each column was kept to be the same with the injection flow rates of 219 ml d 1 or 438 ml d 1 abiotic sat column abi sat for short was operated in parallel with each bio sat column to better understand the biological effects and the hgcl2 200 mg l 1 was supplied as a bacteriostatic agent one conventional sat column with natural unsterilized soil was also established as a control for proving the improvement of removal efficiency by bio sat three pnp concentration solutions as mentioned above were compared for unsaturated conditions as well as two discharge rates 219 and 438 ml d 1 pnp of 10 mg l 1 was also supplied at 219 ml d 1 under saturated condition to study the effect of soil saturation level therefore 15 sand columns were independently conducted in total the specific operational conditions of each column were listed in right edge of fig 2 each bio sat soil column experienced three stages successively flow stabilizing bioaugmentation and pnp removal for the first flow stabilizing stage approximately 10 times pore volumes of sterile ultrapure water broke through the columns for the steady hydraulic condition the initial od600 of column effluent was zero to specifically investigate the biological removal process of sat the bioaugmentation step began after the soil reaching adsorption saturation by supplying pnp wastewater and the monitoring of pnp remaining concentrations also commenced at this point in the second bioaugmentation stage the sterile msm with different pnp concentrations was continuously fed to the columns the hepd bacterium solution was introduced regularly into the influent line via the injection port in consideration of the difficulty and cost of culturing bacterium till the pnp concentration in effluent reached initial value arye et al 2011 the od600 value of bacterium solution was set to 0 2 volume of bacterium solution versus msm was 2 ml 20 ml the effluent samples were collected every 2 h in the agilent bottles 10 ml when the remaining concentrations of pnp kept to be constant the bioaugmentation of soil was assumed to be formed finally pnp wastewater of different concentrations was fed to columns which was the pnp removal stage effluent samples were collected every 12 h during wet periods for the measurements of pnp ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrite ph dissolved oxygen do and od600 while no sampling performed during dry periods of the 48 hr wetting drying cycles apart from above parameters toc concentration in effluent was analyzed at the end of sat operation each sampling was performed twice and determined twice in parallel to ensure the better data quality control to simulate the underground environment in cold region all the stages and all the sand columns were conducted at 15 1 c 2 7 analytical methods all water samples collected were measured for od600 with ultraviolet uv spectrophotometer immediately and then the samples were filtered using 0 22 μm membrane filters prior to analysis wen et al 2015 the residual concentration of pnp was measured by the high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a uv vis detector and an eclipse sb c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm shimadzu japan a methyl alcohol water mixture 70 30 v v was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and detection was at the wavelength of 320 nm ammonium nitrate and nitrite analysis were finished by the ion chromatograph shimadzu japan do and ph measurements were made by hach dr2700 and ph meter respectively toc was analyzed by toc analyzer shimadzu japan 3 results and discussions 3 1 isolation and degradation of hepd bacterium 3 1 1 selection and identification of pnp degrading bacterial strain an indigenous bacterial strain capable of degrading pnp and surviving with pnp as its sole carbon nitrogen and energy source for growth was isolated from contaminated soil the 16s rdna sequence analysis showed that it was 99 homologous identity to that of pseudomonas sp the strain was an aerobic and gram positive bacterium with poor acid resistance and it presented a yellow wet and low bulged morphology on the lb plate shown in supplementary information fig s1 3 1 2 selection of optimal temperature for biodegradation the biodegradation experiments carried out at 10 35 c showed that degradation successfully occurred over a wide range of temperatures table 2 the degradation rate of pnp at low temperature 10 20 c which often represented the temperature of real subsurface environment in cold region was over 97 the cell density of the hepd bacterium was also enhanced with increasing temperature in the range of 10 20 c so the hepd bacterium is favorable for introduction into bio sat in cold regions and before introduction the cell density needs to be enriched to 2 107 cfu ml 1 to improve reaction rate the degradation rate at 30 c which may present that in tropical or subtropical topsoil could reach above 99 suggesting that the hepd bacterium may have a strong universality for pnp degradation at different subsurface temperatures 3 1 3 biodegradation ability of hepd bacterium at various pnp stresses biodegradation assays were carried out at 15 c and the initial inoculated od600 was 0 002 fig 3 showed that pnp can be efficiently biodegraded by hepd bacterium at initial pnp loading stresses in the range of 0 200 mg l 1 and the time required for complete biodegradation increased with loading stress there was no significant change of ph during the degradation process supplementary information fig s2 when the initial concentration of pnp was over 200 mg l 1 hepd bacteria were inactivated and could not biodegrade pnp any more this conclusion was verified by the data of table 3 which showed that no significant change happened to the pnp remaining concentration in solution within the range of measured errors namely no biodegradation happened even the hepd bacterium had been inoculated at an increased initial od600 when the initial pnp loading stress was 220 mg l 1 it was due to the enhancement of toxicity with the increased pnp concentrations ghosh et al 2010 3 1 4 degradation products analysis of pnp by hepd bacterium to analyze the metabolites of nitro group pre and post pnp biodegradation change of nitrogen speciation and concentration in solution was shown in fig 4 where no3 and nh4 were not detected in the medium and the concentration of no2 produced was found to increase according to the initial loading concentration of pnp this result was also supported by the findings of other studies gemini et al 2005 tomei et al 2004 regression analysis between the concentrations of produced nitrite and removed pnp showed that reduction in pnp x was associated with the production of concentration of no2 y the stoichiometric coefficient was derived to be 1 03 regression equation y 1 0301x r2 0 9932 since no2 is also considered a toxic environmental contaminant gemini et al 2005 the concentration of no2 was monitored in order to assess the environmental risk that may result from the biodegradation associated no2 production the toc concentrations in solution ranged from 0 to 0 26 mg l 1 when the degradation of pnp was completed indicating that above 99 of initial loading pnp had been mineralized therefore we believed that the ultimate degradation products contained co2 h2o and maybe some unknown inorganics the specific mineralization product could be identified by isotope labeling technology which will be investigated in our future study according to numerous biodegradation studies so far two distinct pnp degradation pathways by various microbes have been identified one involves p benzoquinone hydroquinone and cis trans 4 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde as major intermediate metabolites mainly occurring in gram negative bacteria hq pathway whereas the other proceeds via production of 4 nitrocatechol and 1 2 4 benzenetriol mainly occurring in gram positive bacteria 4 nc pathway above biodegradation intermediates formed in both pathways will be converted to 3 oxoadipate via maleylacetic acid and then participate the tca cycle it s noted that above two pathways could simultaneously occur in some bacteria chauhan et al 2010 hanne et al 1993 spain and gibson 1991 yue et al 2018 zheng et al 2009 based on existing literature and our results we speculated that the possible degradation intermediates of pnp by the hepd bacterium may contain p benzoquinone hydroquinone and cis trans 4 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde 4 nitrocatechol and 1 2 4 benzenetriol maleylacetic acid and 3 oxoadipate the mineralization rate of pnp was above 99 so the intermediates produced in the biodegradation process had little effect on the removal efficiency of bio sat therefore we did not address the specific metabolic process of the hepd bacterium due to limited resource which may be further investigated in future study to assess the environmental risk of this technology 3 2 removal of pnp during bio sat residual pnp concentrations were monitored in both bio sat and abi sat effluent at 15 c from the point of bioaugmentation to the end of the pnp removal at the flow rate of 219 ml d 1 fig 5 showed the reduction in pnp concentrations in both abi sat and bio sat effluents during the experimental period error bars in all figures were based on the standard error the remaining pnp concentrations within abi sat effluent fluctuated but remained in the region of the initial loading concentration of influent because the abi sat had reached saturation of adsorption by pre treatment there was no initial reduction in pnp concentration in bio sat columns as compared to the abiotic control columns day 1 suggesting that one day lag phase occurred before microbial growth and activity commenced then a reduction in pnp concentrations was observed to varying degrees depend on initial loading stresses the remaining concentrations of pnp in effluent from all three bio sat columns under different pnp initial loading stresses reduced steadily during the first 4 5 d 6 5 d and 17 d of the experimental operation furthermore the removal rate decreased with the increase of loading stress of pnp which inferred that in degradable range of concentration high initial levels of contaminant loading may negatively affect microbial growth resulting in a need for microbial population recover namely the effect of the microbial toxicity of pnp ghosh et al 2010 onesios and bouwer 2012 pnp removal process in conventional sat was also compared with bio sat supplementary information fig s3 it showed that bio sat could obviously improve pnp removal efficiency compared with sat and the removal efficiency could reach 100 as to the initial loading concentration of 10 mg l 1 within 5 days after the remaining pnp concentration constant for 4 wetting drying cycles the sterile msm solution was replaced by pnp artificial wastewater meanwhile the hepd bacterium inoculum source was stopped in bio sat columns allowing the final residual pnp to reach a steady state for the onset of pnp removal process changes in pnp remaining concentrations were monitored over a 28 days 28 days and 16 days period for all three loading stresses 1 10 200 mg l 1 as shown in fig 5 where no obvious fluctuation in the residual pnp concentrations was observed in any of the bio sat effluent during this period bio sat still kept its treatment capacity without supply of hepd bacterium inoculum source because the hepd bacterium had grown attaching on the soil media moreover the ability of hepd bacterium to use pnp wastewater as a complete nutrient carbon nitrogen and energy source is highly beneficial to the ability of bio sat columns to continuously remove this persistent organic contaminant above phenomenon is in accordance with the explanation of onesios and bouwer 2012 for biofilm growth which had developed to a possible pseudo steady state after several weeks of water feeding onesios and bouwer 2012 the remaining pnp concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l 1 was constant at 0 mg l 1 not showing any rising trend however the final remaining concentration of 200 mg l 1 was 2 52 mg l 1 never reaching complete removal of pnp throughout the entire removal period it may be caused by the low hydraulic residence time which is an essential parameter affecting biotransformation mienis and arye 2018 removal efficiency of the three columns tested were 100 100 and 98 74 for 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 respectively overall pnp removal efficiency increased in accordance with reduced initial loading concentrations which has also been observed in published literature on the removal of organic nitrogen as well as contamination indicators such as cod doc and bod essandoh et al 2011 2012 mienis and arye 2018 ojeda et al 2008 rapid removal was observed during pnp removal process at all three loading stresses because the biomass had been pre exposed to pnp at bioaugmentation thus avoiding a lag phase when metabolic pathways required for pnp removal were developed tomei et al 2004 so no further acclimatization was necessary for pnp removal in bio sat sem scanning electron microscope analysis were carried out on soil samples taken from above three bio sat columns confirmed the attachment of microbes to the soil particle as compared to the abiotic one fig 6 a the soil particles were also analyzed by xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the results showed there was carbon element on the surface of bioaugmented soil particles which can verify the existence of microbes whilst carbon was not detected on abiotic soil shown in supplementary information fig s4 the images also revealed that mainly rods and small cocci were present and the amounts increased with pnp initial loading concentrations during the process of bioaugmentation fig 6 b d fig 6 e further proved the microbes still attached on the soil surface during pnp removal process although without nutrient solution however the sizes of microbes were found to be decreased and this phenomenon was in agreement with vyas and dave 2010 who found that the size of microbe was related with phosphorus potassium and many other nutrients vyas and dave 2010 the oxygen concentration in influent of three different pnp loadings fluctuated in the range of 4 40 4 60 mg l 1 the final do content in effluent from both abi sat and bio sat were monitored at the end of sat operation period twentieth cycle showed that do in abi sat effluent remained nearly constant 4 61 mg l 1 however in the bio sat effluent all exhibited lower do contents than influent the do decreased with increasing pnp initial loading concentration for the bio sat the specific do values of effluent from bio sat were 3 63 3 46 and 2 66 mg l 1 for the 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 pnp columns respectively and this non drastic reduction in do may indicate that the hepd bacterium was robust with modest oxygen uptake we have not specially investigated whether the biological removal mechanism containing redox reaction but pnp has a strong chemical stability and resistance to chemical oxidation or reduction in natural condition without catalyst due to the presence of nitro group in its structure alizadeh et al 2009 we hence concluded that the do consumption and pnp removal was the evidence of biodegradation 3 3 nitrite production with pnp removal during bio sat treatment accumulation of nitrite due to pnp oxidation was observed in the process of pnp biodegradation within the bio sat columns which was similar to the static degradation process of pnp supplementary information fig s5 it showed that nitrite concentrations reached a maximum of 0 3 mg l 1 on day 5 d 3 mg l 1 on day 7 d and 63 26 mg l 1 on day 17 d corresponding to different pnp initial stresses 1 10 200 mg l 1 in abiotic column effluents nitrite was not been detected throughout the entire operational period the initial detected time nitrite increase rate and time for stabilization of nitrite concentrations all showed good agreement with the attenuation process of pnp in bio sat with the molar ratio of pnp removal to nitrite accumulation being almost 1 1 as supported by findings of previous studies on the biodegradation of pnp to drive nitrite production gemini et al 2005 tomei et al 2004 nitrite is an established toxin and carcinogen gemini et al 2005 with regulatory standards for groundwater in china allowing up to 0 1 mg l 1 lin et al 2008 however nitrite concentrations produced by the biodegradation of pnp within bio sat in the present study were far exceed its approved limits in groundwater systems in the case of shallow or fine sand aquifers the fluctuation of groundwater levels could reach the sat system and carry nitrite from soils to groundwater systems at that moment the combination of existing efficient nitrite removing techniques with bio sat would be suggested for example enrich the indigenous soil microbes that can transform nitrite to n2 sun and austin 2007 or introduce the nanoparticles or optimized nitrifying bacteria ghasemi and sillanpää 2015 lin et al 2008 yang et al 2007 into sat the removal of nitrite produced by bio sat treatment requires further investigation to assess the suitability of inoculating bio sat systems with denitrifying bacteria or colloidal particles and the resulting interactions that would occur with hepd bacterium above mass balance between pnp removal and nitrite production confirmed that pnp biotransformation did occur and adsorption of pnp on the biomass can be excluded the low residual toc concentration in effluent after filtering by 0 22 μm membrane filters from bio sat mainly in a range of 0 1 4 mg l 1 justified that most pnp in wastewater was mineralized instead of reduction 3 4 factors influencing pnp removal in bio sat systems 3 4 1 effects of flow rate on removal efficiency flow rate of pnp wastewater within vadose zone may indirectly affect its persistence during the process of wastewater infiltration into groundwater zones so this effect was investigated with comparison of two hydraulic residence time scenarios 5 136 h and 2 568 h remaining pnp concentrations in bio sat effluents are shown in fig 7 a c where the removal rate of pnp decreased with increase of flow rates at all initial pnp loading doses the amount of time required to reach a steady state of residual pnp was 4 5 days 6 5 days and 17 days respectively for 1 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 of pnp concentrations at 219 ml d 1 this duration extended to 4 5 days 7 days and 27 days when an increased flow rate 438 ml d 1 was applied it is likely resulted from the reduction in hydraulic residence time and the contact time between the bacteria attached on soil and pnp however these results are in contradiction to findings by essandoh et al 2011 that the removal rate of doc cod and bod in sat columns increased with increasing hydraulic loading rate under constant contaminant loading conditions essandoh et al 2011 the difference in above outcomes may be due to the different hydraulic residence times tested and variations in the replenishment of dissolved oxygen fig 7 d showed the degree of pnp removal in the soil columns over a 27 days period 14 cycles of wetting drying alternation for each initial pnp loading concentration there was an increased mass of pnp removal in accordance with increased flow rate although the ultimate removal efficiencies of the columns remained the same at all flow rates remaining constant at 100 100 and 98 7 for the initial loading doses of 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 pnp respectively similar results have been reported for the removal of dextran showing removal efficiencies were independent of flow rate in sat systems fox and makam 2011 it can be also noted that the hydraulic residence time in bio sat under these two flow rates has no effect on biodegradation capability with the hydraulic residence time of 2 568 h is enough for complete removal of 1 and 10 mg l 1 pnp but 5 136 h remains insufficient for complete removal of 200 mg l 1 such results are in concordance with findings reported by ak and gunduz 2013 essandoh et al 2012 laws et al 2011 and sharma et al 2008 on the removal of organic contaminants at varying hydraulic loading rates or extended residence time ak and gunduz 2013 essandoh et al 2012 laws et al 2011 sharma et al 2008 3 4 2 effects of soil saturation considering the two common sat operating modes different soil saturation levels of sat were investigated with soil volumetric moisture contents of 27 8 and 42 corresponding to unsaturated and saturated operating conditions respectively fig 8 a showed pnp removing process by comparing the influent and effluent concentrations under a constant influent concentration of 10 mg l 1 and a flow rate of 219 ml d 1 pnp could be thoroughly degraded in both columns but it took near 4 wetting drying cycles under unsaturated condition and 5 cycles under saturated condition with an average removal mass of 2 50 and 1 67 mg per cycle respectively furthermore removal rate was found to be marginally improved by the reduction in soil saturation level under unsaturated conditions do is the only electron acceptor available for pnp degradation usually regarded as a significant parameter affecting both the rate and the amount of aerobic biodegradation within a system huang et al 2003 accordingly do concentrations in both influent and effluent were monitored to explore the mechanism involved in this association by the eighth wetting drying cycle day 1 of pnp removal process there was a slight decline in pnp removal rate which may be due to the sudden disappearance of phosphorus source required as a microbial nutrient due to the replacement of growth media with artificial wastewater as shown in fig 8 b effluents from both unsaturated and saturated soil columns remained well oxygenated throughout the operational period even after the pnp 10 mg l 1 had been completely removed do was consumed in the soil during pnp aerobic degradation by hepd bacterium but supplementation occurred from the surrounding bubbles and continuous influent during the process of wastewater infiltrating through the unsaturated soil column while saturated soil can only receive oxygen dissolved within the influent so do levels in the unsaturated column effluent 3 46 mg l 1 were higher than that in the saturated column effluent 2 10 mg l 1 this could partly explain why the removal rate of pnp in unsaturated bio sat systems was faster than that in saturated bio sat systems furthermore the biomass observed on the surface of soil particle was less than in saturated bio sat compared to unsaturated bio sat fig 6 f it is of note that bio sat under saturated operating condition is also equipped with the ability of removing pnp completely despite low do concentrations suggesting that the amount of do from influent was sufficient for maintaining the growth and degradation ability of the hepd bacterium a strong positive linear correlation between do concentration and pnp removal rate in unsaturated bio sat in was shown in fig 8 c which suggested that do content is a dominant factor affecting biodegradation when do is sufficient however no significant linear correlation was observed between do concentration and removal rate in saturated bio sat johnson et al 1998 found that isoproturon degradation was not related to the soil moisture content directly at field sites johnson et al 1998 so the specific relation between soil saturation level and pnp removal rate by sat need to be further investigated 4 conclusions this study confirmed the high potential of sat with bioaugmentation in treatment of the pnp wastewater and also its feasibility under relative low temperature in cold regions by a series of laboratory column experiments the major findings are concluded as following 1 an aerobic strain of bacterium that could rapidly and efficiently biodegrade pnp was obtained it could efficiently degrade pnp concentrations up to 200 mg l 1 at temperature range of 10 30 c especially remained its high degradation capability at 15 c a common temperature of subsurface environment at cold regions the introduction of bioaugmentation by the isolated bacterium into conventional sat system resulted in significantly improved removal efficiency for pnp 98 2 within the range of pnp initial loading concentrations selected 1 200 mg l 1 it was found that removal efficiency decreased slightly due to the increased pnp loading stress with the values of 100 100 and 98 74 for the pnp concentrations of 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 respectively equimolar levels of nitrite were produced 0 3 30 and 60 5 mg l 1 respectively as a result of pnp biodegradation 3 increase of hydraulic residence time and dissolved oxygen can effectively improve the pnp removal rate but both has nearly little effect on the removal efficiency with complete degradation of injected pnp which is a great demonstration of the high degradation efficiency and strong adaptation of our isolated bacterium at subsurface temperature in cold region acknowledgements the authors thank the national science foundation of china grants

19393,p nitrophenol pnp is a toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutant and a usual intermediate in the production of fine chemicals which has posed a significant threat to subsurface environment safety soil aquifer treatment sat is a promising method to remove and remediate contamination in vadose zone with low cost and high efficiency however there are still research gaps for the treatment of recalcitrant contaminants by sat in cold regions such as un robust indigenous microbes and low temperature constraint in vadose zone the bioaugmentation technology was first introduced into sat in order to enhance the removal ability of pnp by sat operated in cold regions in this study a high efficiency pnp degrading bacterium was successfully isolated which can efficiently degrade pnp below 200 mg l 1 with a degradation rate above 99 at 15 c close to the real subsurface temperature in cold regions and added into sat for bioaugmentation the feasibility of bioaugmented sat and associated pnp removal process were investigated by laboratory sand columns along with effects of the sat operative parameters namely pnp loading concentration flow rate and soil saturation level of sat within the range of pnp loading stresses tested 1 200 mg l 1 pnp removal efficiency was optimal at constant flow rate of 219 ml d 1 in unsaturated operating condition of sat under 15 c among all the investigated experimental conditions longer hydraulic residence time increased the pnp removal rate although the accumulated mass removed reduced and the removal efficiencies remained constant in unsaturated operating condition of sat it is found from the comparison between the pnp removals via both unsaturated and saturated columns that slight difference only in the removal rate of pnp was observed and the highly efficient bioaugmented sat can completely degrade pnp of 10 mg l 1 within 5 wetting drying cycles under both scenarios graphical abstract image 1 keywords p nitrophenol

toxicity and mutagenic potential and most deleterious effects to ecosystem pnp has been blacklisted for priority contaminants by usepa since 1980 yue et al 2018 zhao and kong 2018 zheng et al 2009 pnp can be found as a common contaminant in natural environment because of its extensive and frequent occurrence in the synthesis and application of pharmaceuticals dyes pesticides industrial solvents and explosives sahoo et al 2011 wang et al 2017 yue et al 2018 zhao and kong 2018 owing to the recalcitrance of pnp in subsurface environment pnp wastewater could easily penetrate vadose zone soil with rainfall or irrigation sahoo et al 2011 and then transport quite a long distance in groundwater system zheng et al 2009 therefore to control pnp s dispersion for further contamination it is better to eliminate pnp at or close to the sources in the vadose zone before it enters into groundwater soil aquifer treatment sat an in situ remediation technology working mainly in the natural vadose zone is proved to be a cost effective and environmental friendly wastewater treatment and reclamation system whilst undertaking groundwater artificial recharge essandoh et al 2011 zucker et al 2015 the specific contamination removal mechanisms in sat are shown in fig 1 wastewater is supplied to an infiltration tank excavated in soil of good permeability a series of natural physical chemical and biological reactions could then take place leading to great reduction of inorganic and dissolved organic contaminants during the process of wastewater permeating through the vadose zone ak and gunduz 2013 mienis and arye 2018 sopilniak et al 2018 removal efficiency could be further improved by enhanced methods in the vadose zone of sat system such as improving adsorption capacity of sat via adding special materials e g steel slag cha et al 2006 enhancing infiltration regime of sat via rapid flooding nadav et al 2012 and so on to ensure water safety groundwater in aquifer beneath the vadose zone would generally be withdrawn for further use such as unrestricted irrigation or industrial purposes months or years later onesios and bouwer 2012 sat has been employed in many subtropical regions around the world with the purpose of treated wastewater s reclamation such as california us south france and tel aviv israel arye et al 2011 brissaud et al 1991 mienis and arye 2018 nadav et al 2012 quanrud et al 2003 in recent years many laboratory studies were carried out on the removal of some recalcitrant organic contaminants in wastewater using sat at room temperature apart from easily degradable contaminants guizani et al 2011 hübner et al 2014 for example onesios and bouwer 2012 attempted to remove 14 ppcps pharmaceuticals and personal care products by sat system and the results showed near 95 reductions in 10 of 14 ppcps were obtained in laboratory soil column tests and the biofilm was detected to take effect on the sat capacity enhancement until nearly 256 days of in situ microorganism growth onesios and bouwer 2012 the sat soil columns have also been used by essandoh et al 2012 for estrogens removal both in unsaturated and saturated operating conditions the removal efficiencies were improved by increased transport length in unsaturated zone the improved removal efficiencies were also obtained at lower flow rates in both unsaturated and saturated conditions essandoh et al 2012 among all the removal mechanisms of sat shown in fig 1 adsorption and biodegradation are considered as the major ones for dissolved organic compounds essandoh et al 2012 2013 mienis and arye 2018 moreover biodegradation is normally the dominant removal mechanism for recalcitrant contaminants ak and gunduz 2013 most biodegradation in the sat systems were achieved by acclimatizing the microorganisms existing in soil or wastewater essandoh et al 2012 2013 mienis and arye 2018 onesios and bouwer 2012 however such process would take too long time and may be much difficult to work on toxic organic contaminants of high concentration as pnp is toxic to most microbes rare indigenous microorganisms in soil and wastewater are capable of degrading pnp rodrigues et al 2017 therefore it is difficult to cleanup pnp in wastewater by conventional sat biological treatment attempts in enhancing the pnp elimination artificially have been made in terms of synthesized material adsorption chen et al 2013b three liquid phase extraction yu et al 2009 fenton oxidation rodrigues et al 2017 and biological degradation subashchandrabose et al 2017 since the adsorption capacity is generally limited with balance of desorption and the extraction and fenton oxidation need to be performed under rather harsh experimental condition besides all the above methods are costly whereas the bio removal capacity has been accelerated by artificially introducing specific strains or a consortium of microorganisms the removal of toxic and recalcitrant organics can be persistent with easy operation and low cost li et al 2017 zheng et al 2009 thus bioaugmentation is a promising approach to cleanup targeted pollutants in soil with the crux of the achievement of efficient and environment friendly degradation microorganism chi et al 2013 figdore et al 2018 so far several microbes capable of degrading pnp have been successfully isolated salehi et al 2011 zhang et al 2015b zheng et al 2009 but their preferable temperature for growth is in a range of 25 35 c which is inconsistent with the actual subsurface environment temperature especially in cold region normally 8 20 c zhang et al 2009 if these microbes were introduced into real vadose zone for wastewater purification the microbial activities would be destined to decline or even loss therefore the isolation of effective microbes at low temperature becomes the main constraint of sat for the pnp efficient biodegradation as revealed by literature review above little has been done for the applicability of sat operated at low temperature which is the restrained but not the only factor affecting biodegradation capacity of sat for treatment of organic contaminants in cold region in addition the un robustness of the indigenous microbes in vadose zone or wastewater needs to be overcome for the engineering considerations therefore we first introduce the bioaugmentation technology into sat operated at low temperature in order to rapidly and efficiently remove the recalcitrant contaminants the objectives of this paper were thus to 1 isolate a special strain of bacterium that could biodegrade pnp rapidly and efficiently at real subsurface temperature for the bioaugmented sat 2 investigate the removal process and efficiency of pnp in bioaugmented sat 3 determine the effects of pnp loading concentration flow rate and soil saturation level of sat on the removal efficiency based on characteristics of soil and contaminant 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial screening and identification a long term parathion pesticides applied soil was sampled to isolate the high efficiency pnp degrading bacterium short as hepd bacterium for adding to the bioaugmented sat short as bio sat the soil sample was collected from the surface layer top 5 cm of the agricultural soil yanji china the topsoil temperature varied from 10 to 20 c daily during the period of the sample collection the pure strain screening was undertaken as following steps 1 5 g soil was added to 100 ml sterile mineral salt medium msm containing 200 mg l 1 pnp as the sole carbon source in a 250 ml conical flask plus 1 ml trace elements solution after aerobic incubation in an orbital shaking incubator was carried out at 120 rpm at 30 c for 7 days in dark the aliquot of 5 ml was transferred to 100 ml fresh msm containing 200 mg l 1 pnp this step was repeated six times to complete the enrichment culture then 10 ml of the culture was centrifuged 10000 rpm 10 min the supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was collected 2 the cell pellet was washed with fresh msm 100 ml and incubated in the orbital shaker incubator for 7 days 120 rpm culture temperature was decreased gradually from 30 to 10 c for each acclimation cycle and ultimately the culture was kept at 10 c for repeated cultures the enrichment culture lasted until the yellow of solution pnp color faded 3 the mixed bacteria solution obtained by the enrichment was streaked onto beef extract peptone medium in parallel with the msm pnp of 100 mg l 1 with 2 weight volume agar for isolation and purification of the degrading bacterium the composition of msm was 3 8 g l 1 na2hpo4 12h2o 1 0 g l 1 kh2po4 3 0 g l 1 kcl 0 2 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o which was designed and adjusted according to zhang et al 2015a and its final ph 7 0 and salinity 3 respectively zhang et al 2015a the trace elements solution contained 0 5 g l 1 edta 0 05 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 1 g l 1 znso4 7h2o 0 25 g l 1 feso4 7h2o 0 01 g l 1 na2moo4 2h2o and 0 02 g l 1 cuso4 5h2o all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade purchased from sangon chemical co shanghai china the isolated pure strain was identified by the 16s rdna gene analysis the bacterial total dna was extracted with a dna extraction kit takara japan two universal primers 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 f primer and 1492r 5 ggttaccttgttacgactt 3 r primer were used for the amplification of the 16s rdna gene via polymerase chain reaction pcr the pcr was performed on fluorescence quantitative pcr instrument bio rad america the products were purified and sequenced by sangon chemical co shanghai china the 16s rdna sequence obtained was compared with known sequences in genbank nih usa by blast for homology the homologous sequence and the measured sequence were compared by multiple sequence alignment using clustal x 2 2 biodegradation protocol biodegradation experiments were carried out using the hepd bacterium isolated the initial od600 reflecting the bacterial cell density of the inoculum was 0 002 batch experiments were all performed in triplicate at different temperatures 10 35 c and initial pnp stresses 10 300 mg l 1 and abiotic control flasks were maintained by adding hgcl2 200 mg l 1 bacteriostatic agent as control during incubation 5 ml samples were removed from flasks at appropriate intervals for determination of the pnp remaining concentration the amount of nitrogen released and the bacterial growth at the end of biodegradation total organic carbon toc concentration was analyzed to investigate whether pnp was mineralized the temperature of sat topsoil where the active and significant removal or transformation of dissolved organic matter occurs essandoh et al 2011 suzuki et al 2015 is closely related to air temperature chen et al 2013a according to existing reports the air temperature at actual sat operation site is 12 30 c but the data available for subsurface temperature is rather scarce quanrud et al 2003 nadav et al 2012 which reflects the neglect on study about the effect of subsurface temperature on sat operation we are located in a cold region northeast china n 43 88 e 125 35 with air temperature ranging from 25 to 33 c so we speculated that the topsoil temperature here is rather lower than that of above subtropical regions the data on china soil temperature showed that the average topsoil temperature of northeast region cold region was between 8 and 20 c zhang et al 2009 therefore we have selected 15 c as a typical subsurface temperature of sat topsoil at cold region and it was also set as the test temperature for subsequent column tests all the degradation experiments were performed at this temperature except for the investigation of effects of temperature on degradation ability aiming at assessing the degradation capacity of the strain at a typical subsurface temperature in cold region 2 3 pnp initial stress selection for sat simulation the allowable concentration of pnp in natural waters is restricted by epa to less than 10 ng l 1 zheng et al 2009 however pnp concentration detected in discharged wastewater ranges from 10 to 500 mg l 1 which has been much higher than the limit value wang et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 most existed studies on pnp biodegradation showed that the microbial activities would be weakened or even disappear when the pnp concentration is above 150 mg l 1 due to its high toxicity rodrigues et al 2017 zheng et al 2009 therefore initial pnp concentrations of 1 10 200 mg l 1 were selected in sat experiments for comparison to examine the impact of light intermediate and heavy pollution stresses the pnp artificial wastewater was prepared by dilution in deionized water of a stock solution only containing 1000 mg pnp purity 99 0 analytical grade sangon china in 1 l of ultrapure water the stock solution was prepared weekly and kept in fridge at 4 c after sterilization before supplied to columns there was no change in pnp concentration after storage within the range of measurement errors standard deviation 2 08 mg l 1 2 4 sand medium river sand was selected as the sat medium due to its good permeability and natural characteristics some physical and chemical properties of the soil were characterized and given in table 1 the applied sand was immersed in naoh solution 0 1 mol l 1 continuously for three days to remove surface impurities followed by thoroughly rinsing with ultrapure water and autoclaved sterilization 121 c 20 min prior to packing columns 2 5 column setup for sat breakthrough according to the sat conceptual model shown in fig 1 the flow beneath the infiltration could be generalized as 1d flow and thus sand columns 2 2 cm i d 16 cm bed depth ptfe were applied for the sat simulation in this study the column setup shown in fig 2 was used for study on the sat breakthroughs one water inlet and one outlet were designed in the both caps of column respectively and sampling ports were not provided in side both the top and bottom of column were filled with a gravel diameter 2 mm layer of 0 5 cm thickness as well as a stainless steel mesh of 200 meshes covering between the gravel layer and soil acting as a buffer zone to ensure a uniform water pass through the entire section at column inlet and prevent clogging of column outlet and ptfe gaskets were fixed between the column body and caps to prevent leakage columns were sterilized by a 10 bleach solution for 24 h followed by rinsing with ultrapure water before packing the columns were packed with the above sterilized dry river sand in layers to ensure the sands distributed uniformly in column all columns were fed with identical artificial wastewater all the latex tubes peristaltic pump tubes tanks and beaker used were sterile as well 2 6 sat simulation scenarios different sat operation modes continuous and intermittent flooding lead to different saturation conditions in vadose zone soil therefore both saturated and unsaturated columns were designed to reflect breakthroughs of pnp within vadose zone with different saturation levels different pnp initial loading stresses and flow setting were also investigated fig 2 both saturated and unsaturated columns were performed following wetting drying cycle to control the aerobic conditions as well as prevent the clogging of vadose zone kopchynski et al 1996 thus the biological activity could be better maintained saturated condition was achieved by continuous feeding the artificial pnp wastewater from the column bottom against gravity and the water table was always kept above the sand surface while unsaturated columns were supplied from the top with the same wastewater which were controlled by one injection peristaltic pump contacted to the top and one discharge pump at the bottom fig 2 despite of the different flow directions the total injected pnp solution volume of each column was kept to be the same with the injection flow rates of 219 ml d 1 or 438 ml d 1 abiotic sat column abi sat for short was operated in parallel with each bio sat column to better understand the biological effects and the hgcl2 200 mg l 1 was supplied as a bacteriostatic agent one conventional sat column with natural unsterilized soil was also established as a control for proving the improvement of removal efficiency by bio sat three pnp concentration solutions as mentioned above were compared for unsaturated conditions as well as two discharge rates 219 and 438 ml d 1 pnp of 10 mg l 1 was also supplied at 219 ml d 1 under saturated condition to study the effect of soil saturation level therefore 15 sand columns were independently conducted in total the specific operational conditions of each column were listed in right edge of fig 2 each bio sat soil column experienced three stages successively flow stabilizing bioaugmentation and pnp removal for the first flow stabilizing stage approximately 10 times pore volumes of sterile ultrapure water broke through the columns for the steady hydraulic condition the initial od600 of column effluent was zero to specifically investigate the biological removal process of sat the bioaugmentation step began after the soil reaching adsorption saturation by supplying pnp wastewater and the monitoring of pnp remaining concentrations also commenced at this point in the second bioaugmentation stage the sterile msm with different pnp concentrations was continuously fed to the columns the hepd bacterium solution was introduced regularly into the influent line via the injection port in consideration of the difficulty and cost of culturing bacterium till the pnp concentration in effluent reached initial value arye et al 2011 the od600 value of bacterium solution was set to 0 2 volume of bacterium solution versus msm was 2 ml 20 ml the effluent samples were collected every 2 h in the agilent bottles 10 ml when the remaining concentrations of pnp kept to be constant the bioaugmentation of soil was assumed to be formed finally pnp wastewater of different concentrations was fed to columns which was the pnp removal stage effluent samples were collected every 12 h during wet periods for the measurements of pnp ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrite ph dissolved oxygen do and od600 while no sampling performed during dry periods of the 48 hr wetting drying cycles apart from above parameters toc concentration in effluent was analyzed at the end of sat operation each sampling was performed twice and determined twice in parallel to ensure the better data quality control to simulate the underground environment in cold region all the stages and all the sand columns were conducted at 15 1 c 2 7 analytical methods all water samples collected were measured for od600 with ultraviolet uv spectrophotometer immediately and then the samples were filtered using 0 22 μm membrane filters prior to analysis wen et al 2015 the residual concentration of pnp was measured by the high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a uv vis detector and an eclipse sb c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm shimadzu japan a methyl alcohol water mixture 70 30 v v was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and detection was at the wavelength of 320 nm ammonium nitrate and nitrite analysis were finished by the ion chromatograph shimadzu japan do and ph measurements were made by hach dr2700 and ph meter respectively toc was analyzed by toc analyzer shimadzu japan 3 results and discussions 3 1 isolation and degradation of hepd bacterium 3 1 1 selection and identification of pnp degrading bacterial strain an indigenous bacterial strain capable of degrading pnp and surviving with pnp as its sole carbon nitrogen and energy source for growth was isolated from contaminated soil the 16s rdna sequence analysis showed that it was 99 homologous identity to that of pseudomonas sp the strain was an aerobic and gram positive bacterium with poor acid resistance and it presented a yellow wet and low bulged morphology on the lb plate shown in supplementary information fig s1 3 1 2 selection of optimal temperature for biodegradation the biodegradation experiments carried out at 10 35 c showed that degradation successfully occurred over a wide range of temperatures table 2 the degradation rate of pnp at low temperature 10 20 c which often represented the temperature of real subsurface environment in cold region was over 97 the cell density of the hepd bacterium was also enhanced with increasing temperature in the range of 10 20 c so the hepd bacterium is favorable for introduction into bio sat in cold regions and before introduction the cell density needs to be enriched to 2 107 cfu ml 1 to improve reaction rate the degradation rate at 30 c which may present that in tropical or subtropical topsoil could reach above 99 suggesting that the hepd bacterium may have a strong universality for pnp degradation at different subsurface temperatures 3 1 3 biodegradation ability of hepd bacterium at various pnp stresses biodegradation assays were carried out at 15 c and the initial inoculated od600 was 0 002 fig 3 showed that pnp can be efficiently biodegraded by hepd bacterium at initial pnp loading stresses in the range of 0 200 mg l 1 and the time required for complete biodegradation increased with loading stress there was no significant change of ph during the degradation process supplementary information fig s2 when the initial concentration of pnp was over 200 mg l 1 hepd bacteria were inactivated and could not biodegrade pnp any more this conclusion was verified by the data of table 3 which showed that no significant change happened to the pnp remaining concentration in solution within the range of measured errors namely no biodegradation happened even the hepd bacterium had been inoculated at an increased initial od600 when the initial pnp loading stress was 220 mg l 1 it was due to the enhancement of toxicity with the increased pnp concentrations ghosh et al 2010 3 1 4 degradation products analysis of pnp by hepd bacterium to analyze the metabolites of nitro group pre and post pnp biodegradation change of nitrogen speciation and concentration in solution was shown in fig 4 where no3 and nh4 were not detected in the medium and the concentration of no2 produced was found to increase according to the initial loading concentration of pnp this result was also supported by the findings of other studies gemini et al 2005 tomei et al 2004 regression analysis between the concentrations of produced nitrite and removed pnp showed that reduction in pnp x was associated with the production of concentration of no2 y the stoichiometric coefficient was derived to be 1 03 regression equation y 1 0301x r2 0 9932 since no2 is also considered a toxic environmental contaminant gemini et al 2005 the concentration of no2 was monitored in order to assess the environmental risk that may result from the biodegradation associated no2 production the toc concentrations in solution ranged from 0 to 0 26 mg l 1 when the degradation of pnp was completed indicating that above 99 of initial loading pnp had been mineralized therefore we believed that the ultimate degradation products contained co2 h2o and maybe some unknown inorganics the specific mineralization product could be identified by isotope labeling technology which will be investigated in our future study according to numerous biodegradation studies so far two distinct pnp degradation pathways by various microbes have been identified one involves p benzoquinone hydroquinone and cis trans 4 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde as major intermediate metabolites mainly occurring in gram negative bacteria hq pathway whereas the other proceeds via production of 4 nitrocatechol and 1 2 4 benzenetriol mainly occurring in gram positive bacteria 4 nc pathway above biodegradation intermediates formed in both pathways will be converted to 3 oxoadipate via maleylacetic acid and then participate the tca cycle it s noted that above two pathways could simultaneously occur in some bacteria chauhan et al 2010 hanne et al 1993 spain and gibson 1991 yue et al 2018 zheng et al 2009 based on existing literature and our results we speculated that the possible degradation intermediates of pnp by the hepd bacterium may contain p benzoquinone hydroquinone and cis trans 4 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde 4 nitrocatechol and 1 2 4 benzenetriol maleylacetic acid and 3 oxoadipate the mineralization rate of pnp was above 99 so the intermediates produced in the biodegradation process had little effect on the removal efficiency of bio sat therefore we did not address the specific metabolic process of the hepd bacterium due to limited resource which may be further investigated in future study to assess the environmental risk of this technology 3 2 removal of pnp during bio sat residual pnp concentrations were monitored in both bio sat and abi sat effluent at 15 c from the point of bioaugmentation to the end of the pnp removal at the flow rate of 219 ml d 1 fig 5 showed the reduction in pnp concentrations in both abi sat and bio sat effluents during the experimental period error bars in all figures were based on the standard error the remaining pnp concentrations within abi sat effluent fluctuated but remained in the region of the initial loading concentration of influent because the abi sat had reached saturation of adsorption by pre treatment there was no initial reduction in pnp concentration in bio sat columns as compared to the abiotic control columns day 1 suggesting that one day lag phase occurred before microbial growth and activity commenced then a reduction in pnp concentrations was observed to varying degrees depend on initial loading stresses the remaining concentrations of pnp in effluent from all three bio sat columns under different pnp initial loading stresses reduced steadily during the first 4 5 d 6 5 d and 17 d of the experimental operation furthermore the removal rate decreased with the increase of loading stress of pnp which inferred that in degradable range of concentration high initial levels of contaminant loading may negatively affect microbial growth resulting in a need for microbial population recover namely the effect of the microbial toxicity of pnp ghosh et al 2010 onesios and bouwer 2012 pnp removal process in conventional sat was also compared with bio sat supplementary information fig s3 it showed that bio sat could obviously improve pnp removal efficiency compared with sat and the removal efficiency could reach 100 as to the initial loading concentration of 10 mg l 1 within 5 days after the remaining pnp concentration constant for 4 wetting drying cycles the sterile msm solution was replaced by pnp artificial wastewater meanwhile the hepd bacterium inoculum source was stopped in bio sat columns allowing the final residual pnp to reach a steady state for the onset of pnp removal process changes in pnp remaining concentrations were monitored over a 28 days 28 days and 16 days period for all three loading stresses 1 10 200 mg l 1 as shown in fig 5 where no obvious fluctuation in the residual pnp concentrations was observed in any of the bio sat effluent during this period bio sat still kept its treatment capacity without supply of hepd bacterium inoculum source because the hepd bacterium had grown attaching on the soil media moreover the ability of hepd bacterium to use pnp wastewater as a complete nutrient carbon nitrogen and energy source is highly beneficial to the ability of bio sat columns to continuously remove this persistent organic contaminant above phenomenon is in accordance with the explanation of onesios and bouwer 2012 for biofilm growth which had developed to a possible pseudo steady state after several weeks of water feeding onesios and bouwer 2012 the remaining pnp concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l 1 was constant at 0 mg l 1 not showing any rising trend however the final remaining concentration of 200 mg l 1 was 2 52 mg l 1 never reaching complete removal of pnp throughout the entire removal period it may be caused by the low hydraulic residence time which is an essential parameter affecting biotransformation mienis and arye 2018 removal efficiency of the three columns tested were 100 100 and 98 74 for 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 respectively overall pnp removal efficiency increased in accordance with reduced initial loading concentrations which has also been observed in published literature on the removal of organic nitrogen as well as contamination indicators such as cod doc and bod essandoh et al 2011 2012 mienis and arye 2018 ojeda et al 2008 rapid removal was observed during pnp removal process at all three loading stresses because the biomass had been pre exposed to pnp at bioaugmentation thus avoiding a lag phase when metabolic pathways required for pnp removal were developed tomei et al 2004 so no further acclimatization was necessary for pnp removal in bio sat sem scanning electron microscope analysis were carried out on soil samples taken from above three bio sat columns confirmed the attachment of microbes to the soil particle as compared to the abiotic one fig 6 a the soil particles were also analyzed by xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the results showed there was carbon element on the surface of bioaugmented soil particles which can verify the existence of microbes whilst carbon was not detected on abiotic soil shown in supplementary information fig s4 the images also revealed that mainly rods and small cocci were present and the amounts increased with pnp initial loading concentrations during the process of bioaugmentation fig 6 b d fig 6 e further proved the microbes still attached on the soil surface during pnp removal process although without nutrient solution however the sizes of microbes were found to be decreased and this phenomenon was in agreement with vyas and dave 2010 who found that the size of microbe was related with phosphorus potassium and many other nutrients vyas and dave 2010 the oxygen concentration in influent of three different pnp loadings fluctuated in the range of 4 40 4 60 mg l 1 the final do content in effluent from both abi sat and bio sat were monitored at the end of sat operation period twentieth cycle showed that do in abi sat effluent remained nearly constant 4 61 mg l 1 however in the bio sat effluent all exhibited lower do contents than influent the do decreased with increasing pnp initial loading concentration for the bio sat the specific do values of effluent from bio sat were 3 63 3 46 and 2 66 mg l 1 for the 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 pnp columns respectively and this non drastic reduction in do may indicate that the hepd bacterium was robust with modest oxygen uptake we have not specially investigated whether the biological removal mechanism containing redox reaction but pnp has a strong chemical stability and resistance to chemical oxidation or reduction in natural condition without catalyst due to the presence of nitro group in its structure alizadeh et al 2009 we hence concluded that the do consumption and pnp removal was the evidence of biodegradation 3 3 nitrite production with pnp removal during bio sat treatment accumulation of nitrite due to pnp oxidation was observed in the process of pnp biodegradation within the bio sat columns which was similar to the static degradation process of pnp supplementary information fig s5 it showed that nitrite concentrations reached a maximum of 0 3 mg l 1 on day 5 d 3 mg l 1 on day 7 d and 63 26 mg l 1 on day 17 d corresponding to different pnp initial stresses 1 10 200 mg l 1 in abiotic column effluents nitrite was not been detected throughout the entire operational period the initial detected time nitrite increase rate and time for stabilization of nitrite concentrations all showed good agreement with the attenuation process of pnp in bio sat with the molar ratio of pnp removal to nitrite accumulation being almost 1 1 as supported by findings of previous studies on the biodegradation of pnp to drive nitrite production gemini et al 2005 tomei et al 2004 nitrite is an established toxin and carcinogen gemini et al 2005 with regulatory standards for groundwater in china allowing up to 0 1 mg l 1 lin et al 2008 however nitrite concentrations produced by the biodegradation of pnp within bio sat in the present study were far exceed its approved limits in groundwater systems in the case of shallow or fine sand aquifers the fluctuation of groundwater levels could reach the sat system and carry nitrite from soils to groundwater systems at that moment the combination of existing efficient nitrite removing techniques with bio sat would be suggested for example enrich the indigenous soil microbes that can transform nitrite to n2 sun and austin 2007 or introduce the nanoparticles or optimized nitrifying bacteria ghasemi and sillanpää 2015 lin et al 2008 yang et al 2007 into sat the removal of nitrite produced by bio sat treatment requires further investigation to assess the suitability of inoculating bio sat systems with denitrifying bacteria or colloidal particles and the resulting interactions that would occur with hepd bacterium above mass balance between pnp removal and nitrite production confirmed that pnp biotransformation did occur and adsorption of pnp on the biomass can be excluded the low residual toc concentration in effluent after filtering by 0 22 μm membrane filters from bio sat mainly in a range of 0 1 4 mg l 1 justified that most pnp in wastewater was mineralized instead of reduction 3 4 factors influencing pnp removal in bio sat systems 3 4 1 effects of flow rate on removal efficiency flow rate of pnp wastewater within vadose zone may indirectly affect its persistence during the process of wastewater infiltration into groundwater zones so this effect was investigated with comparison of two hydraulic residence time scenarios 5 136 h and 2 568 h remaining pnp concentrations in bio sat effluents are shown in fig 7 a c where the removal rate of pnp decreased with increase of flow rates at all initial pnp loading doses the amount of time required to reach a steady state of residual pnp was 4 5 days 6 5 days and 17 days respectively for 1 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 of pnp concentrations at 219 ml d 1 this duration extended to 4 5 days 7 days and 27 days when an increased flow rate 438 ml d 1 was applied it is likely resulted from the reduction in hydraulic residence time and the contact time between the bacteria attached on soil and pnp however these results are in contradiction to findings by essandoh et al 2011 that the removal rate of doc cod and bod in sat columns increased with increasing hydraulic loading rate under constant contaminant loading conditions essandoh et al 2011 the difference in above outcomes may be due to the different hydraulic residence times tested and variations in the replenishment of dissolved oxygen fig 7 d showed the degree of pnp removal in the soil columns over a 27 days period 14 cycles of wetting drying alternation for each initial pnp loading concentration there was an increased mass of pnp removal in accordance with increased flow rate although the ultimate removal efficiencies of the columns remained the same at all flow rates remaining constant at 100 100 and 98 7 for the initial loading doses of 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 pnp respectively similar results have been reported for the removal of dextran showing removal efficiencies were independent of flow rate in sat systems fox and makam 2011 it can be also noted that the hydraulic residence time in bio sat under these two flow rates has no effect on biodegradation capability with the hydraulic residence time of 2 568 h is enough for complete removal of 1 and 10 mg l 1 pnp but 5 136 h remains insufficient for complete removal of 200 mg l 1 such results are in concordance with findings reported by ak and gunduz 2013 essandoh et al 2012 laws et al 2011 and sharma et al 2008 on the removal of organic contaminants at varying hydraulic loading rates or extended residence time ak and gunduz 2013 essandoh et al 2012 laws et al 2011 sharma et al 2008 3 4 2 effects of soil saturation considering the two common sat operating modes different soil saturation levels of sat were investigated with soil volumetric moisture contents of 27 8 and 42 corresponding to unsaturated and saturated operating conditions respectively fig 8 a showed pnp removing process by comparing the influent and effluent concentrations under a constant influent concentration of 10 mg l 1 and a flow rate of 219 ml d 1 pnp could be thoroughly degraded in both columns but it took near 4 wetting drying cycles under unsaturated condition and 5 cycles under saturated condition with an average removal mass of 2 50 and 1 67 mg per cycle respectively furthermore removal rate was found to be marginally improved by the reduction in soil saturation level under unsaturated conditions do is the only electron acceptor available for pnp degradation usually regarded as a significant parameter affecting both the rate and the amount of aerobic biodegradation within a system huang et al 2003 accordingly do concentrations in both influent and effluent were monitored to explore the mechanism involved in this association by the eighth wetting drying cycle day 1 of pnp removal process there was a slight decline in pnp removal rate which may be due to the sudden disappearance of phosphorus source required as a microbial nutrient due to the replacement of growth media with artificial wastewater as shown in fig 8 b effluents from both unsaturated and saturated soil columns remained well oxygenated throughout the operational period even after the pnp 10 mg l 1 had been completely removed do was consumed in the soil during pnp aerobic degradation by hepd bacterium but supplementation occurred from the surrounding bubbles and continuous influent during the process of wastewater infiltrating through the unsaturated soil column while saturated soil can only receive oxygen dissolved within the influent so do levels in the unsaturated column effluent 3 46 mg l 1 were higher than that in the saturated column effluent 2 10 mg l 1 this could partly explain why the removal rate of pnp in unsaturated bio sat systems was faster than that in saturated bio sat systems furthermore the biomass observed on the surface of soil particle was less than in saturated bio sat compared to unsaturated bio sat fig 6 f it is of note that bio sat under saturated operating condition is also equipped with the ability of removing pnp completely despite low do concentrations suggesting that the amount of do from influent was sufficient for maintaining the growth and degradation ability of the hepd bacterium a strong positive linear correlation between do concentration and pnp removal rate in unsaturated bio sat in was shown in fig 8 c which suggested that do content is a dominant factor affecting biodegradation when do is sufficient however no significant linear correlation was observed between do concentration and removal rate in saturated bio sat johnson et al 1998 found that isoproturon degradation was not related to the soil moisture content directly at field sites johnson et al 1998 so the specific relation between soil saturation level and pnp removal rate by sat need to be further investigated 4 conclusions this study confirmed the high potential of sat with bioaugmentation in treatment of the pnp wastewater and also its feasibility under relative low temperature in cold regions by a series of laboratory column experiments the major findings are concluded as following 1 an aerobic strain of bacterium that could rapidly and efficiently biodegrade pnp was obtained it could efficiently degrade pnp concentrations up to 200 mg l 1 at temperature range of 10 30 c especially remained its high degradation capability at 15 c a common temperature of subsurface environment at cold regions the introduction of bioaugmentation by the isolated bacterium into conventional sat system resulted in significantly improved removal efficiency for pnp 98 2 within the range of pnp initial loading concentrations selected 1 200 mg l 1 it was found that removal efficiency decreased slightly due to the increased pnp loading stress with the values of 100 100 and 98 74 for the pnp concentrations of 1 10 and 200 mg l 1 respectively equimolar levels of nitrite were produced 0 3 30 and 60 5 mg l 1 respectively as a result of pnp biodegradation 3 increase of hydraulic residence time and dissolved oxygen can effectively improve the pnp removal rate but both has nearly little effect on the removal efficiency with complete degradation of injected pnp which is a great demonstration of the high degradation efficiency and strong adaptation of our isolated bacterium at subsurface temperature in cold region acknowledgements the authors thank the national science foundation of china grants

19394,the effective aridity in riparian areas is increasing from climate change and from human water consumption which exacerbates the impacts of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and from catchment run off in rivers the potential of natural riparian areas to act as green filters has long been recognized but the possible ecological benefits of natural riparian areas over large scale environmental gradients on fish have not been explored in detail using an extensive data set from northeastern spain 99 700 km2 15 catchments 530 sites ours is the first study to ask whether natural riparian vegetation can mitigate the effects of pollution on fish in rivers experiencing water scarcity we used multimodel inference to explore the additive and interactive effects of riparian vegetation with nutrient pollution and water conductivity which are among the world s worst river stressors on multiple fish guilds including widely distributed species and highly invasive alien fish species most models 54 supported the additive effects of water quality factors on fish after having accounted for the influence of geography and hydrological alterations although many fewer models 7 included riparian vegetation as an important predictor riparian vegetation modulated the forms of the associations between fish and pollution the relationship of nutrient pollution with native and alien fish richness changed from negative to positive with greater riparian structure or species richness however we found the opposite effect for the mean body size of sedentary fish and only positive additive effects of riparian richness for the probability of occurrence of pelagic fish ammonium and nitrite concentrations adversely affected fish in these rivers up to 10 years after the enforcement of the implementation of the water framework directive by the european union high conductivity also much affects fish having negatives associations with migratory pelagic invertivorous and native fish and positive associations with sedentary benthic omnivorous and alien fish therefore the current status of natural riparian areas is unlikely to fully mitigate water quality impacts on fish the conservation of freshwater resources in semi arid regions such as north eastern spain requires improved waste water treatments and better agriculture practices graphical abstract image 1 keywords riparian vegetation fish assemblages multiple stressors nutrient pollution sewage effluents ecological guilds 1 introduction the management of freshwater resources is one of the major challenges for humanity freshwater scarcity affects two thirds of the global population 4 billion people and half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity year round mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 sewage discharges exacerbate this crisis of freshwater availability with as many as 2 4 billion people at risk of acquiring water borne diseases w h o 2017 although developing countries are most at risk water pollution issues occur in developed countries especially in semi arid regions where the low dilution ability of rivers makes standard wastewater treatment plants wwtp less able to fully mitigate pollution stress prat and munné 2000 e p a 2013 if most of the world s population are to be living in water stressed areas by 2025 w h o 2017 then there is an urgent need to search for improved water treatment strategies for these regions ideally sensitively integrated with natural ecosystem processes hering et al 2013 current technologies allow the purification of wwtp effluents to high water quality standards e g garcía ivars et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017 yang et al 2017 however these treatments are not always cost effective rosal et al 2010 grant et al 2012 and do not necessarily have the benefits of wwtp when integrated into natural systems such as constructed wetlands hering et al 2013 garcía rodríguez et al 2014 constructed wetlands provide habitats for wildlife alongside water purification kadlec 1979 higgins et al 1993 and they have been used more often in recent decades as a cheaper alternative to technologically advanced wwtps cole 1998 dan et al 2017 some limitations are that constructed wetlands may occupy large surface areas cole 1998 kadlec 1979 and that their performance depends on climate and river flow which may limit their efficacy in semi arid regions but see cerezo et al 2001 puigagut et al 2007 moreover other major pathways of pollution in rivers than point sources wwtp effluents need to be considered such as agricultural runoff krause et al 2008 fig 1 run off and effluents from wwtps carry many compounds which can act as subsidies nutrients or pollutants chemicals and high nutrient levels for riverine ecosystems wagenhoff et al 2011 aristi et al 2015 the benefits of intact riparian vegetation for river ecosystem functioning long have been recognized broadmeadow and nisbet 2004 feld et al 2011 melcher et al 2016 as are buffer strips that reduce the nutrient influx from agricultural areas peterjohn and correll 1984 krause et al 2008 collins et al 2012 however the potential of an intact vegetation continuum to attenuate in stream pollution in rivers have not yet been examined in detail fig 1 the relatively few studies addressing this question in semi arid regions have shown in stream attenuation of inputs from urban and industrial wwtps e g aristi et al 2015 acuña et al 2015 colin et al 2016 or after experimental nutrient additions e g sabater et al 2000 bernal et al 2015 sabater et al 2000 reported that removal of riparian vegetation affects in stream nutrient retention which supports other studies that have shown experimentally the ability of several plant species e g phragmithes australis typha latifolia to purify pollutant mixtures kumari and tripathi 2015 nonetheless chemicals also can be toxic to many organisms including plants and affect their growth abundance and diversity e g barbour et al 1999 colin et al 2016 moreover the structure of riparian areas differs depending on geography and human activities and their benefits can be plant specific e g pozo et al 1997 therefore more comprehensive studies assessing the potential of riparian vegetation to attenuate pollution than these spatially limited studies are necessary before one can develop appropriate mitigation strategies for dealing with riverine water pollution in semi arid regions here we use data from extensive fish surveys in rivers in northeastern spain n 530 sampling sites 15 catchments to explore the effects of riparian vegetation and pollution on freshwater fish assemblages freshwater fish are very important resources for humans and are among the most at risk biotic groups on earth closs et al 2015 previous studies in northeastern spain have shown that individuals body condition and size and the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages are affected by water pollution and by physical habitat degradation e g murphy et al 2013 maceda veiga et al 2016 colin et al 2017 2018 therefore our study system has the potential to explore how the effects of water pollution on fish might depend on the status of riparian vegetation which has not yet been explored moreover the ecological characteristics of fish assemblages in northeastern spain e g foraging migratory and invasive behaviours are similar to many fish assemblages around the world closs et al 2015 which potentially makes our inferences generalizable beyond our study system by using multimodel inference we explored the additive and interactive effects of in stream water pollution and riparian vegetation on fish we used multiple fish attributes that are common in environmental monitoring that use fish as bioindicators aarts and nienhuis 2003 fausch et al 1990 murphy et al 2013 including individual traits e g body condition and size and guild categorizations e g native status migratory and foraging behaviors table 1 perturbations such as pollution may impair fish growth and condition before their effects become apparent in populations or communities underwood 1989 if riparian or water pollution effects differ among fish guilds we expected greater effects on sedentary benthic species because sedentary and benthic species probably experience local conditions more fully than do migratory species negative effects should be most intense on fish species at the apices of food webs because perturbations propagate up food webs leading to differentially greater declines in top predators paine 1966 o connor et al 2013 if alien fish species are indicators of poor environmental conditions which is often assumed in river health assessments but see kennard et al 2005 the adverse effects of poor water and riparian quality should be greater for native than for alien fish last our work expands the limited analysis of the interactive effects among perturbations on freshwater ecosystems e g jackson et al 2016 maceda veiga et al 2017 kath et al 2018 by exploring whether there is a need to consider interactions between riparian vegetation and water pollution in rivers under water scarcity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we collected fish riparian and environmental data in 530 sampling sites in 15 catchments from 2002 to 2009 within a framework of several projects to assess the ecological status of rivers in north eastern spain in compliance with the european water framework directive eu directive 2000 60 ec the study area was the entire river ebro basin part of the garonne basin and all catalonian catchments draining to the mediterranean sea fig 2 these catchments have a mediterranean hydrological regime with high chances of floods in autumn and of droughts in summer while most parts of these catchments travel through semi arid regions natural resource managers identified five river typologies low and high mountain rivers moist mountain rivers littoral intermittent rivers and lowland permanent rivers based on changes in elevation evapotranspiration precipitation and river slope e g sostoa et al 2003 the study sites represented the diverse orography of the region elevation ranges from 0 to 1814 m a s l all geological types although most rivers were calcareous and the range of fish assemblages riparian structures and water quality conditions if sampling sites were close to a human settlement we surveyed from 300 to 1000 m downstream of the settlements depending on site accessibility the distance between sampling sites was 1 km the vegetation of riparian areas consisted of relatively intact native deciduous forests e g alnus glutinosa and mediterranean oak forests e g quercus ilex crops e g zea mays triticum spp medicago sativa weedy areas e g rubus ulmifolius and plantations including widely distributed alien plant species e g arundo donax eucalyptus globulus robinia pseudoacacia nentwig et al 2017 as for many countries in southern europe e p a 2013 the majority of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in this region have no tertiary treatment h salvadó personal communication and water scarcity leads wwtp effluents to be up to 90 of river flow particularly for streams in summer droughts and with high human water demand e g prat and munné 2000 mandaric et al 2018 moreover there are sparse illegal pollution spills and rivers drain intensive farming and agriculture areas especially in eu nitrate vulnerable zones which are 45 of all catalonian municipalities aca 2017 we surveyed in low flow conditions because this is when fish populations are most stable and can be sampled best by using electrofishing see below low flow conditions also are the most intense stressful conditions and consequently we could better identify associations among fish water quality and riparian vegetation 2 2 fish surveys fish were captured using an international standardized fish sampling method cen standards en 14962 and en 14011 for the whole wetted area of at least 100 m long reach at each sampling site in low flow conditions in an upstream direction e g maceda veiga et al 2017 colin et al 2018 we used single pass electrofishing with a portable unit that generated up to 200 v and 3 a pulsed dc which detects 80 100 of the fish species and captures 60 90 of the individuals compared to four pass electrofishing a s unpublished data the studied rivers exemplified the small and medium size streams typical of mediterranean climate regions sabater et al 2009 the survey of large rivers e g main ebro river channel would have required the use of fishing boats and so fish data would not have been comparable among sampling sites we used the same equipment at all sites to avoid potential bias in captures and we expressed data as captures per unit of effort cpue individuals caught divided by fishing time in minutes and the area surveyed in m2 fish surveys were authorized by the spanish government and the autonomous government of catalonia ap 003 fish were anaesthetized in a buffered ms222 solution 0 02 tricaine methane sulfonate sigma in buckets provided with air pumps to limit stress as directed by the university of barcelona ethical committee c e e a 510 14 all fish were allowed to recover in river water after measurements were made identified to species level and released at the site of capture data were counts of the total number of individuals by species and lengths mm and weights g of a random set of individuals from each species 40 if possible we used fish mass m i and length l i to calculate the scaled mass index smi m i l o l i b sma sensu peig and green 2009 l o is the mean of l i of each fish species and b sma is the scaling exponent obtained from a type ii linear regression between m i and l i the smi is an index of body condition which is widely used for animals including fish e g maceda veiga et al 2016a colin et al 2016 and smi is regarded as a correlate of fitness measures peig and green 2009 we assigned each fish species to four guild classifications see maceda veiga et al 2017 for a full list of species using fish atlases and descriptions of the biology and ecology of species doadrio 2011 colin et al 2016 the native status of fish was defined as a native if regional faunal lists indicate that the species historically occurred in the basin where captured or b alien if it indicates that the fish species was not historically present in the basin of capture or elsewhere in the iberian peninsula the trophic guild of each fish species was defined as a omnivorous or b invertivorous which occasionally prey upon small vertebrates based on adults diet the migratory behaviour guild included sedentary or migratory in our study area only the european eel anguilla anguilla moves between marine and freshwater water bodies while the other migratory species e g salmo trutta parachondrostoma miegii luciobarbus graellsii typically undertake within river upstream migrations for breeding last the swimming guild was benthic or pelagic swimmers 2 3 riparian vegetation the status of riparian vegetation and connectivity to adjacent woodlands was evaluated using four measures from established protocols e g the index of riparian quality qbr and the protocol hidri munné et al 2003 total marginal cover ranked the surface of the riparian area covered by riparian trees from 10 to 80 weighted by the amount of discontinuity between the riparian area and adjacent woodland from 25 to 100 of connectivity with the overall score being on a 0 25 scale see appendix s1 for a full description the riparian vegetation structure was assessed on a 0 25 scale considering the percentage of trees from 0 to 75 of riparian trees and shrubs from 10 to 25 of shrubs in the riparian area and its continuity along the river weighted by the presence of planted trees emergent aquatic plants e g t latifolia p australis and the amount of brushwood e g 50 of emergent aquatic plants linear plantations with 50 of brushwood cover see appendix s1 for a full description another measure of riparian complexity was the total number of biomass dominant riparian species alongside each sampling site last we used these plant inventories to classify communities as mediterranean oak forest pine plantations native riparian trees monocultures of the large herb arundo donax and other alien tree species e g robinia pseudoacacia ailanthus altissima using the methods outlined in the regional biodiversity atlas banc de dades de biodiversitat de catalunya font et al 2018 2 4 water quality and other predictors each sampling site was characterized by using eight water quality variables and six environmental descriptors to account for potential confounding factors in establishing associations among water quality riparian structure and fish assemblages water quality was analyzed prior to the conduct of the fish surveys the colorimetric test kit visocolor quantified general water hardness and the concentrations of ammonium detection limit dl 0 2 mg l nitrite dl 0 02 mg l nitrate dl 1 mg l and phosphate p dl 0 2 mg l while a digital multiparametric ysi probe measured temperature ºc conductivity μs cm and ph we did not have access to an oxygen probe during the fish surveys all of these variables were chosen to detect major water quality issues in rivers caused directly by the release of sewage effluents or from catchment run off from agricultural areas or indirectly by alterations in biogeochemical cycles and water ionic composition from pollutants that were not measured e g industrial waste in colin et al 2016 therefore nutrient concentrations and conductivity were regarded as tracers of general water pollution including that caused by potash mines e g fernandez turiel et al 2003 kaushal et al 2018 clean waters in this region have conductivity values 600 μs cm phosphate levels 0 05 mg l and ammonium and nitrite concentrations 0 015 mg l sánchez montoya et al 2018 elevation was used as a surrogate for the position of the sampling site in the river and to represent natural spatial factors affecting aquatic organisms e g maceda veiga et al 2016 elevation was highly correlated with the minimum and maximum annual air temperature spearman s ρ 0 8 and with the distance to the river mouth spearman s ρ 0 70 n 325 sampling sites maceda veiga 2013 changes in elevation affect the amount of solar radiation precipitation and topography all of which determine the altitudinal zonation of vegetation daubenmire 1943 font et al 2018 and so elevation was preferred for the analyses we calculated the strahler stream order number as a measure of river size strahler 1964 which was derived from a 1 50 000 map rivers were ranked from small first order tributaries to the largest main river based on a hierarchy of tributaries strahler stream order number is proportional to relative watershed dimensions channel width slope and stream discharge at that place in the system strahler 1964 there were no gauging stations near most of our sampling sites and so we did not have a direct measure of river flow the use of alternative methods to quantify flow such as the addition of nacl and measuring changes in river conductivity over time elosegi et al 2009 was infeasible due to the amount of salt necessary the extensive area sampled often in remote areas and the high natural conductivity of some sampling sites therefore we used three proxies for river flow we used an integrated measure of river hydromorphological integrity e g presence of weirs channels and walls to quantify the degree of naturalness of the river channel which modulates river water flow on a scale from 0 bad to 10 good conservation status appendix s1 we measured the water velocity and the depth of the river at three points evenly distributed across the river and at each 20 m band upstream to the end of the surveyed reach last we ranked habitat diversity e g presence of riffles pools refugees from 0 to 10 following the methods in the u s rapid bioassessment protocol barbour et al 1999 this is a measure of habitat quality which also indirectly measures river flow if headwaters have a high percentage of riffles and these are rare under water scarcity 2 5 data analyses analyses were conducted in r r core team 2016 using the packages and functions outlined below there were six response variables 1 species richness 2 shannon species diversity 3 presence 4 abundance of fish at sites where they occurred 5 the mean of individual body length and 6 body condition to characterize fish populations in each sampling site abundance data were very skewed and so we distinguished between fish presence 3 and abundance at sites where fish occurred 4 because the statistical fits of presence and abundance where present models were better than abundance based models for all data spatial gradients of variation in environmental predictors were used in models instead of classifying sampling sites as pristine and perturbed because gradient analyses are more realistic and objectively defined representations of natural systems friberg et al 2011 moreover the actual toxicities of conductivity many nutrients and ph largely are unknown for fish species in northeastern spain therefore a pristine vs perturbed dichotomy would be arbitrary especially if upstream and downstream fish species are expected to have different tolerances to the same water quality variables see maceda veiga et al 2017 nonetheless nutrient concentrations were aggregated based on the most probable toxic severity camargo and alonso 2006 such as ammonium and nitrite tn and nitrate and phosphate p np with the latter being the less toxic at low concentrations 2 5 1 pair wise correlations and data transformation visual inspection of the distribution of all predictors showed that continuous variables were right skewed and so these were log transformed pair wise correlations among all predictors were examined using spearman s ρ total riparian cover and general water hardness were the only variables strongly correlated with riparian vegetation structure and ph respectively all spearman s ρ 0 85 we omitted total riparian cover and general water hardness because there were better model fits r 2 than when their peers were included such selection was assessed further by looking at variation inflation factors vif to explore collinearity and the retained predictors appendix s2 was the only set in which collinearity was of little statistical concern vifs 2 zuur et al 2010 all the retained predictors were standardized 0 mean unit variance to have all predictors on a common scale i e each variable is expressed in units of its standard deviation we grouped predictors as 1 water quality descriptors wq 2 riparian descriptors veg and 3 covariates general river descriptors env for brevity table 1 however all variables within each set were included individually in models 2 5 2 overview of modelling techniques we used generalized linear mixed models glmms and hierarchical partitioning hp as two complementary approaches to establish associations between water quality riparian vegetation and fish attributes while accounting for the confounding effects of covariates predictors are always correlated even when the most highly correlated are excluded appendix s2 which can bias regression estimates of glmms mac nally 2000 glmms can include random effects so we included basin and year as random intercepts we collectively refer to these as ρ to account for potential systematic differences arising from these factors while hp cannot accommodate random effects or include categorical variables e g basin the method is one of the best ways to identify independent explained variance among correlated predictors mac nally 2000 and so is complementary way to makes inferences alongside glmms the support for the hypothesis that fish might benefit from riparian areas in northeastern spain including pollution attenuation was determined by assessing the effect size of water and riparian quality variables identified as important by both glmm and hp models to explain variation in the nine fish guilds 2 5 2 1 generalized linear mixed models a series of glmms m1 to m5 was built using the function glmer in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 to identify the predictors that best represented the variation in the nine fish guilds table 3 we used bernoulli errors logit link function for presence absence data poisson errors log link function for abundance and richness and gaussian errors log link for fish length and fish body condition smi an akaike information criterion aic approach was used to assess whether increasing the number of predictors in base model m1 which included just random effects and covariates markedly improved model fit we selected the best models for explaining variation in the fish responses based on the lowest aic value i e 2 aic units less than any other candidate model and the associated change in fit among equally plausible model overall fit for the best models needs to be assessed mac nally et al 2018 so we used the function auc area under curve auc in the proc package robin et al 2011 for bernoulli models and for other error distributions we used the function r squaredglmm r 2 in the mumin package barton 2011 if riparian vegetation riparian vegetation structure and richness of biomass dominant tree species had no discernible effect on the fish responses then models m1 and m2 should be superior to m3 m4 and m5 which included the additive m3 and m4 and interactive effects of riparian vegetation m5 if water quality is a major environmental concern in the studied rivers and vegetation has limited additional explanatory power then the best model should be m2 if geographical factors physical habitat and instream hydraulics were the most important predictors to explain variation in fish responses then the best model should be m1 if riparian vegetation were identified as important variable for accounting variation in fish attributes then we asked do any of the most common vegetation types in northeastern spain mediterranean oak forest pine plantations native riparian trees a donax and other alien tree species explain much additional variation to models with additive or interactive effects of water quality and riparian vegetation descriptors plant species provide rivers with different quality and quantity of litter pozo et al 1997 naiman et al 1998 and may affect riverine conditions differently depending on the plants physiologies for example river water flow is altered by evapotranspiration which differs among plant species nagler et al 2005 if the type of riparian vegetation had no substantial effect on fish then the model including riparian vegetation structure and richness of biomass dominant tree species would be the best one the function anova was used to assess the significance of the predictors included in the best models χ 2 p 0 05 models were validated by inspecting diagnostic plots of model residuals following zuur et al 2010 we tested for spatial autocorrelation using the moran index in the package spdep bivand et al 2012 and found that it was not likely to be an analytical problem moran values ranging from 0 05 to 0 09 p 0 2 2 5 2 2 hierarchical partitioning analyses of variance the relative importance of the predictors selected by the aic approach in explaining variation in fish attributes significant at p 0 05 was evaluated further by using hierarchical partitioning hp function hier part walsh et al 2003 hp partitions the independent contributions of each predictor to variation in the response variable and distinguishes these from the joint contribution with other predictors i e collinearity the function rand hp was used to test the significance of hp models using a randomization test for hierarchical partitioning analysis based on the upper 95 confidence limit 2 5 2 3 the importance of river typologies although all of our models accounted for the potentially confounding effect of natural geographical and hydrological factors we specifically compared the performance of the best models including riparian vegetation with those including river typology as another potentially more specific covariate low and high mountain rivers moist mountain rivers littoral intermittent streams and lowland permanent rivers see study area using a subset of our data set for which we had this information n 325 sampling sites similarly we rebuilt all models for a subset of our data set with just the smaller streams strahler stream order 4 to explore whether the effects of riparian vegetation might be greater for them the statistical assessment processes was the same stated above 3 results we caught 34 fish species including representatives of all native status 47 native and 53 alien trophic guilds 65 omnivores and 35 invertivores swimming behaviours 53 benthic and 47 pelagic and migratory guilds 92 sedentary and 8 migratory fish were caught in all four vegetation types mediterranean oak forests deciduous native trees pine plantations a donax and other alien tree species in different water quality conditions and in all river typologies in terms of size and elevation table 1 the most frequently captured fish species 140 sampling sites were the native cyprinids b haasi and l graellsii and the native salmonid s trutta 3 1 had riparian vegetation or water quality discernible effects on fish guilds twenty nine 54 out of the 54 best generalized linear mixed models glmms included water quality variables as important factors for predicting fish responses and fitted the data relatively well given the number of sites r 2 0 22 0 75 auc 0 66 0 78 table 3 appendix s3 alongside water quality variables four 7 of the 54 best models included riparian vegetation for predicting the fish responses and fitted the data reasonably well r 2 0 41 0 49 table 3 there were additive effects between water quality and riparian variables for the presence of pelagic fish and interactive effects for total native richness total alien richness and mean length of sedentary fish table 3 twenty one 39 of the models included only geographical and hydro morphological variables as important factors for predicting fish responses especially for the alien and invertivorous guilds table 3 when only additive effects were considered all fish guilds were negatively associated with the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite and positively related to ph except for pelagic fish for which there was no clear association fig 3 although conductivity had an overall negative association with all fish the effects differed among guilds while the association was positive for sedentary benthic omnivorous and alien fish it was negative for migratory pelagic invertivorous and native fish fig 3 similarly the concentration of phosphate and nitrate had an overall negative association with all fish but the association was positive for sedentary fish negative for omnivorous and native fish and neutral for others fig 3 3 2 associations between riparian vegetation and fish guilds using glmms riparian vegetation was identified as an important factor for explaining variation in native fish richness alien fish richness the probability of occurrence of pelagic fish and the mean length of sedentary fish appendix s4 fig 3 there was a negative association between riparian structure and alien fish richness table 3 the richness of biomass dominant riparian species also was negatively associated with the mean length of sedentary fish but positively related to the presence of pelagic fish table 3 the effects of riparian vegetation on the fish were modulated by water quality the relationship between native fish richness and the concentrations of ammonia and nitrite went from negative to positive with increasing riparian vegetation structure or riparian richness fig 4 however the positive association between mean length of sedentary fish and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite or those of phosphate and nitrate switched to negative with increasing riparian richness fig 4 last the negative association between riparian vegetation structure and alien fish richness was attenuated by larger values of water conductivity fig 4 none of these four models was improved by including the five most frequent vegetation types table 4 regardless of the vegetation type riparian vegetation structure or richness of biomass dominant tree species were the most influential riparian variables of fish responses table 4 results from glmms mostly were consistent with those from hp calculations table 5 the exceptions were 1 ph was important in the glmm for alien fish richness but not in the hp model 2 the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were significant for the mean body length of pelagic fish in glmms but not in hp analyses and 3 the index of river morphology was important in glmms but not for hp for the presence of pelagic fish table 5 overall the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite explained variation in native fish richness alongside physical habitat diversity and strahler stream order physical habitat diversity and conductivity contributed to the probability of pelagic fish occurrence variation in alien fish richness mostly was explained by elevation and strahler stream order last the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite and richness of biomass dominant tree species mostly was associated with changes in mean length of sedentary fish table 5 3 3 did river typologies markedly influence our outcomes the inclusion of river typology as a predictor in the best glmms for the fish responses which included riparian vegetation variables increased aic values i e poorer fits and did not improve significantly model predictions appendix s5 therefore environmental covariates other than river typology were more influential in explaining associations between fish responses and riparian vegetation when all models were recalculated for the subset of strahler stream orders 4 appendix s6 the explanatory power generally declined compared to results for the full data set appendix s7and s8 there were inconsistences in only six of the 54 models the model for the presence of migratory fish was the only one that included riparian vegetation m3 that had not done so previously however model fit was worse than when the best model was m2 appendix s7 4 discussion our extensive fish data set including widely distributed ecological guilds is a first in exploring the additive and interactive effects of riparian vegetation and water quality on riverine fish over large scale environmental gradients we found broad support for additive effects between water conductivity and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite on several fish guilds in a semi arid region there was less evidence for the additive or interactive effects between these factors and riparian vegetation on fish and there was little evidence that the type of riparian community affected associations only riparian vegetation structure or the richness of biomass dominant species might influence how water pollution affects fish in particular total native and alien fish richness the presence of pelagic fish and the mean length of sedentary fish 4 1 weak associations of fish with riparian vegetation compared to water quality impacts while riparian vegetation appeared to provide fish with many benefits broadmeadow and nisbet 2004 feld et al 2011 melcher et al 2016 only 7 of the 54 models we built included riparian vegetation as an important factor table 3 given that much of the variance in our models remained unexplained generally r 2 0 56 appendix s9 the limited effect of riparian vegetation might be due to rivers being highly dynamic or high fish mobility aquatic assemblages may be more affected by regional scale processes than by local conditions holt 2002 heino et al 2015 however regional conditions may not be so important for most fish guilds because 54 of our models found associations between local water quality and fish attributes after accounting for potential effects of spatial confounding factors moreover the majority of the studied species move short distances even though their exact home ranges are unknown de sostoa et al 1990 for example barbus haasi one of the most frequently captured native species moves 100 m in a year and most individuals remain close to pools aparicio and de sostoa 1999 this fish behaviour probably is common in small mediterranean rivers which we surveyed appendix s8 to allow many fish species to deal with seasonal drought when models included both riparian vegetation and water quality variables ammonium nitrite and high water conductivity jointly made a larger independent contribution to variation in fish guilds than did riparian vegetation these outcomes suggest that riparian vegetation may have not mitigated pollution effects sufficiently fig 1 even though the longitudinal attenuation of pollution had been reported in some of the studied rivers e g aristi et al 2015 bernal et al 2015 colin et al 2016 riparian vegetation reduces nutrient influx from surrounding agricultural areas peterjohn and correll 1984 collins et al 2012 directive 91 271 eec but only one municipality vic was within eu s designated nitrate vulnerable zone due to intensive farming directive 91 676 eec therefore we are confident that our high conductivity ammonium and nitrite values mostly are attributed to multiple inputs from wwtps and possibly from illegal spills peaks in ammonium and nitrite concentrations should not have been detected if the compulsory secondary treatment had been applied to wastewater directive 91 271 eec previous studies have shown that other compounds including those that are biologically recalcitrant e g metals chlorides pesticides pharmaceuticals are present in the studied rivers at harmful concentrations due to the lack of advanced wwtp e g muñoz et al 2009 colin et al 2016 despite this water quality ammonium nitrite and conductivity levels was much improved 1 5 km downstream of the discharge site of an industry in a stream travelling through an open oak forest with pines colin et al 2016 however toxicants may have been stored in other ecosystem compartments e g sediment hyporheic habitat monroy et al 2014 sánchez morales et al 2018 therefore improving wwtps probably is the most appropriate action especially if long reaches of rivers in the study area that were fishless a decade ago now have fish populations given better functioning wwtps even in poorly vegetated reaches e g vinyoles et al 2007 colin et al 2016 the limited effects of riparian vegetation on fish experiencing pollution might be due to several mechanisms fig 1 pollution including high nutrient loads homogenizes the composition and much reduces the abundance of benthic communities mason 1996 which are food for fish however we found that riparian vegetation promoted total fish richness possibly because reduced benthic food availability may have been offset by in falling terrestrial foods e g arthropods from riparian vegetation see nakano et al 1999 whose diversity and total abundance is positively associated with riparian plant richness e g greenwood et al 2004 maceda veiga et al 2016b the availability of such terrestrial inputs may explain the positive association between riparian richness and the occurrence of pelagic fish e g s trutta which often feed on terrestrially derived insects nakano et al 1999 litter and roots of riparian plants increase habitat complexity which can promote fish richness by reducing prey consumer interactions sievers et al 2017 higher riparian tree species richness in the riparian communities affected the association between the mean length of sedentary fish and nutrient concentrations from positive to negative suggesting that nutrients probably were pollutants rather than subsidies wagenhoff et al 2011 another possible explanation for reduced fish size is that high riparian richness i e five tree species may reflect altered riparian condition in our study area well developed native riparian forests typically have fewer than five tree species e g a dense gallery of alnus glutinosa sabater et al 2000 even though our study did not include specific indicators of riparian forest health such as tree age and the presence of seedlings or snags ward and worthley 2003 if riparian condition were poor for fish we should not have found high richness of native and alien fish at the greatest riparian richness although the inclusion of plant species identity into models might be expected to affect the fish riparian associations adding information on the five dominant vegetation types to the analyses did not much affect model fit it is possible that we would have obtained clearer inferences if we had been able to use the total distance rivers had travelled through vegetated riparian zones at the sampled locations identifying the individual contribution of predictors in correlative studies such as ours always is difficult due to the natural covariation of predictors e g alien fish often occur in degraded habitats e g maceda veiga et al 2017 however the use of modelling techniques that are designed to deal with collinearity such as hierarchical partitioning analyses helps to identify and rank individual effects mac nally 2000 there were broad ranges in water quality in streams from all strahler stream orders appendix s8 which should reduce potential confounding due to spatial location moreover we obtained similar inferences from models including the full data set to models for just strahler stream orders 4 appendix s7 4 2 identifying the most vulnerable fish guilds to changes in water and riparian quality the associations between water pollution and riparian vegetation differed among fish guilds and among metrics within each guild which highlights the value of multi species and multi metric assessments as recommended by the eu s water framework directive ec 2000 there were associations between multiple fish guilds and water quality variables but native fish and invertivorous species that often prey upon small vertebrates had greater negative associations with both high conductivity and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite fig 3 the first is consistent with a marked decline of native fish species in northeastern spain partly due to habitat degradation maceda veiga 2013 the second association supports the assertion that species at the apices of food chains are among the most affected by perturbations paine 1966 o connor et al 2013 high conductivity had discernible adverse effects on pelagic fish e g squalius laietanus salmo trutta but not on the expected benthic less mobile species e g b haasi b meridionalis these outcomes may be due to s trutta having a wider distribution in northeastern spain than s laietanus and with s trutta being more sensitive to water pollution than s laietanus maceda veiga and de sostoa 2011 however our findings from low flow conditions are consistent with colin et al 2017 who attributed the potential higher tolerance of the benthic b meridionalis to low water levels than the pelagic s laietanus when exposed to water pollution alien fish metrics were negatively associated with the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite but were positively associated with conductivity which probably is a better proxy for general chronic pollution e g potash mines industrial discharges fernandez turiel et al 2003 colin et al 2016a this could question the relevance of alien fish species in environmental monitoring especially if most eco toxicological studies on wild fish in europe have been conducted using alien cyprinid fishes such as common carp c carpio colin et al 2016b inferences from work on carp should be compared to those for more sensitive species including putatively more sensitive alien species to avoid bias in establishing safe thresholds for water quality however this would require a re assessment of fish tolerance to environmental degradation possibly by using biomarkers i e physiological indicators which have not yet been adopted in official monitoring programs colin et al 2016b 4 3 possible management strategies to improve water quality considering the highly toxicity of nitrite and ammonium at low concentrations especially at the high ph values we saw noga 2011 it is a priority to reduce nitrite and ammonium concentrations in northeastern spanish rivers wwtps should be relatively larger in semi arid regions compared with northern european countries in which higher river flows year round help to dilute effluents see also prat and munné 2000 another low cost treatment may be to direct effluents to travel through constructed wetlands which also would remove other pollutants hering et al 2013 garcía rodríguez et al 2014 riparian vegetation including trees shrubs and grass strips can retain up to 100 of total nitrogen and up to 70 of phosphorous and a minimum width of 30 m on either side of a stream has been suggested to mimic the effects of well preserved riparian forests feld et al 2011 this management strategy also applies to agricultural areas to reduce diffuse pollution krause et al 2008 collins et al 2012 however industrial effluents probably need more targeted treatments e g marcucci et al 2002 schoebert et al 2005 if high water conductivity itself is toxic to riparian trees busch and smith 1995 the establishment of safe thresholds for pollutants in nature is challenging especially when the toxicity of nutrients such as nitrates e g camargo and alonso 2006 smallbone et al 2016 and phosphates e g maceda veiga et al 2017 everall et al 2018 is not well known moreover chlorides which increase conductivity reduce the toxicity of nutrients such as nitrite to fish noga 2011 alongside water quality our study identified hydro morphological alterations e g dams channelization that were adverse to pelagic fish in addition to sluggish flow which also was negatively associated with native fish richness these results provide some support to the notion that the natural hydrology of rivers favours native fish closs et al 2015 and that water scarcity affects pelagic fish more than benthic species colin et al 2017 moreover the negative association we saw between alien fish richness and river water speed suggests that restoring the natural hydrological regime probably would help to control alien fish which typically originated in sluggish stagnant waters moyle and marchetti 2006 the conservation of native riparian areas may benefit from restoring river flow if hydrology and river geomorphology affect riparian vegetation structure naiman et al 1998 the concentration of water pollutants is reduced with higher river flow e g colin et al 2016a and riffles increase water oxygenation however fast flowing waters do need to alternate with zones of low stream velocities to increase the contact time between water roots and the substrate all of which attenuate pollution kadlec 1979 higgins et al 1993 nonetheless these interferences need a more comprehensive understanding of the processes involved in pollution attenuation e g photolysis sorption volatilization gurr and reinhard 2006 5 conclusions our study provided little evidence that the current condition of riparian zones in northeastern spain is sufficient to mitigate pollution effects on fish therefore the most appropriate course of action may be to improve wastewater treatments and to restore river natural flows to reduce nutrient and water conductivity toxic effects the development of healthy riparian forest can take a long time after land use change removal of dams and reductions in toxicants human assisted re vegetation may help but increasing water loss from evapotranspiration should be taken into account in this largely semi arid region more research into the ecological consequences of riparian management is needed to make

19394,the effective aridity in riparian areas is increasing from climate change and from human water consumption which exacerbates the impacts of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and from catchment run off in rivers the potential of natural riparian areas to act as green filters has long been recognized but the possible ecological benefits of natural riparian areas over large scale environmental gradients on fish have not been explored in detail using an extensive data set from northeastern spain 99 700 km2 15 catchments 530 sites ours is the first study to ask whether natural riparian vegetation can mitigate the effects of pollution on fish in rivers experiencing water scarcity we used multimodel inference to explore the additive and interactive effects of riparian vegetation with nutrient pollution and water conductivity which are among the world s worst river stressors on multiple fish guilds including widely distributed species and highly invasive alien fish species most models 54 supported the additive effects of water quality factors on fish after having accounted for the influence of geography and hydrological alterations although many fewer models 7 included riparian vegetation as an important predictor riparian vegetation modulated the forms of the associations between fish and pollution the relationship of nutrient pollution with native and alien fish richness changed from negative to positive with greater riparian structure or species richness however we found the opposite effect for the mean body size of sedentary fish and only positive additive effects of riparian richness for the probability of occurrence of pelagic fish ammonium and nitrite concentrations adversely affected fish in these rivers up to 10 years after the enforcement of the implementation of the water framework directive by the european union high conductivity also much affects fish having negatives associations with migratory pelagic invertivorous and native fish and positive associations with sedentary benthic omnivorous and alien fish therefore the current status of natural riparian areas is unlikely to fully mitigate water quality impacts on fish the conservation of freshwater resources in semi arid regions such as north eastern spain requires improved waste water treatments and better agriculture practices graphical abstract image 1 keywords riparian vegetation fish assemblages multiple stressors nutrient pollution sewage effluents ecological guilds 1 introduction the management of freshwater resources is one of the major challenges for humanity freshwater scarcity affects two thirds of the global population 4 billion people and half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity year round mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 sewage discharges exacerbate this crisis of freshwater availability with as many as 2 4 billion people at risk of acquiring water borne diseases w h o 2017 although developing countries are most at risk water pollution issues occur in developed countries especially in semi arid regions where the low dilution ability of rivers makes standard wastewater treatment plants wwtp less able to fully mitigate pollution stress prat and munné 2000 e p a 2013 if most of the world s population are to be living in water stressed areas by 2025 w h o 2017 then there is an urgent need to search for improved water treatment strategies for these regions ideally sensitively integrated with natural ecosystem processes hering et al 2013 current technologies allow the purification of wwtp effluents to high water quality standards e g garcía ivars et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017 yang et al 2017 however these treatments are not always cost effective rosal et al 2010 grant et al 2012 and do not necessarily have the benefits of wwtp when integrated into natural systems such as constructed wetlands hering et al 2013 garcía rodríguez et al 2014 constructed wetlands provide habitats for wildlife alongside water purification kadlec 1979 higgins et al 1993 and they have been used more often in recent decades as a cheaper alternative to technologically advanced wwtps cole 1998 dan et al 2017 some limitations are that constructed wetlands may occupy large surface areas cole 1998 kadlec 1979 and that their performance depends on climate and river flow which may limit their efficacy in semi arid regions but see cerezo et al 2001 puigagut et al 2007 moreover other major pathways of pollution in rivers than point sources wwtp effluents need to be considered such as agricultural runoff krause et al 2008 fig 1 run off and effluents from wwtps carry many compounds which can act as subsidies nutrients or pollutants chemicals and high nutrient levels for riverine ecosystems wagenhoff et al 2011 aristi et al 2015 the benefits of intact riparian vegetation for river ecosystem functioning long have been recognized broadmeadow and nisbet 2004 feld et al 2011 melcher et al 2016 as are buffer strips that reduce the nutrient influx from agricultural areas peterjohn and correll 1984 krause et al 2008 collins et al 2012 however the potential of an intact vegetation continuum to attenuate in stream pollution in rivers have not yet been examined in detail fig 1 the relatively few studies addressing this question in semi arid regions have shown in stream attenuation of inputs from urban and industrial wwtps e g aristi et al 2015 acuña et al 2015 colin et al 2016 or after experimental nutrient additions e g sabater et al 2000 bernal et al 2015 sabater et al 2000 reported that removal of riparian vegetation affects in stream nutrient retention which supports other studies that have shown experimentally the ability of several plant species e g phragmithes australis typha latifolia to purify pollutant mixtures kumari and tripathi 2015 nonetheless chemicals also can be toxic to many organisms including plants and affect their growth abundance and diversity e g barbour et al 1999 colin et al 2016 moreover the structure of riparian areas differs depending on geography and human activities and their benefits can be plant specific e g pozo et al 1997 therefore more comprehensive studies assessing the potential of riparian vegetation to attenuate pollution than these spatially limited studies are necessary before one can develop appropriate mitigation strategies for dealing with riverine water pollution in semi arid regions here we use data from extensive fish surveys in rivers in northeastern spain n 530 sampling sites 15 catchments to explore the effects of riparian vegetation and pollution on freshwater fish assemblages freshwater fish are very important resources for humans and are among the most at risk biotic groups on earth closs et al 2015 previous studies in northeastern spain have shown that individuals body condition and size and the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages are affected by water pollution and by physical habitat degradation e g murphy et al 2013 maceda veiga et al 2016 colin et al 2017 2018 therefore our study system has the potential to explore how the effects of water pollution on fish might depend on the status of riparian vegetation which has not yet been explored moreover the ecological characteristics of fish assemblages in northeastern spain e g foraging migratory and invasive behaviours are similar to many fish assemblages around the world closs et al 2015 which potentially makes our inferences generalizable beyond our study system by using multimodel inference we explored the additive and interactive effects of in stream water pollution and riparian vegetation on fish we used multiple fish attributes that are common in environmental monitoring that use fish as bioindicators aarts and nienhuis 2003 fausch et al 1990 murphy et al 2013 including individual traits e g body condition and size and guild categorizations e g native status migratory and foraging behaviors table 1 perturbations such as pollution may impair fish growth and condition before their effects become apparent in populations or communities underwood 1989 if riparian or water pollution effects differ among fish guilds we expected greater effects on sedentary benthic species because sedentary and benthic species probably experience local conditions more fully than do migratory species negative effects should be most intense on fish species at the apices of food webs because perturbations propagate up food webs leading to differentially greater declines in top predators paine 1966 o connor et al 2013 if alien fish species are indicators of poor environmental conditions which is often assumed in river health assessments but see kennard et al 2005 the adverse effects of poor water and riparian quality should be greater for native than for alien fish last our work expands the limited analysis of the interactive effects among perturbations on freshwater ecosystems e g jackson et al 2016 maceda veiga et al 2017 kath et al 2018 by exploring whether there is a need to consider interactions between riparian vegetation and water pollution in rivers under water scarcity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we collected fish riparian and environmental data in 530 sampling sites in 15 catchments from 2002 to 2009 within a framework of several projects to assess the ecological status of rivers in north eastern spain in compliance with the european water framework directive eu directive 2000 60 ec the study area was the entire river ebro basin part of the garonne basin and all catalonian catchments draining to the mediterranean sea fig 2 these catchments have a mediterranean hydrological regime with high chances of floods in autumn and of droughts in summer while most parts of these catchments travel through semi arid regions natural resource managers identified five river typologies low and high mountain rivers moist mountain rivers littoral intermittent rivers and lowland permanent rivers based on changes in elevation evapotranspiration precipitation and river slope e g sostoa et al 2003 the study sites represented the diverse orography of the region elevation ranges from 0 to 1814 m a s l all geological types although most rivers were calcareous and the range of fish assemblages riparian structures and water quality conditions if sampling sites were close to a human settlement we surveyed from 300 to 1000 m downstream of the settlements depending on site accessibility the distance between sampling sites was 1 km the vegetation of riparian areas consisted of relatively intact native deciduous forests e g alnus glutinosa and mediterranean oak forests e g quercus ilex crops e g zea mays triticum spp medicago sativa weedy areas e g rubus ulmifolius and plantations including widely distributed alien plant species e g arundo donax eucalyptus globulus robinia pseudoacacia nentwig et al 2017 as for many countries in southern europe e p a 2013 the majority of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in this region have no tertiary treatment h salvadó personal communication and water scarcity leads wwtp effluents to be up to 90 of river flow particularly for streams in summer droughts and with high human water demand e g prat and munné 2000 mandaric et al 2018 moreover there are sparse illegal pollution spills and rivers drain intensive farming and agriculture areas especially in eu nitrate vulnerable zones which are 45 of all catalonian municipalities aca 2017 we surveyed in low flow conditions because this is when fish populations are most stable and can be sampled best by using electrofishing see below low flow conditions also are the most intense stressful conditions and consequently we could better identify associations among fish water quality and riparian vegetation 2 2 fish surveys fish were captured using an international standardized fish sampling method cen standards en 14962 and en 14011 for the whole wetted area of at least 100 m long reach at each sampling site in low flow conditions in an upstream direction e g maceda veiga et al 2017 colin et al 2018 we used single pass electrofishing with a portable unit that generated up to 200 v and 3 a pulsed dc which detects 80 100 of the fish species and captures 60 90 of the individuals compared to four pass electrofishing a s unpublished data the studied rivers exemplified the small and medium size streams typical of mediterranean climate regions sabater et al 2009 the survey of large rivers e g main ebro river channel would have required the use of fishing boats and so fish data would not have been comparable among sampling sites we used the same equipment at all sites to avoid potential bias in captures and we expressed data as captures per unit of effort cpue individuals caught divided by fishing time in minutes and the area surveyed in m2 fish surveys were authorized by the spanish government and the autonomous government of catalonia ap 003 fish were anaesthetized in a buffered ms222 solution 0 02 tricaine methane sulfonate sigma in buckets provided with air pumps to limit stress as directed by the university of barcelona ethical committee c e e a 510 14 all fish were allowed to recover in river water after measurements were made identified to species level and released at the site of capture data were counts of the total number of individuals by species and lengths mm and weights g of a random set of individuals from each species 40 if possible we used fish mass m i and length l i to calculate the scaled mass index smi m i l o l i b sma sensu peig and green 2009 l o is the mean of l i of each fish species and b sma is the scaling exponent obtained from a type ii linear regression between m i and l i the smi is an index of body condition which is widely used for animals including fish e g maceda veiga et al 2016a colin et al 2016 and smi is regarded as a correlate of fitness measures peig and green 2009 we assigned each fish species to four guild classifications see maceda veiga et al 2017 for a full list of species using fish atlases and descriptions of the biology and ecology of species doadrio 2011 colin et al 2016 the native status of fish was defined as a native if regional faunal lists indicate that the species historically occurred in the basin where captured or b alien if it indicates that the fish species was not historically present in the basin of capture or elsewhere in the iberian peninsula the trophic guild of each fish species was defined as a omnivorous or b invertivorous which occasionally prey upon small vertebrates based on adults diet the migratory behaviour guild included sedentary or migratory in our study area only the european eel anguilla anguilla moves between marine and freshwater water bodies while the other migratory species e g salmo trutta parachondrostoma miegii luciobarbus graellsii typically undertake within river upstream migrations for breeding last the swimming guild was benthic or pelagic swimmers 2 3 riparian vegetation the status of riparian vegetation and connectivity to adjacent woodlands was evaluated using four measures from established protocols e g the index of riparian quality qbr and the protocol hidri munné et al 2003 total marginal cover ranked the surface of the riparian area covered by riparian trees from 10 to 80 weighted by the amount of discontinuity between the riparian area and adjacent woodland from 25 to 100 of connectivity with the overall score being on a 0 25 scale see appendix s1 for a full description the riparian vegetation structure was assessed on a 0 25 scale considering the percentage of trees from 0 to 75 of riparian trees and shrubs from 10 to 25 of shrubs in the riparian area and its continuity along the river weighted by the presence of planted trees emergent aquatic plants e g t latifolia p australis and the amount of brushwood e g 50 of emergent aquatic plants linear plantations with 50 of brushwood cover see appendix s1 for a full description another measure of riparian complexity was the total number of biomass dominant riparian species alongside each sampling site last we used these plant inventories to classify communities as mediterranean oak forest pine plantations native riparian trees monocultures of the large herb arundo donax and other alien tree species e g robinia pseudoacacia ailanthus altissima using the methods outlined in the regional biodiversity atlas banc de dades de biodiversitat de catalunya font et al 2018 2 4 water quality and other predictors each sampling site was characterized by using eight water quality variables and six environmental descriptors to account for potential confounding factors in establishing associations among water quality riparian structure and fish assemblages water quality was analyzed prior to the conduct of the fish surveys the colorimetric test kit visocolor quantified general water hardness and the concentrations of ammonium detection limit dl 0 2 mg l nitrite dl 0 02 mg l nitrate dl 1 mg l and phosphate p dl 0 2 mg l while a digital multiparametric ysi probe measured temperature ºc conductivity μs cm and ph we did not have access to an oxygen probe during the fish surveys all of these variables were chosen to detect major water quality issues in rivers caused directly by the release of sewage effluents or from catchment run off from agricultural areas or indirectly by alterations in biogeochemical cycles and water ionic composition from pollutants that were not measured e g industrial waste in colin et al 2016 therefore nutrient concentrations and conductivity were regarded as tracers of general water pollution including that caused by potash mines e g fernandez turiel et al 2003 kaushal et al 2018 clean waters in this region have conductivity values 600 μs cm phosphate levels 0 05 mg l and ammonium and nitrite concentrations 0 015 mg l sánchez montoya et al 2018 elevation was used as a surrogate for the position of the sampling site in the river and to represent natural spatial factors affecting aquatic organisms e g maceda veiga et al 2016 elevation was highly correlated with the minimum and maximum annual air temperature spearman s ρ 0 8 and with the distance to the river mouth spearman s ρ 0 70 n 325 sampling sites maceda veiga 2013 changes in elevation affect the amount of solar radiation precipitation and topography all of which determine the altitudinal zonation of vegetation daubenmire 1943 font et al 2018 and so elevation was preferred for the analyses we calculated the strahler stream order number as a measure of river size strahler 1964 which was derived from a 1 50 000 map rivers were ranked from small first order tributaries to the largest main river based on a hierarchy of tributaries strahler stream order number is proportional to relative watershed dimensions channel width slope and stream discharge at that place in the system strahler 1964 there were no gauging stations near most of our sampling sites and so we did not have a direct measure of river flow the use of alternative methods to quantify flow such as the addition of nacl and measuring changes in river conductivity over time elosegi et al 2009 was infeasible due to the amount of salt necessary the extensive area sampled often in remote areas and the high natural conductivity of some sampling sites therefore we used three proxies for river flow we used an integrated measure of river hydromorphological integrity e g presence of weirs channels and walls to quantify the degree of naturalness of the river channel which modulates river water flow on a scale from 0 bad to 10 good conservation status appendix s1 we measured the water velocity and the depth of the river at three points evenly distributed across the river and at each 20 m band upstream to the end of the surveyed reach last we ranked habitat diversity e g presence of riffles pools refugees from 0 to 10 following the methods in the u s rapid bioassessment protocol barbour et al 1999 this is a measure of habitat quality which also indirectly measures river flow if headwaters have a high percentage of riffles and these are rare under water scarcity 2 5 data analyses analyses were conducted in r r core team 2016 using the packages and functions outlined below there were six response variables 1 species richness 2 shannon species diversity 3 presence 4 abundance of fish at sites where they occurred 5 the mean of individual body length and 6 body condition to characterize fish populations in each sampling site abundance data were very skewed and so we distinguished between fish presence 3 and abundance at sites where fish occurred 4 because the statistical fits of presence and abundance where present models were better than abundance based models for all data spatial gradients of variation in environmental predictors were used in models instead of classifying sampling sites as pristine and perturbed because gradient analyses are more realistic and objectively defined representations of natural systems friberg et al 2011 moreover the actual toxicities of conductivity many nutrients and ph largely are unknown for fish species in northeastern spain therefore a pristine vs perturbed dichotomy would be arbitrary especially if upstream and downstream fish species are expected to have different tolerances to the same water quality variables see maceda veiga et al 2017 nonetheless nutrient concentrations were aggregated based on the most probable toxic severity camargo and alonso 2006 such as ammonium and nitrite tn and nitrate and phosphate p np with the latter being the less toxic at low concentrations 2 5 1 pair wise correlations and data transformation visual inspection of the distribution of all predictors showed that continuous variables were right skewed and so these were log transformed pair wise correlations among all predictors were examined using spearman s ρ total riparian cover and general water hardness were the only variables strongly correlated with riparian vegetation structure and ph respectively all spearman s ρ 0 85 we omitted total riparian cover and general water hardness because there were better model fits r 2 than when their peers were included such selection was assessed further by looking at variation inflation factors vif to explore collinearity and the retained predictors appendix s2 was the only set in which collinearity was of little statistical concern vifs 2 zuur et al 2010 all the retained predictors were standardized 0 mean unit variance to have all predictors on a common scale i e each variable is expressed in units of its standard deviation we grouped predictors as 1 water quality descriptors wq 2 riparian descriptors veg and 3 covariates general river descriptors env for brevity table 1 however all variables within each set were included individually in models 2 5 2 overview of modelling techniques we used generalized linear mixed models glmms and hierarchical partitioning hp as two complementary approaches to establish associations between water quality riparian vegetation and fish attributes while accounting for the confounding effects of covariates predictors are always correlated even when the most highly correlated are excluded appendix s2 which can bias regression estimates of glmms mac nally 2000 glmms can include random effects so we included basin and year as random intercepts we collectively refer to these as ρ to account for potential systematic differences arising from these factors while hp cannot accommodate random effects or include categorical variables e g basin the method is one of the best ways to identify independent explained variance among correlated predictors mac nally 2000 and so is complementary way to makes inferences alongside glmms the support for the hypothesis that fish might benefit from riparian areas in northeastern spain including pollution attenuation was determined by assessing the effect size of water and riparian quality variables identified as important by both glmm and hp models to explain variation in the nine fish guilds 2 5 2 1 generalized linear mixed models a series of glmms m1 to m5 was built using the function glmer in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 to identify the predictors that best represented the variation in the nine fish guilds table 3 we used bernoulli errors logit link function for presence absence data poisson errors log link function for abundance and richness and gaussian errors log link for fish length and fish body condition smi an akaike information criterion aic approach was used to assess whether increasing the number of predictors in base model m1 which included just random effects and covariates markedly improved model fit we selected the best models for explaining variation in the fish responses based on the lowest aic value i e 2 aic units less than any other candidate model and the associated change in fit among equally plausible model overall fit for the best models needs to be assessed mac nally et al 2018 so we used the function auc area under curve auc in the proc package robin et al 2011 for bernoulli models and for other error distributions we used the function r squaredglmm r 2 in the mumin package barton 2011 if riparian vegetation riparian vegetation structure and richness of biomass dominant tree species had no discernible effect on the fish responses then models m1 and m2 should be superior to m3 m4 and m5 which included the additive m3 and m4 and interactive effects of riparian vegetation m5 if water quality is a major environmental concern in the studied rivers and vegetation has limited additional explanatory power then the best model should be m2 if geographical factors physical habitat and instream hydraulics were the most important predictors to explain variation in fish responses then the best model should be m1 if riparian vegetation were identified as important variable for accounting variation in fish attributes then we asked do any of the most common vegetation types in northeastern spain mediterranean oak forest pine plantations native riparian trees a donax and other alien tree species explain much additional variation to models with additive or interactive effects of water quality and riparian vegetation descriptors plant species provide rivers with different quality and quantity of litter pozo et al 1997 naiman et al 1998 and may affect riverine conditions differently depending on the plants physiologies for example river water flow is altered by evapotranspiration which differs among plant species nagler et al 2005 if the type of riparian vegetation had no substantial effect on fish then the model including riparian vegetation structure and richness of biomass dominant tree species would be the best one the function anova was used to assess the significance of the predictors included in the best models χ 2 p 0 05 models were validated by inspecting diagnostic plots of model residuals following zuur et al 2010 we tested for spatial autocorrelation using the moran index in the package spdep bivand et al 2012 and found that it was not likely to be an analytical problem moran values ranging from 0 05 to 0 09 p 0 2 2 5 2 2 hierarchical partitioning analyses of variance the relative importance of the predictors selected by the aic approach in explaining variation in fish attributes significant at p 0 05 was evaluated further by using hierarchical partitioning hp function hier part walsh et al 2003 hp partitions the independent contributions of each predictor to variation in the response variable and distinguishes these from the joint contribution with other predictors i e collinearity the function rand hp was used to test the significance of hp models using a randomization test for hierarchical partitioning analysis based on the upper 95 confidence limit 2 5 2 3 the importance of river typologies although all of our models accounted for the potentially confounding effect of natural geographical and hydrological factors we specifically compared the performance of the best models including riparian vegetation with those including river typology as another potentially more specific covariate low and high mountain rivers moist mountain rivers littoral intermittent streams and lowland permanent rivers see study area using a subset of our data set for which we had this information n 325 sampling sites similarly we rebuilt all models for a subset of our data set with just the smaller streams strahler stream order 4 to explore whether the effects of riparian vegetation might be greater for them the statistical assessment processes was the same stated above 3 results we caught 34 fish species including representatives of all native status 47 native and 53 alien trophic guilds 65 omnivores and 35 invertivores swimming behaviours 53 benthic and 47 pelagic and migratory guilds 92 sedentary and 8 migratory fish were caught in all four vegetation types mediterranean oak forests deciduous native trees pine plantations a donax and other alien tree species in different water quality conditions and in all river typologies in terms of size and elevation table 1 the most frequently captured fish species 140 sampling sites were the native cyprinids b haasi and l graellsii and the native salmonid s trutta 3 1 had riparian vegetation or water quality discernible effects on fish guilds twenty nine 54 out of the 54 best generalized linear mixed models glmms included water quality variables as important factors for predicting fish responses and fitted the data relatively well given the number of sites r 2 0 22 0 75 auc 0 66 0 78 table 3 appendix s3 alongside water quality variables four 7 of the 54 best models included riparian vegetation for predicting the fish responses and fitted the data reasonably well r 2 0 41 0 49 table 3 there were additive effects between water quality and riparian variables for the presence of

morphological variables as important factors for predicting fish responses especially for the alien and invertivorous guilds table 3 when only additive effects were considered all fish guilds were negatively associated with the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite and positively related to ph except for pelagic fish for which there was no clear association fig 3 although conductivity had an overall negative association with all fish the effects differed among guilds while the association was positive for sedentary benthic omnivorous and alien fish it was negative for migratory pelagic invertivorous and native fish fig 3 similarly the concentration of phosphate and nitrate had an overall negative association with all fish but the association was positive for sedentary fish negative for omnivorous and native fish and neutral for others fig 3 3 2 associations between riparian vegetation and fish guilds using glmms riparian vegetation was identified as an important factor for explaining variation in native fish richness alien fish richness the probability of occurrence of pelagic fish and the mean length of sedentary fish appendix s4 fig 3 there was a negative association between riparian structure and alien fish richness table 3 the richness of biomass dominant riparian species also was negatively associated with the mean length of sedentary fish but positively related to the presence of pelagic fish table 3 the effects of riparian vegetation on the fish were modulated by water quality the relationship between native fish richness and the concentrations of ammonia and nitrite went from negative to positive with increasing riparian vegetation structure or riparian richness fig 4 however the positive association between mean length of sedentary fish and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite or those of phosphate and nitrate switched to negative with increasing riparian richness fig 4 last the negative association between riparian vegetation structure and alien fish richness was attenuated by larger values of water conductivity fig 4 none of these four models was improved by including the five most frequent vegetation types table 4 regardless of the vegetation type riparian vegetation structure or richness of biomass dominant tree species were the most influential riparian variables of fish responses table 4 results from glmms mostly were consistent with those from hp calculations table 5 the exceptions were 1 ph was important in the glmm for alien fish richness but not in the hp model 2 the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were significant for the mean body length of pelagic fish in glmms but not in hp analyses and 3 the index of river morphology was important in glmms but not for hp for the presence of pelagic fish table 5 overall the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite explained variation in native fish richness alongside physical habitat diversity and strahler stream order physical habitat diversity and conductivity contributed to the probability of pelagic fish occurrence variation in alien fish richness mostly was explained by elevation and strahler stream order last the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite and richness of biomass dominant tree species mostly was associated with changes in mean length of sedentary fish table 5 3 3 did river typologies markedly influence our outcomes the inclusion of river typology as a predictor in the best glmms for the fish responses which included riparian vegetation variables increased aic values i e poorer fits and did not improve significantly model predictions appendix s5 therefore environmental covariates other than river typology were more influential in explaining associations between fish responses and riparian vegetation when all models were recalculated for the subset of strahler stream orders 4 appendix s6 the explanatory power generally declined compared to results for the full data set appendix s7and s8 there were inconsistences in only six of the 54 models the model for the presence of migratory fish was the only one that included riparian vegetation m3 that had not done so previously however model fit was worse than when the best model was m2 appendix s7 4 discussion our extensive fish data set including widely distributed ecological guilds is a first in exploring the additive and interactive effects of riparian vegetation and water quality on riverine fish over large scale environmental gradients we found broad support for additive effects between water conductivity and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite on several fish guilds in a semi arid region there was less evidence for the additive or interactive effects between these factors and riparian vegetation on fish and there was little evidence that the type of riparian community affected associations only riparian vegetation structure or the richness of biomass dominant species might influence how water pollution affects fish in particular total native and alien fish richness the presence of pelagic fish and the mean length of sedentary fish 4 1 weak associations of fish with riparian vegetation compared to water quality impacts while riparian vegetation appeared to provide fish with many benefits broadmeadow and nisbet 2004 feld et al 2011 melcher et al 2016 only 7 of the 54 models we built included riparian vegetation as an important factor table 3 given that much of the variance in our models remained unexplained generally r 2 0 56 appendix s9 the limited effect of riparian vegetation might be due to rivers being highly dynamic or high fish mobility aquatic assemblages may be more affected by regional scale processes than by local conditions holt 2002 heino et al 2015 however regional conditions may not be so important for most fish guilds because 54 of our models found associations between local water quality and fish attributes after accounting for potential effects of spatial confounding factors moreover the majority of the studied species move short distances even though their exact home ranges are unknown de sostoa et al 1990 for example barbus haasi one of the most frequently captured native species moves 100 m in a year and most individuals remain close to pools aparicio and de sostoa 1999 this fish behaviour probably is common in small mediterranean rivers which we surveyed appendix s8 to allow many fish species to deal with seasonal drought when models included both riparian vegetation and water quality variables ammonium nitrite and high water conductivity jointly made a larger independent contribution to variation in fish guilds than did riparian vegetation these outcomes suggest that riparian vegetation may have not mitigated pollution effects sufficiently fig 1 even though the longitudinal attenuation of pollution had been reported in some of the studied rivers e g aristi et al 2015 bernal et al 2015 colin et al 2016 riparian vegetation reduces nutrient influx from surrounding agricultural areas peterjohn and correll 1984 collins et al 2012 directive 91 271 eec but only one municipality vic was within eu s designated nitrate vulnerable zone due to intensive farming directive 91 676 eec therefore we are confident that our high conductivity ammonium and nitrite values mostly are attributed to multiple inputs from wwtps and possibly from illegal spills peaks in ammonium and nitrite concentrations should not have been detected if the compulsory secondary treatment had been applied to wastewater directive 91 271 eec previous studies have shown that other compounds including those that are biologically recalcitrant e g metals chlorides pesticides pharmaceuticals are present in the studied rivers at harmful concentrations due to the lack of advanced wwtp e g muñoz et al 2009 colin et al 2016 despite this water quality ammonium nitrite and conductivity levels was much improved 1 5 km downstream of the discharge site of an industry in a stream travelling through an open oak forest with pines colin et al 2016 however toxicants may have been stored in other ecosystem compartments e g sediment hyporheic habitat monroy et al 2014 sánchez morales et al 2018 therefore improving wwtps probably is the most appropriate action especially if long reaches of rivers in the study area that were fishless a decade ago now have fish populations given better functioning wwtps even in poorly vegetated reaches e g vinyoles et al 2007 colin et al 2016 the limited effects of riparian vegetation on fish experiencing pollution might be due to several mechanisms fig 1 pollution including high nutrient loads homogenizes the composition and much reduces the abundance of benthic communities mason 1996 which are food for fish however we found that riparian vegetation promoted total fish richness possibly because reduced benthic food availability may have been offset by in falling terrestrial foods e g arthropods from riparian vegetation see nakano et al 1999 whose diversity and total abundance is positively associated with riparian plant richness e g greenwood et al 2004 maceda veiga et al 2016b the availability of such terrestrial inputs may explain the positive association between riparian richness and the occurrence of pelagic fish e g s trutta which often feed on terrestrially derived insects nakano et al 1999 litter and roots of riparian plants increase habitat complexity which can promote fish richness by reducing prey consumer interactions sievers et al 2017 higher riparian tree species richness in the riparian communities affected the association between the mean length of sedentary fish and nutrient concentrations from positive to negative suggesting that nutrients probably were pollutants rather than subsidies wagenhoff et al 2011 another possible explanation for reduced fish size is that high riparian richness i e five tree species may reflect altered riparian condition in our study area well developed native riparian forests typically have fewer than five tree species e g a dense gallery of alnus glutinosa sabater et al 2000 even though our study did not include specific indicators of riparian forest health such as tree age and the presence of seedlings or snags ward and worthley 2003 if riparian condition were poor for fish we should not have found high richness of native and alien fish at the greatest riparian richness although the inclusion of plant species identity into models might be expected to affect the fish riparian associations adding information on the five dominant vegetation types to the analyses did not much affect model fit it is possible that we would have obtained clearer inferences if we had been able to use the total distance rivers had travelled through vegetated riparian zones at the sampled locations identifying the individual contribution of predictors in correlative studies such as ours always is difficult due to the natural covariation of predictors e g alien fish often occur in degraded habitats e g maceda veiga et al 2017 however the use of modelling techniques that are designed to deal with collinearity such as hierarchical partitioning analyses helps to identify and rank individual effects mac nally 2000 there were broad ranges in water quality in streams from all strahler stream orders appendix s8 which should reduce potential confounding due to spatial location moreover we obtained similar inferences from models including the full data set to models for just strahler stream orders 4 appendix s7 4 2 identifying the most vulnerable fish guilds to changes in water and riparian quality the associations between water pollution and riparian vegetation differed among fish guilds and among metrics within each guild which highlights the value of multi species and multi metric assessments as recommended by the eu s water framework directive ec 2000 there were associations between multiple fish guilds and water quality variables but native fish and invertivorous species that often prey upon small vertebrates had greater negative associations with both high conductivity and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite fig 3 the first is consistent with a marked decline of native fish species in northeastern spain partly due to habitat degradation maceda veiga 2013 the second association supports the assertion that species at the apices of food chains are among the most affected by perturbations paine 1966 o connor et al 2013 high conductivity had discernible adverse effects on pelagic fish e g squalius laietanus salmo trutta but not on the expected benthic less mobile species e g b haasi b meridionalis these outcomes may be due to s trutta having a wider distribution in northeastern spain than s laietanus and with s trutta being more sensitive to water pollution than s laietanus maceda veiga and de sostoa 2011 however our findings from low flow conditions are consistent with colin et al 2017 who attributed the potential higher tolerance of the benthic b meridionalis to low water levels than the pelagic s laietanus when exposed to water pollution alien fish metrics were negatively associated with the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite but were positively associated with conductivity which probably is a better proxy for general chronic pollution e g potash mines industrial discharges fernandez turiel et al 2003 colin et al 2016a this could question the relevance of alien fish species in environmental monitoring especially if most eco toxicological studies on wild fish in europe have been conducted using alien cyprinid fishes such as common carp c carpio colin et al 2016b inferences from work on carp should be compared to those for more sensitive species including putatively more sensitive alien species to avoid bias in establishing safe thresholds for water quality however this would require a re assessment of fish tolerance to environmental degradation possibly by using biomarkers i e physiological indicators which have not yet been adopted in official monitoring programs colin et al 2016b 4 3 possible management strategies to improve water quality considering the highly toxicity of nitrite and ammonium at low concentrations especially at the high ph values we saw noga 2011 it is a priority to reduce nitrite and ammonium concentrations in northeastern spanish rivers wwtps should be relatively larger in semi arid regions compared with northern european countries in which higher river flows year round help to dilute effluents see also prat and munné 2000 another low cost treatment may be to direct effluents to travel through constructed wetlands which also would remove other pollutants hering et al 2013 garcía rodríguez et al 2014 riparian vegetation including trees shrubs and grass strips can retain up to 100 of total nitrogen and up to 70 of phosphorous and a minimum width of 30 m on either side of a stream has been suggested to mimic the effects of well preserved riparian forests feld et al 2011 this management strategy also applies to agricultural areas to reduce diffuse pollution krause et al 2008 collins et al 2012 however industrial effluents probably need more targeted treatments e g marcucci et al 2002 schoebert et al 2005 if high water conductivity itself is toxic to riparian trees busch and smith 1995 the establishment of safe thresholds for pollutants in nature is challenging especially when the toxicity of nutrients such as nitrates e g camargo and alonso 2006 smallbone et al 2016 and phosphates e g maceda veiga et al 2017 everall et al 2018 is not well known moreover chlorides which increase conductivity reduce the toxicity of nutrients such as nitrite to fish noga 2011 alongside water quality our study identified hydro morphological alterations e g dams channelization that were adverse to pelagic fish in addition to sluggish flow which also was negatively associated with native fish richness these results provide some support to the notion that the natural hydrology of rivers favours native fish closs et al 2015 and that water scarcity affects pelagic fish more than benthic species colin et al 2017 moreover the negative association we saw between alien fish richness and river water speed suggests that restoring the natural hydrological regime probably would help to control alien fish which typically originated in sluggish stagnant waters moyle and marchetti 2006 the conservation of native riparian areas may benefit from restoring river flow if hydrology and river geomorphology affect riparian vegetation structure naiman et al 1998 the concentration of water pollutants is reduced with higher river flow e g colin et al 2016a and riffles increase water oxygenation however fast flowing waters do need to alternate with zones of low stream velocities to increase the contact time between water roots and the substrate all of which attenuate pollution kadlec 1979 higgins et al 1993 nonetheless these interferences need a more comprehensive understanding of the processes involved in pollution attenuation e g photolysis sorption volatilization gurr and reinhard 2006 5 conclusions our study provided little evidence that the current condition of riparian zones in northeastern spain is sufficient to mitigate pollution effects on fish therefore the most appropriate course of action may be to improve wastewater treatments and to restore river natural flows to reduce nutrient and water conductivity toxic effects the development of healthy riparian forest can take a long time after land use change removal of dams and reductions in toxicants human assisted re vegetation may help but increasing water loss from evapotranspiration should be taken into account in this largely semi arid region more research into the ecological consequences of riparian management is needed to make
