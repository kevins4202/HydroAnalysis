24565,ecosystem fragmentation is one of the main threats to species persistence via habitat reduction and isolation which often lead to species extinctions a question that has long been of interest is the minimum habitat size that can sustain viable populations in fragmented landscape despite numerous empirical and theoretical efforts on this topic most studies fail to address this central question and our mechanistic understanding of and capacity to predict the effects and outcomes associated with fragmentation stressor is still illusive we develop an ordinary differential equation ode based framework that incorporates the effect of the patch area on the net population growth rate for a plant species in fragmented ecosystem via a general net growth function we investigate the minimum patch area needed to sustain a given plant species we use data from the amazonian herb heliconia acuminata to test our model furthermore we compare the performance ode model and a linear matrix model to predict the observed data we provide a general formula for a threshold value for the fragment area below which a plant population is not viable for heliconia acuminata our ode based model predicts a value for the minimum fragment area of 0 7 h a which reflects the observed data and is smaller than the value obtained using the matrix projection model our findings suggest that the heliconia s mortality rate responds more negatively to fragmentation furthermore we found that the ode based model can serve as an alternative to the linear demographic model keywords forest fragmentation ode models linear matrix models population dynamics amazonian herb minimum fragment size 1 introduction the rate of species extinction and ecosystems degradation is increasing worldwide due to increasing chronic anthropogenic disturbances and of human population growth forest fragmentation and associated habitat loss and isolation are important causes of known species extinctions and one of the main threats to species persistence andreazzi et al 2012 broadhurst et al 2008 bruna 2003 brudvig et al 2015 flaspohler et al 2010 gagnon et al 2011 jacquemyn et al 2012 kolb et al 2010 laurance et al 2011 tang et al 2011 vaughn et al 2014 zambrano and salguero gómez 2014 habitat patchiness including fragmentation has been an important concept in ecology for over 80 years for example early work on the importance of habitat heterogeneity by gause 1934 suggests that persistence of predator prey systems depends on the availability of separate refuges for prey also there is empirical evidence that reduction in habitat size has long lasting effect on population dynamics as well as community assembly and associated dynamics bruna 2003 gagnon et al 2011 kolb et al 2010 zambrano and salguero gómez 2014 bruna and kress 2002 fahrig 2017 matesanz et al 2017 rybicki et al 2020 lucas 2020 most of these studies used linear matrix models bolker et al 2009 caswell 2001 cushing 1998 morris and doak 2003 based on field data to project population dynamics response to habitat reduction quoting bruna 2003 matrix based demographic models have become increasingly common in ecology because of their application from life history evolution to conservation and there is a broad body of literature describing their construction interpretation assumptions and limitations linear matrix models can consider the dependence of the birth or death rate on the population density but studies including such dependence are not found often in the literature silva matos et al 1999 however several works demonstrate the existence of such density dependent processes as well as its role in determining plant population persistence in fragmented landscapes broadhurst et al 2008 jacquemyn et al 2012 bruna and kress 2002 jacquemyn et al 2003 pachepsky and levine 2011 lienert 2004 furthermore fragmentation studies that used these linear matrix models failed to predict the system responses beyond observed degree of fragmentation and often neglect the role of path isolation consequently predicting how fragmentation stressor impacts the plant population viability is still illusive andreazzi et al 2012 rybicki et al 2020 lucas 2020 didham et al 2012 mathematical modeling with data integration is an important tool to obtain insights to many aspects of ecosystem sustainability and management there exists a substantial body of theoretical studies focusing on modeling the spread of one population in fragmented ecosystems brudvig et al 2015 cantrell et al 2011 cantrell and cosner 2003 ferrari et al 2014 hastings et al 2004 musgrave and lutscher 2014 murray 2002 neubert and parker 2004 williamson 1989 these range from ordinary differential equations based models of meta populations in patches to network models to models based on reaction diffusion equations to structural equation models sem these theoretical models aid to understand the influence of forest fragmentation beyond the limits of observed fragmentation examples this is critical given that replicated cases of forest fragmentation are often scarce and in some cases experimentally manipulated laurance et al 2011 due to lack of study examples however most of these theoretical studies often do not provide practical answers to the key question of the minimum or optimal fragment size that is needed to protect the populations in fragmented ecosystem to further our mechanistic understanding of theoretical and practical conservation implications of forest fragmentation on species extinction it is critical to develop a modeling framework that addresses these issues we propose a model that uses the flexibility of existing theoretical models on fragmentation by the practical use of linear matrix models to illustrate how to investigate the minimum fragment size necessary to maintain viable population the model consists of a single ordinary differential equation ode and explicitly incorporates a density dependency on the net growth rate recruitment rate minus death rate of the species population the multiple mechanisms by which fragmentation affects the recruitment rate is a complex topic to disentangle it has been largely investigated by a couple of researchers see bruna 2003 brudvig et al 2015 jacquemyn et al 2012 lienert 2004 bruna et al 2004 cramer et al 2007 references there in but it remains elusive although it is critical to understand such mechanisms we do not address it in this paper instead we assume that plant growth is dependent on population density or biomass density and is modeled by a logistic type function this particular form was chosen because a logistic growth rate is one of the most common and simplest assumption in population models see allen 2007 furthermore we assume that population net growth rate is affected by the reduction of patch area through a general net growth function this assumption reflects the knowledge in the field that patch size affects some vital rates via edge effects how these interact to influence the asymptotic growth rate of a population is poorly understood for instance bruna and oli bruna and oli 2005 found at least one year where the asymptotic growth rate of the heliconia population was very similar in the fragmented patches and the continuous forest the model is used to broadly address the question what is the minimum patch area needed to sustain any plant population to provide a practical example we specifically use the model to determine the minimum patch size necessary to sustain the populations of heliconia acuminata heliconiaceae in a fragmented landscape this amazonian understory herb is about 30 50 cm tall with a maximum size of about 1 6 m and native to the south american countries namely brazil bolivia colombia french guiana guyana peru suriname and venezuela we parameterized our ode model by fitting the net population growth rate function using the data sets in bruna 2003 these data sets were collected in central amazonia in the scope of the brazil s biological dynamics of forest fragments project bdffp this project is one of the largest and longest experimental data collection endeavors to study the ecological impact of habitat fragmentation laurance et al 2011 the experimental sites consist of fragments of size 1 10 hectares and a continuous forest located in brazil the demography and population dynamics of heliconia acuminata in these patches has been previously studied bruna 2003 using a linear matrix model in this paper we first introduce in section 2 the mathematical model and its underlying assumptions we further describe the data sets and present the net population growth rate as well as death rate functions and their parameterization in section 3 in section 4 we characterize the dynamics of the model and the biological implications of the findings specifically we provide the formula to compute the area threshold and the specific value for the amazonia herb in the fragmented system although the goal of the work by bruna 2003 was not to predict short term changes in abundance we have used it to compare the result obtained from the matrix project model with the results of our ode model in section 5 we investigate the ability of the ode model to predict the observed population density of heliconia acuminata in the year 2000 in the amazonia system studied in bruna 2003 fig 1 shows the conceptual diagram summarizing the development of the model 2 mathematical model for fragmented ecosystem in this section we develop a mathematical model that will integrating experimental data from sites with distinct areas the model is then used to investigate how fragmentation affects the dynamics of heliconia acuminata population let b t represent the plant density or density of biomass express in number of plants per area or units of mass per area in a fragment of a given area and with carrying capacity k the temporal dynamics of the population density is modeled by the following ode with a logistic growth 1 d b d t β a b 1 b k r a μ a b 1 b k where β a r a μ a is the net growth rate of the population r a is the recruitment rate and μ a is the natural death rate of the population with model 1 we make the following assumption a 1 the net growth rate β a is assumed to depend on fragment size the specific form of the function β a and its fitting details are given in section 3 a 2 in bruna 2003 the size of the continuous forest was not specified in this paper we arbitrarily assume that a patch of 100 hectares behaves almost like a continuous forest a 3 it is reasonable to expect that there may be large variation in the carrying capacity of each site however due to lack of detailed data we assume that the carrying capacity of each site is the carrying capacity of the site with the largest area that is we assume that the carrying capacity is equal for all sites its value is taken to be the average of the observed value of the density for the continuous forest in the year 1999 given in bruna 2003 a 4 we assume that the patches are completely isolate that is there are no dispersal in or out of patches this is a critical aspect of this species biology as shown in bruna 2003 in particular the study shows that even though patches are not completely isolated the interactions between the species in the same patch are much stronger than those between different patches a 5 there are no seed bank that is there are no seeds that are stored in the soil that survives for the next life cycles this assumption is consistent with the fact that seeds of tropical plants move quickly into a seedling bank to escape intense pressure from seed predators and pathogens bruna 2002 a 6 there is no significant vital death correlation this means that the probability of dying is not strongly correlated with the reproduction rate so it can be assumed that the reproduction and death rates are independent of each other this assumption is reasonable for heliconia acuminata based on discussions in bruna and kress 2002 a 7 the death rate μ is assumed to depend on the area the particular form of the function μ a and the details of its parameterization is given in section 3 a 8 the growth of the population density is logistic 3 model parameterization 3 1 data description the data we use consists of three years of census data from 13 populations of the amazonian understory herb heliconia acuminata in fragments with three distinct areas at biological dynamics of forest fragment project located 80 km north of manaus brazil see bruna 2003 for details on methods and results the data was collected in four sites with area of 1 h a three sites with area of 10 h a and six sites in the continuous forest which in this paper we consider to have an area of 100 h a see appendix a 1 for each of the sites bruna 2003 provided the projected or asymptotic population growth rate values for 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 transition years these values are the dominant eigenvalue of each corresponding transition matrix we called them the projected λ values and denote them by λ p furthermore we denote by λ p i the different values of the projected λ values corresponding to the two transition years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 and fragments with three distinct areas the transition matrices corresponding to years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 are also given in bruna 2003 additionally bruna 2003 gave the values of the observed asymptotic population growth rate for each transition year 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 for each site with distinct areas these values were computed in bruna 2003 by dividing the observed plant density at year t by the observed plant density at year t 1 in this paper we call them observed λ and denote them by λ o i thus we have two sets of data points λ fragment area a data set consisting of projected values of λ denoted by λ p i a i and a data set consisting of observed λ denoted by λ o i a i the plant mortality rate for each fragment was computed from the survival probability in the transition matrices and is listed in appendix a 1 the values of the population density available correspond to the year 1999 the methodology for computing the values of the density in 1998 and 2000 at each site is given in appendix a 1 for each year 1998 1999 and 2000 we obtained two values of plant density the first set of values are derived from the projected λ p which we denote by b p i t i where i 1 2 3 corresponds to years t 1 1998 t 2 1999 and t 3 2000 the second set of values are derived from the observed λ o denoted by b o i t i a summary of the data used in this paper and a brief description on how it was adapted from the data published in bruna 2003 is presented in appendix a 1 next we estimate the parameters for the function β a in section 3 2 and μ a in section 3 3 to accomplish this task we use function cftoolin matlab 9 5 0 1049112 r2018b to fit the functions to the data just described λ p i t i and λ o i t i the best fit curve is assumed to be that which minimizes the sum of squared residuals since the functions are nonlinear we use the standard error of the regression to assess the goodness of fit 3 2 dependence of β on a β a to establish the function β a that will be parameterized with the data we assume that it satisfies the following properties i β a is a continuous and differentiable function on 0 ii when the area of the site is close to zero the growth rate approaches this models the fact that when the area of the patch is very small the biomass or population density decreases very fast iii when the area is very large the growth rate levels out at a certain value two possible functions that satisfy conditions i iii are given in eqs 2 and 3 2 β a ln λ a β f a a c a and 3 β a ln λ a ln c 1 a 1 c 2 a ln c 1 c 2 a 1 c 2 a note that the available data contains the values of λ however we need to estimate β the relation between λ and β is 4 β a ln λ a eq 4 explains why the logarithm appears on both equation 2 and 3 the parameter a c 0 in eq 2 is the critical value of the area for which the sign of the net growth rate changes from a negative value to a positive value we call this point the switching point this is the point at which the plant density switches from increasing to decreasing or vice versa and we will show this fact in section 4 next we proceed with the estimation of the parameters in the functions we divide the fitting into two cases in one case we use the values of the projected λ for the years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 across the plots of same size and the corresponding areas that is we use the data set λ p i a i in the other case we utilize the values of the observed λ for the years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 across the plots of same size and the corresponding areas this is the data set λ o i a i the values of the data sets are given in tables a 1 and a 2 appendix a 1 for each data set we parametrize both functions given in equations 2 and 3 there are two parameters to be estimated in each formula β f a c in eq 2 and c 1 c 2 in eq 3 for each data set and each of the functions we follow two approaches in one approach we fix one parameter and estimate the other in the other approach we estimate both parameters when fixing one parameter we choose to fix β f ln c 1 c 2 ln λ f because it can be estimated from the available data it is estimated by averaging over all values of the asymptotic growth rate λ of the continuous forest sites with area equal to 100 h a presented in appendix a 1 then compute the natural logarithm of the resulting value the values for the estimate of β f using the two data sets λ p i a i and λ o i a i are given in table a 1 appendix a 1 where they are denoted by β f p and β f o respectively in particular when performing the fitting with the data set λ p i a i and fixing one parameter we set 5 ln c 1 c 2 β f ln λ f 0 0214 then we estimate the parameter a c by parametrizing the function in eq 2 and estimate c 2 by fitting the function in eq 3 when using the data values λ o i a i we proceed similarly but equation 5 is replaced by 6 ln c 1 c 2 β f ln λ f 0 1066 the results of the both fittings are summarized in table 1 and in fig 2 results summary we found a significant correlation between fragment area and growth rate β thus validating our assumption a 1 the growth rate is dependent on the area a that is β β a furthermore when using the data points λ p i a i the fit standard error rmse is approximately the same either 0 021 or 0 022 across the four fittings see column 5 in table 1 similarly when using the data points λ o i a i it follows that the rmse across the four fittings is either 0 065 or 0 066 see column 7 in table 1 this result suggests that there is no significant difference in the goodness of fit associated to the fitting of the two distinct function forms given in eqs 2 and 3 this feature is also visible in fig 2 from table 1 column 6 we see that the value of β f estimated using matlab cftool is 0 1032 when the function in eq 2 is adopted and it is ln 28 39 25 60 0 1034 when the fitting is done with the function in eq 3 these values differ by less than 3 2 from the value estimated directly from the data λ o i a i which is β f 0 1066 see eq 6 on the other hand when the fitting is performed with the data set λ p i a i column 4 table 1 β f is estimated to be equal 0 01088 and ln 38 02 37 61 0 01084 when the fitting is based on the function 2 and 3 respectively however the value of β f estimated from the data λ p i a i is 0 0214 see eq 5 which is 50 higher than the values obtained by fitting with matlab cftool based on these results we select the function in eq 2 to model the dependence of β on the area of the fragment this function is fed into model 1 leading to two models one model parameterized by λ p i a i and the other parameterized by λ o i a i in both models a c is replaced by the corresponding value estimated via matlab cftool and given in table 1 similarly to the parameter β f is assigned the corresponding value estimated directly from the data and given in eqs 5 and 6 3 3 dependence of μ on a μ a observe that the fitting of the mortality function μ a is not necessary for parametrizing model 1 however we present the parameterization of μ a to estimate the minimum fragment area at which the plant mortality equals its natural mortality rate which is assumed to be the average mortality rate observed in the sites with area equal 100 h a continuous forest this quantity is important as it helps in understanding how fragmentation affects plant vital rates we assume that the function μ a satisfies the following properties i μ a is continuous and differentiable ii 0 μ 1 iii when the site area is close to zero the death rate approaches 1 this models the fact that when the area of the patch is very small the death rate is very high furthermore we assume that when the area is very large the mortality rate levels out at a certain value which is the natural death rate of the plant if there is no fragmentation in the system continuous forest one possible function that satisfies these conditions is 7 μ a 1 μ f exp d 1 a μ f where μ f is the natural plant mortality when the site is not fragmented continuous forest and d 1 is the system decay constant the value of μ f is the average of the mortality data values corresponding to sites with area equal to 100 h a which is the continuous forest those values are provided in appendix a 1 table a 4 and their average is μ f 0 0336 in the same table the values of μ for each plot with area of 1 h a 10 h a can be found eq 7 together with the data is used to estimate the parameter d 1 the parameterization is carried out as when fitting β a via matlab cftool and the results are given in table 2 as well as in fig 3 results summary the value of system s decay constant is estimated to be d 1 2 488 per year based on this value straightforward calculations show that the mortality rate in a fragment reaches the natural death rate when the area is equal or greater than 4 1 h a at a 4 1 h a the mortality in the site differ 0 1 from μ f 4 effect of fragment size on herb population density as discussed in section 3 2 we adopt the function in eq 2 to describe the relation between net growth rate β and area that is β a β f a a c a thus the model given in eq 1 reduces to 8 d b d t β a b 1 b k β f a a c a b 1 b k with β a r a μ a the equilibrium states of the system are obtained by solving the equation resulting from setting the right hand side of 8 equal to zero simple calculations shows that for fixed value of area a the solutions are 9 β a β f a a c a 0 b 0 b k the condition β a β f a a c a 0 holds true when a a c at this value of area β a r a μ a 0 that is the recruitment rate r and the dead rate μ are equal thus the initial density of biomass does not grow or decay the system will stabilize at the initial value of the plant density we next consider the case β a 0 and study the local stability of the equilibrium states b 0 and b k we first compute the jacobian matrix of the system which is given by 10 j a m β a 1 2 b k at equilibrium b 0 j a m β a β f a a c a since β f 0 it follows that j a m is positive if a a c and negative if a a c therefore b 0 is a locally asymptotical stable l a s equilibrium if a a c while it is unstable if condition a a c holds true when considering the equilibrium state b k the jacobian j a m β a and the equilibrium state b k is unstable if a a c and it is l a s if a a c the results can then be summarized in the following proposition proposition 1 consider the model of forest fragmentation given by 8 where the parameters have nonnegative values if a a c the plant density stabilizes at its initial value if a a c then the equilibrium b 0 is l a s while the equilibrium b k is unstable on the other hand if a a c then the equilibrium b 0 is unstable and the b k is l a s biological implications if the fragment size is below the switching point a c the population growth rate β a becomes negative indicating decreasing population size towards the equilibrium state b 0 which implies that the persistence of the herb heliconia acuminata is in jeopardy if the fragment size is above the critical value a c then heliconia acuminata population level stabilizes at the carrying capacity of the system k from the fitting we can see that the average value of the critical patch area a c is approximately 1 75 h a based on the projected data λ p i a i i and the fragment critical area a c is estimated to have an average value of approximately 0 655 when the observed data set is used to fit the function thus the switching point a c estimated with observed data λ o i a i is lower about 63 than the switching point estimated with the data λ p i a i therefore our model predictions based on the observed data indicate that the plant population has a higher resilience to fragmentation than the prediction based on the projected data recall that the values of λ p i in the project data λ p i a i are derived from the linear matrix model these results are illustrated in fig 4 when the fragment size is precisely equal to the threshold value population size that was initially in the patch does not change which indicates that the plant can persist in the system whenever the initial population size is different from zero the results summarized in proposition 1 are illustrated in fig 4 this figure depicts numerical simulations of the model 1 parameterized with the projected data set λ p i a i as well as numerical simulations of the model parameterized with the data λ o i a i 5 model predictability capabilities after parametrizing the model 1 with the two data sets projected data set λ p i a i and observed data λ o i a i we test their predictability against the experimental data consisting of plant population density b corresponding to years t 1 1998 t 2 1999 and t 3 2000 that is against the data set b o i t i given in appendix a 1 table a 2 for a patch of a given area the initial condition used to run the models the one parameterized by λ p i a i and the one parameterized by the observed data λ o i a i is the average value of the observed population density in year 1998 more precisely we used the initial value of 194 342 388 when the area was fixed at 1 h a 10 h a and 100 h a respectively the results are shown in fig 5 additionally fixing a patch area we investigate how well the model parameterized by the set λ o i a i performs to reproduced the average observed data comparatively to the matrix model used in bruna 2003 specifically we compare the temporal pattern obtained with the model parameterized with the observed data set λ o i a i with the observed and projected average plant population density the results are indicated in fig 6 6 discussion of results our results are obtained with a model parameterized with the best data set available the collection of data is in the scope of the brazil s biological dynamics of forest fragments project bdffp this project is one of the largest and longest experimental work to study the ecological impact of habitat fragmentation laurance et al 2011 it constitutes an incredible effort in the field but there is only three patch sizes in the data and three time instances 1998 1999 and 2000 this information is far from ideal to parametrize the model in addition to being small the data sets exhibit high variability and missing values consequently several approximations were made for example there were missing values of projected and observed asymptotic growth rate λ for transitions years 1998 1999 for 3 sites with area 100 h a so for these sites we assume that the density of heliconia acuminata in year 1998 was the same as in the year 1999 the model parameterization can be easily changed to accommodate distinct data sets not only concerning heliconia acuminata that may be produced in the future but also concerning other plant systems the results in fig 5 suggests that the model either parameterized by the projected data λ p i a i or parameterized by the observed data λ o i a i do not fit well the plant density observed in each individual site of fragments of same area this might be due to the constrains of the data sets mentioned above however when using the average observed plant density instead of the observed density in each individual site the model parameterized by the data set λ o i a i captures qualitatively the plant density temporal evolution pattern see fig 6 this occurs for all three distinct areas considered in contrast the matrix model predictions only capture the observed temporal evolution of the plant density in the continuous forest panel c nonetheless our ode model fits the observed data slightly better than the linear matrix model due to the fact that the data sets are small it is difficult to conduct robustness test by removing some of the data points and see whether one gets similar fitting results sensitivity analysis could be used to gain additional insight on how the model respond to uncertainty in the parameters this is part of future work 7 conclusions we explored the effect of fragmentation on plant population size in an ordinary differential equation ode based framework this model assume that the growth of the plant population size is of logistic type and that the net growth rate recruitment rate minus mortality rate is affected by the reduction of patch area through a general net growth function we use the model to investigate the minimum patch area needed to sustain any plant shrub system additionally we parametrize the model with a three years census data of heliconia acuminata in both forest fragments and continuous forest provided in the work by bruna 2003 we apply the resulting fitted model to determine the minimum fragment size necessary to sustain the heliconia acuminata density in a fragmented landscape for this specific data set we also test the hypothesis that the ode based model with the dependence of plant growth rate on the population density explicitly modeled fits the observed heliconia acuminata density better than the linear matrix demographic models that are common used in the field our theoretical analysis of the model indicates that the persistence of heliconia acuminate is possible when the area of the fragment is higher than a threshold a c the system switching point that is for values of the area greater to a c the net population growth rate is greater than zero which implies persistent plant population whose size will reach asymptotically the fragment carrying capacity if no disturbances occur the persistence of the plant is still possible if the forest fragment area is equal to a c but in this case the population stagnates at the initial value the switching point a c estimated with the proposed net growth rate function parameterized with the census data from amazonian heliconia acuminata is 0 655 1 h a this result is in agreement with the findings reported by bruna and kress 2002 concerning the same amazonian heliconia acuminata system which shows that among the three area patches studied 1 10 100 h a the herb in fragments of 1 h a is more vulnerable to fragmentation the switching point estimated with same function but parameterized with the data calculated using the asymptotical growth rate λ obtained from the matrix based model and presented in the work by bruna 2003 is 1 75 2 h a thus the predictions based on the census data indicate that the plant system is more resilient to fragmentation than the predictions based on the data recovered from the matrix based model the mortality decay constant estimated through the function parameterized with the data census reveals that the mortality rate of heliconia acuminata stabilizes at the value of the mortality rate observed in an ecosystem without fragmentation when the fragment size is greater or equal to 4 h a thus our study suggests that in the particular scenario of heliconia acuminata amazonian system the net growth rate is less sensitive to fragmentation than the mortality rate such phenomena was also reported for the same plant system bruna and kress 2002 it was reported that fragments of 10 h a of land suffered higher mortality than the continuous forest given our results we observed that the ode based model presented in this study can serve as an alternative to the linear demographic model since we have included in our ode model some assumptions about how the mortality and recruitment rates behave which are not included in the linear demographic model furthermore the ode model is able to fit the given data this is an interesting result suggesting the use of models that take in account the dependence of the plant population growth rates on population size when investigating the impact of fragmentation on plant species however further investigations are needed to verify if this findings are applied to other plant populations in fragmented systems the model in this paper is very simple it consists of an ordinary differential equation that represent average or mean field approximations of the true time and spatial scales of the object of study an alternative formulation could involve an age structured model and or including spatial component additionally those models could incorporate distinct processes in which fragmentation affects for example pollination seed dispersal the seed and seedling establishment however any attempt in this direction would require a multitude of parameters and necessarily data to validate it given the nature of the phenomena at hand these requirements may be very difficult to satisfy therefore the approach of using simpler models may have advantages over uses of agent based or computational models that are more realistic but providing very limited theoretical insights realistically we understand that we should consider multi patch and interactions between the patches however since this is an alternative approach to the use of linear demographic model it is important to understand the dynamics of a single isolated patch in the future we will consider a more realistic model with multi patches and their connectedness credit authorship contribution statement maria c a leite conceptualization methodology software investigation data curation writing original

corresponding to year 1999 as well as the fragment area are given in table 1 bruna 2003 the projected asymptotical growth rate λ corresponding to the transition years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 for each site is also provided in table 1 the details on the computation of these values are given also in bruna 2003 the values of observed λ are depicted in fig 5 in the same work the transition matrices describing the dynamics of the heliconia acuminata are provided in appendix b bruna 2003 a 1 1 values of the projected λ p i observed λ o i asymptotic growth rate and area a i of the fragment for each site the projected values of λ that is λ p i and area of each fragments site a i were read off table 1 bruna 2003 and is provided in table a 1 for completeness the resulting data set is denoted by λ p i a i the observed transition values of λ o i summarized in the table a 1 were read off fig 5 and the data set is denoted by λ o i the corresponding values of the growth rate β p i and β o i were computed using the relation β ln λ on the right hand side of table a 1 is listed the values of the projected and observed growth rates corresponding to the continuous forest these values are the average of the values of β p i and β o i for sites with area 100 ha and they are denoted by β f p and β f o respectively a 1 2 values of the population density of heliconia acuminata b p i projected and b o i observed in years 1998 1999 and 2000 for each site the density of the plant in the years 1998 1999 and 2000 were computed from the values of the density registered for year 1999 table 1 bruna 2003 and using the formula a 1 λ density of heliconia in year t 1 density of heliconia in year t for each area and each year we obtain two data sets projected density b p i t i and observed density b o i t i where the indices i 1 2 3 represent years 1998 1999 2000 respectively the former set is obtained by using the values λ p i in eq a 1 the values of b o i in latter set are computed using λ o i in the same equation for the sites with area 100 ha for which the values of projected and observed λ corresponding to the transition year 1998 1999 are not available in bruna 2003 we assumed that the population density in year 1998 is the same as in year 1999 the sets b p i t i and b o i t i are given in table a 2 in table a 3 we present the average values of heliconia density in sites with area 100 ha continuous forest and corresponding to year 1998 a 1 3 mortality rates the mortality rate for each fragment was computed using the survival probability calculated from the transition matrices describing the dynamics of heliconia acuminata provided in appendix b bruna and kress 2002 the values presented in table a 4 are the average of the mortality in years 1999 and 2000 the value of the natural death rate μ f in the continuous forest was computed by averaging over all values of the plant s mortality in all sites of area 100 h a 
24565,ecosystem fragmentation is one of the main threats to species persistence via habitat reduction and isolation which often lead to species extinctions a question that has long been of interest is the minimum habitat size that can sustain viable populations in fragmented landscape despite numerous empirical and theoretical efforts on this topic most studies fail to address this central question and our mechanistic understanding of and capacity to predict the effects and outcomes associated with fragmentation stressor is still illusive we develop an ordinary differential equation ode based framework that incorporates the effect of the patch area on the net population growth rate for a plant species in fragmented ecosystem via a general net growth function we investigate the minimum patch area needed to sustain a given plant species we use data from the amazonian herb heliconia acuminata to test our model furthermore we compare the performance ode model and a linear matrix model to predict the observed data we provide a general formula for a threshold value for the fragment area below which a plant population is not viable for heliconia acuminata our ode based model predicts a value for the minimum fragment area of 0 7 h a which reflects the observed data and is smaller than the value obtained using the matrix projection model our findings suggest that the heliconia s mortality rate responds more negatively to fragmentation furthermore we found that the ode based model can serve as an alternative to the linear demographic model keywords forest fragmentation ode models linear matrix models population dynamics amazonian herb minimum fragment size 1 introduction the rate of species extinction and ecosystems degradation is increasing worldwide due to increasing chronic anthropogenic disturbances and of human population growth forest fragmentation and associated habitat loss and isolation are important causes of known species extinctions and one of the main threats to species persistence andreazzi et al 2012 broadhurst et al 2008 bruna 2003 brudvig et al 2015 flaspohler et al 2010 gagnon et al 2011 jacquemyn et al 2012 kolb et al 2010 laurance et al 2011 tang et al 2011 vaughn et al 2014 zambrano and salguero gómez 2014 habitat patchiness including fragmentation has been an important concept in ecology for over 80 years for example early work on the importance of habitat heterogeneity by gause 1934 suggests that persistence of predator prey systems depends on the availability of separate refuges for prey also there is empirical evidence that reduction in habitat size has long lasting effect on population dynamics as well as community assembly and associated dynamics bruna 2003 gagnon et al 2011 kolb et al 2010 zambrano and salguero gómez 2014 bruna and kress 2002 fahrig 2017 matesanz et al 2017 rybicki et al 2020 lucas 2020 most of these studies used linear matrix models bolker et al 2009 caswell 2001 cushing 1998 morris and doak 2003 based on field data to project population dynamics response to habitat reduction quoting bruna 2003 matrix based demographic models have become increasingly common in ecology because of their application from life history evolution to conservation and there is a broad body of literature describing their construction interpretation assumptions and limitations linear matrix models can consider the dependence of the birth or death rate on the population density but studies including such dependence are not found often in the literature silva matos et al 1999 however several works demonstrate the existence of such density dependent processes as well as its role in determining plant population persistence in fragmented landscapes broadhurst et al 2008 jacquemyn et al 2012 bruna and kress 2002 jacquemyn et al 2003 pachepsky and levine 2011 lienert 2004 furthermore fragmentation studies that used these linear matrix models failed to predict the system responses beyond observed degree of fragmentation and often neglect the role of path isolation consequently predicting how fragmentation stressor impacts the plant population viability is still illusive andreazzi et al 2012 rybicki et al 2020 lucas 2020 didham et al 2012 mathematical modeling with data integration is an important tool to obtain insights to many aspects of ecosystem sustainability and management there exists a substantial body of theoretical studies focusing on modeling the spread of one population in fragmented ecosystems brudvig et al 2015 cantrell et al 2011 cantrell and cosner 2003 ferrari et al 2014 hastings et al 2004 musgrave and lutscher 2014 murray 2002 neubert and parker 2004 williamson 1989 these range from ordinary differential equations based models of meta populations in patches to network models to models based on reaction diffusion equations to structural equation models sem these theoretical models aid to understand the influence of forest fragmentation beyond the limits of observed fragmentation examples this is critical given that replicated cases of forest fragmentation are often scarce and in some cases experimentally manipulated laurance et al 2011 due to lack of study examples however most of these theoretical studies often do not provide practical answers to the key question of the minimum or optimal fragment size that is needed to protect the populations in fragmented ecosystem to further our mechanistic understanding of theoretical and practical conservation implications of forest fragmentation on species extinction it is critical to develop a modeling framework that addresses these issues we propose a model that uses the flexibility of existing theoretical models on fragmentation by the practical use of linear matrix models to illustrate how to investigate the minimum fragment size necessary to maintain viable population the model consists of a single ordinary differential equation ode and explicitly incorporates a density dependency on the net growth rate recruitment rate minus death rate of the species population the multiple mechanisms by which fragmentation affects the recruitment rate is a complex topic to disentangle it has been largely investigated by a couple of researchers see bruna 2003 brudvig et al 2015 jacquemyn et al 2012 lienert 2004 bruna et al 2004 cramer et al 2007 references there in but it remains elusive although it is critical to understand such mechanisms we do not address it in this paper instead we assume that plant growth is dependent on population density or biomass density and is modeled by a logistic type function this particular form was chosen because a logistic growth rate is one of the most common and simplest assumption in population models see allen 2007 furthermore we assume that population net growth rate is affected by the reduction of patch area through a general net growth function this assumption reflects the knowledge in the field that patch size affects some vital rates via edge effects how these interact to influence the asymptotic growth rate of a population is poorly understood for instance bruna and oli bruna and oli 2005 found at least one year where the asymptotic growth rate of the heliconia population was very similar in the fragmented patches and the continuous forest the model is used to broadly address the question what is the minimum patch area needed to sustain any plant population to provide a practical example we specifically use the model to determine the minimum patch size necessary to sustain the populations of heliconia acuminata heliconiaceae in a fragmented landscape this amazonian understory herb is about 30 50 cm tall with a maximum size of about 1 6 m and native to the south american countries namely brazil bolivia colombia french guiana guyana peru suriname and venezuela we parameterized our ode model by fitting the net population growth rate function using the data sets in bruna 2003 these data sets were collected in central amazonia in the scope of the brazil s biological dynamics of forest fragments project bdffp this project is one of the largest and longest experimental data collection endeavors to study the ecological impact of habitat fragmentation laurance et al 2011 the experimental sites consist of fragments of size 1 10 hectares and a continuous forest located in brazil the demography and population dynamics of heliconia acuminata in these patches has been previously studied bruna 2003 using a linear matrix model in this paper we first introduce in section 2 the mathematical model and its underlying assumptions we further describe the data sets and present the net population growth rate as well as death rate functions and their parameterization in section 3 in section 4 we characterize the dynamics of the model and the biological implications of the findings specifically we provide the formula to compute the area threshold and the specific value for the amazonia herb in the fragmented system although the goal of the work by bruna 2003 was not to predict short term changes in abundance we have used it to compare the result obtained from the matrix project model with the results of our ode model in section 5 we investigate the ability of the ode model to predict the observed population density of heliconia acuminata in the year 2000 in the amazonia system studied in bruna 2003 fig 1 shows the conceptual diagram summarizing the development of the model 2 mathematical model for fragmented ecosystem in this section we develop a mathematical model that will integrating experimental data from sites with distinct areas the model is then used to investigate how fragmentation affects the dynamics of heliconia acuminata population let b t represent the plant density or density of biomass express in number of plants per area or units of mass per area in a fragment of a given area and with carrying capacity k the temporal dynamics of the population density is modeled by the following ode with a logistic growth 1 d b d t β a b 1 b k r a μ a b 1 b k where β a r a μ a is the net growth rate of the population r a is the recruitment rate and μ a is the natural death rate of the population with model 1 we make the following assumption a 1 the net growth rate β a is assumed to depend on fragment size the specific form of the function β a and its fitting details are given in section 3 a 2 in bruna 2003 the size of the continuous forest was not specified in this paper we arbitrarily assume that a patch of 100 hectares behaves almost like a continuous forest a 3 it is reasonable to expect that there may be large variation in the carrying capacity of each site however due to lack of detailed data we assume that the carrying capacity of each site is the carrying capacity of the site with the largest area that is we assume that the carrying capacity is equal for all sites its value is taken to be the average of the observed value of the density for the continuous forest in the year 1999 given in bruna 2003 a 4 we assume that the patches are completely isolate that is there are no dispersal in or out of patches this is a critical aspect of this species biology as shown in bruna 2003 in particular the study shows that even though patches are not completely isolated the interactions between the species in the same patch are much stronger than those between different patches a 5 there are no seed bank that is there are no seeds that are stored in the soil that survives for the next life cycles this assumption is consistent with the fact that seeds of tropical plants move quickly into a seedling bank to escape intense pressure from seed predators and pathogens bruna 2002 a 6 there is no significant vital death correlation this means that the probability of dying is not strongly correlated with the reproduction rate so it can be assumed that the reproduction and death rates are independent of each other this assumption is reasonable for heliconia acuminata based on discussions in bruna and kress 2002 a 7 the death rate μ is assumed to depend on the area the particular form of the function μ a and the details of its parameterization is given in section 3 a 8 the growth of the population density is logistic 3 model parameterization 3 1 data description the data we use consists of three years of census data from 13 populations of the amazonian understory herb heliconia acuminata in fragments with three distinct areas at biological dynamics of forest fragment project located 80 km north of manaus brazil see bruna 2003 for details on methods and results the data was collected in four sites with area of 1 h a three sites with area of 10 h a and six sites in the continuous forest which in this paper we consider to have an area of 100 h a see appendix a 1 for each of the sites bruna 2003 provided the projected or asymptotic population growth rate values for 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 transition years these values are the dominant eigenvalue of each corresponding transition matrix we called them the projected λ values and denote them by λ p furthermore we denote by λ p i the different values of the projected λ values corresponding to the two transition years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 and fragments with three distinct areas the transition matrices corresponding to years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 are also given in bruna 2003 additionally bruna 2003 gave the values of the observed asymptotic population growth rate for each transition year 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 for each site with distinct areas these values were computed in bruna 2003 by dividing the observed plant density at year t by the observed plant density at year t 1 in this paper we call them observed λ and denote them by λ o i thus we have two sets of data points λ fragment area a data set consisting of projected values of λ denoted by λ p i a i and a data set consisting of observed λ denoted by λ o i a i the plant mortality rate for each fragment was computed from the survival probability in the transition matrices and is listed in appendix a 1 the values of the population density available correspond to the year 1999 the methodology for computing the values of the density in 1998 and 2000 at each site is given in appendix a 1 for each year 1998 1999 and 2000 we obtained two values of plant density the first set of values are derived from the projected λ p which we denote by b p i t i where i 1 2 3 corresponds to years t 1 1998 t 2 1999 and t 3 2000 the second set of values are derived from the observed λ o denoted by b o i t i a summary of the data used in this paper and a brief description on how it was adapted from the data published in bruna 2003 is presented in appendix a 1 next we estimate the parameters for the function β a in section 3 2 and μ a in section 3 3 to accomplish this task we use function cftoolin matlab 9 5 0 1049112 r2018b to fit the functions to the data just described λ p i t i and λ o i t i the best fit curve is assumed to be that which minimizes the sum of squared residuals since the functions are nonlinear we use the standard error of the regression to assess the goodness of fit 3 2 dependence of β on a β a to establish the function β a that will be parameterized with the data we assume that it satisfies the following properties i β a is a continuous and differentiable function on 0 ii when the area of the site is close to zero the growth rate approaches this models the fact that when the area of the patch is very small the biomass or population density decreases very fast iii when the area is very large the growth rate levels out at a certain value two possible functions that satisfy conditions i iii are given in eqs 2 and 3 2 β a ln λ a β f a a c a and 3 β a ln λ a ln c 1 a 1 c 2 a ln c 1 c 2 a 1 c 2 a note that the available data contains the values of λ however we need to estimate β the relation between λ and β is 4 β a ln λ a eq 4 explains why the logarithm appears on both equation 2 and 3 the parameter a c 0 in eq 2 is the critical value of the area for which the sign of the net growth rate changes from a negative value to a positive value we call this point the switching point this is the point at which the plant density switches from increasing to decreasing or vice versa and we will show this fact in section 4 next we proceed with the estimation of the parameters in the functions we divide the fitting into two cases in one case we use the values of the projected λ for the years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 across the plots of same size and the corresponding areas that is we use the data set λ p i a i in the other case we utilize the values of the observed λ for the years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 across the plots of same size and the corresponding areas this is the data set λ o i a i the values of the data sets are given in tables a 1 and a 2 appendix a 1 for each data set we parametrize both functions given in equations 2 and 3 there are two parameters to be estimated in each formula β f a c in eq 2 and c 1 c 2 in eq 3 for each data set and each of the functions we follow two approaches in one approach we fix one parameter and estimate the other in the other approach we estimate both parameters when fixing one parameter we choose to fix β f ln c 1 c 2 ln λ f because it can be estimated from the available data it is estimated by averaging over all values of the asymptotic growth rate λ of the continuous forest sites with area equal to 100 h a presented in appendix a 1 then compute the natural logarithm of the resulting value the values for the estimate of β f using the two data sets λ p i a i and λ o i a i are given in table a 1 appendix a 1 where they are denoted by β f p and β f o respectively in particular when performing the fitting with the data set λ p i a i and fixing one parameter we set 5 ln c 1 c 2 β f ln λ f 0 0214 then we estimate the parameter a c by parametrizing the function in eq 2 and estimate c 2 by fitting the function in eq 3 when using the data values λ o i a i we proceed similarly but equation 5 is replaced by 6 ln c 1 c 2 β f ln λ f 0 1066 the results of the both fittings are summarized in table 1 and in fig 2 results summary we found a significant correlation between fragment area and growth rate β thus validating our assumption a 1 the growth rate is dependent on the area a that is β β a furthermore when using the data points λ p i a i the fit standard error rmse is approximately the same either 0 021 or 0 022 across the four fittings see column 5 in table 1 similarly when using the data points λ o i a i it follows that the rmse across the four fittings is either 0 065 or 0 066 see column 7 in table 1 this result suggests that there is no significant difference in the goodness of fit associated to the fitting of the two distinct function forms given in eqs 2 and 3 this feature is also visible in fig 2 from table 1 column 6 we see that the value of β f estimated using matlab cftool is 0 1032 when the function in eq 2 is adopted and it is ln 28 39 25 60 0 1034 when the fitting is done with the function in eq 3 these values differ by less than 3 2 from the value estimated directly from the data λ o i a i which is β f 0 1066 see eq 6 on the other hand when the fitting is performed with the data set λ p i a i column 4 table 1 β f is estimated to be equal 0 01088 and ln 38 02 37 61 0 01084 when the fitting is based on the function 2 and 3 respectively however the value of β f estimated from the data λ p i a i is 0 0214 see eq 5 which is 50 higher than the values obtained by fitting with matlab cftool based on these results we select the function in eq 2 to model the dependence of β on the area of the fragment this function is fed into model 1 leading to two models one model parameterized by λ p i a i and the other parameterized by λ o i a i in both models a c is replaced by the corresponding value estimated via matlab cftool and given in table 1 similarly to the parameter β f is assigned the corresponding value estimated directly from the data and given in eqs 5 and 6 3 3 dependence of μ on a μ a observe that the fitting of the mortality function μ a is not necessary for parametrizing model 1 however we present the parameterization of μ a to estimate the minimum fragment area at which the plant mortality equals its natural mortality rate which is assumed to be the average mortality rate observed in the sites with area equal 100 h a continuous forest this quantity is important as it helps in understanding how fragmentation affects plant vital rates we assume that the function μ a satisfies the following properties i μ a is continuous and differentiable ii 0 μ 1 iii when the site area is close to zero the death rate approaches 1 this models the fact that when the area of the patch is very small the death rate is very high furthermore we assume that when the area is very large the mortality rate levels out at a certain value which is the natural death rate of the plant if there is no fragmentation in the system continuous forest one possible function that satisfies these conditions is 7 μ a 1 μ f exp d 1 a μ f where μ f is the natural plant mortality when the site is not fragmented continuous forest and d 1 is the system decay constant the value of μ f is the average of the mortality data values corresponding to sites with area equal to 100 h a which is the continuous forest those values are provided in appendix a 1 table a 4 and their average is μ f 0 0336 in the same table the values of μ for each plot with area of 1 h a 10 h a can be found eq 7 together with the data is used to estimate the parameter d 1 the parameterization is carried out as when fitting β a via matlab cftool and the results are given in table 2 as well as in fig 3 results summary the value of system s decay constant is estimated to be d 1 2 488 per year based on this value straightforward calculations show that the mortality rate in a fragment reaches the natural death rate when the area is equal or greater than 4 1 h a at a 4 1 h a the mortality in the site differ 0 1 from μ f 4 effect of fragment size on herb population density as discussed in section 3 2 we adopt the function in eq 2 to describe the relation between net growth rate β and area that is β a β f a a c a thus the model given in eq 1 reduces to 8 d b d t β a b 1 b k β f a a c a b 1 b k with β a r a μ a the equilibrium states of the system are obtained by solving the equation resulting from setting the right hand side of 8 equal to zero simple calculations shows that for fixed value of area a the solutions are 9 β a β f a a c a 0 b 0 b k the condition β a β f a a c a 0 holds true when a a c at this value of area β a r a μ a 0 that is the recruitment rate r and the dead rate μ are equal thus the initial density of biomass does not grow or decay the system will stabilize at the initial value of the plant density we next consider the case β a 0 and study the local stability of the equilibrium states b 0 and b k we first compute the jacobian matrix of the system which is given by 10 j a m β a 1 2 b k at equilibrium b 0 j a m β a β f a a c a since β f 0 it follows that j a m is positive if a a c and negative if a a c therefore b 0 is a locally asymptotical stable l a s equilibrium if a a c while it is unstable if condition a a c holds true when considering the equilibrium state b k the jacobian j a m β a and the equilibrium state b k is unstable if a a c and it is l a s if a a c the results can then be summarized in the following proposition proposition 1 consider the model of forest fragmentation given by 8 where the parameters have nonnegative values if a a c the plant density stabilizes at its initial value if a a c then the equilibrium b 0 is l a s while the equilibrium b k is unstable on the other hand if a a c then the equilibrium b 0 is unstable and the b k is l a s biological implications if the fragment size is below the switching point a c the population growth rate β a becomes negative indicating decreasing population size towards the equilibrium state b 0 which implies that the persistence of the herb heliconia acuminata is in jeopardy if the fragment size is above the critical value a c then heliconia acuminata population level stabilizes at the carrying capacity of the system k from the fitting we can see that the average value of the critical patch area a c is approximately 1 75 h a based on the projected data λ p i a i i and the fragment critical area a c is estimated to have an average value of approximately 0 655 when the observed data set is used to fit the function thus the switching point a c estimated with observed data λ o i a i is lower about 63 than the switching point estimated with the data λ p i a i therefore our model predictions based on the observed data indicate that the plant population has a higher resilience to fragmentation than the prediction based on the projected data recall that the values of λ p i in the project data λ p i a i are derived from the linear matrix model these results are illustrated in fig 4 when the fragment size is precisely equal to the threshold value population size that was initially in the patch does not change which indicates that the plant can persist in the system whenever the initial population size is different from zero the results summarized in proposition 1 are illustrated in fig 4 this figure depicts numerical simulations of the model 1 parameterized with the projected data set λ p i a i as well as numerical simulations of the model parameterized with the data λ o i a i 5 model predictability capabilities after parametrizing the model 1 with the two data sets projected data set λ p i a i and observed data λ o i a i we test their predictability against the experimental data consisting of plant population density b corresponding to years t 1 1998 t 2 1999 and t 3 2000 that is against the data set b o i t i given in appendix a 1 table a 2 for a patch of a given area the initial condition used to run the models the one parameterized by λ p i a i and the one parameterized by the observed data λ o i a i is the average value of the observed population density in year 1998 more precisely we used the initial value of 194 342 388 when the area was fixed at 1 h a 10 h a and 100 h a respectively the results are shown in fig 5 additionally fixing a patch area we investigate how well the model parameterized by the set λ o i a i performs to reproduced the average observed data comparatively to the matrix model used in bruna 2003 specifically we compare the temporal pattern obtained with the model parameterized with the observed data set λ o i a i with the observed and projected average plant population density the results are indicated in fig 6 6 discussion of results our results are obtained with a model parameterized with the best data set available the collection of data is in the scope of the brazil s biological dynamics of forest fragments project bdffp this project is one of the largest and longest experimental work to study the ecological impact of habitat fragmentation laurance et al 2011 it constitutes an incredible effort in the field but there is only three patch sizes in the data and three time instances 1998 1999 and 2000 this information is far from ideal to parametrize the model in addition to being small the data sets exhibit high variability and missing values consequently several approximations were made for example there were missing values of projected and observed asymptotic growth rate λ for transitions years 1998 1999 for 3 sites with area 100 h a so for these sites we assume that the density of heliconia acuminata in year 1998 was the same as in the year 1999 the model parameterization can be easily changed to accommodate distinct data sets not only concerning heliconia acuminata that may be produced in the future but also concerning other plant systems the results in fig 5 suggests that the model either parameterized by the projected data λ p i a i or parameterized by the observed data λ o i a i do not fit well the plant density observed in each individual site of fragments of same area this might be due to the constrains of the data sets mentioned above however when using the average observed plant density instead of the observed density in each individual site the model parameterized by the data set λ o i a i captures qualitatively the plant density temporal evolution pattern see fig 6 this occurs for all three distinct areas considered in contrast the matrix model predictions only capture the observed temporal evolution of the plant density in the continuous forest panel c nonetheless our ode model fits the observed data slightly better than the linear matrix model due to the fact that the data sets are small it is difficult to conduct robustness test by removing some of the data points and see whether one gets similar fitting results sensitivity analysis could be used to gain additional insight on how the model respond to uncertainty in the parameters this is part of future work 7 conclusions we explored the effect of fragmentation on plant population size in an ordinary differential equation ode based framework this model assume that the growth of the plant population size is of logistic type and that the net growth rate recruitment rate minus mortality rate is affected by the reduction of patch area through a general net growth function we use the model to investigate the minimum patch area needed to sustain any plant shrub system additionally we parametrize the model with a three years census data of heliconia acuminata in both forest fragments and continuous forest provided in the work by bruna 2003 we apply the resulting fitted model to determine the minimum fragment size necessary to sustain the heliconia acuminata density in a fragmented landscape for this specific data set we also test the hypothesis that the ode based model with the dependence of plant growth rate on the population density explicitly modeled fits the observed heliconia acuminata density better than the linear matrix demographic models that are common used in the field our theoretical analysis of the model indicates that the persistence of heliconia acuminate is possible when the area of the fragment is higher than a threshold a c the system switching point that is for values of the area greater to a c the net population growth rate is greater than zero which implies persistent plant population whose size will reach asymptotically the fragment carrying capacity if no disturbances occur the persistence of the plant is still possible if the forest fragment area is equal to a c but in this case the population stagnates at the initial value the switching point a c estimated with the proposed net growth rate function parameterized with the census data from amazonian heliconia acuminata is 0 655 1 h a this result is in agreement with the findings reported by bruna and kress 2002 concerning the same amazonian heliconia acuminata system which shows that among the three area patches studied 1 10 100 h a the herb in fragments of 1 h a is more vulnerable to fragmentation the switching point estimated with same function but parameterized with the data calculated using the asymptotical growth rate λ obtained from the matrix based model and presented in the work by bruna 2003 is 1 75 2 h a thus the predictions based on the census data indicate that the plant system is more resilient to fragmentation than the predictions based on the data recovered from the matrix based model the mortality decay constant estimated through the function parameterized with the data census reveals that the mortality rate of heliconia acuminata stabilizes at the value of the mortality rate observed in an ecosystem without fragmentation when the fragment size is greater or equal to 4 h a thus our study suggests that in the particular scenario of heliconia acuminata amazonian system the net growth rate is less sensitive to fragmentation than the mortality rate such phenomena was also reported for the same plant system bruna and kress 2002 it was reported that fragments of 10 h a of land suffered higher mortality than the continuous forest given our results we observed that the ode based model presented in this study can serve as an alternative to the linear demographic model since we have included in our ode model some assumptions about how the mortality and recruitment rates behave which are not included in the linear demographic model furthermore the ode model is able to fit the given data this is an interesting result suggesting the use of models that take in account the dependence of the plant population growth rates on population size when investigating the impact of fragmentation on plant species however further investigations are needed to verify if this findings are applied to other plant populations in fragmented systems the model in this paper is very simple it consists of an ordinary differential equation that represent average or mean field approximations of the true time and spatial scales of the object of study an alternative formulation could involve an age structured model and or including spatial component additionally those models could incorporate distinct processes in which fragmentation affects for example pollination seed dispersal the seed and seedling establishment however any attempt in this direction would require a multitude of parameters and necessarily data to validate it given the nature of the phenomena at hand these requirements may be very difficult to satisfy therefore the approach of using simpler models may have advantages over uses of agent based or computational models that are more realistic but providing very limited theoretical insights realistically we understand that we should consider multi patch and interactions between the patches however since this is an alternative approach to the use of linear demographic model it is important to understand the dynamics of a single isolated patch in the future we will consider a more realistic model with multi patches and their connectedness credit authorship contribution statement maria c a leite conceptualization methodology software investigation data curation writing original

corresponding to year 1999 as well as the fragment area are given in table 1 bruna 2003 the projected asymptotical growth rate λ corresponding to the transition years 1998 1999 and 1999 2000 for each site is also provided in table 1 the details on the computation of these values are given also in bruna 2003 the values of observed λ are depicted in fig 5 in the same work the transition matrices describing the dynamics of the heliconia acuminata are provided in appendix b bruna 2003 a 1 1 values of the projected λ p i observed λ o i asymptotic growth rate and area a i of the fragment for each site the projected values of λ that is λ p i and area of each fragments site a i were read off table 1 bruna 2003 and is provided in table a 1 for completeness the resulting data set is denoted by λ p

computed using the relation β ln λ on the right hand side of table a 1 is listed the values of the projected and observed growth rates corresponding to the continuous forest these values are the average of the values of β p i and β o i for sites with area 100 ha and they are denoted by β f p and β f o respectively a 1 2 values of the population density of heliconia acuminata b p i projected and b o i observed in years 1998 1999 and 2000 for each site the density of the plant in the years 1998 1999 and 2000 were computed from the values of the density registered for year 1999 table 1 bruna 2003 and using the formula a 1 λ density of heliconia in year t 1 density of heliconia in year t for each area and each year we obtain two data sets projected density b p i t i and observed

using λ o i in the same equation for the sites with area 100 ha for which the values of projected and observed λ corresponding to the transition year 1998 1999 are not available in bruna 2003 we assumed that the population density in year 1998 is the same as in year 1999 the sets b p i t i and b o i t i are given in table a 2 in table a 3 we present the average values of heliconia density in

24566,ecophysiological models are more data demanding and consequently less used than correlative ecological niche models to predict species distribution under climate change especially for endotherms hybrid models that integrate both approaches are even less used and several aspects about their predictions e g accuracy geographic extent and uncertainty have been poorly explored we developed a hybrid model for mammals using hours of activity and hours of heat stress as mechanistic variables fitted using macroclimatic data and applied to conventional correlative modeling we then compared the outputs from conventional correlative models with our hybrid model for 58 tropical mammals in term of accuracy uncertainty and predicted geographic distribution under climate change we expected that hybrid models to have higher accuracy than correlative ones with difference in predicted geographic distribution extent we found no substantial differences between correlative and hybrid predictions for accuracy uncertainty and extent although the area predicted as suitable did not differ in extent they differ in location with lower congruence between models for future prediction this result challenged the widespread assumption that hybrid models are more accurate the ecophysiological model approach proposed here ease ecophysiological data requirements we propose therefore choosing model approach based on study s objective rather than on data requirements or the assumption that hybrid models have better predictions the main advantage of the hybrid model is in providing a more complete view of the species response as proximal causal and distal environment aspects are combined graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords combined model ecological niche model endotherms integrative model mammals mechanistic model species distribution model climate change 1 introduction correlative ecological niche models are widely used to estimate climate change impacts on species distribution peterson and soberón 2012 these models correlate species occurrence records with environmental variables peterson et al 2011 climate change impacts can also be estimated at a physiological level as high temperatures can generate hyperthermia events threatening bodily functions and basic activities hansen 2009 welbergen et al 2008 therefore species physiological traits can be related to environmental data in a mechanistic model to predict species distribution and estimate extinction risk kearney and porter 2009 correlative and mechanistic approaches can also be combined into a hybrid model providing a more comprehensive view of where and why species will be threatened by climate change briscoe et al 2016 elith et al 2010 in the last decade the number of studies that performed hybrid models incorporating physiological variables as input into correlative models has increased e g plants serra diaz et al 2013 mammals mathewson et al 2017 corals rodríguez et al 2019 lizards caetano et al 2020 there are different ways to generate a hybrid model such as using mechanistically derived spatial variables as predictors in correlative models most common method e g caetano et al 2020 enriquez urzelai et al 2019 kearney and porter 2017 using the mechanistic projection to limit the correlative calibration area e g elith et al 2010 and considering only the regions where the congruence between models were found e g ceia hasse et al 2014 most studies that compared different models suggested that hybrid models provide more accurate predictions than correlative and mechanistic models separately e g mathewson et al 2017 enriquez urzelai et al 2019 caetano et al 2020 they have also suggested that different modeling approaches provide different range extent predictions e g elith et al 2010 ceia hasse et al 2014 however these studies evaluated few species and did not compare model predictions quantitatively while correlative models need only environmental variables and occurrence records as biotic input hybrid models have the same disadvantage of mechanistic models the scarcity of data necessary to capture mechanisms briscoe et al 2016 pacifici et al 2015 peterson et al 2015 long term studies at field and laboratory experiments are necessary to obtain ecophysiological data e g sinervo et al 2010 caetano et al 2020 considering online databases occurrence records is far more available e g gbif org analytics global gbif 2020 than species trait and life history data amp 2021 myers et al 2020 this hinders mechanistic modelers from achieving generalization through comprehensive studies with a large number of species especially tropical ones tourinho and vale submitted one solution for this issue is to develop allometric models and physiological functions sufficiently general buckley et al 2010 peterson et al 2015 recent studies have developed general physiological equations for ectotherms in which thermal performance curves time activity and hours of restriction were estimated from environmental variables evaluating extinction risk for many lizards caetano et al 2020 sinervo et al 2010 2018 unlike ectotherms endotherms can control their body temperature tb by regulating metabolism although this physiological strategy is expensive and limited podulka et al 2004 the thermal neutral zone tnz is a temperature range in which endotherms maintain their activities at a constant metabolic rate without spending energy to thermoregulate podulka et al 2004 when the air temperature rises above the maximum extreme of the tnz endotherms reduce the internal heat production keeping tb constant while wasting energy podulka et al 2004 on the other hand like ectotherms these animals can thermoregulate through behavioral strategies avoiding heat by hiding in thermal refuges podulka et al 2004 welbergen et al 2008 either by using energy or by changing behavior the time spent on thermoregulation is called hours of restriction hr for ectotherms sinervo et al 2010 here considering that endotherms can maintain homeothermy at a range of environmental temperature above the maximum temperature of tnz by wasting energy mitchell et al 2018 instead of hours of restriction we used the term hours of heat stress hs the hr or hs can reduce the species fitness in climate change scenarios as reduces forage and reproduction activities in a trade off to maintain tb constant mckechnie and wolf 2010 sinervo et al 2010 hours of restriction have been increasingly used in mechanistic and hybrid models to estimate geographic range and extinction risk of ectotherms showing great model performance caetano et al 2020 ceia hasse et al 2014 riddell et al 2019 sinervo et al 2018 2010 only one study explored the relationship between hour of activity ha to environmental temperatures for one mammal mathewson et al 2017 although not including the novel and analogous hours of heat stress approach here we modeled 58 small tropical mammals worldwide under current and future conditions using two approaches the correlative ecological niche model with climatic variables only and hybrid ecological niche model that incorporates climatic variables and ecophysiological derived variables i e hs and ha as predictors into a correlative model the ecophysiological model for small mammals used here is innovative reducing the central problem of data scarcity relying on more easily available data while ecophysiological models usually require a number of life cycle and animal energetic parameters such as skin s resistance to water loss thermal conductivity resting metabolic curve fur thickness etc e g mathewson et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 our model only requires tnz extreme values and breeding season furthermore hybrid models are widely assumed as more accurate in the literature e g caetano et al 2020 dormann et al 2012 mathewson et al 2017 peterson et al 2015 but empirical evidence remains sparse tourinho and vale submitted we compared both predictions to understand which model in terms of accuracy uncertainty and predicted distribution congruence and extent for 58 small mammals worldwide in the first comprehensive empirical comparison between correlative and hybrid models for the mammalian order following the literature we expect hybrid models to be more accurate and predicted distributions to differ in extent e g buckley et al 2010 dormann et al 2012 ceia hasse et al 2014 peterson et al 2015 although no study has evaluated hybrid models uncertainty to date we expect hybrid model to have greater uncertainty because it has more parameters evans et al 2013 merow et al 2014 2 methods 2 1 species data we chose small mammals as a target for this study body mass smaller than 5kg fuller et al 2016 due to the body volume area proportion although small mammals can dissipate metabolic heat efficiently their body temperature responds quickly to high environmental temperatures t air hampering the maintenance of homeothermy angilletta et al 2010 hetem et al 2014 mitchell et al 2018 hence they are more sensitive to climate change than large mammals mitchell et al 2018 on the other hand small mammals quickly access thermal refuges like burrows and tree cavities fick et al 2009 mccain and king 2014 the refuges can buffer high t air decreasing climate change s immediate impacts nowack et al 2017 however refuges can indirectly increase the climate change impacts by increasing hours of heat stress hs and therefore reducing the species fitness lane et al 2012 sinervo et al 2018 2010 we focused on tropical species i e mainly distributed in the tropics because they can be more vulnerable to climate change than temperate and polar species khaliq et al 2014 tewksbury et al 2008 and as we know only one study used hybrid models to predict climate change vulnerability for tropical vertebrates caetano et al 2020 in tropical areas endotherms already live close to the limits of tnz breadth and the extreme maximum temperature of the thermal tolerances are already close to the extreme maximum t air khaliq et al 2014 furthermore the thermal tolerances range of tropical species is narrow due to the low thermal variability of the tropical environment khaliq et al 2014 tewksbury et al 2008 the tropical extent area was based on beck et al 2018 calculating ecophysiological parameters hs and hours of activity ha requires the extreme values of the species thermal neutral zone tnz and breeding season we compiled data of lower and upper limits of the tnz and body mass for 58 small mammals table s1 in supporting information as an approximation of thermal tolerance we compiled breeding season when the reproduction and foraging activities can be more compromised by hr sinervo et al 2018 2010 and height of habitat experienced by species used to select microclimatic conditions table s1 in supporting information finally we compiled species occurrence records gbif 2020 constable et al 2010 checking for record s geographic accuracy eliminating all ill defined data duplicated records and wrong coordinates rspatial org hijmans 2020 we reduced geographic autocorrelation considering only records located less than 1km from each other using the spthin package aiello lammens et al 2015 in r we also reduced environmental autocorrelation following varela et al 2014 our species varied in occurrence records ranging from 30 to 1724 nyctimene albiventer and carollia perspicillata respectively when modeling a large set of species variation in occurrence records is expected amount of occurrence records vary naturally among species due to difference in species rareness both terms of abundance and range size this is a phenomenon known as wallacean shortfall which recognizes that knowledge about the geographic distribution of most species is incomplete hortal et al 2015 lomolino 2004 differences in record numbers among species might not be a problem but few and or aggregated records can certainly interfere with model performance breiner et al 2018 pearson et al 2007 therefore we considered only species with more than 30 occurrences and low geographic and environmental autocorrelation i e non aggregate and independent records 2 2 environmental variables we obtained macroclimatic variables from wordclim 1 4 http www worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 for historical a k a current average for 1960 1990 and future conditions average for 2061 2080 with a spatial resolution of 30 ca 1 km at the equator these variables were monthly average minimum temperature t min monthly average maximum temperature t max and monthly total precipitation for future conditions we used mpi esm lr hijmans et al 2005 the best general circulation models gcms for world scale analyses anav et al 2013 under a business as usual greenhouse gas concentration scenario rcp 8 5 ipcc 2013 we used microclimatic variables from kearney et al 2014 as input for ecophysiological models these variables are a dataset of microclimatic conditions e g air temperature and substrate temperatures at a global scale available for the current time at ca 15 km resolution and hourly time resolution for strictly terrestrial species we selected the soil and sand surface temperatures i e 0 cm and air temperature at 1 cm above the soil considering all shade percentage levels 0 25 50 75 90 and 100 for species that use terrestrial and arboreal height of the environment we added air temperature from 120 cm of the surface the highest measurement available in the dataset we selected air temperature 1 cm and 120 cm above the surface for strictly arboreal species considering 0 and 100 shade levels 2 3 ecophysiological modeling adapting the methods from sinervo et al 2010 2018 for every occurrence record compiled we calculate the mean of hours of heat stress by accumulating each hour when the microclimatic temperature te was higher than the maximum extreme of the thermal neutral zone i e upper critical temperature uct we calculated the mean of hours of activity accumulating hours when microclimatic temperature was higher than the minimum extreme of the tnz i e lower critical temperature lct we constructed hs integrals from microclimatic rasters for each 12 months m for each 24 h of the day e g 24 rasters one for each hour when the function fs registered the number of hours in which te uct 1 h s m t 0 24 f s t e m u c t d t and for ha when the function fa registered the number of hours in which te lct 2 h a m t 0 24 f a t e m l c t d t we computed the integrals considering each hourly raster scenarios of microclimate ne for each type of substrate soil and sand each surface depth 0 cm to 120 cm and each shade percentage 0 to 100 we integrated each of ne scenarios for te i m h where i shade percentage to do so we used eqs 3 and 4 to average all scenarios in lebesgue integral using the indicator function i which takes the value 1 for te uct or lct or 0 for te integrating hours h hours when te uct or lct uct or lct we computed hs as the number of hours above the uct threshold for each scenario which after averaging all te i scenarios for a given month yields monthly averages h s m 3 h s m n e i 1 h 24 h 0 i h s u c t t e i m h n e and for computing h a m as the number of hours above lct threshold averaging all te i scenarios for a given month yields monthly averages h a m 4 h a m n e i 1 h 24 h 1 i h a l c t t e i m h n e this model assumes that in nature the small mammals would move among t e habitats of the microclimate scenarios caetano et al 2020 its body would experience the hourly average of all te scenarios as it works its way across the landscape from soil and sand substrates horizontally or vertically to the upper canopy considering that the target species occur worldwide to be more accurate we took account of the sunrise and sunset hours for each grid within species geographic range for the next step we built hs and ha data through the macroclimatic variables tmax and tmin respectively for current and future periods for each raster cell we fitted hs and ha as a function of tmax or tmin using a sigmoidal richards s function in jmp 14 5 h s t m a x u c t τ s 1 1 τ s 2 e x p τ s 3 t m a x u c t 1 τ s 4 6 h a t m i n l c t τ a 1 1 τ a 2 e x p τ a 3 t m i n l c t 1 τ a 4 these two functions were used to downscale hs and ha for each month of the year for worldclim raster resolution to generate the ha temperature derived raster we averaged all 12 months and to generate the hs temperature derived raster we averaged only the months respective to the breeding season of the species hence these rasters could be incorporated into correlative models as predictors all these analyses were adapted from the mapinguari package caetano et al 2019 http github com gabrielhoc mapinguari and the new codes are available in an online repository http github com luaratourinho 2 4 correlative and hybrid modeling because different modeling methods produce different forecasts diniz filho et al 2009 elith et al 2010 qiao et al 2015 we used four algorithms to generate the correlative models maxent which requires as input occurrence records and background points and glm randomforest and svm which require occurrence records and pseudo absence records into the calibration area we randomized 100 pseudoabsence records for species with less than 100 and 1 000 pseudoabsence records for species with more than 100 occurrence records with a minimal of 50 km distance to occurrence records barbet massin et al 2012 using the package biomod2 thuiller et al 2016 in r to perform maxent we randomized 10 000 background records within the calibration area of each species we evaluated models using 10 fold cross validation we created continuous ensemble models by weighted average the most popular consensus method and which provides robust predictions araújo and new 2007 hao et al 2020 2019 kaky et al 2020 marmion et al 2009 but see zhu et al 2021 which evaluated different ensemble methods based on true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 eliminating models with tss 0 6 to convert continuous forecast in binary values we used the maximum training specificity and sensitivity threshold we created the binary ensemble models by the majority rule araújo and new 2007 both binary and continuous ranged from 0 climatically unsuitable to 1 climatically suitable we modeled species ecological niche using the package dismo hijmans et al 2017 in r this framework is aligned with zurell et al 2020 protocol across literature there are different strategies to integrate ecophysiological and correlative approaches into a hybrid model in the context of the impact of climate change on vertebrate species the most common strategy is to use ecophysiological derived spatial variables as input in correlative models caetano et al 2020 elith et al 2010 enriquez urzelai et al 2019 mathewson et al 2017 for a review see tourinho vale submitted in this approach the relationship between species functional traits e g animal s metabolic heat and net heat flux and micro climatic conditions are projected into geographic space and its output e g activity model are introduced as a predictor into the correlative model e g mathewson et al 2017 alternatively and less common approaches are for example to quantify the agreement between correlative and mechanistic outputs and retain only congruent areas e g elith et al 2010 ceia hasse et al 2014 and to create pseudoabsence records only in the regions predicted as unsuitable in the mechanistic model and use these records to run the correlative model e g elith et al 2010 here we adopted the most common hybrid strategy using the ecophysiological derived spatial variables provided by our ecophysiological model as an input of the correlative model thus we built the hybrid model using the same correlative methodology differing only in the predictors used in the correlative models we used only climatic variables tmax tmin and monthly total precipitation of summer and winter in the hybrid models we used the monthly total precipitation of summer and winter and derived ecophysiological predictors hs and ha as mechanistic variables before the modeling we cropped all variables considering a buffer of 20 of the species minimum convex polygon barve et al 2011 see fig 1 for a complete workflow of the method proposed 2 5 models comparison to test whether hybrid and correlative models differ in accuracy uncertainty and in range extent plus stable lost and gained areas we performed a paired t test for each response variable we ran tree performance measures of model accuracy tss auc and kappa we used the mean and the standard deviation of tss of auc and of kappa from all algorithm models of each species as observation data in the tests to measure the uncertainty from model predictions we calculated the standard deviation through each partition and averaged the output in an ensemble of the current and future periods again each species results were used as an observation on the tests range extent plus stable lost and gained areas predicted by binary models and the mean of difference from each species continuous predictions were also used as observation data in tests none of these response variables showed relevant phylogenetic signal fig s1 in supporting information we were also interested in evaluating spatial congruence in predictions from different modeling approaches to do so we overlapped the forecasts and measured in percentage the proportion of the congruent area the area predicted as suitable only by the hybrid model and the area predicted as suitable only by the correlative model 3 results we found no difference in accuracy from hybrid models and correlative models for any metric analyzed tss auc and kappa for both mean and standard deviation fig 2 a f table s3 in supporting information we found difference only in uncertainty of predictions in which hybrid models exhibited higher current 11 and future 12 uncertainty fig 2g h table s4 in supporting information however most of the uncertainty values were concentrated around the null model line with approximately only five species forcing a significant tendency we also found no difference when comparing the magnitude of area loss gain and stability and in range extent between future and current predictions generated by each modeling approach fig 3 a d table s4 in supporting information for hybrid models the magnitude of suitability loss varied between 0 to 39 and the magnitude of suitability gain between 0 to 65 which was also like correlative models that varied between 0 to 34 suitability loss and 0 to 75 suitability gain the mean of difference from continuous predictions showed no difference as well fig 3e however few species yielded a high difference between approaches see table s4 in supporting information the current predictions from both approaches exhibit almost 72 5 of congruence in the area the dashed line represented percentage values in fig 4 and values for each species in table s5 in supporting information the area predicted only by the hybrid models were around 12 5 and only by the correlative models were around 15 for future predictions the congruence area exhibited from both approaches was around 57 the area predicted only by the hybrid model was around 20 and only by the correlative model was around 23 in other words the congruence area was greater for current predictions than for future predictions and the difference in prediction magnitude was greater for the future than for the present with the correlative model predicting greater range i e overestimating the distribution see dashed blue lines in fig 4 4 discussion our results showed high congruence between model predictions no difference between accuracy although hybrid model showed a probably higher uncertainty than correlative models considering the accuracy our results refuted the hypothesis raised here and numerous times in the literature that hybrid models have higher accuracy e g buckley et al 2010 dormann et al 2012 ceia hasse et al 2014 peterson et al 2015 many theoretical studies are based on the argument that hybrid model should provide higher accuracy than correlative model because they incorporate causal aspects into the model improving the realism of the predictions e g dormann et al 2012 peterson et al 2015 empirical studies have performed different approaches for few species therefore they were not able to analyze quantitatively model accuracy considering the unique accuracy value provided by the model e g ceia hasse et al 2014 mathewson et al 2017 caetano et al 2020 our study on the other hand performed correlative and hybrid model for 58 tropical mammals worldwide being able to perform a statistical analysis to compare the accuracy of the models our set of species was diverse including species with wide and restricted geographic range different body masses breeding seasons and number of occurrence records however for all selected species the most used performance tests in the literature tss auc and kappa showed non significant differences between models although hybrid models are expected to have higher accuracy for being a more realistic models levins 1966 tourinho and vale submitted our results suggest that there might be a trade off in which hybrid models accuracy is penalized by high parameterization which also increases uncertainty on the other hand as far as we know when studies compare model predictions uncertainty is not a point of discussion it is common that studies do not test differences in model uncertainty or even report it zurell et al 2020 however different mathematical approaches can yield different results diniz filho et al 2009 qiao et al 2015 and it is pertinent to ask where the model can better predict suitability zurell et al 2020 our study was the first to compare the uncertainty between correlative and hybrid predictions correlative models had less uncertainty than hybrid models corroborating our hypothesis grounded on the assumption that the more parameters the greater the model complexity and also thus the its uncertainty evans et al 2013 merow et al 2014 however although the results showed quantitatively that correlative models are less uncertain this tendency was pushed by the model of five species only fig 2g h and can hardly be generalized pooling all species together our results corroborate the literature in the assumption that species distribution is highly congruent between models for current predictions e g ceia hasse et al 2014 elith et al 2010 we found a higher congruence between modeling approaches for current rather than for the future predictions fig 4 likely because future conditions are harder to predict than current one in other words the predictions between models indicate different regions as suitable in the future on the other hand correlative and hybrid predictions were similar in extent and percentage gain and loss area although they did not necessarily predict the same area for loss or gain another important point to raise here is that mechanistic models are data demanding and therefore used less in the literature briscoe et al 2019 meineri et al 2015 peterson et al 2015 porter and kearney 2009 urban et al 2016 consequently the choice of modeling is determined in great part by data availability and computational support that allows incorporating a large amount of data into the models dormann et al 2012 the method proposed here is innovative and accessible considering data availability using species occurrence data tnz extreme temperatures and breeding season only we can generate ecophysiological predictors from microclimate environmental temperatures and set them as a function of macroclimatic variables this enables the modeling of a great number of species compared to conventional physiological mechanistic models e g kearney and porter 2017 mathewson et al 2017 indeed our study modeled 58 mammal species while the few other studies that performed ecophysiological hybrid models for vertebrates had ca 1 to 3 species e g ceia hasse et al 2014 mathewson et al 2017 lyons and kozak 2020 this is the first comprehensive study on mammals response to climate change with correlative and hybrid models predictions however this methodology is still computer demanding requiring a supercomputer to run the many steps of this model there are many methodological decisions when building correlative mechanistic and or hybrid ecological niche model which can influence the results elith et al 2010 mathewson et al 2017 zurell et al 2020 the correlative workflow is well known for having a number of methodological options in

24566,ecophysiological models are more data demanding and consequently less used than correlative ecological niche models to predict species distribution under climate change especially for endotherms hybrid models that integrate both approaches are even less used and several aspects about their predictions e g accuracy geographic extent and uncertainty have been poorly explored we developed a hybrid model for mammals using hours of activity and hours of heat stress as mechanistic variables fitted using macroclimatic data and applied to conventional correlative modeling we then compared the outputs from conventional correlative models with our hybrid model for 58 tropical mammals in term of accuracy uncertainty and predicted geographic distribution under climate change we expected that hybrid models to have higher accuracy than correlative ones with difference in predicted geographic distribution extent we found no substantial differences between correlative and hybrid predictions for accuracy uncertainty and extent although the area predicted as suitable did not differ in extent they differ in location with lower congruence between models for future prediction this result challenged the widespread assumption that hybrid models are more accurate the ecophysiological model approach proposed here ease ecophysiological data requirements we propose therefore choosing model approach based on study s objective rather than on data requirements or the assumption that hybrid models have better predictions the main advantage of the hybrid model is in providing a more complete view of the species response as proximal causal and distal environment aspects are combined graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords combined model ecological niche model endotherms integrative model mammals mechanistic model species distribution model climate change 1 introduction correlative ecological niche models are widely used to estimate climate change impacts on species distribution peterson and soberón 2012 these models correlate species occurrence records with environmental variables peterson et al 2011 climate change impacts can also be estimated at a physiological level as high temperatures can generate hyperthermia events threatening bodily functions and basic activities hansen 2009 welbergen et al 2008 therefore species physiological traits can be related to environmental data in a mechanistic model to predict species distribution and estimate extinction risk kearney and porter 2009 correlative and mechanistic approaches can also be combined into a hybrid model providing a more comprehensive view of where and why species will be threatened by climate change briscoe et al 2016 elith et al 2010 in the last decade the number of studies that performed hybrid models incorporating physiological variables as input into correlative models has increased e g plants serra diaz et al 2013 mammals mathewson et al 2017 corals rodríguez et al 2019 lizards caetano et al 2020 there are different ways to generate a hybrid model such as using mechanistically derived spatial variables as predictors in correlative models most common method e g caetano et al 2020 enriquez urzelai et al 2019 kearney and porter 2017 using the mechanistic projection to limit the correlative calibration area e g elith et al 2010 and considering only the regions where the congruence between models were found e g ceia hasse et al 2014 most studies that compared different models suggested that hybrid models provide more accurate predictions than correlative and mechanistic models separately e g mathewson et al 2017 enriquez urzelai et al 2019 caetano et al 2020 they have also suggested that different modeling approaches provide different range extent predictions e g elith et al 2010 ceia hasse et al 2014 however these studies evaluated few species and did not compare model predictions quantitatively while correlative models need only environmental variables and occurrence records as biotic input hybrid models have the same disadvantage of mechanistic models the scarcity of data necessary to capture mechanisms briscoe et al 2016 pacifici et al 2015 peterson et al 2015 long term studies at field and laboratory experiments are necessary to obtain ecophysiological data e g sinervo et al 2010 caetano et al 2020 considering online databases occurrence records is far more available e g gbif org analytics global gbif 2020 than species trait and life history data amp 2021 myers et al 2020 this hinders mechanistic modelers from achieving generalization through comprehensive studies with a large number of species especially tropical ones tourinho and vale submitted one solution for this issue is to develop allometric models and physiological functions sufficiently general buckley et al 2010 peterson et al 2015 recent studies have developed general physiological equations for ectotherms in which thermal performance curves time activity and hours of restriction were estimated from environmental variables evaluating extinction risk for many lizards caetano et al 2020 sinervo et al 2010 2018 unlike ectotherms endotherms can control their body temperature tb by regulating metabolism although this physiological strategy is expensive and limited podulka et al 2004 the thermal neutral zone tnz is a temperature range in which endotherms maintain their activities at a constant metabolic rate without spending energy to thermoregulate podulka et al 2004 when the air temperature rises above the maximum extreme of the tnz endotherms reduce the internal heat production keeping tb constant while wasting energy podulka et al 2004 on the other hand like ectotherms these animals can thermoregulate through behavioral strategies avoiding heat by hiding in thermal refuges podulka et al 2004 welbergen et al 2008 either by using energy or by changing behavior the time spent on thermoregulation is called hours of restriction hr for ectotherms sinervo et al 2010 here considering that endotherms can maintain homeothermy at a range of environmental temperature above the maximum temperature of tnz by wasting energy mitchell et al 2018 instead of hours of restriction we used the term hours of heat stress hs the hr or hs can reduce the species fitness in climate change scenarios as reduces forage and reproduction activities in a trade off to maintain tb constant mckechnie and wolf 2010 sinervo et al 2010 hours of restriction have been increasingly used in mechanistic and hybrid models to estimate geographic range and extinction risk of ectotherms showing great model performance caetano et al 2020 ceia hasse et al 2014 riddell et al 2019 sinervo et al 2018 2010 only one study explored the relationship between hour of activity ha to environmental temperatures for one mammal mathewson et al 2017 although not including the novel and analogous hours of heat stress approach here we modeled 58 small tropical mammals worldwide under current and future conditions using two approaches the correlative ecological niche model with climatic variables only and hybrid ecological niche model that incorporates climatic variables and ecophysiological derived variables i e hs and ha as predictors into a correlative model the ecophysiological model for small mammals used here is innovative reducing the central problem of data scarcity relying on more easily available data while ecophysiological models usually require a number of life cycle and animal energetic parameters such as skin s resistance to water loss thermal conductivity resting metabolic curve fur thickness etc e g mathewson et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 our model only requires tnz extreme values and breeding season furthermore hybrid models are widely assumed as more accurate in the literature e g caetano et al 2020 dormann et al 2012 mathewson et al 2017 peterson et al 2015 but empirical evidence remains sparse tourinho and vale submitted we compared both predictions to understand which model in terms of accuracy uncertainty and predicted distribution congruence and extent for 58 small mammals worldwide in the first comprehensive empirical comparison between correlative and hybrid models for the mammalian order following the literature we expect hybrid models to be more accurate and predicted distributions to differ in extent e g buckley et al 2010 dormann et al 2012 ceia hasse et al 2014 peterson et al 2015 although no study has evaluated hybrid models uncertainty to date we expect hybrid model to have greater uncertainty because it has more parameters evans et al 2013 merow et al 2014 2 methods 2 1 species data we chose small mammals as a target for this study body mass smaller than 5kg fuller et al 2016 due to the body volume area proportion although small mammals can dissipate metabolic heat efficiently their body temperature responds quickly to high environmental temperatures t air hampering the maintenance of homeothermy angilletta et al 2010 hetem et al 2014 mitchell et al 2018 hence they are more sensitive to climate change than large mammals mitchell et al 2018 on the other hand small mammals quickly access thermal refuges like burrows and tree cavities fick et al 2009 mccain and king 2014 the refuges can buffer high t air decreasing climate change s immediate impacts nowack et al 2017 however refuges can indirectly increase the climate change impacts by increasing hours of heat stress hs and therefore reducing the species fitness lane et al 2012 sinervo et al 2018 2010 we focused on tropical species i e mainly distributed in the tropics because they can be more vulnerable to climate change than temperate and polar species khaliq et al 2014 tewksbury et al 2008 and as we know only one study used hybrid models to predict climate change vulnerability for tropical vertebrates caetano et al 2020 in tropical areas endotherms already live close to the limits of tnz breadth and the extreme maximum temperature of the thermal tolerances are already close to the extreme maximum t air khaliq et al 2014 furthermore the thermal tolerances range of tropical species is narrow due to the low thermal variability of the tropical environment khaliq et al 2014 tewksbury et al 2008 the tropical extent area was based on beck et al 2018 calculating ecophysiological parameters hs and hours of activity ha requires the extreme values of the species thermal neutral zone tnz and breeding season we compiled data of lower and upper limits of the tnz and body mass for 58 small mammals table s1 in supporting information as an approximation of thermal tolerance we compiled breeding season when the reproduction and foraging activities can be more compromised by hr sinervo et al 2018 2010 and height of habitat experienced by species used to select microclimatic conditions table s1 in supporting information finally we compiled species occurrence records gbif 2020 constable et al 2010 checking for record s geographic accuracy eliminating all ill defined data duplicated records and wrong coordinates rspatial org hijmans 2020 we reduced geographic autocorrelation considering only records located less than 1km from each other using the spthin package aiello lammens et al 2015 in r we also reduced environmental autocorrelation following varela et al 2014 our species varied in occurrence records ranging from 30 to 1724 nyctimene albiventer and carollia perspicillata respectively when modeling a large set of species variation in occurrence records is expected amount of occurrence records vary naturally among species due to difference in species rareness both terms of abundance and range size this is a phenomenon known as wallacean shortfall which recognizes that knowledge about the geographic distribution of most species is incomplete hortal et al 2015 lomolino 2004 differences in record numbers among species might not be a problem but few and or aggregated records can certainly interfere with model performance breiner et al 2018 pearson et al 2007 therefore we considered only species with more than 30 occurrences and low geographic and environmental autocorrelation i e non aggregate and independent records 2 2 environmental variables we obtained macroclimatic variables from wordclim 1 4 http www worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 for historical a k a current average for 1960 1990 and future conditions average for 2061 2080 with a spatial resolution of 30 ca 1 km at the equator these variables were monthly average minimum temperature t min monthly average maximum temperature t max and monthly total precipitation for future conditions we used mpi esm lr hijmans et al 2005 the best general circulation models gcms for world scale analyses anav et al 2013 under a business as usual greenhouse gas concentration scenario rcp 8 5 ipcc 2013 we used microclimatic variables from kearney et al 2014 as input for ecophysiological models these variables are a dataset of microclimatic conditions e g air temperature and substrate temperatures at a global scale available for the current time at ca 15 km resolution and hourly time resolution for strictly terrestrial species we selected the soil and sand surface temperatures i e 0 cm and air temperature at 1 cm above the soil considering all shade percentage levels 0 25 50 75 90 and 100 for species that use terrestrial and arboreal height of the environment we added air temperature from 120 cm of the surface the highest measurement available in the dataset we selected air temperature 1 cm and 120 cm above the surface for strictly arboreal species considering 0 and 100 shade levels 2 3 ecophysiological modeling adapting the methods from sinervo et al 2010 2018 for every occurrence record compiled we calculate the mean of hours of heat stress by accumulating each hour when the microclimatic temperature te was higher than the maximum extreme of the thermal neutral zone i e upper critical temperature uct we calculated the mean of hours of activity accumulating hours when microclimatic temperature was higher than the minimum extreme of the tnz i e lower critical temperature lct we constructed hs integrals from microclimatic rasters for each 12 months m for each 24 h of the day e g 24 rasters one for each hour when the function fs registered the number of hours in which te uct 1 h s m t 0 24 f s t e m u c t d t and for ha when the function fa registered the number of hours in which te lct 2 h a m t 0 24 f a t e m l c t d t we computed the integrals considering each hourly raster scenarios of microclimate ne for each type of substrate soil and sand each surface depth 0 cm to 120 cm and each shade percentage 0 to 100 we integrated each of ne scenarios for te i m h where i shade percentage to do so we used eqs 3 and 4 to average all scenarios in lebesgue integral using the indicator function i which takes the value 1 for te uct or lct or 0 for te integrating hours h hours when te uct or lct uct or lct we computed hs as the number of hours above the uct threshold for each scenario which after averaging all te i scenarios for a given month yields monthly averages h s m 3 h s m n e i 1 h 24 h 0 i h s u c t t e i m h n e and for computing h a m as the number of hours above lct threshold averaging all te i scenarios for a given month yields monthly averages h a m 4 h a m n e i 1 h 24 h 1 i h a l c t t e i m h n e this model assumes that in nature the small mammals would move among t e habitats of the microclimate scenarios caetano et al 2020 its body would experience the hourly average of all te scenarios as it works its way across the landscape from soil and sand substrates horizontally or vertically to the upper canopy considering that the target species occur worldwide to be more accurate we took account of the sunrise and sunset hours for each grid within species geographic range for the next step we built hs and ha data through the macroclimatic variables tmax and tmin respectively for current and future periods for each raster cell we fitted hs and ha as a function of tmax or tmin using a sigmoidal richards s function in jmp 14 5 h s t m a x u c t τ s 1 1 τ s 2 e x p τ s 3 t m a x u c t 1 τ s 4 6 h a t m i n l c t τ a 1 1 τ a 2 e x p τ a 3 t m i n l c t 1 τ a 4 these two functions were used to downscale hs and ha for each month of the year for worldclim raster resolution to generate the ha temperature derived raster we averaged all 12 months and to generate the hs temperature derived raster we averaged only the months respective to the breeding season of the species hence these rasters could be incorporated into correlative models as predictors all these analyses were adapted from the mapinguari package caetano et al 2019 http github com gabrielhoc mapinguari and the new codes are available in an online repository http github com luaratourinho 2 4 correlative and hybrid modeling because different modeling methods produce different forecasts diniz filho et al 2009 elith et al 2010 qiao et al 2015 we used four algorithms to generate the correlative models maxent which requires as input occurrence records and background points and glm randomforest and svm which require occurrence records and pseudo absence records into the calibration area we randomized 100 pseudoabsence records for species with less than 100 and 1 000 pseudoabsence records for species with more than 100 occurrence records with a minimal of 50 km distance to occurrence records barbet massin et al 2012 using the package biomod2 thuiller et al 2016 in r to perform maxent we randomized 10 000 background records within the calibration area of each species we evaluated models using 10 fold cross validation we created continuous ensemble models by weighted average the most popular consensus method and which provides robust predictions araújo and new 2007 hao et al 2020 2019 kaky et al 2020 marmion et al 2009 but see zhu et al 2021 which evaluated different ensemble methods based on true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 eliminating models with tss 0 6 to convert continuous forecast in binary values we used the maximum training specificity and sensitivity threshold we created the binary ensemble models by the majority rule araújo and new 2007 both binary and continuous ranged from 0 climatically unsuitable to 1 climatically suitable we modeled species ecological niche using the package dismo hijmans et al 2017 in r this framework is aligned with zurell et al 2020 protocol across literature there are different strategies to integrate ecophysiological and correlative approaches into a hybrid model in the context of the impact of climate change on vertebrate species the most common strategy is to use ecophysiological derived spatial variables as input in correlative models caetano et al 2020 elith et al 2010 enriquez urzelai et al 2019 mathewson et al 2017 for a review see tourinho vale submitted in this approach the relationship between species functional traits e g animal s metabolic heat and net heat flux and micro climatic conditions are projected into geographic space and its output e g activity model are introduced as a predictor into the correlative model e g mathewson et al 2017 alternatively and less common approaches are for example to quantify the agreement between correlative and mechanistic outputs and retain only congruent areas e g elith et al 2010 ceia hasse et al 2014 and to create pseudoabsence records only in the regions predicted as unsuitable in the mechanistic model and use these records to run the correlative model e g elith et al 2010 here we adopted the most common hybrid strategy using the ecophysiological derived spatial variables provided by our ecophysiological model as an input of the correlative model thus we built the hybrid model using the same correlative methodology differing only in the predictors used in the correlative models we used only climatic variables tmax tmin and monthly total precipitation of summer and winter in the hybrid models we used the monthly total precipitation of summer and winter and derived ecophysiological predictors hs and ha as mechanistic variables before the modeling we cropped all variables considering a buffer of 20 of the species minimum convex polygon barve et al 2011 see fig 1 for a complete workflow of the method proposed 2 5 models comparison to test whether hybrid and correlative models differ in accuracy uncertainty and in range extent plus stable lost and gained areas we performed a paired t test for each response variable we ran tree performance measures of model accuracy tss auc and kappa we used the mean and the standard deviation of tss of auc and of kappa from all algorithm models of each species as observation data in the tests to measure the uncertainty from model predictions we calculated the standard deviation through each partition and averaged the output in an ensemble of the current and future periods again each species results were used as an observation on the tests range extent plus stable lost and gained areas predicted by binary models and the mean of difference from each species continuous predictions were also used as observation data in tests none of these response variables showed relevant phylogenetic signal fig s1 in supporting information we were also interested in evaluating spatial congruence in predictions from different modeling approaches to do so we overlapped the forecasts and measured in percentage the proportion of the congruent area the area predicted as suitable only by the hybrid model and the area predicted as suitable only by the correlative model 3 results we found no difference in accuracy from hybrid models and correlative models for any metric analyzed tss auc and kappa for both mean and standard deviation fig 2 a f table s3 in supporting information we found difference only in uncertainty of predictions in which hybrid models exhibited higher current 11 and future 12 uncertainty fig 2g h table s4 in supporting information however most of the uncertainty values were concentrated around the null model line with approximately only five species forcing a significant tendency we also found no difference when comparing the magnitude of area loss gain and stability and in range extent between future and current predictions generated by each modeling approach fig 3 a d table s4 in supporting information for hybrid models the magnitude of suitability loss varied between 0 to 39 and the magnitude of suitability gain between 0 to 65 which was also like correlative models that varied between 0 to 34 suitability loss and 0 to 75 suitability gain the mean of difference from continuous predictions showed no difference as well fig 3e however few species yielded a high difference between approaches see table s4 in supporting information the current predictions from both approaches exhibit almost 72 5 of congruence in the area the dashed line represented percentage values in fig 4 and values for each species in table s5 in supporting information the area predicted only by the hybrid models were around 12 5 and only by the correlative models were around 15 for future predictions the congruence area exhibited from both approaches was around 57 the area predicted only by the hybrid model was around 20 and only by the correlative model was around 23 in other words the congruence area was greater for current predictions than for future predictions and the difference in prediction magnitude was greater for the future than for the present with the correlative model predicting greater range i e overestimating the distribution see dashed blue lines in fig 4 4 discussion our results showed high congruence between model predictions no difference between accuracy although hybrid model showed a probably higher uncertainty than correlative models considering the accuracy our results refuted the hypothesis raised here and numerous times in the literature that hybrid models have higher accuracy e g buckley et al 2010 dormann et al 2012 ceia hasse et al 2014 peterson et al 2015 many theoretical studies are based on the argument that hybrid model should provide higher accuracy than correlative model because they incorporate causal aspects into the model improving the realism of the predictions e g dormann et al 2012 peterson et al 2015 empirical studies have performed different approaches for few species therefore they were not able to analyze quantitatively model accuracy considering the unique accuracy value provided by the model e g ceia hasse et al 2014 mathewson et al 2017 caetano et al 2020 our study on the other hand performed correlative and hybrid model for 58 tropical mammals worldwide being able to perform a statistical analysis to compare the accuracy of the models our set of species was diverse including species with wide and restricted geographic range different body masses breeding seasons and number of occurrence records however for all selected species the most used performance tests in the literature tss auc and kappa showed non significant differences between models although hybrid models are expected to have higher accuracy for being a more realistic models levins 1966 tourinho and vale submitted our results suggest that there might be a trade off in which hybrid models accuracy is penalized by high parameterization which also increases uncertainty on the other hand as far as we know when studies compare model predictions uncertainty is not a point of discussion it is common that studies do not test differences in model uncertainty or even report it zurell et al 2020 however different mathematical approaches can yield different results diniz filho et al 2009 qiao et al 2015 and it is pertinent to ask where the model can better predict suitability zurell et al 2020 our study was the first to compare the uncertainty between correlative and hybrid predictions correlative models had less uncertainty than hybrid models corroborating our hypothesis grounded on the assumption that the more parameters the greater the model complexity and also thus the its uncertainty evans et al 2013 merow et al 2014 however although the results showed quantitatively that correlative models are less uncertain this tendency was pushed by the model of five species only fig 2g h and can hardly be generalized pooling all species together our results corroborate the literature in the assumption that species distribution is highly congruent between models for current predictions e g ceia hasse et al 2014 elith et al 2010 we found a higher congruence between modeling approaches for current rather than for the future predictions fig 4 likely because future conditions are harder to predict than current one in other words the predictions between models indicate different regions as suitable in the future on the other hand correlative and hybrid predictions were similar in extent and percentage gain and loss area although they did not necessarily predict the same area for loss or gain another important point to raise here is that mechanistic models are data demanding and therefore used less in the literature briscoe et al 2019 meineri et al 2015 peterson et al 2015 porter and kearney 2009 urban et al 2016 consequently the choice of modeling is determined in great part by data availability and computational support that allows incorporating a large amount of data into the models dormann et al 2012 the method proposed here is innovative and accessible considering data availability using species occurrence data tnz extreme temperatures and breeding season only we can generate ecophysiological predictors from microclimate environmental temperatures and set them as a function of macroclimatic variables this enables the modeling of a great number of species compared to conventional physiological mechanistic models e g kearney and porter 2017 mathewson et al 2017 indeed our study modeled 58 mammal species while the few other studies that performed ecophysiological hybrid models for vertebrates had ca 1 to 3 species e g ceia hasse et al 2014 mathewson et al 2017 lyons and kozak 2020 this is the first comprehensive study on mammals response to climate change with correlative and hybrid models predictions however this methodology is still computer demanding requiring a supercomputer to run the many steps of this model there are many methodological decisions when building correlative mechanistic and or hybrid ecological niche model which can influence the results elith et al 2010 mathewson et al 2017 zurell et al 2020 the correlative workflow is well known for having a number of methodological options in terms of calibration area e g barve et al 2011 sánchez tapia et al 2020 algorithms e g diniz filho et al 2009 elith et al 2010 definition of pseudo absences e g barbet massin et al 2012 lobo tognelli 2011 performance tests e g allouche et al 2006 warren seifert 2011 and consensus a k a ensemble methods e g hao et al 2019 2020 marmion et al 2009 zhu et al 2021 here for example we used the most popular consensus method in the literature the weight average which provides robust predictions hao et al 2019 marmion et al 2009 but a recent study recommends the use of principal component analysis median as consensus method instead zhu et al 2021 methods in ecological niche modeling are always being revised and it is important therefore to keep up to date with the literature following those that are becoming standard in the field zurell et al 2020 always in light of the objective of the study in any case fortunately our methodological proposal allows for any adjustment in the correlative workflow we also suggest the use of different integrative decisions and methodologies to further explore the differences and advantages between correlative and hybrid models such as applying species tolerance thresholds and using virtual species which is expected to avoid inherent errors and biases of real species occurrences huang et al 2016 in the literature studies that compared correlative and hybrid model focus specially on methodological e g data requirements and prediction e g accuracy and range extent differences e g briscoe et al 2019 meineri et al 2015 peterson et al 2015 porter and kearney 2009 urban et al 2016 here we proposed method that ease data requirements and show that hybrid and correlative models do not differ in predictions therefore we propose that the main advantage of the hybrid model is not in delivering better predictions but simply providing a more complete view of the species response as proximal causal and distal environment aspects are combined dormann et al 2012 pacifici et al 2015 peterson et al 2015 on the other hand because the predictions from correlative models also showed good performance if data requirements and computational power are a problem or if causal aspects are not the focus of the study correlative models are still a good approach credit authorship contribution statement luara tourinho conceptualization methodology

24567,statistical species distribution models sdms are widely used to quantify how taxa respond to environmental conditions and to predict their distribution however the application of sdms to freshwater fish taxa is complicated by the active dispersal of fish taxa through river networks and the species and habitat dependent observation process i e the sampling method and effort required to accurately sample their distributions many studies have applied presence absence models pams to fish taxa while more recent studies have proposed zero inflated models zims to account for count observations with many zeroes however relatively few studies have incorporated the observation process into the model structure which would facilitate the combination of data from various monitoring programs that differ in their observation process in this study we use conceptual models to identify potentially dominant natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions with a direct mechanistic effect on the distributions of freshwater fish taxa in switzerland a region with a large range of environmental conditions from alpine streams that are mainly affected by hydromorphological alterations to lowland streams in densely populated areas with intensive agricultural land use moreover numerous barriers impede fish migration along the entire river network using combined data from two fish monitoring programs in switzerland we applied an exhaustive cross validation procedure to select a set of environmental variables with the highest out of sample predictive performance for the pam and zim for fish density individuals m2 of the seven most prevalent fish taxa salmo spp cottus spp squalius spp barbatula spp barbus spp phoxinus spp gobio spp we used these variables to develop a pam and zim for each taxon that accounts for differences in sampling methods and sampling effort we quantified the quality of fit during calibration using all samples and predictive performance during 5 fold cross validation of each model results show that stream temperature and stream morphology within the accessible habitat commonly appear among the best predictive presence absence models for multiple taxa spatial variables that account for migration barriers and quantify morphological conditions within the accessible habitat were selected for 6 out of 7 taxa the selected pams performed well for all taxa with an intermediate prevalence 10 40 with an explanatory power d 2 of between 0 32 0 37 during calibration using all samples and only minor decreases in explanatory power during cross validation d 2 0 34 0 44 as expected the pam for the highly prevalent salmo spp 91 failed to predict the few absence data points by contrast the zim model performed best for salmo spp with a standardized likelihood ratio of 1 56 for all other taxa besides barbus spp the zim models also had likelihood ratios above one indicating a better predictive performance than the null model we hope this study stimulates the development and application of fish species distribution models based on prior knowledge of causally linked environmental variables and incorporating observation errors to improve their predictive performance this can facilitate learning from biomonitoring data to support management 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems such as lakes and rivers are rich in biodiversity however over exploitation places freshwater ecosystems at greater risk of habitat destruction and degradation than their terrestrial and marine counterparts dudgeon et al 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 within the european union nearly half 47 of lakes and rivers failed to achieve a good ecological status in 2015 as defined by the eu water framework directive using indicators of the quality of biological communities with many freshwater species either increasingly threatened or endangered including mammals birds fish insects and other invertebrate communities fish species in europe are of particular concern with 37 of the 547 native species listed as threatened or endangered and 17 of species populations in decline brooks and freyhof 2011 the main anthropogenic threats to europe s freshwater fish species are the destruction degradation and fragmentation of habitat due to the channelization of natural river courses pollution from intensive agriculture and urban areas the construction of dams and water abstraction gozlan et al 2019 studies have emphasized the need for additional biomonitoring efforts to more accurately characterize the geographic distribution and population trends of freshwater fish species to 1 improve future risk assessments 2 identify underlying environmental drivers of species distributions and 3 better inform stream management gozlan et al 2019 vörösmarty et al 2010 accurately assessing the total population of a fish species in a given river length can be difficult due to the active dispersal capabilities of fish e g relative to benthic macroinvertebrates and the observation error inherent to imperfect fish sampling methods electrofishing is perhaps the most common fishing method for stream biomonitoring and involves passing a high voltage current through a length of river to stun fish for easy collection and analysis additional sampling efforts may increase the proportion of fish caught i e reducing observation error including the placement of nets at the start and end points of the fished area to prevent individual fish from escaping prior to sampling and performing multiple electrofishing passes or rounds to accurately quantify the number of individuals in a reach multiple fishing rounds can provide particularly useful data for fisheries management including population estimates that can be derived based on the number of fish captured in successive fishing rounds and on prior knowledge of the probability of capturing an individual of a given species e g carle and strub 1978 in obtaining presence absence and abundance i e count observations from biomonitoring data studies over the past two decades have applied statistical species distribution models sdms to quantify how observed distributions of species respond to a range of natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions techniques in statistical and machine learning have been applied ranging from classical statistical models such as generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams e g fukushima et al 2007 olden and jackson 2002 to machine learning algorithms such as random forests and boosted regression trees chee and elith 2012 maloney et al 2013 environmental conditions used as explanatory variables in fish sdms include topography e g elevation bond et al 2011 soil and geology e g maloney et al 2012 climatic variability e g temperature precipitation creque et al 2005 mcnyset 2005 hydrological regime e g flow velocity discharge bond et al 2011 mcnyset 2005 and habitat quality e g substrates hiding spots creque et al 2005 anthropogenic impacts due to land use e g agriculture urban areas impaired river morphology and to a lesser extent habitat fragmentation due to barriers e g distance to barriers such as dams radinger et al 2017 2019 rolls et al 2014 have been incorporated into fish sdms to quantify the effect of explanatory variables at multiple spatial scales chee and elith 2012 peterson et al 2011 the importance of including environmental conditions that have a direct mechanistic effect on species distributions has been emphasized as a means to improve model interpretability and to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying species distributions austin 2002 this principle is difficult to implement in practice due to limited data availability but is especially important when the models are intended to inform stream management moreover the presence absence and abundance i e count observations of fish species distributions often exhibit statistical properties that pose additional challenges when applying classical statistical sdms studies applying sdms in wider ecological contexts often assume species presence absence or count observations to follow a binomial or poisson distribution respectively however count distributions of fish may exhibit overdispersion i e the variance is greater than the mean due to a patchy distribution of individuals the poisson distribution assumes that its mean and variance are equal which yields biased parameter estimates when used to model overdispersed counts martin et al 2005 zuur et al 2009 typically the negative binomial distribution is used to account for overdispersion e g warton 2005 but may still be inadequate for explaining overdispersed counts with excess zeroes potts and elith 2006 to model counts of species exhibiting overdispersion and many zeroes zero inflated models 1 1 although early ecological applications of zero inflated models are highlighted zero inflated distributions were first proposed by aitchison 1955 and later applied by lambert 1992 zims have been proposed that effectively combine a binary outcome model i e with a bernoulli distribution that predicts excess zeroes with a model for count data i e following a poisson or negative binomial distribution martin et al 2005 wenger and freeman 2008 zuur et al 2009 zims have been applied to marine fish species for some time e g stefánsson 1996 often with the aim of better informing fish stock assessments and fisheries management cosandey godin et al 2014 thorson et al 2016 walsh and brodziak 2015 more recently zims have been applied to freshwater fish with initial studies comparing the performance of classical statistical techniques with their zero inflated counterparts lewin et al 2010 vaudor et al 2011 increasingly sophisticated applications of zims have been proposed to model freshwater fish distributions including models that include species observations with multiple size classes kanno et al 2012 account for non linear responses of species to environmental conditions arab et al 2012 and quantify environmental conditions at multiple spatial scales stewart koster et al 2013 hierarchical model structures have also been proposed to account for spatial autocorrelation among environmental conditions due to the hierarchical structure of the river network boone et al 2012 however while studies applying zims to marine fish observations have incorporated the observation process i e the equipment used and sampling effort into their proposed models there are relatively few studies that propose similar models for freshwater species wildhaber et al 2012 in this study our overarching aim is to develop conceptual models of fish autecology and use them to develop statistical models of fish species distributions i e fish sdms more concretely we develop conceptual models to summarize our prior knowledge of dominant natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions that have a direct mechanistic effect on freshwater fish species we then propose two distinct statistical models to predict the occurrence of different fish taxa namely a presence absence model pam and a zero inflated model zim to predict fish density i e fish count per unit area fished respectively although we use the conceptual models to identify environmental conditions that can potentially be included as explanatory variables in the statistical models we ultimately select explanatory variables among these that provide the best predictive performance for each species in pursuing the overarching aim of this study we address the following research questions 1 to what extent can we predict the occurrence and density of freshwater fish in a region with a large range of environmental conditions from densely populated areas with intensive agriculture to alpine regions based on currently available data from different monitoring programs and based on different fish sampling methods 2 which of the available environmental variables are most important for predicting occurrence and density of the most common fish taxa and do they reflect prior knowledge in developing the pams and zims for multiple fish taxa we combine several innovations we include the observation process in the structure of the statistical models to combine observational data collected using different sampling methods i e with qualitative semi quantitative and quantitative fishing in classical approaches e g carle and strub 1978 the true density of fish is estimated from repeated samplings these estimates are then used to calibrate a model for the true density in our approach the measurement process is included in the model which predicts the true density as internal state and provides the estimated fish caught as additional model output this makes it possible to consider all sources of uncertainty during the calibration process the same applies for occurrence in the pam in addition we quantify habitat fragmentation due to natural and anthropogenic barriers in the river network and influence factors that act at different spatial scales e g reach and accessible area with this study we explore what we can learn from model based analysis of currently available biomonitoring data and identify limitations and gaps to support river management 2 material and methods 2 1 observational data we combined data from the swiss national surface water quality monitoring program nawa kunz et al 2016 and the progetto fiumi program brodersen and seehausen 2014 table 1 both programs aim to describe fish community structure in swiss streams and rivers through quantitative semi quantitative or qualitative electrofishing sites in the progetto fiumi program were chosen to include all swiss drainages and the entire altitudinal gradient which are habituated by fish 203 2297 m a s l during quantitative sampling block nets were installed at the start and end points of the fished reach and two or three rounds of fishing were done with all fish caught included in the sample data and thus allowing for population estimates of individual taxa semi quantitative fishing was similar to quantitative fishing efforts but without the use of block nets and a single round of fishing during qualitative sampling one fishing round was done along a reach without the use of nets in qualitative sampling the reach was not entirely fished and not all captured fish were included in the data but all captured taxa were recorded in total 55 species were recorded as the taxonomic status of several of the most important riverine fish in central europe is currently being revised e g kottelat and freyhof 2007 lucek et al 2018 palandačić et al 2017 and species specific field records are therefore often unreliable we aggregated all species at the genus level see si section 1 1 for further explanations based on the combined progetto fiumi and nawa data we derived the abundance i e count and presence absence observations of fish taxa in each sample due to the difficulty of modeling rare taxa guisan et al 2006 potts and elith 2006 sor et al 2017 we selected seven taxa that occur in 10 or more of all samples table 2 for model development 2 2 conceptual model based on literature sources and consultations with biologists on the autecology of the selected fish taxa we developed conceptual models that show the current knowledge about dominant natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions that drive the distribution of fish taxa throughout their major life stages see fig 1 for salmo spp and si section 1 4 for similar conceptual models for additional taxa the main goal of these conceptual models is to inspire the development of statistical models based on causally linked explanatory variables to the degree possible schuwirth et al 2019 we included environmental conditions and processes in the conceptual models regardless of their data availability e g fish stocking impacts of angling on fish populations predation while acknowledging that numerous additional factors for which there is little or no available data could also be included e g prevalence of parasites and proliferative kidney disease effects of hydropeaking however the lack of data for specific environmental conditions e g water quality variables such as fine sediment loading does not exclude the possibility of indirectly quantifying their effect on the distribution of fish taxa e g by including agricultural land use indicators as explanatory variables in our statistical models 2 3 model definition in this section we introduce two statistical models first a presence absence model that takes observation errors into account and second a model that predicts the fish density i e the number of individuals per square meter at a site but is calibrated on the observed counts i e abundance of a given fish taxon both models include an observation process based on the fishing method in the model structure for all model definitions the following indices are used sites i 1 i time of sampling at site i t i 1 t i explanatory variables k 1 k the time point of sampling t i at a site is needed to represent the 11 of sites that are repeatedly fished however for simplicity we omit this index when defining the presence absence and zero inflated models 2 3 1 presence absence model the pam consists of two parts a generalized linear model that predicts the probability of occurrence of a given fish taxon based on environmental conditions and an observation model that describes the probability of observing the taxon based on its probability of occurrence the number of fishing rounds and the probability of catching and correctly identifying an individual that is present the model structure is visualized as a network in fig 2 the presence or absence of a fish taxon at site i is encoded by the variable y i which equals one if the taxon is present or zero if the taxon is absent we describe the presence absence observations with a conventional logistic regression 1 y i bernoulli π i where the probability of occurrence π i is given by 2 π i 1 exp α k 1 k x i k β k 1 with the intercept α selected environmental conditions as explanatory variables x i k and coefficients β k that quantify the taxon specific responses to the environmental conditions it is a common approach to derive observations of y i directly from count data however counting fish is prone to errors due to the incomplete sampling of all individuals present and potential misidentification of taxa to represent this in the model we make a distinction between the presence absence observations y i obs which are based on the count data and the true presence absence of a taxon y i an observation model links the two variables 3 p y i obs y i bernoulli ω i ω i p true i if y i 1 p false i if y i 0 the probability to catch at least one individual at site i is represented by the true positive probability p true i this probability is derived from a taxon specific probability p catch of catching an individual and the number of fishing rounds n i rounds 4 p true i n p y i obs 1 p catch n i rounds n p n n 1 1 p catch n i rounds n p n this derivation requires the distribution of the number of fish p n which was approximated with the empirical distribution of the count data across all sites there is also a typically low probability that a taxon is erroneously observed due to misidentification this is modeled by the false positive probability p false the two probabilities p catch and p false are based on expert judgment and not inferred from the data 2 3 2 fish density model the zim predicts the number of observed fish based on a zero inflated distribution for the fish density and an observation model that accounts for the fished area the number of fishing rounds and the catch probability fig 3 for a given taxon the fish density ρ i i e the number of fish per square meter at a site i is modeled by two components i a linear combination of the environmental explanatory variables x i k count with parameters α count and β k count i e the count component zeileis et al 2008 and ii a normally distributed site specific random effect i this results in 5 ρ i exp α count k 1 k x i k count β k count i with i n 0 σ the site effect i can be interpreted as a residual term and would be included to quantify the intrinsic uncertainty of the fish density at each site due to environmental conditions not included in the model or due to biotic interactions despite this appealing interpretation we eventually decided to omit the site effects because of the difficulty of defining appropriate informative priors which would be needed to avoid identifiability problems during parameter estimation see discussion 2 3 3 including zero inflation with the exception of salmo spp other taxa include observations with a large proportion of zero counts si fig 1 more than what can be explained by the selected environmental variables for fish density these excess zeros can arise if the taxon is absent at the time of sampling a site or the limited area fished relative to the spatial and temporal scale of the species movements martin et al 2005 alternatively the habitat conditions at a site may be suitable for the ecological preferences of a taxon but is otherwise inaccessible due to habitat fragmentation including physical barriers within the river network e g dams or weirs to model these excess zero densities a bernoulli distributed random variable is introduced 6 π i zero bernoulli logit α zero k 1 k x i k zero β k zero if π i zero equals one the zero inflated fish density ρ i at a site is zero 7 ρ i 1 π i zero ρ i this zero component is similar to a logistic regression applied to presence absence observations i e a generalized linear model with a logistic link function note that although we distinguish between environmental variables for the count and zero components in our model structure an explanatory variable may be included in both components 2 3 4 the observation process to link the fish density with the observations the model includes an observation process the mean number of fish n i that can be potentially caught at a site is the product of the zero inflated fish density ρ i and the fished area a i m2 8 n i ρ i a i however the number of fish that are actually caught is influenced by the number of sampling rounds n i rounds and the taxon specific probability p catch of catching an individual the expected total number of individuals to catch in a sample is calculated as 9 n i catch n i 1 1 p catch n i rounds the randomness of the catch procedure is often modeled with a poisson or negative binomial distribution because we cannot exclude the possibility of overdispersion martin et al 2005 zuur et al 2009 the observations are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution 10 n i catch n b n i catch ϑ i with a mean of n i catch and the dispersion parameter ϑ i the dispersion parameter ϑ i is given by n i catch ϕ 1 where ϕ is a parameter inferred from the data because of the zero inflation the modelled distribution of the number of fish caught at each site can be bimodal as illustrated in fig 4 at some sites a qualitative fishing method was applied which provides only presence absence data absence observations correspond to n i catch 0 and presence observations correspond to n i catch 0 hence qualitative presence observations contribute to the likelihood function with p n i catch 0 1 p n i catch 0 2 4 model performance we evaluated the performance of the presence absence and zero inflated model for each taxon by quantifying a the quality of fit of each model during calibration using all samples in the data and b the predictive performance of each model during k fold cross validation the quality of fit and predictive performance of the models is quantified with the metrics defined below 2 4 1 quality of fit assuming independent observations the likelihood of the presence absence model is l pam i 1 i p y i obs α β and the likelihood of the zero inflated model l zim i 1 i p n i catch θ where θ represents all zim parameters α zero β zero α count β count p c atch ϑ because the number of observations i may vary across taxa we standardize the likelihoods l l 1 i the quality of fit of a model is quantified by the ratio of the standardized likelihood of the proposed model i e including the environmental variables and their respective parameters and the likelihood of the simpler null model i e a model including only the intercepts α zero and α count l ratio l proposed l null this quantity expresses how much more likely an observation is on average based on the proposed model compared to the null model alternatively the quality of fit of the pam for each taxon can be quantified using the standardized deviance of the model predictions from the presence absence observations d 2 l o g l the explanatory power of the environmental variables selected as model inputs in the presence absence model for a taxon can be assessed using the d 2 statistic similar in interpretation to the r 2 of a linear model assuming a normally distributed response see guisan and zimmermann 2000 the d 2 is calculated as the fraction of null model i e a model with only an intercept α deviance that is reduced by the proposed model deviance d 2 d null d proposed d null we did not use the deviance or d 2 for the zims because it is not clear how to specify the saturated model millar 2011 instead we quantify the quality of fit of the zims using the log likelihood log l of the proposed model and the likelihood ratios l ratio 2 4 2 predictive performance we quantified the predictive performance of the pam and zim for each taxon by k fold cross validation in k fold cross validation we randomly partition the full dataset into k subsets calibrate the proposed and null pam or zim to every combination of k 1 folds and obtain model predictions from the independent subsample k the predictive performance of the model over the independent subsamples is then quantified by the total log likelihood of the k testing data sets divided by the number of observations we chose k 5 to obtain sufficiently large sample sizes during prediction on the independent data not used to calibrate the model that ensure more robust estimates of predictive performance in addition for the pams we calculated the average explanatory power d 2 over the k folds during calibration and prediction on independent data in calculating the mean explanatory power during prediction the null model is calibrated using the independent subsample the performance of the zims during cross validation was furthermore quantified with the standardized likelihood ratio l ratio for testing and training data over all folds 2 5 variable selection 2 5 1 preparation of potential variables based on the mechanistic conceptual models we developed for each fish taxon we selected potential variables for which data was available or which we could indirectly derive from existing data an inspection of the pearson correlations r between the potential variables revealed no strong correlations i e r 0 7 see section 1 2 in the si for the pairwise correlations among potential variable for all samples with the exception of the stream width and depth variability below see table 3 as potential explanatory variables we included the habitat conditions e g substrate flow velocity at each site table 3 in addition we performed extensive spatial analyses of the river network to quantify the accessible habitat area available from each site at multiple spatial scales 1 10 km at 1 km intervals however due to strong collinearity we used a maximum distance of 2 km for variable selection as well as the accessibility of nearby lakes by taking into account natural and artificial barriers as impassable obstacles in our analyses we obtained estimates of the maximum morning stream temperature in summer i e annual morning maximum in each accessible reach from a simple linear model see table 3 for details and calculated the mean within the spatially accessible habitat area we included a quadratic term temp2 to model taxa that prefer intermediate stream temperatures and respond negatively to both low and high temperatures similar to our spatial analysis of stream temperature we used available data from stream morphology assessments bafu 2006 throughout the river network to quantify the mean morphological state of reaches accessible from the sampled sites the spatial network analysis was implemented in esri s arcgis 10 7 with additional post processing performed using the sf package pebesma et al 2020 in the r statistical computing environment ver 3 6 r core team 2020 2 5 2 selecting variables based on predictive performance to select a set of environmental variables from table 3 that maximize the predictive performance of the presence absence and zero inflated model for each taxon we performed an exhaustive search procedure that combines a best subsets regression analysis james et al 2013 with 5 fold cross validation during this procedure we constructed models containing all possible combinations of p parameters while excluding models with pearson correlations r 0 7 from further analysis and applied 5 fold cross validation to each model for each taxon the exhaustive search was applied to pams with between 1 and 10 potential variables and to zims with between 1 and 4 potential variables testing the predictive performance of the zims was limited to 1 4 potential variables due to the count and zero components in the model structure leading to a large number of combinations of variables in the model that quickly became computationally intractable despite the use of parallelized processing with additional potential variables for the variable selection we used models that do not explicitly account for the observation process to make use of standard r packages that have a short run time see next section during maximum likelihood estimation we identified models with the highest predictive performance based on the total log likelihood during independent predictions over the k folds and verified that parameter estimates of the top three performing models were consistently positive or negative over the five folds 2 6 model implementation and parameter inference throughout most of the model development process we used the r statistical computing environment ver 3 6 r core team 2020 during variable selection the parameters α β j in the presence absence models were identified by maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative weighted least squares algorithm in the glm function in r and using the null model parameters as starting values if the iterative weighted least squares algorithm produced parameter estimates with a proposed model deviance greater than the null model deviance we applied a more robust optimization method with the optim function in r to identify the maximum likelihood solution as in nelder and mead 1965 for the zero inflated models we used the zero inflated negative binomial model implemented in the zeroinfl function of the pscl package zeileis et al 2008 in r the parameters θ were identified by maximum likelihood estimation using the quasi newtonian broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno algorithm implemented in the optim function in r broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 based on the results of our variable selection we implemented the selected pams and zims including the observation process in stan carpenter et al 2017 and accessed it through the r package rstan stan development team 2018 the joint posterior probability distributions of the model parameters were sampled by doing bayesian inference with an adaptive no u turn hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo algorithm brooks et al 2011 duane et al 1987 the prior distributions of the parameters are provided in table 4 we used rather wide priors for the parameters α β ϕ to reflect for our limited prior knowledge 3 results 3 1 variable selection the variable selection procedure provided insight into statistical associations between the occurrence and abundance of taxa and environmental variables during the variable selection procedure of the presence absence models for all taxa the top three models in terms of predictive performance each included stream temperature within the accessible habitat see table 5 the models for cottus spp and phoxinus spp include a quadratic term that leads to a slight curvature of the response curve within the relevant temperature range covered in the data see section 3 3 and si fig 14 fish taxa exhibited consistently positive responses to additional spatially explicit variables such as the accessible habitat area habitatarea and the mean width variability within the accessible habitat area widthvar while two taxa exhibited a negative response to the mean depth variability within the accessible habitat area depthvar contrary to our expectation based on the conceptual models three taxa responded negatively to overhead shelter in fished area hidingspots and four taxa responded negatively to the proportion of forest in the catchment with the exception of barbatula spp the taxon specific responses to agricultural farm and lud and urban land use were negative the top performing zero inflated models of salmo spp include a quadratic term for temperature and negative responses to accessible habitat areas while also revealing consistent positive responses to the proportion of urban land use in the catchment and to the proportion of hiding spots in the fished areas table 6 in contrast the zim models of several other fish taxa include a positive response of the predicted counts to the accessible habitat area and or a negative response to overhead shelter hidingspots the results of the selected zims for barbus spp are not discussed here due to poor model performance compared to the null model see section 3 2 model performance for results and discussion 3 2 model performance the selected presence absence models show a similarly good quality of fit for all taxa except for the widespread salmo spp due to the high explanatory power of the selected environmental variables in each model table 7 moreover the performance of the selected models is quite good during cross validation with only minor decreases in mean explanatory power d 2 and standardized likelihood ratios l ratio during predictions on out of sample testing data for the taxa with intermediate prevalence the explanatory power of the selected environmental variables in the pam lead to models that predict probabilities of occurrence that closely matched the observations and were similar during calibration training and prediction testing of 5 fold cross validation fig 5 the geographic distribution of the predicted probabilities of occurrence of the presence absence models can be used to identify specific sites or regions where the model predictions are consistent with or diverge from the observations see fig 6 for an example for cottus spp and section 1 6 in the si for other taxa the zero inflated models generally performed better than the null model for all taxa except barbus spp as indicated by the likelihood ratios above one for testing data during cross validation table 8 3 3 taxon specific responses the maximum posterior parameter estimates during calibration of the pams for each taxon show taxon specific responses during calibration using all samples table 9 all taxa responded positively to mean maximum morning summer stream temperature within the total accessible habitat temp in the relevant range covered in the data set 9 25 c see figure 14 in the si for the responses of the taxa that include a quadratic term i e cottus spp and phoxinus spp the maximum posterior parameters of the zim models for all taxa for which the model predicted better than the null model are provided in table 10 in addition the marginal posterior parameter distributions of the count and zero components illustrate the uncertainty in the parameter estimates fig 7 for salmo spp and si figures 15 19 for other taxa for example for salmo spp the marginal posterior estimates do not overlap with zero indicating significant responses to the selected environmental conditions this taxon has no variables selected for the zero component the count component shows the strongest response to the accessible habitat area followed by hiding spots temperature squared and urban areas in the catchment the quadratic temperature term leads to a preference for moderate mean maximum morning summer temperatures with an optimum at 18 3 c see figure 14 in the si 4 discussion in this study we set out to model and predict the occurrence and density observations of riverine fish using natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions in a region with a high variation in topography the sites are diverse including alpine streams with mainly hydromorphological alterations and lowland rivers in densely populated areas with intensive agriculture to achieve this aim we developed mechanistic conceptual models of fish autecology to summarize dominant environmental variables that could be included in a statistical species distribution model we then developed a presence absence model and a zero inflated count model for each fish taxon incorporating the observation process i e fishing method and sampling effort fished area into the structure of each model this enabled us to integrate data from different programs and account for the uncertainty of the observation process during calibration 4 1 overall performance in selecting environmental variables to include in the pam and zim for each taxon based on a simplified model our results show that we can explain and predict the occurrences of riverine fish with an intermediate prevalence using a presence absence model rather well by contrast the pam performs poorly for the highly prevalent salmo spp prevalence of 95 the dependence of the pam performance on prevalence is consistent with previous findings sor et al 2017 demonstrating that it is very difficult to predict absence observations for taxa that occur almost everywhere or presence observations for taxa that are very rare with a statistical model that relies on the information content in the data for this reason rare taxa are usually excluded from statistical species distribution models sor et al 2017 the zim predicted reasonably well compared to the null model for most taxa with a likelihood ratio for testing data between 1 1 and 1 6 indicating that the likelihood is 1 1 to 1 6 times larger for the proposed model than for the null model on average for each data point barbus spp was the only taxon with a standardized likelihood ratio below one indicating that the zim model predicts worse than the null model due to overfitting the performance of the zim may be further improved by additional environmental variables that were unavailable for this study by increasing the number of data points with non zero counts for taxa with low prevalence and or by extending the variable selection procedure which was restricted to 1 4 environmental variables due to computational limits but see next sections initially we tested the inclusion of random site effects in the zim to account for uncertainties in the fish densities in addition to uncertainty by patchiness and the observation process fig 3 however the absence of prior information about the variance of the site effects and the variance of the negative binomial distribution for counts led to difficulties identifying these two sources of error due to the low information content in the data we therefore omitted the random site effects from the zim 4 2 taxon specific responses in the models the top ranked pams for all taxa included stream summer morning temperature with consistently positive parameter estimates during cross validation the pams for squalius spp barbus spp phoxinus spp and gobio spp showed clear positive responses to stream temperature that are consistent with existing knowledge of habitat preferences among cyprinids while the positive response of cottus spp in the pam contrasts with the expected optimum temperature of 10 11 c fig si 3 the inferred optimum summer morning temperature for salmo spp around 18 c fig si 14 in the zim is roughly in agreement with prior knowledge jonsson and jonsson 2009 additional spatially explicit habitat conditions appeared frequently in the top ranked models including the mean channel width variability and depth variability within the accessible habitat the negative responses of barbus spp and phoxinus spp to depth variability and concurrent positive responses to width variability should be interpreted with care because the correlation between these two variables was close to the threshold of exclusion pearson correlation coefficient of 0 7 see section 1 3 in the si the unexpected negative responses among many taxa to hiding spots in the fished area in the pams suggests that habitats with undercut banks may provide more shelter for piscivorous fish which can negatively impact e g cyprinid fish through increased predation pressure e g walser et al 1999 this is further supported by the positive response of salmo spp abundance to hiding spots in the zim the total habitat area which is determined by the presence or rather absence of migration barriers had a positive association with the presence and abundance of cottus spp and barbatula spp and a negative association with salmo spp abundance since salmo spp is subject to stocking in switzerland borsuk et al 2006 it is plausible that it is more likely to maintain populations in fragmented habitats as compared to other species and that local extinctions of competitor species may lead to higher densities holmen et al 2003 keeley 2001 previous studies also showed that habitat fragmentation can alter fish community structure in streams e g perkin and gido 2012 the models indicated positive associations between urban land use in the catchment and salmo spp cottus spp phoxinus spp abundance and negative associations with the presence of barbus spp agricultural land use indicators had different effects on taxa presence and abundance in the models while most taxa showed a negative association with the proportion of forest cover in the catchment for example the livestock unit densities had a negative association with phoxinus spp and opposing effects on cottus spp in the pam and the zim the proportion of arable land farm had a negative association with cottus spp and barbus spp presence and positive associations with squalius spp and barbatula spp the latter of which is expected to be tolerant to organic pollution si fig 5 although potential mechanistic pathways that can lead to these responses are known their relative importance is uncertain for example the negative responses of specific fish taxa to arable land use may be attributable to impaired water quality e g organic matter inputs leading to oxygen depletion stream morphology e g clogging with fine sediments or altered stream hydrology while some taxa may profit from higher stream productivity due to nutrient inputs to disentangle these effects more detailed water quality data for the fish monitoring sites would be needed 4 3 conceptual and statistical models the discrepancies between the environmental conditions included in our conceptual and statistical models may arise for two major reasons first our conceptual models are more mechanistic than our statistical models because i we included environmental influence factors in the conceptual models that have a direct mechanistic effect on the selected taxa and regardless of data availability and ii for specific taxa such as salmo spp squalius spp barbus spp barbatula spp the conceptual models are structured according to major fish growth stages despite these differences we acknowledge that our conceptual models may be incomplete or contain a high degree of uncertainty due to limited knowledge of the effects of specific natural environmental influence factors e g prevalence of disease and parasites and anthropogenic influences e g stocking and angling on the development and distribution of specific taxa second not all environmental variables included in the conceptual model could be included in the statistical model due to the limited availability of data e g water quality parameters we used the conceptual models to identify potential environmental variables and selected variables to include in the statistical models i e the pam and zim for each taxon based on the data availability and predictive performance of candidate models differences between the conceptual and statistical model in terms of the selected variables and taxon specific responses may indicate that our prior knowledge in the conceptual model is incorrect or that the explanatory variables are not accurate enough especially those that were estimated from other factors or are only indirectly linked to stressors such as land use for the zim we cannot exclude the possibility that the variable selection procedure was not comprehensive enough because we tested only models with 1 4 explanatory variables due to computational limitations however given that even the relatively simple selected zims led to overfitting for barbus spp this is at least for barbus spp unlikely to be the cause of the poor predictive performance 4 4 improving the zero inflated model additional analysis of the zim is necessary to further improve predictive performance and to identify more intuitive methods of illustrating model performance the standardized likelihood ratios of the zero inflated count models for the testing data during cross validation below one for barbus spp indicate an overfitting of the model despite the low number of parameters included and a failure of the model to predict the counts for independent data points the skewed distribution of observed counts with a long tailing see observed counts in the si already indicates that it will be difficult to predict the few observations with high counts with a rather simple statistical model based on environmental conditions especially if the number of available data points with observations above zero are low increasing the sample size of the observational data to increase the information content relating fish densities to environmental conditions may improve model performance in the future it might be worth trying to model biomass instead of counts fish biomass can be expected to have a more even distribution because observations of high numbers can be caused by a large number of juveniles with low biomass we found that many studies applying zims to fish use information theoretic statistics such as bic and dic to evaluate and select a model e g arab et al 2012 instead of penalizing the likelihood of a candidate model based on increasing model complexity i e adding environmental variables to the model we opted to quantify the performance of the zims using the likelihood during calibration using all samples and 5 fold cross validation while the standardized likelihood ratio indicates how much more likely the observations are in the proposed model relative to the null model it would be valuable to also visualize the results by comparing observations and model predictions however since the zero inflated densities can have a bi modal distribution see fig 4 it is not straightforward to visualize and summarize model predictions e g based on quantiles but see si fig 20 for an attempt to visualize the distributions of the predicted vs observed counts in conclusion the use of conceptual models for the presence absence and densities of fish taxa contributed to the pre selection of environmental variables and the development of statistical models that reflect plausible cause and effect relationships we were able to develop presence absence models for taxa with intermediate prevalence and a zim for the most prevalent taxa that have a reasonable predictive performance incorporating spatially explicit environmental variables and making use of monitoring data with different sampling methods and levels of sampling effort to account for the observation process we have shown that statistical models can indicate potential positive or negative effects of environmental factors on the occurrence and abundance of common riverine fish taxa many of these factors are currently subject to management actions or influenced by global changes examples for such management actions are the removal of barriers to fish migration o hanley et al 2013 the morphological restoration of rivers haase et al 2013 and changes in agricultural practices to reduce pesticide and nutrient inputs acero triana et al 2021 the models developed in this study are far from able to accurately predict the effect of a specific management action on a local fish community which would additionally require considerations of the colonization potential biotic interactions and less common taxa still this study may help to adjust expectations towards management actions under changing environmental conditions for example according to our results increasing stream temperatures can be expected to increase the occurrence of most common fish species while the removal of barriers and increased morphological variability could lead to a species turn over with this attempt for mechanistically inspired statistical models we hope to encourage the use of increasingly available fish biomonitoring

24567,statistical species distribution models sdms are widely used to quantify how taxa respond to environmental conditions and to predict their distribution however the application of sdms to freshwater fish taxa is complicated by the active dispersal of fish taxa through river networks and the species and habitat dependent observation process i e the sampling method and effort required to accurately sample their distributions many studies have applied presence absence models pams to fish taxa while more recent studies have proposed zero inflated models zims to account for count observations with many zeroes however relatively few studies have incorporated the observation process into the model structure which would facilitate the combination of data from various monitoring programs that differ in their observation process in this study we use conceptual models to identify potentially dominant natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions with a direct mechanistic effect on the distributions of freshwater fish taxa in switzerland a region with a large range of environmental conditions from alpine streams that are mainly affected by hydromorphological alterations to lowland streams in densely populated areas with intensive agricultural land use moreover numerous barriers impede fish migration along the entire river network using combined data from two fish monitoring programs in switzerland we applied an exhaustive cross validation procedure to select a set of environmental variables with the highest out of sample predictive performance for the pam and zim for fish density individuals m2 of the seven most prevalent fish taxa salmo spp cottus spp squalius spp barbatula spp barbus spp phoxinus spp gobio spp we used these variables to develop a pam and zim for each taxon that accounts for differences in sampling methods and sampling effort we quantified the quality of fit during calibration using all samples and predictive performance during 5 fold cross validation of each model results show that stream temperature and stream morphology within the accessible habitat commonly appear among the best predictive presence absence models for multiple taxa spatial variables that account for migration barriers and quantify morphological conditions within the accessible habitat were selected for 6 out of 7 taxa the selected pams performed well for all taxa with an intermediate prevalence 10 40 with an explanatory power d 2 of between 0 32 0 37 during calibration using all samples and only minor decreases in explanatory power during cross validation d 2 0 34 0 44 as expected the pam for the highly prevalent salmo spp 91 failed to predict the few absence data points by contrast the zim model performed best for salmo spp with a standardized likelihood ratio of 1 56 for all other taxa besides barbus spp the zim models also had likelihood ratios above one indicating a better predictive performance than the null model we hope this study stimulates the development and application of fish species distribution models based on prior knowledge of causally linked environmental variables and incorporating observation errors to improve their predictive performance this can facilitate learning from biomonitoring data to support management 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems such as lakes and rivers are rich in biodiversity however over exploitation places freshwater ecosystems at greater risk of habitat destruction and degradation than their terrestrial and marine counterparts dudgeon et al 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 within the european union nearly half 47 of lakes and rivers failed to achieve a good ecological status in 2015 as defined by the eu water framework directive using indicators of the quality of biological communities with many freshwater species either increasingly threatened or endangered including mammals birds fish insects and other invertebrate communities fish species in europe are of particular concern with 37 of the 547 native species listed as threatened or endangered and 17 of species populations in decline brooks and freyhof 2011 the main anthropogenic threats to europe s freshwater fish species are the destruction degradation and fragmentation of habitat due to the channelization of natural river courses pollution from intensive agriculture and urban areas the construction of dams and water abstraction gozlan et al 2019 studies have emphasized the need for additional biomonitoring efforts to more accurately characterize the geographic distribution and population trends of freshwater fish species to 1 improve future risk assessments 2 identify underlying environmental drivers of species distributions and 3 better inform stream management gozlan et al 2019 vörösmarty et al 2010 accurately assessing the total population of a fish species in a given river length can be difficult due to the active dispersal capabilities of fish e g relative to benthic macroinvertebrates and the observation error inherent to imperfect fish sampling methods electrofishing is perhaps the most common fishing method for stream biomonitoring and involves passing a high voltage current through a length of river to stun fish for easy collection and analysis additional sampling efforts may increase the proportion of fish caught i e reducing observation error including the placement of nets at the start and end points of the fished area to prevent individual fish from escaping prior to sampling and performing multiple electrofishing passes or rounds to accurately quantify the number of individuals in a reach multiple fishing rounds can provide particularly useful data for fisheries management including population estimates that can be derived based on the number of fish captured in successive fishing rounds and on prior knowledge of the probability of capturing an individual of a given species e g carle and strub 1978 in obtaining presence absence and abundance i e count observations from biomonitoring data studies over the past two decades have applied statistical species distribution models sdms to quantify how observed distributions of species respond to a range of natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions techniques in statistical and machine learning have been applied ranging from classical statistical models such as generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams e g fukushima et al 2007 olden and jackson 2002 to machine learning algorithms such as random forests and boosted regression trees chee and elith 2012 maloney et al 2013 environmental conditions used as explanatory variables in fish sdms include topography e g elevation bond et al 2011 soil and geology e g maloney et al 2012 climatic variability e g temperature precipitation creque et al 2005 mcnyset 2005 hydrological regime e g flow velocity discharge bond et al 2011 mcnyset 2005 and habitat quality e g substrates hiding spots creque et al 2005 anthropogenic impacts due to land use e g agriculture urban areas impaired river morphology and to a lesser extent habitat fragmentation due to barriers e g distance to barriers such as dams radinger et al 2017 2019 rolls et al 2014 have been incorporated into fish sdms to quantify the effect of explanatory variables at multiple spatial scales chee and elith 2012 peterson et al 2011 the importance of including environmental conditions that have a direct mechanistic effect on species distributions has been emphasized as a means to improve model interpretability and to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying species distributions austin 2002 this principle is difficult to implement in practice due to limited data availability but is especially important when the models are intended to inform stream management moreover the presence absence and abundance i e count observations of fish species distributions often exhibit statistical properties that pose additional challenges when applying classical statistical sdms studies applying sdms in wider ecological contexts often assume species presence absence or count observations to follow a binomial or poisson distribution respectively however count distributions of fish may exhibit overdispersion i e the variance is greater than the mean due to a patchy distribution of individuals the poisson distribution assumes that its mean and variance are equal which yields biased parameter estimates when used to model overdispersed counts martin et al 2005 zuur et al 2009 typically the negative binomial distribution is used to account for overdispersion e g warton 2005 but may still be inadequate for explaining overdispersed counts with excess zeroes potts and elith 2006 to model counts of species exhibiting overdispersion and many zeroes zero inflated models 1 1 although early ecological applications of zero inflated models are highlighted zero inflated distributions were first proposed by aitchison 1955 and later applied by lambert 1992 zims have been proposed that effectively combine a binary outcome model i e with a bernoulli distribution that predicts excess zeroes with a model for count data i e following a poisson or negative binomial distribution martin et al 2005 wenger and freeman 2008 zuur et al 2009 zims have been applied to marine fish species for some time e g stefánsson 1996 often with the aim of better informing fish stock assessments and fisheries management cosandey godin et al 2014 thorson et al 2016 walsh and brodziak 2015 more recently zims have been applied to freshwater fish with initial studies comparing the performance of classical statistical techniques with their zero inflated counterparts lewin et al 2010 vaudor et al 2011 increasingly sophisticated applications of zims have been proposed to model freshwater fish distributions including models that include species observations with multiple size classes kanno et al 2012 account for non linear responses of species to environmental conditions arab et al 2012 and quantify environmental conditions at multiple spatial scales stewart koster et al 2013 hierarchical model structures have also been proposed to account for spatial autocorrelation among environmental conditions due to the hierarchical structure of the river network boone et al 2012 however while studies applying zims to marine fish observations have incorporated the observation process i e the equipment used and sampling effort into their proposed models there are relatively few studies that propose similar models for freshwater species wildhaber et al 2012 in this study our overarching aim is to develop conceptual models of fish autecology and use them to develop statistical models of fish species distributions i e fish sdms more concretely we develop conceptual models to summarize our prior knowledge of dominant natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions that have a direct mechanistic effect on freshwater fish species we then propose two distinct statistical models to predict the occurrence of different fish taxa namely a presence absence model pam and a zero inflated model zim to predict fish density i e fish count per unit area fished respectively although we use the conceptual models to identify environmental conditions that can potentially be included as explanatory variables in the statistical models we ultimately select explanatory variables among these that provide the best predictive performance for each species in pursuing the overarching aim of this study we address the following research questions 1 to what extent can we predict the occurrence and density of freshwater fish in a region with a large range of environmental conditions from densely populated areas with intensive agriculture to alpine regions based on currently available data from different monitoring programs and based on different fish sampling methods 2 which of the available environmental variables are most important for predicting occurrence and density of the most common fish taxa and do they reflect prior knowledge in developing the pams and zims for multiple fish taxa we combine several innovations we include the observation process in the structure of the statistical models to combine observational data collected using different sampling methods i e with qualitative semi quantitative and quantitative fishing in classical approaches e g carle and strub 1978 the true density of fish is estimated from repeated samplings these estimates are then used to calibrate a model for the true density in our approach the measurement process is included in the model which predicts the true density as internal state and provides the estimated fish caught as additional model output this makes it possible to consider all sources of uncertainty during the calibration process the same applies for occurrence in the pam in addition we quantify habitat fragmentation due to natural and anthropogenic barriers in the river network and influence factors that act at different spatial scales e g reach and accessible area with this study we explore what we can learn from model based analysis of currently available biomonitoring data and identify limitations and gaps to support river management 2 material and methods 2 1 observational data we combined data from the swiss national surface water quality monitoring program nawa kunz et al 2016 and the progetto fiumi program brodersen and seehausen 2014 table 1 both programs aim to describe fish community structure in swiss streams and rivers through quantitative semi quantitative or qualitative electrofishing sites in the progetto fiumi program were chosen to include all swiss drainages and the entire altitudinal gradient which are habituated by fish 203 2297 m a s l during quantitative sampling block nets were installed at the start and end points of the fished reach and two or three rounds of fishing were done with all fish caught included in the sample data and thus allowing for population estimates of individual taxa semi quantitative fishing was similar to quantitative fishing efforts but without the use of block nets and a single round of fishing during qualitative sampling one fishing round was done along a reach without the use of nets in qualitative sampling the reach was not entirely fished and not all captured fish were included in the data but all captured taxa were recorded in total 55 species were recorded as the taxonomic status of several of the most important riverine fish in central europe is currently being revised e g kottelat and freyhof 2007 lucek et al 2018 palandačić et al 2017 and species specific field records are therefore often unreliable we aggregated all species at the genus level see si section 1 1 for further explanations based on the combined progetto fiumi and nawa data we derived the abundance i e count and presence absence observations of fish taxa in each sample due to the difficulty of modeling rare taxa guisan et al 2006 potts and elith 2006 sor et al 2017 we selected seven taxa that occur in 10 or more of all samples table 2 for model development 2 2 conceptual model based on literature sources and consultations with biologists on the autecology of the selected fish taxa we developed conceptual models that show the current knowledge about dominant natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions that drive the distribution of fish taxa throughout their major life stages see fig 1 for salmo spp and si section 1 4 for similar conceptual models for additional taxa the main goal of these conceptual models is to inspire the development of statistical models based on causally linked explanatory variables to the degree possible schuwirth et al 2019 we included environmental conditions and processes in the conceptual models regardless of their data availability e g fish stocking impacts of angling on fish populations predation while acknowledging that numerous additional factors for which there is little or no available data could also be included e g prevalence of parasites and proliferative kidney disease effects of hydropeaking however the lack of data for specific environmental conditions e g water quality variables such as fine sediment loading does not exclude the possibility of indirectly quantifying their effect on the distribution of fish taxa e g by including agricultural land use indicators as explanatory variables in our statistical models 2 3 model definition in this section we introduce two statistical models first a presence absence model that takes observation errors into account and second a model that predicts the fish density i e the number of individuals per square meter at a site but is calibrated on the observed counts i e abundance of a given fish taxon both models include an observation process based on the fishing method in the model structure for all model definitions the following indices are used sites i 1 i time of sampling at site i t i 1 t i explanatory variables k 1 k the time point of sampling t i at a site is needed to represent the 11 of sites that are repeatedly fished however for simplicity we omit this index when defining the presence absence and zero inflated models 2 3 1 presence absence model the pam consists of two parts a generalized linear model that predicts the probability of occurrence of a given fish taxon based on environmental conditions and an observation model that describes the probability of observing the taxon based on its probability of occurrence the number of fishing rounds and the probability of catching and correctly identifying an individual that is present the model structure is visualized as a network in fig 2 the presence or absence of a fish taxon at site i is encoded by the variable y i which equals one if the taxon is present or zero if the taxon is absent we describe the presence absence observations with a conventional logistic regression 1 y i bernoulli π i where the probability of occurrence π i is given by 2 π i 1 exp α k 1 k x i k β k 1 with the intercept α selected environmental conditions as explanatory variables x i k and coefficients β k that quantify the taxon specific responses to the environmental conditions it is a common approach to derive observations of y i directly from count data however counting fish is prone to errors due to the incomplete sampling of all individuals present and potential misidentification of taxa to represent this in the model we make a distinction between the presence absence observations y i obs which are based on the count data and the true presence absence of a taxon y i an observation model links the two variables 3 p y i obs y i bernoulli ω i ω i p true i if y i 1 p false i if y i 0 the probability to catch at least one individual at site i is represented by the true positive probability p true i this probability is derived from a taxon specific probability p catch of catching an individual and the number of fishing rounds n i rounds 4 p true i n p y i obs 1 p catch n i rounds n p n n 1 1 p catch n i rounds n p n this derivation requires the distribution of the number of fish p n which was approximated with the empirical distribution of the count data across all sites there is also a typically low probability that a taxon is erroneously observed due to misidentification this is modeled by the false positive probability p false the two probabilities p catch and p false are based on expert judgment and not inferred from the data 2 3 2 fish density model the zim predicts the number of observed fish based on a zero inflated distribution for the fish density and an observation model that accounts for the fished area the number of fishing rounds and the catch probability fig 3 for a given taxon the fish density ρ i i e the number of fish per square meter at a site i is modeled by two components i a linear combination of the environmental explanatory variables x i k count with parameters α count and β k count i e the count component zeileis et al 2008 and ii a normally distributed site specific random effect i this results in 5 ρ i exp α count k 1 k x i k count β k count i with i n 0 σ the site effect i can be interpreted as a residual term and would be included to quantify the intrinsic uncertainty of the fish density at each site due to environmental conditions not included in the model or due to biotic interactions despite this appealing interpretation we eventually decided to omit the site effects because of the difficulty of defining appropriate informative priors which would be needed to avoid identifiability problems during parameter estimation see discussion 2 3 3 including zero inflation with the exception of salmo spp other taxa include observations with a large proportion of zero counts si fig 1 more than what can be explained by the selected environmental variables for fish density these excess zeros can arise if the taxon is absent at the time of sampling a site or the limited area fished relative to the spatial and temporal scale of the species movements martin et al 2005 alternatively the habitat conditions at a site may be suitable for the ecological preferences of a taxon but is otherwise inaccessible due to habitat fragmentation including physical barriers within the river network e g dams or weirs to model these excess zero densities a bernoulli distributed random variable is introduced 6 π i zero bernoulli logit α zero k 1 k x i k zero β k zero if π i zero equals one the zero inflated fish density ρ i at a site is zero 7 ρ i 1 π i zero ρ i this zero component is similar to a logistic regression applied to presence absence observations i e a generalized linear model with a logistic link function note that although we distinguish between environmental variables for the count and zero components in our model structure an explanatory variable may be included in both components 2 3 4 the observation process to link the fish density with the observations the model includes an observation process the mean number of fish n i that can be potentially caught at a site is the product of the zero inflated fish density ρ i and the fished area a i m2 8 n i ρ i a i however the number of fish that are actually caught is influenced by the number of sampling rounds n i rounds and the taxon specific probability p catch of catching an individual the expected total number of individuals to catch in a sample is calculated as 9 n i catch n i 1 1 p catch n i rounds the randomness of the catch procedure is often modeled with a poisson or negative binomial distribution because we cannot exclude the possibility of overdispersion martin et al 2005 zuur et al 2009 the observations are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution 10 n i catch n b n i catch ϑ i with a mean of n i catch and the dispersion parameter ϑ i the dispersion parameter ϑ i is given by n i catch ϕ 1 where ϕ is a parameter inferred from the data because of the zero inflation the modelled distribution of the number of fish caught at each site can be bimodal as illustrated in fig 4 at some sites a qualitative fishing method was applied which provides only presence absence data absence observations correspond to n i catch 0 and presence observations correspond to n i catch 0 hence qualitative presence observations contribute to the likelihood function with p n i catch 0 1 p n i catch 0 2 4 model performance we evaluated the performance of the presence absence and zero inflated model for each taxon by quantifying a the quality of fit of each model during calibration using all samples in the data and b the predictive performance of each model during k fold cross validation the quality of fit and predictive performance of the models is quantified with the metrics defined below 2 4 1 quality of fit assuming independent observations the likelihood of the presence absence model is l pam i 1 i p y i obs α β and the likelihood of the zero inflated model l zim i 1 i p n i catch θ where θ represents all zim parameters α zero β zero α count β count p c atch ϑ because the number of observations i may vary across taxa we standardize the likelihoods l l 1 i the quality of fit of a model is quantified by the ratio of the standardized likelihood of the proposed model i e including the environmental variables and their respective parameters and the likelihood of the simpler null model i e a model including only the intercepts α zero and α count l ratio l proposed l null this quantity expresses how much more likely an observation is on average based on the proposed model compared to the null model alternatively the quality of fit of the pam for each taxon can be quantified using the standardized deviance of the model predictions from the presence absence observations d 2 l o g l the explanatory power of the environmental variables selected as model inputs in the presence absence model for a taxon can be assessed using the d 2 statistic similar in interpretation to the r 2 of a linear model assuming a normally distributed response see guisan and zimmermann 2000 the d 2 is calculated as the fraction of null model i e a model with only an intercept α deviance that is reduced by the proposed model deviance d 2 d null d proposed d null we did not use the deviance or d 2 for the zims because it is not clear how to specify the saturated model millar 2011 instead we quantify the quality of fit of the zims using the log likelihood log l of the proposed model and the likelihood ratios l ratio 2 4 2 predictive performance we quantified the predictive performance of the pam and zim for each taxon by k fold cross validation in k fold cross validation we randomly partition the full dataset into k subsets calibrate the proposed and null pam or zim to every combination of k 1 folds and obtain model predictions from the independent subsample k the predictive performance of the model over the independent subsamples is then quantified by the total log likelihood of the k testing data sets divided by the number of observations we chose k 5 to obtain sufficiently large sample sizes during prediction on the independent data not used to calibrate the model that ensure more robust estimates of predictive performance in addition for the pams we calculated the average explanatory power d 2 over the k folds during calibration and prediction on independent data in calculating the mean explanatory power during prediction the null model is calibrated using the independent subsample the performance of the zims during cross validation was furthermore quantified with the standardized likelihood ratio l ratio for testing and training data over all folds 2 5 variable selection 2 5 1 preparation of potential variables based on the mechanistic conceptual models we developed for each fish taxon we selected potential variables for which data was available or which we could indirectly derive from existing data an inspection of the pearson correlations r between the potential variables revealed no strong correlations i e r 0 7 see section 1 2 in the si for the pairwise correlations among potential variable for all samples with the exception of the stream width and depth variability below see table 3 as potential explanatory variables we included the habitat conditions e g substrate flow velocity at each site table 3 in addition we performed extensive spatial analyses of the river network to quantify the accessible habitat area available from each site at multiple spatial scales 1 10 km at 1 km intervals however due to strong collinearity we used a maximum distance of 2 km for variable selection as well as the accessibility of nearby lakes by taking into account natural and artificial barriers as impassable obstacles in our analyses we obtained estimates of the maximum morning stream temperature in summer i e annual morning maximum in each accessible reach from a simple linear model see table 3 for details and calculated the mean within the spatially accessible habitat area we included a quadratic term temp2 to model taxa that prefer intermediate stream temperatures and respond negatively to both low and high temperatures similar to our spatial analysis of stream temperature we used available data from stream morphology assessments bafu 2006 throughout the river network to quantify the mean morphological state of reaches accessible from the sampled sites the spatial network analysis was implemented in esri s arcgis 10 7 with additional post processing performed using the sf package pebesma et al 2020 in the r statistical computing environment ver 3 6 r core team 2020 2 5 2 selecting variables based on predictive performance to select a set of environmental variables from table 3 that maximize the predictive performance of the presence absence and zero inflated model for each taxon we performed an exhaustive search procedure that combines a best subsets regression analysis james et al 2013 with 5 fold cross validation during this procedure we constructed models containing all possible combinations of p parameters while excluding models with pearson correlations r 0 7 from further analysis and applied 5 fold cross validation to each model for each taxon the exhaustive search was applied to pams with between 1 and 10 potential variables and to zims with between 1 and 4 potential variables testing the predictive performance of the zims was limited to 1 4 potential variables due to the count and zero components in the model structure leading to a large number of combinations of variables in the model that quickly became computationally intractable despite the use of parallelized processing with additional potential variables for the variable selection we used models that do not explicitly account for the observation process to make use of standard r packages that have a short run time see next section during maximum likelihood estimation we identified models with the highest predictive performance based on the total log likelihood during independent predictions over the k folds and verified that parameter estimates of the top three performing models were consistently positive or negative over the five folds 2 6 model implementation and parameter inference throughout most of the model development process we used the r statistical computing environment ver 3 6 r core team 2020 during variable selection the parameters α β j in the presence absence models were identified by maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative weighted least squares algorithm in the glm function in r and using the null model parameters as starting values if the iterative weighted least squares algorithm produced parameter estimates with a proposed model deviance greater than the null model deviance we applied a more robust optimization method with the optim function in r to identify the maximum likelihood solution as in nelder and mead 1965 for the zero inflated models we used the zero inflated negative binomial model implemented in the zeroinfl function of the pscl package zeileis et al 2008 in r the parameters θ were identified by maximum likelihood estimation using the quasi newtonian broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno algorithm implemented in the optim function in r broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 based on the results of our variable selection we implemented the selected pams and zims including the observation process in stan carpenter et al 2017 and accessed it through the r package rstan stan development team 2018 the joint posterior probability distributions of the model parameters were sampled by doing bayesian inference with an adaptive no u turn hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo algorithm brooks et al 2011 duane et al 1987 the prior distributions of the parameters are provided in table 4 we used rather wide priors for the parameters α β ϕ to reflect for our limited prior knowledge 3 results 3 1 variable selection the variable selection procedure provided insight into statistical associations between the occurrence and abundance of taxa and environmental variables during the variable selection procedure of the presence absence models for all taxa the top three models in terms of predictive performance each included stream temperature within the accessible habitat see table 5 the models for cottus spp and phoxinus spp include a quadratic term that leads to a slight curvature of the response curve within the relevant temperature range covered in the data see section 3 3 and si fig 14 fish taxa exhibited consistently positive responses to additional spatially explicit variables such as the accessible habitat area habitatarea and the mean width variability within the accessible habitat area widthvar while two taxa exhibited a negative response to the mean depth variability within the accessible habitat area depthvar contrary to our expectation based on the conceptual models three taxa responded negatively to overhead shelter in fished area hidingspots and four taxa responded negatively to the proportion of forest in the catchment with the exception of barbatula spp the taxon specific responses to agricultural farm and lud and urban land use were negative the top performing zero inflated models of salmo spp include a quadratic term for temperature and negative responses to accessible habitat areas while also revealing consistent positive responses to the proportion of urban land use in the catchment and to the proportion of hiding spots in the fished areas table 6 in contrast the zim models of several other fish taxa include a positive response of the predicted counts to the accessible habitat area and or a negative response to overhead shelter hidingspots the results of the selected zims for barbus spp are not discussed here due to poor model performance compared to the null model see section 3 2 model performance for results and discussion 3 2 model performance the selected presence absence models show a similarly good quality of fit for all taxa except for the widespread salmo spp due to the high explanatory power of the selected environmental variables in each model table 7 moreover the performance of the selected models is quite good during cross validation with only minor decreases in mean explanatory power d 2 and standardized likelihood ratios l ratio during predictions on out of sample testing data for the taxa with intermediate prevalence the explanatory power of the selected environmental variables in the pam lead to models that predict probabilities of occurrence that closely matched the observations and were similar during calibration training and prediction testing of 5 fold cross validation fig 5 the geographic distribution of the predicted probabilities of occurrence of the presence absence models can be used to identify specific sites or regions where the model predictions are consistent with or diverge from the observations see fig 6 for an example for cottus spp and section 1 6 in the si for other taxa the zero inflated models generally performed better than the null model for all taxa except barbus spp as indicated by the likelihood ratios above one for testing data during cross validation table 8 3 3 taxon specific responses the maximum posterior parameter estimates during calibration of the pams for each taxon show taxon specific responses during calibration using all samples table 9 all taxa responded positively to mean maximum morning summer stream temperature within the total accessible habitat temp in the relevant range covered in the data set 9 25 c see figure 14 in the si for the responses of the taxa that include a quadratic term i e cottus spp and phoxinus spp the maximum posterior parameters of the zim models for all taxa for which the model predicted better than the null model are provided in table 10 in addition the marginal posterior parameter distributions of the count and zero components illustrate the uncertainty in the parameter estimates fig 7 for salmo spp and si figures 15 19 for other taxa for example for salmo spp the marginal posterior estimates do not overlap with zero indicating significant responses to the selected environmental conditions this taxon has no variables selected for the zero component the count component shows the strongest response to the accessible habitat area followed by hiding spots temperature squared and urban areas in the catchment the quadratic temperature term leads to a preference for moderate mean maximum morning summer temperatures with an optimum at 18 3 c see figure 14 in the si 4 discussion in this study we set out to model and predict the occurrence and density observations of riverine fish using natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions in a region with a high variation in topography the sites are diverse including alpine streams with mainly hydromorphological alterations and lowland rivers in densely populated areas with intensive agriculture to achieve this aim we developed mechanistic conceptual models of fish autecology to summarize dominant environmental variables that could be included in a statistical species distribution model we then developed a presence absence model and a zero inflated count model for each fish taxon incorporating the observation process i e fishing method and sampling effort fished area into the structure of each model this enabled us to integrate data from different programs and account for the uncertainty of the observation process during calibration 4 1 overall performance in selecting environmental variables to include in the pam and zim for each taxon based on a simplified model our results show that we can explain and predict the occurrences of riverine fish with an intermediate prevalence using a presence absence model rather well by contrast the pam performs poorly for the highly prevalent salmo spp prevalence of 95 the dependence of the pam performance on prevalence is consistent with previous findings sor et al 2017 demonstrating that it is very difficult to predict absence observations for taxa that occur almost everywhere or presence observations for taxa that are very rare with a statistical model that relies on the information content in the data for this reason rare taxa are usually excluded from statistical species distribution models sor et al 2017 the zim predicted reasonably well compared to the null model for most taxa with a likelihood ratio for testing data between 1 1 and 1 6 indicating that the likelihood is 1 1 to 1 6 times larger for the proposed model than for the null model on average for each data point barbus spp was the only taxon with a standardized likelihood ratio below one indicating that the zim model predicts worse than the null model due to overfitting the performance of the zim may be further improved by additional environmental variables that were unavailable for this study by increasing the number of data points with non zero counts for taxa with low prevalence and or by extending the variable selection procedure which was restricted to 1 4 environmental variables due to computational limits but see next sections initially we tested the inclusion of random site effects in the zim to account for uncertainties in the fish densities in addition to uncertainty by patchiness and the observation process fig 3 however the absence of prior information about the variance of the site effects and the variance of the negative binomial distribution for counts led to difficulties identifying these two sources of error due to the low information content in the data we therefore omitted the random site effects from the zim 4 2 taxon specific responses in the models the top ranked pams for all taxa included stream summer morning temperature with consistently positive parameter estimates during cross validation the pams for squalius spp barbus spp phoxinus spp and gobio spp showed clear positive responses to stream temperature that are consistent with existing knowledge of habitat preferences among cyprinids while the positive response of cottus spp in the pam contrasts with the expected optimum temperature of 10 11 c fig si 3 the inferred optimum summer morning temperature for salmo spp around 18 c fig si 14 in the zim is roughly in agreement with prior knowledge jonsson and jonsson 2009 additional spatially explicit habitat conditions appeared frequently in the top ranked models including the mean channel width variability and depth variability within the accessible habitat the negative responses of barbus spp and phoxinus spp to depth variability and concurrent positive responses to width variability should be interpreted with care because the correlation between these two variables was close to the threshold of exclusion pearson correlation coefficient of 0 7 see section 1 3 in the si the unexpected negative responses among many taxa to hiding spots in the fished area in the pams suggests that habitats with undercut banks may provide more shelter for piscivorous fish which can negatively impact e g cyprinid fish through increased predation pressure e g walser et al 1999 this is further supported by the positive response of salmo spp abundance to hiding spots in the zim the total habitat area which is determined by the presence or rather absence of migration barriers had a positive association with the presence and abundance of cottus spp and barbatula spp and a negative association with salmo spp abundance since salmo spp is subject to stocking in switzerland borsuk et al 2006 it is plausible that it is more likely to maintain populations in fragmented habitats as compared to other species and that local extinctions of competitor species may lead to higher densities holmen et al 2003 keeley 2001 previous studies also showed that habitat fragmentation can alter fish community structure in streams e g perkin and gido 2012 the models indicated positive associations between urban land use in the catchment and salmo spp cottus spp phoxinus spp abundance and negative associations with the presence of barbus spp agricultural land use indicators had different effects on taxa presence and abundance in the models while most taxa showed a negative association with the proportion of forest cover in the catchment for example the livestock unit densities had a negative association with phoxinus spp and opposing effects on cottus spp in the pam and the zim the proportion of arable land farm had a negative association with cottus spp and barbus spp presence and positive associations with squalius spp and barbatula spp the latter of which is expected to be tolerant to organic pollution si fig 5 although potential mechanistic pathways that can lead to these responses are known their relative importance is uncertain for example the negative responses of specific fish taxa to arable land use may be attributable to impaired water quality e g organic matter inputs leading to oxygen depletion stream morphology e g clogging with fine sediments or altered stream hydrology while some taxa may profit from higher stream productivity due to nutrient inputs to disentangle these effects more detailed water quality data for the fish monitoring sites would be needed 4 3 conceptual and statistical models the discrepancies between the environmental conditions included in our conceptual and statistical models may arise for two major reasons first our conceptual models are more mechanistic than our statistical models because i we included environmental influence factors in the conceptual models that have a direct mechanistic effect on the selected taxa and regardless of data availability and ii for specific taxa such as salmo spp squalius spp barbus spp barbatula spp the conceptual models are structured according to major fish growth stages despite these differences we acknowledge that our conceptual models may be incomplete or contain a high degree of uncertainty due to limited knowledge of the effects of specific natural environmental influence factors e g prevalence of disease and parasites and anthropogenic influences e g stocking and angling on the development and distribution of specific taxa second not all environmental variables included in the conceptual model could be included in the statistical model due to the limited availability of data e g water quality parameters we used the conceptual models to identify potential environmental variables and selected variables to include in the statistical models i e the pam and zim for each taxon based on the data availability and predictive performance of candidate models differences between the conceptual and statistical model in terms of the selected variables and taxon specific responses may indicate that our prior knowledge in the conceptual model is incorrect or that the explanatory variables are not accurate enough especially those that were estimated from other factors or are only indirectly linked to stressors such as land use for the zim we cannot exclude the possibility that the variable selection procedure was not comprehensive enough because we tested only models with 1 4 explanatory variables due to computational limitations however given that even the relatively simple selected zims led to overfitting for barbus spp this is at least for barbus spp unlikely to be the cause of the poor predictive performance 4 4 improving the zero inflated model additional analysis of the zim is necessary to further improve predictive performance and to identify more intuitive methods of illustrating model performance the standardized likelihood ratios of the zero inflated count models for the testing data during cross validation below one for barbus spp indicate an overfitting of the model despite the low number of parameters included and a failure of the model to predict the counts for independent data points the skewed distribution of observed counts with a long tailing see observed counts in the si already indicates that it will be difficult to predict the few observations with high counts with a rather simple statistical model based on environmental conditions especially if the number of available data points with observations above zero are low increasing the sample size of the observational data to increase the information content relating fish densities to environmental conditions may improve model performance in the future it might be worth trying to model biomass instead of counts fish biomass can be expected to have a more even distribution because observations of high numbers can be caused by a large number of juveniles with low biomass we found that many studies applying zims to fish use information theoretic statistics such as bic and dic to evaluate and select a model e g arab et al 2012 instead of penalizing the likelihood of a candidate model based on increasing model complexity i e adding environmental variables to the model we opted to quantify the performance of the zims using the likelihood during calibration using all samples and 5 fold cross validation while the standardized likelihood ratio indicates how much more likely the observations are in the proposed model relative to the null model it would be valuable to also visualize the results by comparing observations and model predictions however since the zero inflated densities can have a bi modal distribution see fig 4 it is not straightforward to visualize and summarize model predictions e g based on quantiles but see si fig 20 for an attempt to visualize the distributions of the predicted vs observed counts in conclusion the use of conceptual models for the presence absence and densities of fish taxa contributed to the pre selection of environmental variables and the development of statistical models that reflect plausible cause and effect relationships we were able to develop presence absence models for taxa with intermediate prevalence and a zim for the most prevalent taxa that have a reasonable predictive performance incorporating spatially explicit environmental variables and making use of monitoring data with different sampling methods and levels of sampling effort to account for the observation process we have shown that statistical models can indicate potential positive or negative effects of environmental factors on the occurrence and abundance of common riverine fish taxa many of these factors are currently subject to management actions or influenced by global changes examples for such management actions are the removal of barriers to fish migration o hanley et al 2013 the morphological restoration of rivers haase et al 2013 and changes in agricultural practices to reduce pesticide and nutrient inputs acero triana et al 2021 the models developed in this study are far from able to accurately predict the effect of a specific management action on a local fish community which would additionally require considerations of the colonization potential biotic interactions and less common taxa still this study may help to adjust expectations towards management actions under changing environmental conditions for example according to our results increasing stream temperatures can be expected to increase the occurrence of most common fish species while the removal of barriers and increased morphological variability could lead to a species turn over with this attempt for mechanistically inspired statistical models we hope to encourage the use of increasingly available fish biomonitoring

24568,climate change impacts agricultural pests in complicated ways and accounting for these responses should form an integral part of pest management programmes process based models are often used in agriculture to forecast population dynamics of pests within a growing season however these are often constrained to assessing the impacts of temperature in isolation of other factors these models are therefore unable to fully explore species responses to climate change which may be driven by multiple abiotic and biological stressors here we build a mechanistic model of a globally distributed agricultural aphid pest myzus persicae sulzer and an associated parasitic wasp diaeretiella rapae m intosh that is known to biologically control the aphid we simulate temporal dynamics of the crop with a well established canola growing degree day model apsim and incorporate the impacts of temperature and rainfall on insect survival the model was parameterised with laboratory measured datasets from around the globe and we have calibrated and validated the model to australian broadacre cropping systems using regional observation records we then ran the validated models with future temperature and rainfall scenarios to reveal that suppression of aphid populations by the wasp is enhanced under stressful abiotic conditions which are predicted to occur more frequently in the future the process based modelling approach affords valuable and novel insights into physiological traits that influence population dynamics of both species and highlights gaps in our current understanding of the system in the future farmers could have greater confidence in the bio control potential of d rapae under different conditions and be in a position to adjust their m persicae management programmes accordingly this is the first model to explore the interaction of these two cosmopolitan species in the field which is applicable across broad geographic regions while also providing insights as to how both species could be better managed on a local scale keywords aphid parasitoid agriculture climate change pest management multi trophic 1 introduction climate change has direct

shifting into higher latitudes bebber 2015 voltinism is rising altermatt 2010 and physiological rates such as metabolism development and reproduction are increasing bale et al 2002 dillon et al 2010 despite these general patterns the results of a number of studies caution that responses of agricultural pests which occupy highly modified habitats are more complicated boggs 2016 eigenbrode and macfadyen 2017 lehmann et al 2020 a recent review by lehmann et al 2020 found that of the 31 globally distributed pests considered 55 showed more than one type of response that simultaneously increased and decreased the severity of crop damage for example in response to rising temperatures the northern range boundaries of the gypsy moth lymantria dispar in north america and europe have expanded into higher latitudes vanhanen et al 2007 williams and liebhold 1995 at the same time the damage it causes in southern regions of its range has declined in addition to temperature terrestrial insects are sensitive to other interacting stressors including altered rainfall patterns todgham and stillman 2013 increasing co2 johns and hughes 2002 and more frequent extreme weather events ma et al 2015 pest insects may also be indirectly impacted by the responses of their host plants competitors and natural enemies dáder et al 2015 delucia et al 2012 holton et al 2003 han et al 2019 with this myriad of processes in mind it is perhaps not surprising that observed insect pest responses to climate change are complex dependent on the species the crop and geographic location lehmann et al 2020 a range of ecological models have been developed and applied to predict the impacts of climate change depending on the complexity of the system and the questions being explored such models aim to strike a balance between biological realism and mathematical tractability godfray and waage 1991 rochat and gutierrez 2001 an example of a generalized population dynamic model is presented by deutsch et al 2018 the authors populated the model with physiological data of taxa from multiple trophic levels deutsch et al 2008 and ran simulations across a global extent under future climate scenarios while the model predictions provide general insights into regions where insects might cause the greatest crop damage in the future known complexities in species responses to climate change were over looked consequently findings are not easily down scaled to manage pests and beneficials at the landscape scale see stephens et al 2013 despite the existence of a number of process based modelling tools that capture complexity in insect pest dynamics e g dymex kriticos et al 2003 insim hemerik and van nes 2008 and ilcym tonnang et al 2013 relatively few models have been developed that apply such tools to investigate the impacts of climate change indeed a recent review identified only 19 studies that use process based models that have been integrated with future climate projections choudhary et al 2019 while these models assessed a range of species and systems the vast majority focused on the impacts of rising temperatures in isolation of other abiotic and biological stressors yet multiple interacting factors are likely to affect future populations barton et al 2019 an agricultural pest of concern globally is the green peach aphid myzus persicae sulzer hemiptera aphididae a phloem feeding species that infests a range of host plants van emden et al 1969 blackman eastop 2000 within australia it is a major pest of canola brassica napus l a winter crop that is grown throughout the country s mediterranean type climate zone across this geographic range the species exhibits mostly asexual reproduction moran 1992 allowing populations in canola to grow rapidly generally in autumn and spring when warmer temperatures coincide with more frequent rainfall during the hot dry summer months m persicae takes refuge in secondary hosts within the landscape coined green bridges coutts et al 2006 the aphid s generally tolerant life history traits hazell et al 2010a hazell et al 2010b evolved resistance to multiple pesticides umina et al 2014 de little et al 2017 and strong dispersal capacity makes controlling outbreaks of this pest challenging while the direct feeding damage m persicae causes to canola may not always be of concern it is the principal vector of turnip yellows virus tuyv formerly known as beet western yellow virus a pathogen that can result in substantial damage to the crop and a reduction in yield jones and coutts 2007 modern approaches to pest control tend to emphasize integrated pest management ipm strategies with an increased reliance on beneficial arthropods that through parasitism or predation supress insect pests below damaging densities stern et al 1959 despite the known benefits of ipm adoption of such strategies in australia has been slow in broadacre grain farming systems in part due to a lack of understanding of the distributions and ecologies of beneficial species macfadyen et al 2019 zalucki et al 2015 zalucki et al 2009 in australia one beneficial species abundant in canola fields is the parasitoid wasp diaeretiella rapae m intosh hymenoptera aphidiidae a promising candidate for biological control of m persicae ward et al 2021 diaeretiella rapae has been the subject of several laboratory and field studies in other countries including japan brazil and the usa and has been shown to negatively impact m persicae ferreira et al 2018 mitsunaga et al 2016 stark and acheampong 2007 several studies have assessed the impacts of rising temperatures on aphid wasp interactions however findings are often inconsistent bezemer et al 1998 gillespie et al 2012 romo and tylianakis 2013 hoover and newman 2004 for example predicted that an aphid rhopalosiphum padi l and its associated parasitoid aphidius rhopalosiphi de stefani perez respond similarly to rising temperature and co2 levels and thus the level of biological control is expected to remain unchanged under simulated future climates in contrast an empirical study found that parasitism rate by undetermined wasp species in the field on r padi and sitobion avenue fabricius increased 3 fold in field plots that were artificially warmed although this result varied among experimental years dong et al 2013 laboratory studies on the other hand indicate that higher trophic levels are more sensitive to thermal stress and so as temperatures more readily exceed parasitoid or predator critical limits their capacity to supress more thermally tolerant hosts could be compromised preisser and strong 2004 voigt et al 2003 with these uncertainties in mind models that integrate multi trophic interactions with future climate scenarios will provide additional insights into how ecosystem services provided by beneficial species may change in the future a number of statistical machine learning and process based models have been developed for m persicae around the world including australia maling et al 2010 ro and long 1999 trivedi et al 2002 zhu et al 2006 for example a hybrid mechanistic statistical model has been integrated with species specific information for m persicae canola and tuyv to track population densities and virus transmission maling et al 2010 this study predicts that warmer temperatures in autumn result in higher aphid densities early in the growing season and consequently higher rates of virus incidence in the mature crop while there have been some theoretical modelling studies exploring the capacity of d rapae to act as a biological control agent bannerman and roitberg 2014 neuville et al 2015 stark and acheampong 2007 as far as we are aware none have been developed with the primary focus of forecasting population dynamics in the field here we develop a mechanistic model to explore the population dynamics of m persicae and d rapae during the canola growing season in southern australia the model primarily draws on physiological data measured for each species under laboratory conditions as well as some functions defined in previous modelling frameworks to translate the model from controlled laboratory settings into the australian field context we calibrate its parameters and validate its predictions with observations of aphid and wasp densities from the field with the validated model we then run a series of scenarios to explore how these two species are likely to respond to projected future changes in temperature and rainfall in the process of developing and testing the model we identify key physiological traits that have an important impact on population dynamics under field conditions and highlight uncertainties in our knowledge 2 methods 2 1 model overview and parameterisation the simulation model aimed to predict how population abundances of m persicae and d rapae vary through time under different climatic conditions across southern australia the model involved cohorts each containing multiple individuals that are tracked together through their life cycle as the model simulation progressed on daily timesteps population abundances of each species depend on the rates of development reproduction dispersal and mortality each of these processes vary with temperature rainfall cohort age and population density and also with species interactions i e rates of parasitism all functions are deterministic and thus the physiological state of individuals within a cohort is identical empirical data describing the impacts of temperature age and population density on physiological processes were sourced from the literature tables 1 and 2 esm table 1 multiple response curves were fit to each trait s dataset by iteratively altering the parameters using a non linear least squares approach the nls function in base r version 3 5 2 bates and watts 1988 r development core team 2020 the full suite of functions considered for each physiological trait and the statistical values used to determine the model of best fit are listed in esm table 1 for brevity we report only the chosen response curves in the methods outlined below in cases where no empirical data could be found measurements of closely related species were sourced as a proxy or functions from previous modelling studies were directly incorporated into the model parameter descriptions units symbols and data sources for the aphid and wasp models are listed in table 1 and table 2 respectively migration of aphids into the crop from the surrounding landscape through active short range dispersal or passive long range migration parry et al 2013 thierry et al 2021 requires in itself a detailed spatially explicit modelling framework that is beyond the scope of the current study but see maling et al 2010 instead we focused on the temporal patterns in population dynamics making the assumption that canola crops reflect a uniform landscape to aphid and wasp populations more specifically we assumed an aphid population occupies a 1 m2 patch within a much larger canola field see bannerman and roitberg 2014 2 2 aphid model myzus persicae 2 2 1 initial population of aphids all simulations presented in this study commenced with a single cohort of immigrating adult m persicae which can commence reproduction on the day following their initial arrival see below for definition of start day the initial density of this starting cohort was defined before running the model according to anecdotal observations and later assessed with a sensitivity analysis throughout the simulation a background population of fecund alate winged adults was included allowing for multiple outbreaks of aphids within the simulation period for example if the initial population of observed aphids crashed under extreme temperature the population could re establish from these background individuals when conditions were once again conducive for survival within each timestep population functions were applied in the following order 1 cohort status updated from the previous day 2 nymph development and adult aging 3 life stage transitions 4 emigration of newly emerged alate adults 5 mortality 6 parasitism where applicable and 7 remaining adults produce offspring into the following day s cohort fig 1 these steps were performed on both alate and apterous wingless aphid sub populations at the end of the simulation the total number of individuals within each life history stage adults or nymphs and morphological type were tallied on each timestep providing a prediction of the population dynamics of aphids throughout the simulation period it was assumed that all aphids are female reflecting the predominant parthenogenic reproduction strategy of m persicae in australia 2 2 2 aphid development life stage transitions and adult dispersal the impacts of temperature on aphid nymph development rate follows a wang model eqn 1 according to 1 dr t h 1 e r t d t opt 1 e t t la ϑ 1 e t ua t ϑ where d r t is the proportion of development achieved at a given temperature t h and r are scalars d t o p t t l a and t u a are the optimum temperature and lower and upper thresholds for development respectively while ϑ represents the boundary width at the upper and lower temperatures for every time step in the simulation development units were accumulated in an additive manner until development of the cohort was complete nymphs of future alate adults develop at a slower rate than those of future apterous aphids liu and meng 1999 so parameters of the above function were adjusted accordingly table 1 upon adult emergence a set proportion of alate adults emigrate from the population inverse of ω and these individuals were immediately removed from the population before any further calculations 2 2 3 aphid mortality the impacts of extreme temperatures on m persicae survival are described with a super gaussian function such that daily mortality rates increase as daily maximum t x and minimum t n temperatures diverge from the upper and lower development thresholds respectively t u a and t l a esm fig 1b 2 temp erat ure mort ality 1 e π aphid x n χ t x n ψ aphid 6 here π a p h i d x n and ψ a p h i d combine to impact the rate at which survival declines beyond the temperature thresholds parameterized to ensure that daily mortality rate was 0 5 at temperatures previously measured to induce 50 mortality in the laboratory in many insect species mortality rate occurs faster as temperature increases beyond the critical thermal maximum ct max in comparison to dropping below the critical thermal minimum ct min terblanche et al 2011 to reflect this asymmetry we fitted the value of the π a p h i d x n term independently for the two temperature extremes heavy rainfall events are associated with increased aphid mortality according to a function defined by thackray et al 2004 and later adjusted for m persicae by maling et al 2010 3 rain fall mort ality 0 026 rf 0 33 specifically aphid mortality increases linearly as r f daily rainfall increases from 15 mm to 30 mm after which mortality is capped at 50 we modelled changes in survival rates senescence with respect to the aphid s calendar age from birth according to a gompertz survival function eqn 4 esm fig 1c 4 s e n e s c e n c e 1 e δ β 1 e β a g e where δ and β represent the shape and gradient of the curve respectively an additional source of daily background mortality ζaphid capturing all other lethal processes other than those explicitly modelled here predation by other species and random chance was assumed to occur at a default rate of 0 03 bannerman and roitberg 2014 overall mortality of each cohort on any given timestep eqn 5 was thus calculated by 5 d a i l y m o r t a l i t y r a t e t e m p e r a t u r e m o r t a l i t y r a i n f a l l m o r t a l i t y s e n e s c e n c e b a c k g r o u n d m o r t a l i t y 2 2 4 aphid fecundity reproduction in adult m persicae commences one day after adult emergence peaks four days after emergence and then declines thereafter a weibull distribution eqn 6 most accurately describes this pattern 6 daily fecu ndity age κ ι γ age η γ ι 1 e age η γ ι where ι γ and η are the shape scale and location parameters respectively and κ scales fecundity along the y axis such that the default maximum nymphs produced per day at the optimal age is eight esm fig 1d the impact of temperature on daily fecundity of m persicae is described with a quadratic function with an optimum temperature r t o p t of 25 c eqn 7 predicted fecundity was then adjusted to generate a scaling parameter between 0 and 1 7 t e m p e r a t u r e s c a l a r t ξ a t 2 ξ b t ξ a r t o p t 2 ξ b r t o

from a previous modelling study based on m persicae bannerman and roitberg 2014 8 dens ity scal ar adens 1 1 1 e ρ adens d where d describes the inflection point of the logistic regression curve ρ determines the rate of decline in fecundity as population density increases and a d e n s was assumed to be the density of the day s population once mortality and dispersal have been applied the realised daily fecundity eqn 9 per adult was determined by 9 real ised fecu ndity dens ity scal ar temp erat ure scal ar daily fecu ndity which was multiplied by the number of adults in each cohort the resulting offspring were summed to produce a new cohort of nymphs that commence development in the following time step alate adults are known to produce fewer offspring than their apterae counterparts and so the realised fecundity of alate females was further reduced according to an alate fecundity penalty υ table 1 2 2 5 production of alates the proportion of offspring that are destined to develop into alate adults is in part dependent on the density of the population a d e n s whereby more alates are produced as the population grows esm fig 1f to our knowledge there are no published data describing this pattern for m persicae and so we drew on a function eqn 10 defined for the cherry oat aphid rhopalosiphum padi morgan 2000 parry et al 2006 10 a l a t e p r o d u c t i o n z 1 e x p w a d e n s z ω where ω represents the density threshold at which alates are first produced note the proportion of alate offspring are capped at 50 bannerman and roitberg 2014 2 3 parasitoid model diaeretiella rapae 2 3 1 background population of wasps two characteristics of the initial d rapae population were defined by the user prior to each simulation run 1 the simulation days on which wasps intercept the aphid population and 2 the density of wasps that do so these population level traits have the option of being randomly assigned to reflect a more realistic field situation but for the purposes of this study such dynamics were specified deterministically 2 3 2 rates of parasitism although data on the functional response of d rapae parasitising m persicae could not be found the trait was assumed to be similar to that of d rapae on the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia tazerouni et al 2012 while previous studies suggest that parasitism rates of d rapae differ slightly on diuraphis noxia compared with m persicae bernal et al 1994 yu et al 1993 both interactions follow a type ii response and so we deem this substitution to be valid and rates are calibrated to the field with a scalar value ϕ see below as such we describe parasitism rates in this model with the random parasitoid equation rogers 1972 a type ii response curve without replacement assuming no interference between multiple wasps esm fig 2 a 11 n e n 0 1 e t av n 0 t h φ where α is the attack rate th is the handling time and t a v is the total amount of time available to the parasitoids in this case the daily timestep t a v 1 diaeretiella rapae prefers to parasitise 2nd and 3rd instar aphid nymphs of the cabbage aphid brevicornye brassicae and the turnip aphid lipaphis pseudobrassicae khakasa et al 2016 and so we assumed this was also the case for m persicae bannerman and roitberg 2014 the number of aphids available for parasitism n 0 was therefore defined as the number of aphids in the 2nd and 3rd nymphal stages where wasps do not discriminate between apterous or alate aphids to calibrate parasitism rates from the laboratory into field conditions the number of aphids attacked was further multiplied by a scalar value ϕ tazerouni et al 2012 report parasitism rates of d rapae on diuraphis noxia across six temperatures and given temperature also appears to similarly impact parasitism of m persicae yu et al 1993 we have assumed the thermal response holds across host species drawing on these data tazerouni et al 2012 and following the approach of zamani et al 2007 we re parameterised equation 11 with data from each temperature independently to determine temperature specific values for α and t h we then defined two linear models describing the correlation with temperature whereby 12 α 0 00001084 t 3 0 0021 t 2 0 0272 t 0 0145 and 13 t h 1 0 298 t 3 0 0035 t 2 0 000256 t 1 395 these two functions were incorporated into the random predator equation eqn 11 so that the impacts of both temperature and aphid density on the parasitism rates of d rapae were accounted for 2 3 3 wasp development development rates of d rapae larvae were assumed to be sensitive to the temperature within their host according to a lactin function eqn 14 esm fig 2b 14 d r t e ε t e ε t u w t t u w τ λ where ε τ and λ are fitted parameters and t u w is the upper developmental temperature threshold of the wasp this upper developmental temperature could not be found for d rapae or closely related species and so a value for another parasitoid aphelinus certus frewin et al 2010 was substituted wasp larvae developing within their hosts become visible to observers can be detected as a mummy upon reaching 60 development gutiérrez ibáñez et al 2007 and the number of visible mummies on each given day was tallied finally although sex ratio of wasps can vary under field conditions for simplicity it is assumed that adult wasps emerge with an equal sex ratio and that 50 of females remain in the population for one additional day to parasitise susceptible aphid nymphs and commence a new generation of wasps kant et al 2012 weisser and völkl 1997 2 3 4 wasp mortality published data on the impacts of acute temperature stress on d rapae critical thermal limits could not be found and so we drew on measurements of emergence success of adults reared in m persicae at a range of temperatures i e chronic stress souza et al 2017 these data were used to parameterise the super gaussian function in accordance with the aphid model eqn 2 with parameters πwasp and ψwasp esm fig 2c the impacts of heavy rainfall on wasps both adults and larvae were defined according to equation 3 and the background mortality rates ζwasp set at 0 03 also to reflect that of the aphid population 2 4 canola model brassica napus host plant availability and palatability directly constrain the presence and abundance of herbivorous insects such as m persicae in time and space to describe this bottom up control we focused on canola b napus as its most abundant secondary host plant in australia we used an established modelling platform agricultural predictions systems simulator apsim v 7 10 holzworth et al 2014 to make predictions of the presence and aphid carrying capacity of canola at locations of interest briefly apsim integrates daily climate variables fig 1 with information on soil and water availability to track the development of canola with growing degree day calculations robertson and lilley 2016 climatic data are sourced from the scientific information for land owners online patched point database silo provided by the queensland department natural resources and mines https legacy longpaddock qld gov au silo jeffrey et al 2001 for our simulations we have 1 assumed the canola is the stingray variety chosen to complement associated field experiments in prep 2 defined sowing dates typical to a location of interest see below and 3 made no further modifications to the apsim source code the apsim simulations were run and predictions of the crop s growth stage incorporated as an input into the insect models to influence their population dynamics in two ways fig 1 firstly we assumed that the initial immigrating aphids cannot establish colonies until seedlings of the canola crop have emerged dictating the commencement of the simulation and that colonies cannot persist once the crop has been harvested terminating the simulation ward et al 1998 maling et al 2010 congdon et al 2019 secondly it was assumed that the canola s growth stage has a direct impact on its aphid carrying capacity it increases with vegetative growth up until the end of stem elongation gs 40 in bbch decimal system after which it declines as the plant matures and senesces thackray et al 2009 this pattern is described with a normal distribution leather and dixon 1981 where µ 760 and σ2 250 which we have scaled between 0 and 1 the density dependence function equation 8 of the aphid population was multiplied by this scalar such that the carrying capacity varies daily as the canola develops 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were conducted using the bayesian analysis of computer code outputs bacco approach with the gaussian emulator model sensitivity analysis programme gem sa kennedy et al 2006 o hagan 2006 parry et al 2013 rather than varying one parameter at a time this technique varies all parameters at once such that the full parameter space is represented in a computationally efficient manner o hagan 2006 parry et al 2013 the model is then run with unique combinations of parameter values with the outputs generated from these iterations a gaussian process model is fit to a variable of interest e g total aphid density to generate an emulator model this emulator in turn assesses which parameters have the greatest relative influence on the models output see parry et al 2013 for further details 2 5 1 aphid model for the aphid model ten parameters were intitially selected representing key population dynamic processes shown in table 1 these parameters were selected as they influence the species response curves in such a way that is expected by populations adapting to local abiotic conditions e g populations in regions with greater temperature variability evolve broader thermal tolerances esm fig 1 and fig 2 a range of values for each parameter around the default value was defined within the bounds of uncertainty ensuring that biological realism was maintained in each case we generated 100 combinations of the ten parameter values assuming a uniform probability distribution and an input design approximating a lp τ distribution the model was then run 100 times each iteration containing a unique combination of the ten parameters in these simulations the wasp sub model was de activated and runs continued for 150 days during which daily temperature and rainfall were maintained at 20 c and 0 mm respectively for each model iteration the total pest pressure during the simulation the area under the population curve of the aphids was calculated and the relative effect of each parameter on this metric was assessed with the gem sa software here we present the main effects of each parameter defined as the impact of the given parameter to the total variance among the model iterations in comparison to the remaining parameters the procedure above was repeated to assess whether the influential parameters identified under constant optimal temperature and rainfall were equally as important under realistic field conditions climate data including daily minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall mm were sourced from the silo database see above at burnley in victoria latitude 37 83 longitude 145 01 spanning 791 days from 2nd december 1959 until 27th february 1961 the location and time period correspond with a study of m persicae that we used to validate the model o loughin et al 1963 esm 3 1 in this sensitivity analysis we included an additional parameter that defines rates of mortality under extreme temperatures ζaphid 2 5 2 wasp model to perform a sensitivity analysis on the wasp sub model we returned the aphid parameters to their default values table 1 and tested three parameters in the wasp model table 2 it was assumed that one adult wasp intercepted the aphid colony on a daily basis during which it was able to parasitise susceptible aphids the relative influence of each parameter on the predicted number of visible mummies throughout the simulation area under the mummy population curve was analysed this analysis was performed under optimal see above and field conditions in the latter we incorporated temperature and rainfall records at a location in western victoria mercer 37 91 143 17 during the canola growing season of 2018 18th may 23rd november this location and time period capture conditions during field surveys of m persicae and d rapae ward et al 2021 esm 3 2 and we included an additional parameter table 1 in these analyses to assess the relative impacts of extreme temperatures on wasp mortality ζwasp 2 6 model calibration and validation 2 6 1 aphid model calibration having developed the models on laboratory data the parameters needed to be calibrated to ensure that the model performed adequately in the australian field context for the aphid sub model we drew on observations of m persicae made by o loughlin 1963 at burnley from 2nd december 1959 until 27th february 1961 where dispersing m persicae alate adults were captured using both moericke and sticky traps combined here at weekly intervals we made use of the 100 model iterations already performed as part of the sensitivity analyses in which the field temperature and rainfall data at the location were integrated from the model outputs we compared predictions of dispersing aphids the number of alate adults that disperse away from the population to the observed number of m persicae captured in the traps while the temporal resolution of the predicted daily and observed weekly datasets differs traps generally capture a small proportion of individuals in the field taylor 1974 and thus we believe this comparison of absolute aphid densities is justified burnley is an urban location with a variety of potential host plants and so these simulations were run throughout the full year assuming that the absence of winter host plants i e canola was not a limiting factor for aphid survival the 100 different parameterisations of the model were then ranked in order of how well they predicted the observed aphid trap captures according to the root mean square error rmse 15 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 where y i is the predicted and x i is the observed aphid density an analysis of variance anova was then used to assess whether the model of best fit that with the lowest rmse predicted the observed aphids significantly better than the model containing the default parameters the model iteration that most accurately predicted dispersing aphids at burnley from 1959 until 1961 rmse mbf 40 05 did not differ significantly t 191 0 682 p 0 496 from that with the default values rmse default 43 26 which was ranked 4th of 100 possible iterations as such given the default model was defined from previous studies the aphid model was run with the default parameter values for all simulations hereafter esm fig 3 1 2 6 2 aphid model validation to assess how the default aphid model performed under novel conditions it was validated with additional field collected datasets from several locations and time series in addition to burnley o loughlin 1963 made observations at two additional sites toolangi 37 53 145 64 and werribee 37 89 144 66 these locations are some distance apart 100 km and although captures were made in the same time period we treat the collections as independent datasets the model was run with temperature and rainfall observations at each location and predictions of dispersing alate adults were compared with those observed in the traps we conducted another validation of the aphid model with data from an additional study using monthly trap captures of m persicae from six locations in south eastern australia during 1961 hughes et al 1964 here the approach outlined above was repeated with relevant climate data incorporated as inputs esm fig 9 1 to statistically test how well the model performed at these eight locations o loughlin 1963 hughes et al 1964 we considered three metrics relevant to aphid infestations in canola throughout the growing season in southern australia 1 the timing of the autumn population outbreak day on which aphid density peaks in the first half of the year 2 the severity of the autumn outbreak peak aphid density in the first half of the year and 3 the total pest pressure throughout the annual cycle area under the aphid population curve over 365 days to calculate these metrics only days on which aphids were observed were considered i e observed aphid densities were not interpolated across the monthly or weekly trap captures we compared the observed and predicted metrics with a paired student s t test where n 8 field observations of migrating m persicae have more recently been made at a location in south australia near kapunda 34 39 138 89 at weekly intervals from 20th april 2016 until 31st december 2018 using a 1 8 m suction trap unpublished data these contemporary data were also used to validate the model the trap in this study was placed in an area dominated by cereal and canola crops and so the simulation commenced at the time of canola sowing and terminated seven days after harvest as predicted by the growing degree day apsim model in addition the density dependence of the aphid population varies through each year in line with the canola s carrying capacity see description of canola model the time of sowing varies from year to year robertson et al 2004 and to include this source of variation in aphid population dynamics three simulations with typical early 15th april middle 1st may and late 31st may sowing dates grdc 2018 were run each year was run in a separate simulation with daily temperature and rainfall records during this growing period sourced from the silo database and incorporated into the model predicted dispersing aphids were then compared with those observed in the suction trap 2 6 3 wasp model calibration the calibration procedure described above was repeated for the wasp sub model drawing on the 100 model simulations run for the wasp sensitivity analysis with climate data for mercer at this location counts of aphid and mummy densities were conducted on five occasions during spring in 2018 at three weekly intervals within a canola field ward et al 2021 the model simulations commenced on the day aphids were first observed in the field and continued until ten days after the final observation was made in accordance with the sensitivity analyses one adult wasp intercepted the aphid colony on a daily basis during which it was able to parasitise susceptible aphid nymphs from the model outputs the predicted number of visible mummies were compared with those from the field study there was significant variation in absolute mummy densities among sites and although fairly typical of observations of these species this makes the use of such data as a calibration tool for models challenging bahlai et al 2013 nonetheless we were able to approximate a model of best fit according to the lowest rmse eqn 15 which was compared with the default parameter values using the same anova approach described above to confirm that the interaction between wasps and aphids was adequately captured we also compared the predicted ratio of mummies with aphids aphid mummy ratio number of aphids number of visible mummies within each population with corresponding observed aphid mummy ratios where aphid colonies were subjected to parasitism by d rapae the default model under estimated the number of visible mummies and thus overestimated the aphid mummy ratio esm fig 3 2 rmse default 24 41 ranked 38th of 100 in contrast the model of best fit more accurately predicted the absolute numbers of mummies timing of mummy development and the aphid mummy ratio esm fig 3 2 rmse mbf 11 34 given the significant differences in accuracy between the default model and the model of best fit t 13 139 76 p 0 001 we used the calibrated model for all wasp simulations hereafter see esm 3 2 for further discussion of the calibration results 2 6 4 wasp model validation to validate the wasp model we drew on observations of mummy densities at two additional locations wilson 37 85 143 37 and peel 38 16 144 00 collected during the same period as those used to calibrate the model at mercer ward et al 2021 these fields are 70 km apart and we considered them to be independent the calibrated wasp model with the default parameters in the aphid model was run with local temperature and rainfall records simulations commenced on the day on which aphids were first observed in the field and continued until ten days after the final observation was made in accordance with the sensitivity analyses described above one adult wasp intercepted the aphid colony on a daily basis during which it was able to parasitise susceptible aphid nymphs as above model performance at these two additional locations was assessed by comparing the observed and predicted number of visible mummies and aphid mummy ratios 2 7 climate change scenarios having validated the insect models with field datasets they were then extrapolated into novel climates to assess how these species may respond to future changes in climate we based the climate scenarios on daily weather records from 1960 until 1969 at burnley in victoria australian bureau of meteorology station number 086095 http www bom gov au climate data termed the reference weather dataset hereafter adjustments to this dataset were then made generating three rainfall and four temperature scenarios 12 climate scenarios esm fig 4 the rainfall scenarios represented typically dry wet and average rainfall years reflecting 10th percentile 454 mm 90th percentile 845 mm and median long term total annual rainfall 606 mm at the location daily rainfall records in the reference weather dataset were adjusted such that total annual rainfall equated to these amounts esm fig 4 current and future temperature projections were sourced from the access 1 0 model bi et al 2013 which forms part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cimp6 riahi et al 2011 taylor 1974 accessed at esri http pcmdi9 llnl gov monthly projections were considered with a relative concentration pathway of 8 5 rcp8 5 which although the most extreme of the forcing experiments appears to be tracking current trajectories ipcc 2014 jackson et al 2017 temperature projections across three periods of ten years were extracted capturing current 2006 2015 near future 2040 2049 and distant future 2090 2099 conditions given access 1 0 performs well in predicting past climates watterson et al 2013 for consistency among scenarios we also sourced climate projections from the historical modelling experiment extracting monthly temperatures from 1960 until 1969 historical period for each of the four temperature scenarios the average decadal t min and t max were determined we subsequently adjusted the daily t min and t max in the reference weather dataset such that the decadal average temperatures equated to those in each of the four temperature scenarios esm fig 4 the models were then run with the 12 climate scenarios with and without the wasp model 24 scenarios in total each year within each decade was run in a separate simulation and across these 10 year replicates the average number of aphids on each day of the year was determined to ensure realistic predictions of species densities during the first few weeks of each year a burn in period is required this was achieved by duplicating each year s climate data running the simulation across the resulting 24 consecutive months and then extracting only the second 12 month period for analyses while host plant availability can act as a bottleneck for aphid populations in australia for simplicity it is assumed that host plants are available to the aphids throughout the full simulation period in addition to tracking dispersing aphid densities through the year we calculated the pest pressure see definition above during the canola growing period predicted by the apsim model in 2019 at burnley from the 15th april until the predicted harvest date on the 12th november an anova was used to quantify the relative impacts of climate scenario and wasp presence on pest pressure which was log transformed to account for unequal variance among scenarios 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis of aphid model in total 99 of the variance in total pest pressure among the 100 model iterations under constant temperature and rainfall was explained by the ten parameters table 3 esm fig 5 the parameter describing the population s carrying capacity d accounted for the majority of this variation increasing this threshold from 5 000 to 15 000 led to an increase in pest pressure from 20 to 60 million aphids when field records of temperature and rainfall were incorporated into the model the population s carrying capacity was again the most influential parameter although it accounted for only half of the total variance table 3 esm fig 6 the second most influential parameter defined the rate of adult senescence where higher rates of aging led to reduced pest pressure the aphid s sensitivity to stressful temperature ψaphid was the third most influential parameter 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of wasp model under constant temperature and rainfall conditions three parameters considered in the sensitivity analysis of the wasp model accounted for 95 3 of the variation in the total number of visible mummies table 3 esm fig 7 two thirds of this variance could be attributed to the parasitism rate of female wasps φ where increases in parasitism resulted in increases in the number of visible mummies within the aphid colony rates of background mortality mostly accounted for the remainder of the total variance such that lower mortality rates increase the number of wasp larvae developing within the aphid colony esm fig 8 a high proportion of variance 84 in visible mummy densities could also be attributed to four model parameters under fluctuating temperature and rainfall although the relative importance of each parameter differed in comparison to constant conditions table 3 the wasp s sensitivity to extreme temperatures accounted for the majority of the model output s variance greater sensitivity to heat and cold led to higher mortality and a reduction in visible mummies table 3 esm fig 8 in contrast parasitism rate appears to play a relatively minor role in determining densities of visible mummies in the field 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 validation of aphid model when the aphid model was run with climate data from the three locations considered by o loughlin 1963 predictions approximated the absolute numbers of dispersing aphids over the 14 month period fig 2 the timing and absolute number of dispersing aphids were accurately predicted in the autumn outbreak at each location while a spring outbreak of aphids was also observed the model did not accurately predict this migration event at burnley and werribee the absolute densities were predicted but the timing of the outbreaks were approximately three weeks late fig 2a 2c at toolangi the model failed to predict the spring migration altogether fig 2b statistical validation of the model predictions against observed population dynamics at eight locations in south eastern australia o loughlin 1963 and hughes 1964 confirmed these qualitative comparisons the predicted timing of the autumn peak outbreak t 7 0 42 p 0 69 and the total pest pressure t 7 1 79 p 0 12 did not differ significantly from the observed population metrics however the model failed to predict absolute aphid densities at the autumn outbreak compared with those captured in traps in the field t 7 2 73 p 0 03 see esm fig 9 2 for further details validation of the model against aphid observations collected at kapunda from 2016 to 2018 also confirmed that the model generally performs well under contemporary climates irrespective of when canola is sown the model accurately predicted the seasonal timing of aphid migrations in all three years fig 3 substantial inter annual variation in aphid observations is negatively correlated with annual rainfall esm fig 10a which the model detected in 2016 and 2017 fig 3 4 b in 2018 low rainfall however the model failed to predict two weeks with very high numbers of dispersing aphids although it approximated observed densities on either side of this outbreak fig 3 3 2 2 validation of wasp model the number of mummies observed at multiple aphid populations within the canola field at the three locations wilson and peel were highly variable ranging from an absence of mummies in some aphid populations to over 50 in others on the same day while such variability renders the calibration and validation of the non spatial aphid and wasp models challenging some general comparisons and conclusions can be made at all three locations the calibrated model performed relatively well at predicting the absolute number of visible mummies and the ratio of aphids mummies in aphid colonies exposed to d rapae fig 4 3 3 climate change simulations there was a significant interaction between temperature regime and the presence of wasps on the predicted aphid presence in the crop wasps temperature f 3 222 168 19 p 0 001 fig 5 b 5d in the absence of wasps warmer temperatures predicted into the future led to an overall increase in aphid densities during the canola growing season fig 5a 6c while this general trend was also apparent in the presence of wasps the pattern was not significant indeed under all twelve climate scenarios aphid densities were significantly reduced when wasps were included in the simulation f 1 222 2660 55 p 0 001 fig 5d irrespective of temperature and the presence or absence of wasps aphid densities were reduced under the wet rainfall scenario f 2 222 10 41 p 0 001 fig 5c 5d the seasonal patterns of aphid outbreaks also varied among climate scenarios in the absence of wasps under relatively cold historical conditions aphid densities peaked during summer but remained at low levels for the remainder of the year fig 5a in contrast warmer current and near future climates induced autumn and spring migrations separated by periods of reduced aphid densities in summer and winter as is typically observed in the field fig 5a in the hottest distant future scenario aphid densities were suppressed over summer but were predicted to have relatively higher densities during winter these seasonal patterns were consistent across all rainfall scenarios the median rainfall scenario only is shown in fig 5a when the wasp sub model was included in the simulations fig 5b 5d aphid densities were entirely suppressed in the historical climate scenarios under the three warmer climates aphid outbreaks were observed in autumn although the relative timing and absolute densities of aphid migrations varied between temperature profiles in addition wasps were predicted to suppress outbreaks of aphids in spring under all climate scenarios fig 5b 4 discussion the process based simulation model presented here primarily developed on existing physiological datasets accurately predicted numerous aspects of the population dynamics of m persicae at several locations and time series without the need for additional calibration and in cases where the model failed to predict aphid outbreaks the underlying model processes that led to such discrepancies can be identified and explored further while some parameters in the d rapae model required calibration it too performed relatively well against observed aphid mummy counts in the field we applied the model to predict with some confidence the likely effects of future climate scenarios on aphid populations and their suppression by d rapae the model indicates that while increased temperatures and drier winters lead to higher aphid abundance over the canola growing season wasps can suppress aphid outbreaks especially when abiotic stress is simultaneously encountered by the aphid population as with all models some processes that impact the species densities are not described however the mechanistic nature of the approach allows us to tease apart important drivers of pest outbreaks and identify gaps in our current knowledge in the absence of top down mortality the wasp model de activated rising temperatures led to an overall increase in aphid densities which is expected snyder and ives 2003 also the seasonal timing of population dynamics varied considerably between temperature scenarios and this finding is perhaps more important for informing how m persicae could be managed moving forward in the distant future scenario aphid populations are predicted to thrive over winter but collapse over summer a key component of management strategies for m persicae in australia is to minimise the green bridge over summer in order to reduce the number of aphids immigrating into crops in autumn congdon et al 2019 coutts et al 2006 under future climates such strategies may become less important in some regions given aphids will be unable to persist over the summer months our simulations indicate that farmers can rely on d rapae to provide some level of suppression of population outbreaks of m persicae even under future climates in line with previous modelling and empirical studies bannerman and roitberg 2014 romo and tylianakis 2013 warmer temperatures are likely to be advantageous for wasps allowing females to parasitise more aphids thus over riding any positive impacts of rising temperature on aphid populations despite this overall improved performance of the wasps the level of control exerted by d rapae on m persicae is expected to vary between years for example under the current climate scenario in some years aphid numbers are expected to peak at 60 dispersing aphids a day while in other years they may not exceed ten dispersers per day further inspection of the modelling outputs suggests that years with greater aphid suppression coincide with ambient conditions that cause the aphid population to be stressed i e cold temperatures during the historical scenario and wet years in the current and future scenarios these patterns arising from an interaction between abiotic stress and wasp control need to be further investigated in the field in addition to changing abiotic stressors altered interactions with other competitors or natural enemies might play a role in shaping the responses of m persicae and d rapae to climate change non linear changes in crop physiology in response to changing temperature and co2 levels may also impact insect life history traits and population dynamics bezemer et al 1998 dáder et al 2015 holton et al 2003 moreover insects in the field do not experience abiotic stressors independently of one another as defined here but rather interactions thereof for example rates of insect mortality due to high temperature in the tsetse fly glossina spp are faster during periods of low relative humidity kleynhans and terblanche 2011 data on these responses is unfortunately still limited and thus are rarely included in modelling studies indeed explicitly defining the above processes is beyond the scope of this study we have assumed stable non interacting performance curves among climate scenarios and a constant constraint on aphid background mortality in addition we have assumed that these interactions remain true across different locations in the landscape which is unlikely such altered biotic and abiotic interactions under novel climates should be kept in mind when interpreting the model s predictions sensitivity analyses identified life history traits that are most important for driving population dynamics under constant conditions the aphid s carrying capacity and the wasp s parasitism rate are identified as key parameters impacting population densities while such bottom up controls will limit population growth in the field under fluctuating temperatures insect densities are also constrained by the thermal impacts on mortality including aphid senescence table 3 thus the relative importance of these different constraints on population dynamics food availability versus ambient stress will in part be determined by the temperature regime at a given location the results obtained here highlight the importance of sensitivity testing models under a range of input scenarios to better understand how they might behave in different contexts in some instances the model failed to predict the timing and abundance of aphid population outbreaks esm 9 for example the model failed to predict the spring outbreak in 1961 in toolangi fig 2b because cold conditions prevented immigrating aphids from establishing colonies toolangi has an elevation of 585m a s l and compared with all other locations in the study is surrounded by topographically heterogeneous terrain ambient conditions vary with topography suggitt et al 2011 affecting insect microclimates and their thermally sensitive physiological traits barton and terblanche 2014 bennie 2008 as such the stressfully cold temperatures measured by the weather station which were used in the model may be buffered allowing aphid populations to establish and grow scherrer and körner 2011 incorporating a microclimate model in the framework which translates ambient conditions measured at the weather stations 1 2 m high into the immediate conditions encountered by the pest might help the model to account for the discrepancies observed here while the model performed well during 2016 and 2017 at kapunda in 2018 it failed to predict two weeks of observations in which more than 150 dispersing m persicae aphids were caught fig 3 the number of dispersing aphids predicted by the model is directly proportional to the number of alate adults maturing on any given day table 1 studies have shown however that environmental conditions and deteriorating plant health can directly trigger mass dispersal events of pests for example moradi vajargh and parry 2017 showed that temperatures between 35 c and 40 c in the laboratory can induce almost 100 take off in both sexes of the rutherglen bug nysius vinitor bergroth as well as thermal stress the high dispersal rates in 2018 may have been in response to the advanced crop senescence caused by drought stress bailey et al 1995 for simplicity we have not yet defined these processes in the model or indeed constrained dispersal to within a typical thermal flight activity range broadbent 1949 moradi vajargah and parry 2017 from a management perspective dispersal ability has implications for the spread of not only pests but also any diseases they carry parry 2013 and so the inclusion of such information would improve the model s applicability as a decision support tool very few studies incorporate direct impacts of rainfall into insect population dynamic models maling et al 2010 thackray et al 2004 many claim to incorporate weather data but the majority account for temperature impacts only see mcdonald et al 2015 and barton et al 2019 in our study applying the direct impacts of rainfall on aphid mortality improved the fit of the model when the rainfall function equation 3 was de activated it failed to detect the observed inter annual variation in aphid densities at kapunda esm fig 11 while this observation data esm fig 10 confirmed anecdotal accounts of the impacts of heavy downpours on aphid densities the explicit mechanisms through which this occurs remains unclear the rainfall function defined by thackray et al 2004 is based on data of the english grain aphid sitobion avenue fabricius experiments have shown heavy rainfall events increase the number of aphids that are lost from the plant s leaves thackray et al 2004 as well as a greater propensity for alate aphid dispersal mann et al 1995 different to this species m persicae typically occupies the lower leaves of their host plants and thus may be sheltered from the direct impacts of heavy rainfall harrington and xia nian 1984 5 conclusion while stressful ambient conditions for m persicae are predicted to enhance the biological control capabilities of d rapae much remains unknown as to how these species will interact with their immediate host plant and the broader agricultural landscape thierry et al 2020 both of which are already under intense management and will be subject to climate change moreover management decisions must balance multiple considerations including the impacts of other pests and diseases market access and financial costs nonetheless here we develop a modelling framework that provides a baseline in which subtle interactions and management scenarios might be included the approach taken here translating globally collected laboratory datasets into field predictions and validating these provides a methodology for integrating pre existing knowledge on the ecologies of insect pests into forecasting tools which can then be applied to relevant scales for management purposes 6 author contributions mb and hp developed and wrote the model and

24568,climate change impacts agricultural pests in complicated ways and accounting for these responses should form an integral part of pest management programmes process based models are often used in agriculture to forecast population dynamics of pests within a growing season however these are often constrained to assessing the impacts of temperature in isolation of other factors these models are therefore unable to fully explore species responses to climate change which may be driven by multiple abiotic and biological stressors here we build a mechanistic model of a globally distributed agricultural aphid pest myzus persicae sulzer and an associated parasitic wasp diaeretiella rapae m intosh that is known to biologically control the aphid we simulate temporal dynamics of the crop with a well established canola growing degree day model apsim and incorporate the impacts of temperature and rainfall on insect survival the model was parameterised with laboratory measured datasets from around the globe and we have calibrated and validated the model to australian broadacre cropping systems using regional observation records we then ran the validated models with future temperature and rainfall scenarios to reveal that suppression of aphid populations by the wasp is enhanced under stressful abiotic conditions which are predicted to occur more frequently in the future the process based modelling approach affords valuable and novel insights into physiological traits that influence population dynamics of both species and highlights gaps in our current understanding of the system in the future farmers could have greater confidence in the bio control potential of d rapae under different conditions and be in a position to adjust their m persicae management programmes accordingly this is the first model to explore the interaction of these two cosmopolitan species in the field which is applicable across broad geographic regions while also providing insights as to how both species could be better managed on a local scale keywords aphid parasitoid agriculture climate change pest management multi trophic 1 introduction climate change has direct impacts on the distributions and performance of terrestrial insects bebber 2015 boggs 2016 parmesan and yohe 2003 global trends indicate that in response to rising temperatures species ranges are shifting into higher latitudes bebber 2015 voltinism is rising altermatt 2010 and physiological rates such as metabolism development and reproduction are increasing bale et al 2002 dillon et al 2010 despite these general patterns the results of a number of studies caution that responses of agricultural pests which occupy highly modified habitats are more complicated boggs 2016 eigenbrode and macfadyen 2017 lehmann et al 2020 a recent review by lehmann et al 2020 found that of the 31 globally distributed pests considered 55 showed more than one type of response that simultaneously increased and decreased the severity of crop damage for example in response to rising temperatures the northern range boundaries of the gypsy moth lymantria dispar in north america and europe have expanded into higher latitudes vanhanen et al 2007 williams and liebhold 1995 at the same time the damage it causes in southern regions of its range has declined in addition to temperature terrestrial insects are sensitive to other interacting stressors including altered rainfall patterns todgham and stillman 2013 increasing co2 johns and hughes 2002 and more frequent extreme weather events ma et al 2015 pest insects may also be indirectly impacted by the responses of their host plants competitors and natural enemies dáder et al 2015 delucia et al 2012 holton et al 2003 han et al 2019 with this myriad of processes in mind it is perhaps not surprising that observed insect pest responses to climate change are complex dependent on the species the crop and geographic location lehmann et al 2020 a range of ecological models have been developed and applied to predict the impacts of climate change depending on the complexity of the system and the questions being explored such models aim to strike a balance between biological realism and mathematical tractability godfray and waage 1991 rochat and gutierrez 2001 an example of a generalized population dynamic model is presented by deutsch et al 2018 the authors populated the model with physiological data of taxa from multiple trophic levels deutsch et al 2008 and ran simulations across a global extent under future climate scenarios while the model predictions provide general insights into regions where insects might cause the greatest crop damage in the future known complexities in species responses to climate change were over looked consequently findings are not easily down scaled to manage pests and beneficials at the landscape scale see stephens et al 2013 despite the existence of a number of process based modelling tools that capture complexity in insect pest dynamics e g dymex kriticos et al 2003 insim hemerik and van nes 2008 and ilcym tonnang et al 2013 relatively few models have been developed that apply such tools to investigate the impacts of climate change indeed a recent review identified only 19 studies that use process based models that have been integrated with future climate projections choudhary et al 2019 while these models assessed a range of species and systems the vast majority focused on the impacts of rising temperatures in isolation of other abiotic and biological stressors yet multiple interacting factors are likely to affect future populations barton et al 2019 an agricultural pest of concern globally is the green peach aphid myzus persicae sulzer hemiptera aphididae a phloem feeding species that infests a range of host plants van emden et al 1969 blackman eastop 2000 within australia it is a major pest of canola brassica napus l a winter crop that is grown throughout the country s mediterranean type climate zone across this geographic range the species exhibits mostly asexual reproduction moran 1992 allowing populations in canola to grow rapidly generally in autumn and spring when warmer temperatures coincide with more frequent rainfall during the hot dry summer months m persicae takes refuge in secondary hosts within the landscape coined green bridges coutts et al 2006 the aphid s generally tolerant life history traits hazell et al 2010a hazell et al 2010b evolved resistance to multiple pesticides umina et al 2014 de little et al 2017 and strong dispersal capacity makes controlling outbreaks of this pest challenging while the direct feeding damage m persicae causes to canola may not always be of concern it is the principal vector of turnip yellows virus tuyv formerly known as beet western yellow virus a pathogen that can result in substantial damage to the crop and a reduction in yield jones and coutts 2007 modern approaches to pest control tend to emphasize integrated pest management ipm strategies with an increased reliance on beneficial arthropods that through parasitism or predation supress insect pests below damaging densities stern et al 1959 despite the known benefits of ipm adoption of such strategies in australia has been slow in broadacre grain farming systems in part due to a lack of understanding of the distributions and ecologies of beneficial species macfadyen et al 2019 zalucki et al 2015 zalucki et al 2009 in australia one beneficial species abundant in canola fields is the parasitoid wasp diaeretiella rapae m intosh hymenoptera aphidiidae a promising candidate for biological control of m persicae ward et al 2021 diaeretiella rapae has been the subject of several laboratory and field studies in other countries including japan brazil and the usa and has been shown to negatively impact m persicae ferreira et al 2018 mitsunaga et al 2016 stark and acheampong 2007 several studies have assessed the impacts of rising temperatures on aphid wasp interactions however findings are often inconsistent bezemer et al 1998 gillespie et al 2012 romo and tylianakis 2013 hoover and newman 2004 for example predicted that an aphid rhopalosiphum padi l and its associated parasitoid aphidius rhopalosiphi de stefani perez respond similarly to rising temperature and co2 levels and thus the level of biological control is expected to remain unchanged under simulated future climates in contrast an empirical study found that parasitism rate by undetermined wasp species in the field on r padi and sitobion avenue fabricius increased 3 fold in field plots that were artificially warmed although this result varied among experimental years dong et al 2013 laboratory studies on the other hand indicate that higher trophic levels are more sensitive to thermal stress and so as temperatures more readily exceed parasitoid or predator critical limits their capacity to supress more thermally tolerant hosts could be compromised preisser and strong 2004 voigt et al 2003 with these uncertainties in mind models that integrate multi trophic interactions with future climate scenarios will provide additional insights into how ecosystem services provided by beneficial species may change in the future a number of statistical machine learning and process based models have been developed for m persicae around the world including australia maling et al 2010 ro and long 1999 trivedi et al 2002 zhu et al 2006 for example a hybrid mechanistic statistical model has been integrated with species specific information for m persicae canola and tuyv to track population densities and virus transmission maling et al 2010 this study predicts that warmer temperatures in autumn result in higher aphid densities early in the growing season and consequently higher rates of virus incidence in the mature crop while there have been some theoretical modelling studies exploring the capacity of d rapae to act as a biological control agent bannerman and roitberg 2014 neuville et al 2015 stark and acheampong 2007 as far as we are aware none have been developed with the primary focus of forecasting population dynamics in the field here we develop a mechanistic model to explore the population dynamics of m persicae and d rapae during the canola growing season in southern australia the model primarily draws on physiological data measured for each species under laboratory conditions as well as some functions defined in previous modelling frameworks to translate the model from controlled laboratory settings into the australian field context we calibrate its parameters and validate its predictions with observations of aphid and wasp densities from the field with the validated model we then run a series of scenarios to explore how these two species are likely to respond to projected future changes in temperature and rainfall in the process of developing and testing the model we identify key physiological traits that have an important impact on population dynamics under field conditions and highlight uncertainties in our knowledge 2 methods 2 1 model overview and parameterisation the simulation model aimed to predict how population abundances of m persicae and d rapae vary through time under different climatic conditions across southern australia the model involved cohorts each containing multiple individuals that are tracked together through their life cycle as the model simulation progressed on daily timesteps population abundances of each species depend on the rates of development reproduction dispersal and mortality each of these processes vary with temperature rainfall cohort age and population density and also with species interactions i e rates of parasitism all functions are deterministic and thus the physiological state of individuals within a cohort is identical empirical data describing the impacts of temperature age and population density on physiological processes were sourced from the literature tables 1 and 2 esm table 1 multiple response curves were fit to each trait s dataset by iteratively altering the parameters using a non linear least squares approach the nls function in base r version 3 5 2 bates and watts 1988 r development core team 2020 the full suite of functions considered for each physiological trait and the statistical values used to determine the model of best fit are listed in esm table 1 for brevity we report only the chosen response curves in the methods outlined below in cases where no empirical data could be found measurements of closely related species were sourced as a proxy or functions from previous modelling studies were directly incorporated into the model parameter descriptions units symbols and data sources for the aphid and wasp models are listed in table 1 and table 2 respectively migration of aphids into the crop from the surrounding landscape through active short range dispersal or passive long range migration parry et al 2013 thierry et al 2021 requires in itself a detailed spatially explicit modelling framework that is beyond the scope of the current study but see maling et al 2010 instead we focused on the temporal patterns in population dynamics making the assumption that canola crops reflect a uniform landscape to aphid and wasp populations more specifically we assumed an aphid population occupies a 1 m2 patch within a much larger canola field see bannerman and roitberg 2014 2 2 aphid model myzus persicae 2 2 1 initial population of aphids all simulations presented in this study commenced with a single cohort of immigrating adult m persicae which can commence reproduction on the day following their initial arrival see below for definition of start day the initial density of this starting cohort was defined before running the model according to anecdotal observations and later assessed with a sensitivity analysis throughout the simulation a background population of fecund alate winged adults was included allowing for multiple outbreaks of aphids within the simulation period for example if the initial population of observed aphids crashed under extreme temperature the population could re establish from these background individuals when conditions were once again conducive for survival within each timestep population functions were applied in the following order 1 cohort status updated from the previous day 2 nymph development and adult aging 3 life stage transitions 4 emigration of newly emerged alate adults 5 mortality 6 parasitism where applicable and 7 remaining adults produce offspring into the following day s cohort fig 1 these steps were performed on both alate and apterous wingless aphid sub populations at the end of the simulation the total number of individuals within each life history stage adults or nymphs and morphological type were tallied on each timestep providing a prediction of the population dynamics of aphids throughout the simulation period it was assumed that all aphids are female reflecting the predominant parthenogenic reproduction strategy of m persicae in australia 2 2 2 aphid development life stage transitions and adult dispersal the impacts of temperature on aphid nymph development rate follows a wang model eqn 1 according to 1 dr t h 1 e r t d t opt 1 e t t la ϑ 1 e t ua t ϑ where d r t is the proportion of development achieved at a given temperature t h and r are scalars d t o p t t l a and t u a are the optimum temperature and lower and upper thresholds for development respectively while ϑ represents the boundary width at the upper and lower temperatures for every time step in the simulation development units were accumulated in an additive manner until development of the cohort was complete nymphs of future alate adults develop at a slower rate than those of future apterous aphids liu and meng 1999 so parameters of the above function were adjusted accordingly table 1 upon adult emergence a set proportion of alate adults emigrate from the population inverse of ω and these individuals were immediately removed from the population before any further calculations 2 2 3 aphid mortality the impacts of extreme temperatures on m persicae survival are described with a super gaussian function such that daily mortality rates increase as daily maximum t x and minimum t n temperatures diverge from the upper and lower development thresholds respectively t u a and t l a esm fig 1b 2 temp erat ure mort ality 1 e π aphid x n χ t x n ψ aphid 6 here π a p h i d x n and ψ a p h i d combine to impact the rate at which survival declines beyond the temperature thresholds parameterized to ensure that daily mortality rate was 0 5 at temperatures previously measured to induce 50 mortality in the laboratory in many insect species mortality rate occurs faster as temperature increases beyond the critical thermal maximum ct max in comparison to dropping below the critical thermal minimum ct min terblanche et al 2011 to reflect this asymmetry we fitted the value of the π a p h i d x n term independently for the two temperature extremes heavy rainfall events are associated with increased aphid mortality according to a function defined by thackray et al 2004 and later adjusted for m persicae by maling et al 2010 3 rain fall mort ality 0 026 rf 0 33 specifically aphid mortality increases linearly as r f daily rainfall increases from 15 mm to 30 mm after which mortality is capped at 50 we modelled changes in survival rates senescence with respect to the aphid s calendar age from birth according to a gompertz survival function eqn 4 esm fig 1c 4 s e n e s c e n c e 1 e δ β 1 e β a g e where δ and β represent the shape and gradient of the curve respectively an additional source of daily background mortality ζaphid capturing all other lethal processes other than those explicitly modelled here predation by other species and random chance was assumed to occur at a default rate of 0 03 bannerman and roitberg 2014 overall mortality of each cohort on any given timestep eqn 5 was thus calculated by 5 d a i l y m o r t a l i t y r a t e t e m p e r a t u r e m o r t a l i t y r a i n f a l l m o r t a l i t y s e n e s c e n c e b a c k g r o u n d m o r t a l i t y 2 2 4 aphid fecundity reproduction in adult m persicae commences one day after adult emergence peaks four days after emergence and then declines thereafter a weibull distribution eqn 6 most accurately describes this pattern 6 daily fecu ndity age κ ι γ age η γ ι 1 e age η γ ι where ι γ and η are the shape scale and location parameters respectively and κ scales fecundity along the y axis such that the default maximum nymphs produced per day at the optimal age is eight esm fig 1d the impact of temperature on daily fecundity of m persicae is described with a quadratic function with an optimum temperature r t o p t of 25 c eqn 7 predicted fecundity was then adjusted to generate a scaling parameter between 0 and 1 7 t e m p e r a t u r e s c a l a r t ξ a t 2 ξ b t ξ a r t o p t 2 ξ b r t o p t finally daily fecundity of aphids is also dependent on the population density a d e n s reflecting a typical logistic growth rate esm fig 1e this function and corresponding parameters were drawn from a previous modelling study based on m persicae bannerman and roitberg 2014 8 dens ity scal ar adens 1 1 1 e ρ adens d where d describes the inflection point of the logistic regression curve ρ determines the rate of decline in fecundity as population density increases and a d e n s was assumed to be the density of the day s population once mortality and dispersal have been applied the realised daily fecundity eqn 9 per adult was determined by 9 real ised fecu ndity dens ity scal ar temp erat ure scal ar daily fecu ndity which was multiplied by the number of adults in each cohort the resulting offspring were summed to produce a new cohort of nymphs that commence development in the following time step alate adults are known to produce fewer offspring than their apterae counterparts and so the realised fecundity of alate females was further reduced according to an alate fecundity penalty υ table 1 2 2 5 production of alates the proportion of offspring that are destined to develop into alate adults is in part dependent on the density of the population a d e n s whereby more alates are produced as the population grows esm fig 1f to our knowledge there are no published data describing this pattern for m persicae and so we drew on a function eqn 10 defined for the cherry oat aphid rhopalosiphum padi morgan 2000 parry et al 2006 10 a l a t e p r o d u c t i o n z 1 e x p w a d e n s z ω where ω represents the density threshold at which alates are first produced note the proportion of alate offspring are capped at 50 bannerman and roitberg 2014 2 3 parasitoid model diaeretiella rapae 2 3 1 background population of wasps two characteristics of the initial d rapae population were defined by the user prior to each simulation run 1 the simulation days on which wasps intercept the aphid population and 2 the density of wasps that do so these population level traits have the option of being randomly assigned to reflect a more realistic field situation but for the purposes of this study such dynamics were specified deterministically 2 3 2 rates of parasitism although data on the functional response of d rapae parasitising m persicae could not be found the trait was assumed to be similar to that of d rapae on the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia tazerouni et al 2012 while previous studies suggest that parasitism rates of d rapae differ slightly on diuraphis noxia compared with m persicae bernal et al 1994 yu et al 1993 both interactions follow a type ii response and so we deem this substitution to be valid and rates are calibrated to the field with a scalar value ϕ see below as such we describe parasitism rates in this model with the random parasitoid equation rogers 1972 a type ii response curve without replacement assuming no interference between multiple wasps esm fig 2 a 11 n e n 0 1 e t av n 0 t h φ where α is the attack rate th is the handling time and t a v is the total amount of time available to the parasitoids in this case the daily timestep t a v 1 diaeretiella rapae prefers to parasitise 2nd and 3rd instar aphid nymphs of the cabbage aphid brevicornye brassicae and the turnip aphid lipaphis pseudobrassicae khakasa et al 2016 and so we assumed this was also the case for m persicae bannerman and roitberg 2014 the number of aphids available for parasitism n 0 was therefore defined as the number of aphids in the 2nd and 3rd nymphal stages where wasps do not discriminate between apterous or alate aphids to calibrate parasitism rates from the laboratory into field conditions the number of aphids attacked was further multiplied by a scalar value ϕ tazerouni et al 2012 report parasitism rates of d rapae on diuraphis noxia across six temperatures and given temperature also appears to similarly impact parasitism of m persicae yu et al 1993 we have assumed the thermal response holds across host species drawing on these data tazerouni et al 2012 and following the approach of zamani et al 2007 we re parameterised equation 11 with data from each temperature independently to determine temperature specific values for α and t h we then defined two linear models describing the correlation with temperature whereby 12 α 0 00001084 t 3 0 0021 t 2 0 0272 t 0 0145 and 13 t h 1 0 298 t 3 0 0035 t 2 0 000256 t 1 395 these two functions were incorporated into the random predator equation eqn 11 so that the impacts of both temperature and aphid density on the parasitism rates of d rapae were accounted for 2 3 3 wasp development development rates of d rapae larvae were assumed to be sensitive to the temperature within their host according to a lactin function eqn 14 esm fig 2b 14 d r t e ε t e ε t u w t t u w τ λ where ε τ and λ are fitted parameters and t u w is the upper developmental temperature threshold of the wasp this upper developmental temperature could not be found for d rapae or closely related species and so a value for another parasitoid aphelinus certus frewin et al 2010 was substituted wasp larvae developing within their hosts become visible to observers can be detected as a mummy upon reaching 60 development gutiérrez ibáñez et al 2007 and the number of visible mummies on each given day was tallied finally although sex ratio of wasps can vary under field conditions for simplicity it is assumed that adult wasps emerge with an equal sex ratio and that 50 of females remain in the population for one additional day to parasitise susceptible aphid nymphs and commence a new generation of wasps kant et al 2012 weisser and völkl 1997 2 3 4 wasp mortality published data on the impacts of acute temperature stress on d rapae critical thermal limits could not be found and so we drew on measurements of emergence success of adults reared in m persicae at a range of temperatures i e chronic stress souza et al 2017 these data were used to parameterise the super gaussian function in accordance with the aphid model eqn 2 with parameters πwasp and ψwasp esm fig 2c the impacts of heavy rainfall on wasps both adults and larvae were defined according to equation 3 and the background mortality rates ζwasp set at 0 03 also to reflect that of the aphid population 2 4 canola model brassica napus host plant availability and palatability directly constrain the presence and abundance of herbivorous insects such as m persicae in time and space to describe this bottom up control we focused on canola b napus as its most abundant secondary host plant in australia we used an established modelling platform agricultural predictions systems simulator apsim v 7 10 holzworth et al 2014 to make predictions of the presence and aphid carrying capacity of canola at locations of interest briefly apsim integrates daily climate variables fig 1 with information on soil and water availability to track the development of canola with growing degree day calculations robertson and lilley 2016 climatic data are sourced from the scientific information for land owners online patched point database silo provided by the queensland department natural resources and mines https legacy longpaddock qld gov au silo jeffrey et al 2001 for our simulations we have 1 assumed the canola is the stingray variety chosen to complement associated field experiments in prep 2 defined sowing dates typical to a location of interest see below and 3 made no further modifications to the apsim source code the apsim simulations were run and predictions of the crop s growth stage incorporated as an input into the insect models to influence their population dynamics in two ways fig 1 firstly we assumed that the initial immigrating aphids cannot establish colonies until seedlings of the canola crop have emerged dictating the commencement of the simulation and that colonies cannot persist once the crop has been harvested terminating the simulation ward et al 1998 maling et al 2010 congdon et al 2019 secondly it was assumed that the canola s growth stage has a direct impact on its aphid carrying capacity it increases with vegetative growth up until the end of stem elongation gs 40 in bbch decimal system after which it declines as the plant matures and senesces thackray et al 2009 this pattern is described with a normal distribution leather and dixon 1981 where µ 760 and σ2 250 which we have scaled between 0 and 1 the density dependence function equation 8 of the aphid population was multiplied by this scalar such that the carrying capacity varies daily as the canola develops 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were conducted using the bayesian analysis of computer code outputs bacco approach with the gaussian emulator model sensitivity analysis programme gem sa kennedy et al 2006 o hagan 2006 parry et al 2013 rather than varying one parameter at a time this technique varies all parameters at once such that the full parameter space is represented in a computationally efficient manner o hagan 2006 parry et al 2013 the model is then run with unique combinations of parameter values with the outputs generated from these iterations a gaussian process model is fit to a variable of interest e g total aphid density to generate an emulator model this emulator in turn assesses which parameters have the greatest relative influence on the models output see parry et al 2013 for further details 2 5 1 aphid model for the aphid model ten parameters were intitially selected representing key population dynamic processes shown in table 1 these parameters were selected as they influence the species response curves in such a way that is expected by populations adapting to local abiotic conditions e g populations in regions with greater temperature variability evolve broader thermal tolerances esm fig 1 and fig 2 a range of values for each parameter around the default value was defined within the bounds of uncertainty ensuring that biological realism was maintained in each case we generated 100 combinations of the ten parameter values assuming a uniform probability distribution and an input design approximating a lp τ distribution the model was then run 100 times each iteration containing a unique combination of the ten parameters in these simulations the wasp sub model was de activated and runs continued for 150 days during which daily temperature and rainfall were maintained at 20 c and 0 mm respectively for each model iteration the total pest pressure during the simulation the area under the population curve of the aphids was calculated and the relative effect of each parameter on this metric was assessed with the gem sa software here we present the main effects of each parameter defined as the impact of the given parameter to the total variance among the model iterations in comparison to the remaining parameters the procedure above was repeated to assess whether the influential parameters identified under constant optimal temperature and rainfall were equally as important under realistic field conditions climate data including daily minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall mm were sourced from the silo database see above at burnley in victoria latitude 37 83 longitude 145 01 spanning 791 days from 2nd december 1959 until 27th february 1961 the location and time period correspond with a study of m persicae that we used to validate the model o loughin et al 1963 esm 3 1 in this sensitivity analysis we included an additional parameter that defines rates of mortality under extreme temperatures ζaphid 2 5 2 wasp model to perform a sensitivity analysis on the wasp sub model we returned the aphid parameters to their default values table 1 and tested three parameters in the wasp model table 2 it was assumed that one adult wasp intercepted the aphid colony on a daily basis during which it was able to parasitise susceptible aphids the relative influence of each parameter on the predicted number of visible mummies throughout the simulation area under the mummy population curve was analysed this analysis was performed under optimal see above and field conditions in the latter we incorporated temperature and rainfall records at a location in western victoria mercer 37 91 143 17 during the canola growing season of 2018 18th may 23rd november this location and time period capture conditions during field surveys of m persicae and d rapae ward et al 2021 esm 3 2 and we included an additional parameter table 1 in these analyses to assess the relative impacts of extreme temperatures on wasp mortality ζwasp 2 6 model calibration and validation 2 6 1 aphid model calibration having developed the models on laboratory data the parameters needed to be calibrated to ensure that the model performed adequately in the australian field context for the aphid sub model we drew on observations of m persicae made by o loughlin 1963 at burnley from 2nd december 1959 until 27th february 1961 where dispersing m persicae alate adults were captured using both moericke and sticky traps combined here at weekly intervals we made use of the 100 model iterations already performed as part of the sensitivity analyses in which the field temperature and rainfall data at the location were integrated from the model outputs we compared predictions of dispersing aphids the number of alate adults that disperse away from the population to the observed number of m persicae captured in the traps while the temporal resolution of the predicted daily and observed weekly datasets differs traps generally capture a small proportion of individuals in the field taylor 1974 and thus we believe this comparison of absolute aphid densities is justified burnley is an urban location with a variety of potential host plants and so these simulations were run throughout the full year assuming that the absence of winter host plants i e canola was not a limiting factor for aphid survival the 100 different parameterisations of the model were then ranked in order of how well they predicted the observed aphid trap captures according to the root mean square error rmse 15 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 where y i is the predicted and x i is the observed aphid density an analysis of variance anova was then used to assess whether the model of best fit that with the lowest rmse predicted the observed aphids significantly better than the model containing the default parameters the model iteration that most accurately predicted dispersing aphids at burnley from 1959 until 1961 rmse mbf 40 05 did not differ significantly t 191 0 682 p 0 496 from that with the default values rmse default 43 26 which was ranked 4th of 100 possible iterations as such given the default model was defined from previous studies the aphid model was run with the default parameter values for all simulations hereafter esm fig 3 1 2 6 2 aphid model validation to assess how the default aphid model performed under novel conditions it was validated with additional field collected datasets from several locations and time series in addition to burnley o loughlin 1963 made observations at two additional sites toolangi 37 53 145 64 and werribee 37 89 144 66 these locations are some distance apart 100 km and although captures were made in the same time period we treat the collections as independent datasets the model was run with temperature and rainfall observations at each location and predictions of dispersing alate adults were compared with those observed in the traps we conducted another validation of the aphid model with data from an additional study using monthly trap captures of m persicae from six locations in south eastern australia during 1961 hughes et al 1964 here the approach outlined above was repeated with relevant climate data incorporated as inputs esm fig 9 1 to statistically test how well the model performed at these eight locations o loughlin 1963 hughes et al 1964 we considered three metrics relevant to aphid infestations in canola throughout the growing season in southern australia 1 the timing of the autumn population outbreak day on which aphid density peaks in the first half of the year 2 the severity of the autumn outbreak peak aphid density in the first half of the year and 3 the total pest pressure throughout the annual cycle area under the aphid population curve over 365 days to calculate these metrics only days on which aphids were observed were considered i e observed aphid densities were not interpolated across the monthly or weekly trap captures we compared the observed and predicted metrics with a paired student s t test where n 8 field observations of migrating m persicae have more recently been made at a location in south australia near kapunda 34 39 138 89 at weekly intervals from 20th april 2016 until 31st december 2018 using a 1 8 m suction trap unpublished data these contemporary data were also used to validate the model the trap in this study was placed in an area dominated by cereal and canola crops and so the simulation commenced at the time of canola sowing and terminated seven days after harvest as predicted by the growing degree day apsim model in addition the density dependence of the aphid population varies through each year in line with the canola s carrying capacity see description of canola model the time of sowing varies from year to year robertson et al 2004 and to include this source of variation in aphid population dynamics three simulations with typical early 15th april middle 1st may and late 31st may sowing dates grdc 2018 were run each year was run in a separate simulation with daily temperature and rainfall records during this growing period sourced from the silo database and incorporated into the model predicted dispersing aphids were then compared with those observed in the suction trap 2 6 3 wasp model calibration the calibration procedure described above was repeated for the wasp sub model drawing on the 100 model simulations run for the wasp sensitivity analysis with climate data for mercer at this location counts of aphid and mummy densities were conducted on five occasions during spring in 2018 at three weekly intervals within a canola field ward et al 2021 the model simulations commenced on the day aphids were first observed in the field and continued until ten days after the final observation was made in accordance with the sensitivity analyses one adult wasp intercepted the aphid colony on a daily basis during which it was able to parasitise susceptible aphid nymphs from the model outputs the predicted number of visible mummies were compared with those from the field study there was significant variation in absolute mummy densities among sites and although fairly typical of observations of these species this makes the use of such data as a calibration tool for models challenging bahlai et al 2013 nonetheless we were able to approximate a model of best fit according to the lowest rmse eqn 15 which was compared with the default parameter values using the same anova approach described above to confirm that the interaction between wasps and aphids was adequately captured we also compared the predicted ratio of mummies with aphids aphid mummy ratio number of aphids number of visible mummies within each population with corresponding observed aphid mummy ratios where aphid colonies were subjected to parasitism by d rapae the default model under estimated the number of visible mummies and thus overestimated the aphid mummy ratio esm fig 3 2 rmse default 24 41 ranked 38th of 100 in contrast the model of best fit more accurately predicted the absolute numbers of mummies timing of mummy development and the aphid mummy ratio esm fig 3 2 rmse mbf 11 34 given the significant differences in accuracy between the default model and the model of best fit t 13 139 76 p 0 001 we used the calibrated model for all wasp simulations hereafter see esm 3 2 for further discussion of the calibration results 2 6 4 wasp model validation to validate the wasp model we drew on observations of mummy densities at two additional locations wilson 37 85 143 37 and peel 38 16 144 00 collected during the same period as those used to calibrate the model at mercer ward et al 2021 these fields are 70 km apart and we considered them to be independent the calibrated wasp model with the default parameters in the aphid model was run with local temperature and rainfall records simulations commenced on the day on which aphids were first observed in the field and continued until ten days after the final observation was made in accordance with the sensitivity analyses described above one adult wasp intercepted the aphid colony on a daily basis during which it was able to parasitise susceptible aphid nymphs as above model performance at these two additional locations was assessed by comparing the observed and predicted number of visible mummies and aphid mummy ratios 2 7 climate change scenarios having validated the insect models with field datasets they were then extrapolated into novel climates to assess how these species may respond to future changes in climate we based the climate scenarios on daily weather records from 1960 until 1969 at burnley in victoria australian bureau of meteorology station number 086095 http www bom gov au climate data termed the reference weather dataset hereafter adjustments to this dataset were then made generating three rainfall and four temperature scenarios 12 climate scenarios esm fig 4 the rainfall scenarios represented typically dry wet and average rainfall years reflecting 10th percentile 454 mm 90th percentile 845 mm and median long term total annual rainfall 606 mm at the location daily rainfall records in the reference weather dataset were adjusted such that total annual rainfall equated to these amounts esm fig 4 current and future temperature projections were sourced from the access 1 0 model bi et al 2013 which forms part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cimp6 riahi et al 2011 taylor 1974 accessed at esri http pcmdi9 llnl gov monthly projections were considered with a relative concentration pathway of 8 5 rcp8 5 which although the most extreme of the forcing experiments appears to be tracking current trajectories ipcc 2014 jackson et al 2017 temperature projections across three periods of ten years were extracted capturing current 2006 2015 near future 2040 2049 and distant future 2090 2099 conditions given access 1 0 performs well in predicting past climates watterson et al 2013 for consistency among scenarios we also sourced climate projections from the historical modelling experiment extracting monthly temperatures from 1960 until 1969 historical period for each of the four temperature scenarios the average decadal t min and t max were determined we subsequently adjusted the daily t min and t max in the reference weather dataset such that the decadal average temperatures equated to those in each of the four temperature scenarios esm fig 4 the models were then run with the 12 climate scenarios with and without the wasp model 24 scenarios in total each year within each decade was run in a separate simulation and across these 10 year replicates the average number of aphids on each day of the year was determined to ensure realistic predictions of species densities during the first few weeks of each year a burn in period is required this was achieved by duplicating each year s climate data running the simulation across the resulting 24 consecutive months and then extracting only the second 12 month period for analyses while host plant availability can act as a bottleneck for aphid populations in australia for simplicity it is assumed that host plants are available to the aphids throughout the full simulation period in addition to tracking dispersing aphid densities through the year we calculated the pest pressure see definition above during the canola growing period predicted by the apsim model in 2019 at burnley from the 15th april until the predicted harvest date on the 12th november an anova was used to quantify the relative impacts of climate scenario and wasp presence on pest pressure which was log transformed to account for unequal variance among scenarios 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis of aphid model in total 99 of the variance in total pest pressure among the 100 model iterations under constant temperature and rainfall was explained by the ten parameters table 3 esm fig 5 the parameter describing the population s carrying capacity d accounted for the majority of this variation increasing this threshold from 5 000 to 15 000 led to an increase in pest pressure from 20 to 60 million aphids when field records of temperature and rainfall were incorporated into the model the population s carrying capacity was again the most influential parameter although it accounted for only half of the total variance table 3 esm fig 6 the second most influential parameter defined the rate of adult senescence where higher rates of aging led to reduced pest pressure the aphid s sensitivity to stressful temperature ψaphid was the third most influential parameter 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of wasp model under constant temperature and rainfall conditions three parameters considered in the sensitivity analysis of the wasp model accounted for 95 3 of the variation in the total number of visible mummies table 3 esm fig 7 two thirds of this variance could be attributed to the parasitism rate of female wasps φ where increases in parasitism resulted in increases in the number of visible mummies within the aphid colony rates of background mortality mostly accounted for the remainder of the total variance such that lower mortality rates increase the number of wasp larvae developing within the aphid colony esm fig 8 a high proportion of variance 84 in visible mummy densities could also be attributed to four model parameters under fluctuating temperature and rainfall although the relative importance of each parameter differed in comparison to constant conditions table 3 the wasp s sensitivity to extreme temperatures accounted for the majority of the model output s variance greater sensitivity to heat and cold led to higher mortality and a reduction in visible mummies table 3 esm fig 8 in contrast parasitism rate appears to play a relatively minor role in determining densities of visible mummies in the field 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 validation of aphid model when the aphid model was run with climate data from the three locations considered by o loughlin 1963 predictions approximated the absolute numbers of dispersing aphids over the 14 month period fig 2 the timing and absolute number of dispersing aphids were accurately predicted in the autumn outbreak at each location while a spring outbreak of aphids was also observed the model did not accurately predict this migration event at burnley and werribee the absolute densities were predicted but the timing of the outbreaks were approximately three weeks late fig 2a 2c at toolangi the model failed to predict the spring migration altogether fig 2b statistical validation of the model predictions against observed population dynamics at eight locations in south eastern australia o loughlin 1963 and hughes 1964 confirmed these qualitative comparisons the predicted timing of the autumn peak outbreak t 7 0 42 p 0 69 and the total pest pressure t 7 1 79 p 0 12 did not differ significantly from the observed population metrics however the model failed to predict absolute aphid densities at the autumn outbreak compared with those captured in traps in the field t 7 2 73 p 0 03 see esm fig 9 2 for further details validation of the model against aphid observations collected at kapunda from 2016 to 2018 also confirmed that the model generally performs well under contemporary climates irrespective of when canola is sown the model accurately predicted the seasonal timing of aphid migrations in all three years fig 3 substantial inter annual variation in aphid observations is negatively correlated with annual rainfall esm fig 10a which the model detected in 2016 and 2017 fig 3 4 b in 2018 low rainfall however the model failed to predict two weeks with very high numbers of dispersing aphids although it approximated observed densities on either side of this outbreak fig 3 3 2 2 validation of wasp model the number of mummies observed at multiple aphid populations within the canola field at the three locations wilson and peel were highly variable ranging from an absence of mummies in some aphid populations to over 50 in others on the same day while such variability renders the calibration and validation of the non spatial aphid and wasp models challenging some general comparisons and conclusions can be made at all three locations the calibrated model performed relatively well at predicting the absolute number of visible mummies and the ratio of aphids mummies in aphid colonies exposed to d rapae fig 4 3 3 climate change simulations there was a significant interaction between temperature regime and the presence of wasps on the predicted aphid presence in the crop wasps temperature f 3 222 168 19 p 0 001 fig 5 b 5d in the absence of wasps warmer temperatures predicted into the future led to an overall increase in aphid densities during the canola growing season fig 5a 6c while this general trend was also apparent in the presence of wasps the pattern was not significant indeed under all twelve climate scenarios aphid densities were significantly reduced when wasps were included in the simulation f 1 222 2660 55 p 0 001 fig 5d irrespective of temperature and the presence or absence of wasps aphid densities were reduced under the wet rainfall scenario f 2 222 10 41 p 0 001 fig 5c 5d the seasonal patterns of aphid outbreaks also varied among climate scenarios in the absence of wasps under relatively cold historical conditions aphid densities peaked during summer but remained at low levels for the remainder of the year fig 5a in contrast warmer current and near future climates induced autumn and spring migrations separated by periods of reduced aphid densities in summer and winter as is typically observed in the field fig 5a in the hottest distant future scenario aphid densities were suppressed over summer but were predicted to have relatively higher densities during winter these seasonal patterns were consistent across all rainfall scenarios the median rainfall scenario only is shown in fig 5a when the wasp sub model was included in the simulations fig 5b 5d aphid densities were entirely suppressed in the historical climate scenarios under the three warmer climates aphid outbreaks were observed in autumn although the relative timing and absolute densities of aphid migrations varied between temperature profiles in addition wasps were predicted to suppress outbreaks of aphids in spring under all climate scenarios fig 5b 4 discussion the process based simulation model presented here primarily developed on existing physiological datasets accurately predicted numerous aspects of the population dynamics of m persicae at several locations and time series without the need for additional calibration and in cases where the model failed to predict aphid outbreaks the underlying model processes that led to such discrepancies can be identified and explored further while some parameters in the d rapae model required calibration it too performed relatively well against observed aphid mummy counts in the field we applied the model to predict with some confidence the likely effects of future climate scenarios on aphid populations and their suppression by d rapae the model indicates that while increased temperatures and drier winters lead to higher aphid abundance over the canola growing season wasps can suppress aphid outbreaks especially when abiotic stress is simultaneously encountered by the aphid population as with all models some processes that impact the species densities are not described however the mechanistic nature of the approach allows us to tease apart important drivers of pest outbreaks and identify gaps in our current knowledge in the absence of top down mortality the wasp model de activated rising temperatures led to an overall increase in aphid densities which is expected snyder and ives 2003 also the seasonal timing of population dynamics varied considerably between temperature scenarios and this finding is perhaps more important for informing how m persicae could be managed moving forward in the distant future scenario aphid populations are predicted to thrive over winter but collapse over summer a key component of management strategies for m persicae in australia is to minimise the green bridge over summer in order to reduce the number of aphids immigrating into crops in autumn congdon et al 2019 coutts et al 2006 under future climates such strategies may become less important in some regions given aphids will be unable to persist over the summer months our simulations indicate that farmers can rely on d rapae to provide some level of suppression of population outbreaks of m persicae even under future climates in line with previous modelling and empirical studies bannerman and roitberg 2014 romo and tylianakis 2013 warmer temperatures are likely to be advantageous for wasps allowing females to parasitise more aphids thus over riding any positive impacts of rising temperature on aphid populations despite this overall improved performance of the wasps the level of control exerted by d rapae on m persicae is expected to vary between years for example under the current climate scenario in some years aphid numbers are expected to peak at 60 dispersing aphids a day while in other years they may not exceed ten dispersers per day further inspection of the modelling outputs suggests that years with greater aphid suppression coincide with ambient conditions that cause the aphid population to be stressed i e cold temperatures during the historical scenario and wet years in the current and future scenarios these patterns arising from an interaction between abiotic stress and wasp control need to be further investigated in the field in addition to changing abiotic stressors altered interactions with other competitors or natural enemies might play a role in shaping the responses of m persicae and d rapae to climate change non linear changes in crop physiology in response to changing temperature and co2 levels may also impact insect life history traits and population dynamics bezemer et al 1998 dáder et al 2015 holton et al 2003 moreover insects in the field do not experience abiotic stressors independently of one another as defined here but rather interactions thereof for example rates of insect mortality due to high temperature in the tsetse fly glossina spp are faster during periods of low relative humidity kleynhans and terblanche 2011 data on these responses is unfortunately still limited and thus are rarely included in modelling studies indeed explicitly defining the above processes is beyond the scope of this study we have assumed stable non interacting performance curves among climate scenarios and a constant constraint on aphid background mortality in addition we have assumed that these interactions remain true across different locations in the landscape which is unlikely such altered biotic and abiotic interactions under novel climates should be kept in mind when interpreting the model s predictions sensitivity analyses identified life history traits that are most important for driving population dynamics under constant conditions the aphid s carrying capacity and the wasp s parasitism rate are identified as key parameters impacting population densities while such bottom up controls will limit population growth in the field under fluctuating temperatures insect densities are also constrained by the thermal impacts on mortality including aphid senescence table 3 thus the relative importance of these different constraints on population dynamics food availability versus ambient stress will in part be determined by the temperature regime at a given location the results obtained here highlight the importance of sensitivity testing models under a range of input scenarios to better understand how they might behave in different contexts in some instances the model failed to predict the timing and abundance of aphid population outbreaks esm 9 for example the model failed to predict the spring outbreak in 1961 in toolangi fig 2b because cold conditions prevented immigrating aphids from establishing colonies toolangi has an elevation of 585m a s l and compared with all other locations in the study is surrounded by topographically heterogeneous terrain ambient conditions vary with topography suggitt et al 2011 affecting insect microclimates and their thermally sensitive physiological traits barton and terblanche 2014 bennie 2008 as such the stressfully cold temperatures measured by the weather station which were used in the model may be buffered allowing aphid populations to establish and grow scherrer and körner 2011 incorporating a microclimate model in the framework which translates ambient conditions measured at the weather stations 1 2 m high into the immediate conditions encountered by the pest might help the model to account for the discrepancies observed here while the model performed well during 2016 and 2017 at kapunda in 2018 it failed to predict two weeks of observations in which more than 150 dispersing m persicae aphids were caught fig 3 the number of dispersing aphids predicted by the model is directly proportional to the number of alate adults maturing on any given day table 1 studies have shown however that environmental conditions and deteriorating plant health can directly trigger mass dispersal events of pests for example moradi vajargh and parry 2017 showed that temperatures between 35 c and 40 c in the laboratory can induce almost 100 take off in both sexes of the rutherglen bug nysius vinitor bergroth as well as thermal stress the high dispersal rates in 2018 may have been in response to the advanced crop senescence caused by drought stress bailey et al 1995 for simplicity we have not yet defined these processes in the model or indeed constrained dispersal to within a typical thermal flight activity range broadbent 1949 moradi vajargah and parry 2017 from a management perspective dispersal ability has implications for the spread of not only pests but also any diseases they carry parry 2013 and so the inclusion of such information would improve the model s applicability as a decision support tool very few studies incorporate direct impacts of rainfall into insect population dynamic models maling et al 2010 thackray et al 2004 many claim to incorporate weather data but the majority account for temperature impacts only see mcdonald et al 2015 and barton et al 2019 in our study applying the direct impacts of rainfall on aphid mortality improved the fit of the model when the rainfall function equation 3 was de activated it failed to detect the observed inter annual variation in aphid densities at kapunda esm fig 11 while this observation data esm fig 10 confirmed anecdotal accounts of the impacts of heavy downpours on aphid densities the explicit mechanisms through which this occurs remains unclear the rainfall function defined by thackray et al 2004 is based on data of the english grain aphid sitobion avenue fabricius experiments have shown heavy rainfall events increase the number of aphids that are lost from the plant s leaves thackray et al 2004 as well as a greater propensity for alate aphid dispersal mann et al 1995 different to this species m persicae typically occupies the lower leaves of their host plants and thus may be sheltered from the direct impacts of heavy rainfall harrington and xia nian 1984 5 conclusion while stressful ambient conditions for m persicae are predicted to enhance the biological control capabilities of d rapae much remains unknown as to how these species will interact with their immediate host plant and the broader agricultural landscape thierry et al 2020 both of which are already under intense management and will be subject to climate change moreover management decisions must balance multiple considerations including the impacts of other pests and diseases market access and financial costs nonetheless here we develop a modelling framework that provides a baseline in which subtle interactions and management scenarios might be included the approach taken here translating globally collected laboratory datasets into field predictions and validating these provides a methodology for integrating pre existing knowledge on the ecologies of insect pests into forecasting tools which can then be applied to relevant scales for management purposes 6 author contributions mb and hp developed and wrote the model and

24569,for decades scientists have produced maps of biological ecological and environmental variables these studies commonly evaluate the map accuracy through cross validation with the data used for calibrating the underlying mapping model recent studies however have argued that cross validation statistics of most mapping studies are optimistically biased they attribute these overoptimistic results to a supposed serious methodological flaw in standard cross validation methods namely that these methods ignore spatial autocorrelation in the data they argue that spatial cross validation should be used instead and contend that standard cross validation methods are inherently invalid in a geospatial context because of the autocorrelation present in most spatial data here we argue that these studies propagate a widespread misconception of statistical validation of maps we explain that unbiased estimates of map accuracy indices can be obtained by probability sampling and design based inference and illustrate this with a numerical experiment on large scale above ground biomass mapping in our experiment standard cross validation i e ignoring autocorrelation led to smaller bias than spatial cross validation standard cross validation was deficient in case of a strongly clustered dataset that had large differences in sampling density but less so than spatial cross validation we conclude that spatial cross validation methods have no theoretical underpinning and should not be used for assessing map accuracy while standard cross validation is deficient in case of clustered data model free design unbiased and valid accuracy assessment is achieved with probability sampling and design based inference it is valid without the need to explicitly incorporate or adjust for spatial autocorrelation and perfectly suited for the validation of large scale biological ecological and environmental maps keywords map quality model performance above ground biomass sampling theory design based model based random forest design unbiased code and data availability all statistical analysis code data and results of the case study are available via an open access link at https github com alexandrewadoux spatialvalidation for the spatial cross validation strategies we used the original code provided in ploton et al 2020 1 introduction in recent years mapping studies have provided new insights into continental and global patterns of biogeographical variables some recent examples include global scale maps of soil fungi tedersoo et al 2014 bacteria delgado baquerizo et al 2018 and nematodes van den hoogen et al 2019 landcover change song et al 2018 forest cover change hansen et al 2013 and aboveground biomass baccini et al 2012 among others commonly in these studies the map accuracy is evaluated using statistical measures that evaluate how close the predictions z ˆ s are to the reality z s for a set of locations s d where d is the area of interest i e the population in practice the area of interest is often discretized by overlaying it with a fine grid popular population map accuracy indices are the mean error me root mean squared error rmse the squared pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 these indices are computed either by collecting a new set of data or by using the existing dataset for both model calibration and validation collecting a new set of data is ideally done by probability sampling the sample data are used to estimate the map accuracy indices through design based statistical inference based on classical sampling theory this method is statistically sound and has been extensively described in the statistical cochran 1977 and environmental science e g de gruijter et al 2006 gregoire and valentine 2007 literature but when data are scarce it is sensible to use the available data for both model calibration and validation burt et al 2009 in such case the existing dataset is split into two subsets called calibration and validation folds the calibration fold is used to calibrate a mapping model and make predictions whereas the validation fold is used to estimate the map accuracy indices this procedure can be repeated several times as in bootstrapping when multiple bootstrap samples with replacement are used for calibration and prediction or as in cross validation cv hastie et al 2009 in cv the data are split randomly into k disjoint folds each fold is put aside in turn and used to evaluate the predictions obtained from a model calibrated on the remaining k 1 folds conventionally k is set to 10 10 fold cv but k can also be equal to the sample size as in leave one out cv an advantage of cv and other data splitting strategies is that the existing data are used to evaluate map accuracy without the cost of additional sampling several recent studies brenning 2005 le rest et al 2014 roberts et al 2017 ploton et al 2020 however contend that statistical validation of maps should account for spatial autocorrelation between data points data collected at points that are geographically close generally are more similar than at points that are geographically distant as a consequence these studies claim that map accuracy indices as derived using standard cv are biased because calibration points are not statistically independent from validation points this conception of model validation has led to the recent development of cv techniques that avoid spatial autocorrelation such as spatial k fold cv and buffered leave one out cv b loo cv the study of ploton et al 2020 for example asserts that validation statistics should only be computed on validation points that are spatially independent from the calibration points and found in an experiment on mapping the above ground forest biomass in central africa that this resulted in quasi null predictive model performance here we argue that spatial cv techniques presented by recent studies on biological ecological and environmental mapping such as in le rest et al 2014 ploton et al 2020 hengl et al 2021 for example give rise to a misconception of statistical validation of maps in a spatial context there is a serious risk that practitioners misinterpret spatial cv techniques and reject long standing standard and statistically valid methods for assessing map accuracy in the following we explain why we should not use spatial cv techniques for estimating map accuracy indices and instead adhere to statistically rigorous methods of validation via probability sampling and design based inference our theoretical argument is illustrated with a case study 2 evaluation of map accuracy with probability sampling map accuracy indices are defined as population parameters the rmse for example as a finite population parameter is defined as rmse 1 n i 1 n z ˆ s i z s i 2 i e the square root of the squared prediction errors averaged over all n units i e grid cells in the population note that for infinite populations the map accuracy indices are defined as an integral in practice it is usually impossible to compute the map accuracy indices because one would need to take a census of the whole population instead a subset of n units is selected where typically n n and this sample is used to estimate the map accuracy indices i e the population validation parameters if the sample is a probability sample classical sampling theory can be used to estimate these population validation parameters using design based estimation stehman 1999 de gruijter et al 2006 gregoire and valentine 2007 stehman and foody 2009 brus et al 2011 this has the important advantage that one can prove that the estimates are unbiased and that valid confidence intervals can be computed probability samples have two characteristics all units in the population must have a positive probability of being selected and these inclusion probabilities must be known for at least the selected population units points the most basic probability sampling design is simple random sampling in which case all samples of a given size number of units have equal probability of being selected and a design based estimate of the population rmse is obtained by rmse 1 n i 1 n z ˆ s i z s i 2 there are also more complex probability sampling designs exploiting the spatial structure of the data such as stratified random sampling de gruijter et al 2015 balanced sampling deville and tillé 2004 brus 2015 and the local pivotal method grafström et al 2012 these designs are often more efficient than simple random sampling to estimate population parameters design based estimators of map accuracy indices are model free and design unbiased i e over repeated sampling with the design used to select a validation sample the average of the estimated map accuracy is equal to the true map accuracy note that when validating by design based inference validation locations are allowed to be geographically close to calibration locations also in a population with spatial structure the prediction errors at two independently selected locations are design independent i e when the points are selected independently from each other brus 2021 regardless of whether they are selected from a spatially structured population or not gregoire and valentine 2007 stehman and foody 2009 brus 2021 this refutes the core message of several recent studies e g brenning 2005 ploton et al 2020 that spatial autocorrelation invalidates map accuracy assessment spatial autocorrelation need not be explicitly incorporated in design based estimation of the validation indices because in probability sampling the validation data are design independent several studies have used a probability sampling strategy for map validation for examples see kempen et al 2009 olofsson et al 2012 and boschetti et al 2016 3 evaluation of map accuracy with cross validation it is not always feasible to collect an additional probability sample for map validation given the available resources and time gregoire and valentine 2007 duncanson et al 2019 in such case cross validation can be used to obtain estimates of the map accuracy steele et al 2003 cross validation makes use of the calibration dataset which typically is not a probability sample of the mapping area so that there is no possibility to determine how close the estimates are to the population validation parameters in standard cross validation using a non probability calibration sample we cannot make use of classical sampling theory to derive the probability distribution of the estimation errors of the accuracy indices and for example cannot prove that the estimation is design unbiased in practice cross validation may approximate the population validation parameters well but this depends on the sample size and the distribution of the sample locations across the study area for example if sample locations tend to be spatially clustered and large parts of the study area have low to zero sampling density then the map accuracy indices are likely to be over optimistic computing map accuracy indices with standard cv is not ideal ideally probability sampling is used but the map accuracy indices obtained this way can still be useful in many cases map accuracy indices estimated by standard cv strategies may be close to the unknown population indices but this is an assumption that cannot be verified in practice in spatial cv strategies validation points are forced to be geographically distant from calibration points by selecting validation folds that are assumed statistically independent i e model independent from calibration folds commonly spatial partitioning also known as blocking and buffering or a combination thereof are used to achieve independence in spatial partitioning spatial k fold cv the geographic space is divided into k spatially disjoint subsets the partitions can be determined by a coarse square grid of k cells or by clustering the spatial coordinates of the data set into k clusters in buffered leave one out cv b loo cv observations that are within a distance based radius from a validation point are not considered for model calibration this radius is usually taken to be larger than the range of a variogram computed on the whole data set or as computed on the residuals of this data set after a model is calibrated and model predictions subtracted from the observations spatial cv strategies remove entire portions of the geographic and hence also the covariate space causing under representation of environmental conditions similar to those at validation locations this is particularly a problem for biological ecological and environmental variables which are geographically structured the environmental conditions in the validation fold might be unseen in the calibration folds and the model is likely to predict outside the feature space covered by the joint set of covariates the map accuracy indices estimated in this way are likely systematically and potentially severely over pessimistic as would be the case if environmental conditions between validation and calibration folds are very different below we investigate the degree in which this occurs and illustrate our theoretical arguments with a simple case study 4 case study we built a random forest model for large scale mapping of above ground forest biomass agb for an area in the amazon basin fig 1a using a large set of ecological covariates as predictors to do so we selected a large rectangular area size 928 km 1642 km of above ground live woody biomass data in mg ha 1 from the baccini dataset baccini et al 2012 as the response variable and source of calibration data this allowed us to compute the population map accuracy indices and evaluate the various cross validation approaches note that there are no fundamental objections to using a proxy of the true agb as a response variable because for our purposes the only requirement is that it must have spatial structure the baccini map was aggregated to a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km we prepared a stack of 28 ecologically relevant covariates for the same extent representing mean climatic conditions climate seasonality and extreme conditions relief soil properties and six long term average modis bands the list of covariates their unit and source is provided in the supplementary material all covariates were either resampled using bilinear interpolation or aggregated to conform with the grid of the above ground biomass map considering the spatially exhaustive values of above ground biomass agb as our population of interest we repeatedly 500 times selected calibration samples of 500 grid cells n 500 using i systematic random sampling ii simple random sampling and iii two stage cluster random sampling for each sample we paired the corresponding 500 agb values and the stack of 28 covariates we applied three cross validation cv strategies i random k fold cv ii spatial k fold cv and iii buffered leave one out cv b loo cv we also performed design based validation by repeatedly selecting a separate probability sample of size 500 by simple random sampling without replacement for the two spatial cross validation strategies i e spatial k fold cv and b loo cv we applied the same computational methodology as in ploton et al 2020 and used an exclusion radius slightly larger than the autocorrelation range of the agb empirical variogram in our case 350 km the random forest rf algorithm was used for modelling and prediction and the rmse was estimated each population rmse was subtracted from the rmse estimate the population rmse was obtained by predicting the agb by the rf model at all locations n in the area subtracting these predictions from the true agb i e the baccini map and thus computing the population rmse we assessed the error in the rmse estimated from each sample by computing the difference between the estimated rmse and the population rmse we repeated the selection of the samples and the procedure for the four validation strategies 500 times to obtain the sampling distributions of the rmse estimation errors note that we adopted a model based approach for mapping as is nearly always done in practice selection of calibration locations using probability sampling designs was therefore not essential we only did this to automate the repeated sampling and do so in a reproducible way by assessing prediction performance for three very different sampling designs our experiment evaluates the efficiency of different validation strategies for a range of spatial configurations of acquired calibration data the results are illustrative for both dispersed and clustered sampling scenarios also when the calibration sample is not a probability sample as typically is the case in biological ecological and environmental mapping fig 1b d shows that design based estimation of the population rmse is unbiased and that the estimates have little variation these are attractive properties that show the superiority of design based validation to evaluate the prediction performance of the mapping model and estimate the map accuracy but as noted before it requires probability sampling from the population cross validation using standard random k fold cv is nearly unbiased for the systematic and simple random sampling designs but too optimistic in the case of clustered sampling the two spatial cross validation methods are too pessimistic with b loo cv severely overestimating the rmse in all cases the pessimistic results of the spatial cross validation methods are likely caused by over representation of environmental conditions distinct from the environmental conditions at the calibration points and under representation of environmental conditions similar to those at the calibration locations standard k fold cv was too optimistic in case of clustered sampling because each validation point had nearby calibration points while most points in the map did not this could be remedied by using leave cluster out cv which is another variant of spatial cv but this would likely overestimate the rmse 5 discussion existing methods of map validation using probability sampling and design based inference are perfectly valid for map accuracy assessment without the need to adjust for spatial autocorrelation these methods provide design unbiased estimates of the map accuracy which cannot be guaranteed by cv strategies i e neither standard nor spatial cv spatial cv strategies performed poorly and severely overestimated the population rmse in all sampling design cases considered in the case study the over pessimistic results of spatial cv are essentially caused by the fact that in this method only those parts of the mapped area that are distant from calibration points are validated prediction performance will tend to be poorer in subareas that have no nearby calibration points the map accuracy indices obtained this way are systematically off because of under representation of environmental conditions similar to those of the folds used in calibrating the model spatial cv strategies are highly subjective and depend not only on the sampling design on which the folds are defined but also on the method to determine the spatial partitioning spatial k fold cv and the radius the distance of exclusion in b loo cv further spatial cv strategies suffer from the fundamental problem of dealing with two conflicting objectives exclude validation data that are geographically close to calibration data to achieve spatial independence model based independence under a geostatistical model i e with distances larger than the variogram range and avoid extrapolation in the geographic and covariate space there seems to be no proper solution to this paradox the only sound way to validate a map is the use of probability sampling and design based inference scientists and practitioners can confidently proceed knowing that the map accuracy obtained by standard methods based on sampling theory are not invalidated by claims made in spatial cv studies spatial cv strategies and standard cv in case of clustered data are not appropriate for map validation spatial autocorrelation does not invalidate map accuracy assessment in a design based inference framework for map accuracy assessment the design based approach makes no assumptions on spatial autocorrelation of prediction errors whereas such assumptions are required in a model based approach thus giving rise to discussions on the validity of the estimated map accuracy some studies on spatial cv claim to focus on the validation of the mapping model instead of the validation of a map we call for a better articulation of what validating a mapping model means ploton et al 2020 for example did not evaluate the strength of the relationships between the response variable and the covariates nor did they attempt to explain the causal determinism of the spatial distribution of agb they assessed the accuracy of the agb map using the rmse as an overall statistic of the map quality it remains unclear what validation of a mapping model means and how this differs from validation of a map this lack of definition causes confusion so that there appears to be a mismatch between the claims i e validation of the mapping model and results i e estimating map accuracy indices in studies on spatial cv e g brenning 2005 meyer et al 2019 ploton et al 2020 in mapping studies the objective is to validate the map i e to assess the map accuracy map accuracy assessment is relevant in many disciplines some recent examples of which are validation of global scale maps of soil fungi tedersoo et al 2014 bacteria delgado baquerizo et al 2018 and nematodes van den hoogen et al 2019 landcover change song et al 2018 forest cover change hansen et al 2013 and aboveground biomass baccini et al 2012 among others finally we stress that the methodology communicated in this article for the validation of maps with probability sampling and design based inference is directly applicable to large scale mapping studies strahler et al 2006 and olofsson et al 2012 give recommendations for estimating the accuracy of global maps with sampling designs satisfying the definition of a probability sample depending on the objective these designs typically use stratification or clustering to balance precision of regional map accuracy assessment and cost associated to the collection of the validation data the key aspect of large scale map accuracy assessment relies on the use of probability sampling designs and design based inference of the map accuracy indices examples of studies using these strategies are mcroberts et al 2019 and stehman et al 2012 for the validation of a global biomass map and landcover map respectively more efforts should be invested in this direction 6 conclusion we have shown that spatial cross validation strategies resulted in a grossly pessimistic map accuracy assessment and gave no improvement over standard cross validation both standard and spatial cross validation methods may provide biased estimates of map accuracy in our case study spatial cross validation strategies severely underestimated the map quality while standard cv overestimated it in case of clustered data more importantly studies of spatial cross validation propagate a widespread misconception on the statistical validation of maps map accuracy ideally should be estimated with probability sampling and design based statistical inference such methodology and inference is valid without the need to adjust for spatial autocorrelation in the data scientists and practitioners can confidently proceed knowing that the map accuracy obtained by standard methods based on sampling theory are valid validation based on rigorous design based inference is also feasible for large scale and global maps of

24569,for decades scientists have produced maps of biological ecological and environmental variables these studies commonly evaluate the map accuracy through cross validation with the data used for calibrating the underlying mapping model recent studies however have argued that cross validation statistics of most mapping studies are optimistically biased they attribute these overoptimistic results to a supposed serious methodological flaw in standard cross validation methods namely that these methods ignore spatial autocorrelation in the data they argue that spatial cross validation should be used instead and contend that standard cross validation methods are inherently invalid in a geospatial context because of the autocorrelation present in most spatial data here we argue that these studies propagate a widespread misconception of statistical validation of maps we explain that unbiased estimates of map accuracy indices can be obtained by probability sampling and design based inference and illustrate this with a numerical experiment on large scale above ground biomass mapping in our experiment standard cross validation i e ignoring autocorrelation led to smaller bias than spatial cross validation standard cross validation was deficient in case of a strongly clustered dataset that had large differences in sampling density but less so than spatial cross validation we conclude that spatial cross validation methods have no theoretical underpinning and should not be used for assessing map accuracy while standard cross validation is deficient in case of clustered data model free design unbiased and valid accuracy assessment is achieved with probability sampling and design based inference it is valid without the need to explicitly incorporate or adjust for spatial autocorrelation and perfectly suited for the validation of large scale biological ecological and environmental maps keywords map quality model performance above ground biomass sampling theory design

alexandrewadoux spatialvalidation for the spatial cross validation strategies we used the original code provided in ploton et al 2020 1 introduction in recent years mapping studies have provided new insights into continental and global patterns of biogeographical variables some recent examples include global scale maps of soil fungi tedersoo et al 2014 bacteria delgado baquerizo et al 2018 and nematodes van den hoogen et al 2019 landcover change song et al 2018 forest cover change hansen et al 2013 and aboveground biomass baccini et al 2012 among others commonly in these studies the map accuracy is evaluated using statistical measures that evaluate how close the predictions z ˆ s are to the reality z s for a set of locations s d where d is the area of interest i e the population in practice the area of interest is often discretized by overlaying it with a fine grid popular population map accuracy indices are the mean error me root mean squared error rmse the squared pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 these indices are computed either by collecting a new set of data or by using the existing dataset for both model calibration and validation collecting a new set of data is ideally done by probability sampling the sample data are used to estimate the map accuracy indices through design based statistical inference based on classical sampling theory this method is statistically sound and has been extensively described in the statistical cochran 1977 and environmental science e g de gruijter et al 2006 gregoire and valentine 2007 literature but when data are scarce it is sensible to use the available data for both model calibration and validation burt et al 2009 in such case the existing dataset is split into two subsets called calibration and validation folds the calibration fold is used to calibrate a mapping model and make predictions whereas the validation fold is used to estimate the map accuracy indices this procedure can be repeated several times as in bootstrapping when multiple bootstrap samples with replacement are used for calibration and prediction or as in cross validation cv hastie et al 2009 in cv the data are split randomly into k disjoint folds each fold is put aside in turn and used to evaluate the predictions obtained from a model calibrated on the remaining k 1 folds conventionally k is set to 10 10 fold cv but k can also be equal to the sample size as in leave one out cv an advantage of cv and other data splitting strategies is that the existing data are used to evaluate map accuracy without the cost of additional sampling several recent studies brenning 2005 le rest et al 2014 roberts et al 2017 ploton et al 2020 however contend that statistical validation of maps should account for spatial autocorrelation between data points data collected at points that are geographically close generally are more similar than at points that are geographically distant as a consequence these studies claim that map accuracy indices as derived using standard cv are biased because calibration points are not statistically independent from validation points this conception of model validation has led to the recent development of cv techniques that avoid spatial autocorrelation such as spatial k fold cv and buffered leave one out cv b loo cv the study of ploton et al 2020 for example asserts that validation statistics should only be computed on validation points that are spatially independent from the calibration points and found in an experiment on mapping the above ground forest biomass in central africa that this resulted in quasi null predictive model performance here we argue that spatial cv techniques presented by recent studies on biological ecological and environmental mapping such as in le rest et al 2014 ploton et al 2020 hengl et al 2021 for example give rise to a misconception of statistical validation of maps in a spatial context there is a serious risk that practitioners misinterpret spatial cv techniques and reject long standing standard and statistically valid methods for assessing map accuracy in the following we explain why we should not use spatial cv techniques for estimating map accuracy indices and instead adhere to statistically rigorous methods of validation via probability sampling and design based inference our theoretical argument is illustrated with a case study 2 evaluation of map accuracy with probability sampling map accuracy indices are defined as population parameters the rmse for example as a finite population parameter is defined as rmse 1 n i 1 n z ˆ s i z s i 2 i e the square root of the squared prediction errors averaged over all n units i e grid cells in the population note that for infinite populations the map accuracy indices are defined as an integral in practice it is usually impossible to compute the map accuracy indices because one would need to take a census of the whole population instead a subset of n units is selected where typically n n and this sample is used to estimate the map accuracy indices i e the population validation parameters if the sample is a probability sample classical sampling theory can be used to estimate these population validation parameters using design based estimation stehman 1999 de gruijter et al 2006 gregoire and valentine 2007 stehman and foody 2009 brus et al 2011 this has the important advantage that one can prove that the estimates are unbiased and that valid confidence intervals can be computed probability samples have two characteristics all units in the population must have a positive probability of being selected and these inclusion probabilities must be known for at least the selected population units points the most basic probability sampling design is simple random sampling in which case all samples of a given size number of units have equal probability of being selected and a design based estimate of the population rmse is obtained by rmse 1 n i 1 n z ˆ s i z s i 2 there are also more complex probability sampling designs exploiting the spatial structure of the data such as stratified random sampling de gruijter et al 2015 balanced sampling deville and tillé 2004 brus 2015 and the local pivotal method grafström et al 2012 these designs are often more efficient than simple random sampling to estimate population parameters design based estimators of map accuracy indices are model free and design unbiased i e over repeated sampling with the design used to select a validation sample the average of the estimated map accuracy is equal to the true map accuracy note that when validating by design based inference validation locations are allowed to be geographically close to calibration locations also in a population with spatial structure the prediction errors at two independently selected locations are design independent i e when the points are selected independently from each other brus 2021 regardless of whether they are selected from a spatially structured population or not gregoire and valentine 2007 stehman and foody 2009 brus 2021 this refutes the core message of several recent studies e g brenning 2005 ploton et al 2020 that spatial autocorrelation invalidates map accuracy assessment spatial autocorrelation need not be explicitly incorporated in design based estimation of the validation indices because in probability sampling the validation data are design independent several studies have used a probability sampling strategy for map validation for examples see kempen et al 2009 olofsson et al 2012 and boschetti et al 2016 3 evaluation of map accuracy with cross validation it is not always feasible to collect an additional probability sample for map validation given the available resources and time gregoire and valentine 2007 duncanson et al 2019 in such case cross validation can be used to obtain estimates of the map accuracy steele et al 2003 cross validation makes use of the calibration dataset which typically is not a probability sample of the mapping area so that there is no possibility to determine how close the estimates are to the population validation parameters in standard cross validation using a non probability calibration sample we cannot make use of classical sampling theory to derive the probability distribution of the estimation errors of the accuracy indices and for example cannot prove that the estimation is design unbiased in practice cross validation may approximate the population validation parameters well but this depends on the sample size and the distribution of the sample locations across the study area for example if sample locations tend to be spatially clustered and large parts of the study area have low to zero sampling density then the map accuracy indices are likely to be over optimistic computing map accuracy indices with standard cv is not ideal ideally probability sampling is used but the map accuracy indices obtained this way can still be useful in many cases map accuracy indices estimated by standard cv strategies may be close to the unknown population indices but this is an assumption that cannot be verified in practice in spatial cv strategies validation points are forced to be geographically distant from calibration points by selecting validation folds that are assumed statistically independent i e model independent from calibration folds commonly spatial partitioning also known as blocking and buffering or a combination thereof are used to achieve independence in spatial partitioning spatial k fold cv the geographic space is divided into k spatially disjoint subsets the partitions can be determined by a coarse square grid of k cells or by clustering the spatial coordinates of the data set into k clusters in buffered leave one out cv b loo cv observations that are within a distance based radius from a validation point are not considered for model calibration this radius is usually taken to be larger than the range of a variogram computed on the whole data set or as computed on the residuals of this data set after a model is calibrated and model predictions subtracted from the observations spatial cv strategies remove entire portions of the geographic and hence also the covariate space causing under representation of environmental conditions similar to those at validation locations this is particularly a problem for biological ecological and environmental variables which are geographically structured the environmental conditions in the validation fold might be unseen in the calibration folds and the model is likely to predict outside the feature space covered by the joint set of covariates the map accuracy indices estimated in this way are likely systematically and potentially severely over pessimistic as would be the case if environmental conditions between validation and calibration folds are very different below we investigate the degree in which this occurs and illustrate our theoretical arguments with a simple case study 4 case study we built a random forest model for large scale mapping of above ground forest biomass agb for an area in the amazon basin fig 1a using a large set of ecological covariates as predictors to do so we selected a large rectangular area size 928 km 1642 km of above ground live woody biomass data in mg ha 1 from the baccini dataset baccini et al 2012 as the response variable and source of calibration data this allowed us to compute the population map accuracy indices and evaluate the various cross validation approaches note that there are no fundamental objections to using a proxy of the true agb as a response variable because for our purposes the only requirement is that it must have spatial structure the baccini map was aggregated to a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km we prepared a stack of 28 ecologically relevant covariates for the same extent representing mean climatic conditions climate seasonality and extreme conditions relief soil properties and six long term average modis bands the list of covariates their unit and source is provided in the supplementary material all covariates were either resampled using bilinear interpolation or aggregated to conform with the grid of the above ground biomass map considering the spatially exhaustive values of above ground biomass agb as our population of interest we repeatedly 500 times selected calibration samples of 500 grid cells n 500 using i systematic random sampling ii simple random sampling and iii two stage cluster random sampling for each sample we paired the corresponding 500 agb values and the stack of 28 covariates we applied three cross validation cv strategies i random k fold cv ii spatial k fold cv and iii buffered leave one out cv b loo cv we also performed design based validation by repeatedly selecting a separate probability sample of size 500 by simple random sampling without replacement for the two spatial cross validation strategies i e spatial k fold cv and b loo cv we applied the same computational methodology as in ploton et al 2020 and used an exclusion radius slightly larger than the autocorrelation range of the agb empirical variogram in our case 350 km the random forest rf algorithm was used for modelling and prediction and the rmse was estimated each population rmse was subtracted from the rmse estimate the population rmse was obtained by predicting the agb by the rf model at all locations n in the area subtracting these predictions from the true agb i e the baccini map and thus computing the population rmse we assessed the error in the rmse estimated from each sample by computing the difference between the estimated rmse and the population rmse we repeated the selection of the samples and the procedure for the four validation strategies 500 times to obtain the sampling distributions of the rmse estimation errors note that we adopted a model based approach for mapping as is nearly always done in practice selection of calibration locations using probability sampling designs was therefore not essential we only did this to automate the repeated sampling and do so in a reproducible way by assessing prediction performance for three very different sampling designs our experiment evaluates the efficiency of different validation strategies for a range of spatial configurations of acquired calibration data the results are illustrative for both dispersed and clustered sampling scenarios also when the calibration sample is not a probability sample as typically is the case in biological ecological and environmental mapping fig 1b d shows that design based estimation of the population rmse is unbiased and that the estimates have little variation these are attractive properties that show the superiority of design based validation to evaluate the prediction performance of the mapping model and estimate the map accuracy but as noted before it requires probability sampling from the population cross validation using standard random k fold cv is nearly unbiased for the systematic and simple random sampling designs but too optimistic in the case of clustered sampling the two spatial cross validation methods are too pessimistic with b loo cv severely overestimating the rmse in all

point had nearby calibration points while most points in the map did not this could be remedied by using leave cluster out cv which is another variant of spatial cv but this would likely overestimate the rmse 5 discussion existing methods of map validation using probability sampling and design based inference are perfectly valid for map accuracy assessment without the need to adjust for spatial autocorrelation these methods provide design unbiased estimates of the map accuracy which cannot be guaranteed by cv strategies i e neither standard nor spatial cv spatial cv strategies performed poorly and severely overestimated the population rmse in all sampling design cases considered in the case study the over pessimistic results of spatial cv are essentially caused by the fact that in
