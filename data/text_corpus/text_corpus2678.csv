13390,combinations between ozonation process o3 and submerged microfiltration mf were evaluated as fouling reducing pretreatments for reverse osmosis ro in the treatment of landfill leachate the modified fouling index mfi was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and pretreated leachates the results demonstrate that a first ozonation step followed by the microfiltration step represents the best layout being able to reduce the leachate s mfi over 170 000 times the whole treatment o3 mf ro is capable of fitting the landfill leachate to the local standards in force for discharge in fresh water bodies additionally it was possible to notice the benefits of using ozonation prior to the microfiltration step when compared to the opposite order both because of the smaller mfi value obtained 19 53 s l2 instead of 5095 s l2 and also for the improvement in permeate flux during microfiltration step finally the ro permeate characterization suggest that the established treatment route represents an effective treatment for a wastewater as complex as landfill leachate graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ozone microfiltration landfill leachate reverse osmosis fouling 1 introduction landfill is the most used technology for the treatment of municipal solid waste msw worldwide 1 however the generation of some by products during and after its operation is inevitable landfill leachate one of these undesirable by products is a contaminant liquid that may cause serious environmental problems such as the pollution of surface water and groundwater 2 4 it is generated from the microbiological degradation of organic matter contained in the solid waste and water that comes from both its natural moisture and rainwater that percolates the waste pile infiltrating landfill inner layers 5 6 leachate s characteristics vary over time and from one place to another therefore the choice of the most appropriate treatment for such wastewater is a challenging task in its management 7 8 combinations of separation and destruction mechanisms are recommended for its efficient treatment since it is normally composed of a mixture of suspended colloidal and dissolved matters in large amounts 9 there are applications of physical chemical and biological processes to treat leachate from the most diverse origins in brazil biological processes are commonly used in the treatment of landfill leachate as an attempt to reproduce the model consolidated for decades for sewage treatment since young landfills tend to produce leachate with high biodegradability 1 however landfills aging promotes the generation of leachates that are richer in recalcitrant organic matter 10 which along with the stricter environmental regulations creates a demand for alternative methods to treat this wastewater 11 12 in this context membrane separation processes msp particularly reverse osmosis ro have been increasingly used to fit leachate for discharge 13 15 ro membranes are capable of retaining organic pollutants and inorganic salts making it able to properly treat complex wastewaters such as landfill leachate 16 however this technology struggles with the decrease of permeate flux over operational time 17 18 this can be caused by concentration polarization a reversible effect of accumulation of solutes on membrane surface or fouling a partially or totally irreversible effect of membrane alterations 10 19 the permeate fluxes may get so diminished over operational time that the membrane application is not viable especially with more restrictive membranes like ro 20 previous investigation suggests that ro inefficiencies are usually caused by improper feed pretreatment 21 thus the use of adequate pretreatment steps may help overcome this issue the use of microfiltration mf membranes have been considered a good pretreatment method for ro processes since early evaluations 21 22 mainly due to their ability to retain microorganisms and suspended solids species that could greatly intensify fouling on ro membranes 23 these studies highlighted however the advantages of associating mf to other pretreatment methods that would reduce biofouling propensity which can cause permeate flux and selectivity reductions on both mf and ro membranes 23 one option is ozonation a process that degrades contaminants by the action of a gas stream containing ozone that is fed to the wastewater 24 ozone may directly oxidize organic matter or generate hydroxyl radicals oh highly oxidative chemical species that non selectively degrade organic matter and microorganisms 25 ozonation has been effectively applied to reduce membrane fouling during surface and groundwater treatment 26 29 and the combination of oxidation processes and microfiltration has been successfully used in the treatment of landfill leachate to act as pretreatment to high pressure membranes 30 31 in this scenario the goal of this work is to evaluate the combination of microfiltration and ozonation processes that provides better efficacy of fouling reduction of a leachate from a sanitary landfill located at the metropolitan region of rio de janeiro state brazil the modified fouling index mfi was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and all pretreated leachates the chosen pretreatment route was then applied to different leachate samples before feeding them to an ro membrane these samples were characterized before and after each treatment step in order to verify the step s contribution to the treatment as a whole toxicity tests were also performed to evaluate the impact of this process combination on the local biota the findings of this work are expected to generate relevant information concerning the viability of this treatment option for landfill leachate worldwide additionally an effective pretreatment is supposed to minimize costs with ro membrane replacements due to the improvement in its lifespan 2 materials and methods for this work leachate samples were collected from the equalization pond of a landfill located at the metropolitan region of rio de janeiro state brazil the samples were stored refrigerated at temperature lower than 10 c until the moment of pretreatment 2 1 pretreatment combinations the pretreatment routes evaluated were composed of ozonation process and or submerged microfiltration membrane process as described in fig 1 the evaluation of their efficiencies was made through modified fouling index mfi which is an index that describes the fouling potential of a specific liquid sample during filtration processes it was first described by schippers and verdouw 32 as an improved alternative to the silt density index sdi with the advantage of being proportional to the concentration of colloidal and suspended matters also previous results have reported that sdi do not describe the fouling potential of landfill leachate as well as mfi since sdi values of efficiently pretreated leachate samples did not change much while mfi values indeed greatly reduced 33 2 2 modified fouling index although it is a mere indication of how fouling formation will behave during filtration in the actual membrane system mfi allows the assessment of the fouling potential through the use of a small liquid sample and disposable membranes it is assessed in a pressurized system where the liquid sample percolates a 0 45 Î¼m millipore membrane with 47 mm in diameter at 0 2 mpa 30 psi and at room temperature 25 c fig 2 illustrates the mfi unit scheme a chart of the inverse of filtration rate t v as a function of permeate stream volume v is plotted mfi is defined as the slope of the chart s straight region 34 the steeper the slope the greater the capacity of the liquid to cause fouling the establishment of fouling indexes like mfi is important for the design of treatment systems with reverse osmosis ro membranes since wastewaters that present excessive indexes may cause irreversible deposition on the membrane reducing the permeate stream flux and harming the process performance 30 35 2 3 ozonation ozonation tests were all performed in an ozonation unit put together for this particular assays fig 3 illustrates a scheme of such unit ozonation unit is composed of an o3 generator an analyzer of o3 concentration on the gas stream a semi continuous reactor where leachate is batch fed before the unit s start whilst gas stream is continuously fed two o3 destruction baths and an altered foam collecting vessel as well as all the hoses and manual valves necessary to ensure a proper gas flow through the unit the semi continuous reactor needs to be batch fed with the sample to be ozonated before the operation starts ph adjustment to the specific value of each experiment was previously done with 50 w w naoh solution or with commercial hcl solution purity of 37 these elevated concentrations were necessary in order to minimize dilution effects in the sample that might mask the results during operation the unit is continuously fed with a gas stream containing 99 5 of o2 at the gauge pressure of 62 kpa 9 psi and with a fixed flow rate of 5 l min following instructions of the o3 generator manufacturer the gas stream flows into the generator where o3 is produced from the o2 molecules by the action of an electrical discharge usual operation happens with valve a1 open and valves a2 and a3 closed so that the generator s outlet gas stream feeds the semi continuous reactor through a diffuser plate to divide it into small bubbles at regular time intervals these three valves switch in order to reintroduce the recovered leachate in the foam collecting vessel to the reactor the o3 analyzer continuously measures o3 concentrations in the gas stream in terms of g m3 valves b1 and b2 allow the measurement of o3 concentration in the feed gas stream or in the exhausted gas stream the difference between these two throughout the assay is used to estimate the o3 dose fed to the leachate the process stops by ceasing the gas stream feeding previous results have shown that the higher the o3 dose the higher the reduction of fouling potential and that the operational ph should be evaluated on a case by case basis 36 therefore all ozonation assays in this work happened with a sample volume of 1 l with a fixed o3 mass of 1 g transferred to it the operational ph evaluated were 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 12 0 the efficiency of ozonation process was assessed by means of mfi reduction measured in triplicate 2 4 submerged microfiltration the microfiltration assays took place at a submerged mf system whose scheme is illustrated in fig 4 the unit is composed of a leachate tank where the mf module 0 1 0 4 Î¼m hollow fiber membranes 0 1 m2 of permeation area pam membranas rio de janeiro brazil is submerged in the wastewater to be treated a pressure gauge a vacuum pump and an air compressor the pump applies a continuous negative pressure 0 1 mpa in the interior of the hollow fibers which causes the permeable compounds in the leachate to be sucked in and led to a collecting vessel while the non permeable compounds accumulate in the tank the air compressor injects bubbles inside the module at a continuous flow rate fair of 2 5 l h in order to create stirring that reduces the concentration polarization effect in the vicinities of membrane surface the microfiltration was applied both on the raw leachate and on the leachate after ozonation in the best evaluated operational ph each mf cycle lasted 150 min with an initial leachate volume of 5 l inside the tank the permeate flux behavior over time was observed three methods of chemical cleaning were evaluated to be applied in between mf cycles in order to reduce fouling effects and recover the module s permeability the efficiency of each cleaning method was assessed by a recuperation factor which represents the membrane s water permeability lp after chemical cleaning calculated over the one from the clogged membrane right before the cleaning process the three cleaning methods were a 3 g l sodium hypochlorite naclo bath for 1 h b 1 g l citric acid c6h8o7 bath for 24 h followed by 50 g l sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5h2o2 bath for 30 min c 0 1 g l sodium hypochlorite naclo bath for 24 h followed by 50 g l sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5h2o2 bath for 30 min the method with highest recuperation factor was later applied in between permeation cycles for both raw and ozonated leachate samples of raw leachate after microfiltration were also submitted to the ozonation process in the same operational ph as for the raw leachate to produce samples pretreated by route 4 then samples of leachate after all five pretreatment routes had their mfi values assessed in triplicate in order to establish the best pretreatment route prior to ro step 2 5 reverse osmosis the chosen best pretreatment route was applied to two leachate samples from the same landfill collected in different moments the pretreated leachates were submitted to an ro step in a system that is similar to the one used for mfi assessment and illustrated in fig 2 but with an ro membrane tw30 1812 100 dow filmtec miami usa instead of a mf one the ro operations lasted for 6 5 h at a feeding pressure of 0 5 mpa 73 psi with initial volumes of pretreated leachate in the feeding tank equal to 20 l the permeate flux behavior over time was observed at each treatment step samples were analyzed through the following parameters along with their analytical method according to apha 37 and

the lower the ec50 the higher the samples ecotoxicity to vibrio fischeri organisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozonation table 1 presents the results in triplicate of mfi for raw leachate and for its ozonated samples in different initial ph values the curves from which mfi values were obtained are displayed in appendix a it is possible to notice that the ozonation process presents higher mfi reduction efficiencies between ph 8 0 and 10 0 being slightly higher for ph 8 0 which is beneficial for this application since it is close to the natural ph range of the leachate samples between 7 0 and 8 0 at ph 8 0 this ozonation process showed to be capable of causing a significant reduction of mfi which is almost 90 lower than the one of raw leachate this mfi reduction percentage is similar to values reported before by ozonation applied to similar landfill leachate samples 36 on the other hand it has also been reported that the use of ozonation may enhance the fouling potential of landfill leachate 14 which once again demonstrates the need of evaluating the best treatment route on a case by case basis in the literature higher ph values are usually reported to cause improvements in ozonation process efficiency for instance ph 11 was reported to provide the best cod reduction 39 and abs254 reduction 40 of a mature landfill leachate it is known that the ph exerts major influence on the degradation mechanisms of ozonation since higher ph values tend to generate hydroxyl radicals starting an indirect degradation while lower ph values are more propense to undergo the direct ozone degradation which is more selective to cyclic and unsaturated organic compounds 41 in an intermediate ph value as the one observed in this work it is admitted that both mechanisms take place which seem to favor the mfi reduction of this leachate the ph 8 0 was therefore established as the one in which ozonation process must occur in all ozonation assays presented henceforth 3 2 submerged microfiltration table 2 presents the results of chemical cleaning methods applied to the clogged mf membrane module to recover its water permeability lp after operation cycles of 150 min at 0 1 mpa with raw leachate the curves from which lp values were extracted are presented in appendix b cleaning method c 0 1 g l sodium hypochlorite bath for 24 h followed by 50 g l sodium percarbonate bath for 30 min showed the highest recovery factor among the evaluated routes comparing cleaning methods b and c it is clear that the alkaline solution was more effective for recovering the membrane s permeability than the acidic one also comparing methods a and c it seems that the addition of a cleaning step with peroxide based product helped enhance the recovery factor all this information suggests that leachate fouling on the mf membrane is mainly caused by organic colloids particulate materials and microorganisms rather than by inorganic scaling since alkaline cleaning solutions are normally used for organic and colloidal fouling acidic cleaning solutions for inorganic scaling and peroxide is used for membrane disinfection reducing biofouling 42 this same behavior was observed by torres 30 when evaluating cleaning procedures for microfiltration membranes applied to treat landfill leachate method c was therefore established as the cleaning method and was applied between every permeation cycle described henceforth fig 5 presents the normalized permeate flux i e the immediate permeate fluxes j divided by the initial permeate flux j0 over time on the mf membranes permeations were made with raw leachate or ozonated leachate at ph 8 0 after each 150 min of permeation the established chemical cleaning method was applied in order to recover the permeate flux the curves in fig 5 show the benefits of applying an ozonation step prior to the mf one since the permeate fluxes of the ozonated samples remain further above the flux values of the raw leachate samples throughout the whole operation this same benefit has been previously reported when applying ozonation to humic acid solutions prior to mf membranes 43 the permeate flux of raw leachate samples instantly drops to less than 10 of the initial permeation in the chemically cleaned membrane module not only is the flux decay attenuated for the ozonated sample but also its final value at the steady state seems to settle at a value that is much closer to the initial permeate flux these results corroborate the ones presented in table 1 which indicates that ozonation can greatly reduce leachate s capacity of causing fouling on mf membranes they are also in accordance with mfi great reductions by ozonation reported in previous work 36 3 3 pretreatment combinations after applying an ozonation step to a previously microfiltered leachate sample in the same operational conditions that were used in the raw ones ph 8 0 mo3 1 g vleachate 1 l all pretreatment routes described in fig 1 were performed and their mfi assessment in triplicate are presented in table 3 the curves from which mfi values were obtained are displayed in appendix c these results point to the great capacity of both technologies to reduce the fouling potential of leachate both individually and in combination since all pretreatment routes reached values of mfi reduction close to 90 0 or higher it is curious to observe that the leachate sample after microfiltration still presents a considerably high mfi value which in theory should not happen once the mfi assessment takes place at a disposable mf membrane 0 45 Î¼m it is only intuitive that the submerged mf step would retain all compounds capable of depositing on the membrane surface of the later mfi apparatus reducing it to values close to zero the observation of mfi still elevated for the sample after mf step could be caused by differences between filtration operations or even between the membranes materials of submerged microfiltration process and mfi assessment however the most probable explanation is in the fact that fouling besides harming permeate flux also hampers the membrane selectivity 23 thus the quick fouling formation observed through the accentuated permeate flux drop of raw leachate fig 5 is also responsible for lowering the submerged microfiltration membrane selectivity and therefore reducing the permeate stream quality this phenomenon is one more reason for combining both pretreatment technologies the combinations between both methods were especially effective presenting mfi reductions higher than 99 8 in both cases the sample that went through ozonation followed by microfiltration additionally to presenting higher permeate fluxes during mf step showed final mfi under 20 s l2 which is considerably smaller than the 3 34 106 s l2 presented by the raw leachate this value is half of the one obtained by torres 30 who used fenton reaction another advanced oxidation process aop method followed by submerged mf to reduce the mfi of a stabilized landfill leachate of rio de janeiro this indicates that ozonation may act more efficiently than fenton reaction in this pretreatment route besides holding the advantage of not generating sludge during oxidation it is also 30 times lower than the one obtained by alfaia et al 33 who used coagulation flocculation processes to reduce leachate s mfi which points that the combination of oxidation and separation methods is much more efficient for that purpose than the conventional treatments finally chang et al 44 reported the use of sequential coagulation flocculation microfiltration and ultrafiltration to reduce the mfi of previously biotreated leachate samples from a six year closed landfill in taiwan the authors obtained an mfi reduction from 550 000 s l2 which is already six times lower than the raw leachate of this work to 28 5 s l2 which is a little higher than the final mfi value of this work even with the extra uf final step also ozonation may be more advantageous as an ro pretreatment than these two other methods fenton and coagulation flocculation since it does not generate residues that would add to the ro concentrate in the recirculation to the landfill this characteristic fits the recently approved law 9055 of the state of rio de janeiro brazil 45 which establishes that the re introduction of residues from leachate treatment to the landfill of origin is allowed as long as it does not exceed 1 3 in volume or mass of the leachate generated by it an mfi value of 20 s l2 is still above the intervals usually described as proper for water treatment through ro membranes between 0 and 1 s l2 46 or between 0 and 2 s l2 35 however there is no consensus among the scientific community about such intervals for ro membrane application on wastewater treatments either way this value is 170 000 times smaller than the mfi of raw leachate which represents a substantial improvement for the process in terms of fouling reduction route 5 was therefore selected as the best pretreatment prior to the ro step and the whole treatment was applied to leachate samples collected from this same landfill in two distinct moments samples a and b in order to validate the efficacy of this process 3 4 reverse osmosis the normalized permeate flux behavior in the reverse osmosis system of these two pretreated samples samples a and b over operational time is illustrated in fig 6 the charts in fig 6 show that the permeate flux drop is not very accentuated maintaining itself above 80 of its initial value after 6 5 h of operation for both leachate samples which reinforces the efficacy of the pretreatment method applied in preserving the ro permeability table 4 presents the characterization of both these samples a and b in their raw forms and after each treatment step including the final permeation in the ro membrane firstly it is important to observe that although both leachate samples are from the same landfill a short period of time between sampling is enough to cause some change in its composition which highlights the importance of a treatment process that is able to properly treat a wide range of concentrations of different pollutants overall the characterization results demonstrate the great importance of all treatment steps where each of them is responsible for the improvement of leachate quality in different parameters at different efficiency ratios the complete treatment route is responsible for expressive pollutant reductions above 97 for almost all evaluated parameters ph for both leachate samples is higher after ozonation which is due to the ph adjustment prior to this process and natural ph variation during oxidation reactions such elevation shows influence on the leachate alkalinity since the excessive free hydroxyls elevate the alkalinity measurement making ozonated samples present higher alkalinity than the raw ones in both cases ph and alkalinity did not change much during mf step but alkalinity greatly reduced during ro step probably due to the retention of carbonates and bicarbonates by the ro membrane the evaluation of organic matter content demonstrated that ozonation had significant effect on its reduction which can be perceived both by cod and by abs254 values in both cases the efficiency of cod and abs254 observed are similar or higher to what is commonly observed in the literature when ozonation is applied to leachate treatment 13 14 47 the same effect was not observed by mf step where these parameters did not change much which suggests that the biggest part of organic matter still in the samples after ozonation is dissolved not suspended this remaining organic matter was effectively removed by the ro step which results in an overall organic matter reduction close 99 for both parameters the ozonation step presents a small reduction of ammonia nitrogen which is a bit further removed by the mf step the reduction of ammonia concentration by both steps is probably caused by air stripping i e a mass transfer of gas dissolved in a liquid phase to a gaseous stream that contains lower concentration of such gas a phenomenon called desorption 46 air stripping is commonly applied for the removal of ammonia from landfill leachate and it is highly effective when the ph is adjusted to values above 11 but not that much for lower operational ph values as the one of this work 15 48 since both pretreatment steps encompass a gas stream that is continuously fed to the leachate throughout the process their bubbles were able to carry some of the dissolved gaseous ammonia however the biggest reduction takes place on the ro membrane where almost all the remaining ammonia nitrogen is retained the greatest contribution of mf step to the leachate quality seem to be in the reduction of turbidity a parameter that is associated to the presence of suspended matter which is greatly responsible for membrane fouling 23 it makes sense since this treatment step was applied mainly as a way to preserve the ro membrane lifespan rather than as a method to directly improve the leachate quality ozonation also reduced partially the turbidity prior to mf step and the remaining turbidity after mf was greatly removed by ro membrane presenting overall reductions higher than 99 in both cases as for color reduction ozonation step showed to be particularly effective being responsible for most of its removal this observation corroborates results previously published in the literature which report that color is the parameter the most affected by ozonation when applied in the treatment of landfill leachate 13 47 the same observation occurred when ozonation was applied to leachate samples from landfills in rio de janeiro state 36 in the present work the whole process caused an overall color reduction above 99 where ozonation alone was responsible for the removal of more than 80 of it when analyzing the chloride ions concentrations as expected it is clear that ro step was the sole responsible for their reductions above 97 in both cases which leads to final chloride concentrations much lower than what is established by national standards in force for fresh water bodies cl 250 mg l 49 other parameters that are specified in local resolutions for wastewater discharge in water bodies 50 51 are also within the range established 5 0 ph 9 0 cod 200 mgo2 l n nh3 20 mg l for both ro permeates which suggests that this treatment route is capable of fitting landfill leachates to proper discharge conditions table 5 presents the results of vibrio fischeri acute ecotoxicity for leachate sample b at each step of treatment keeping in mind that the lower the ec50 the higher to ecotoxicity to vibrio fischeri organisms it is clear that each treatment step significantly contributes to the reduction of ecotoxicity of leachate it is important to highlight that no treatment step caused a toxicity improvement which is likely to happen for oxidation processes like ozonation 24 this phenomenon was indeed reported by silva et al 52 who evaluated the use of ozonation to treat landfill leachate and observed that while the raw leachate showed an average ec50 of 13 15 to vibrio fischeri the samples after treatment presented average ec50 of 1 74 and 1 18 for ozone doses of 0 5 go3 l and 1 5 go3 l respectively torres 30 used a combination of aop fenton process and submerged microfiltration to treat landfill leachate and observed an ec50 improvement from 9 4 in the raw sample to 70 5 in the treated one to vibrio fischeri despite the great toxicity reduction the process was not able to fully remove the toxicity to these organisms this information suggests an advantage of using ozonation instead of fenton process for the oxidation step of this treatment since in the present work the sample after ozonation and microfiltration steps showed no toxicity 100 to the same organisms this hypothesis is corroborated by the work of bastos 53 who applied ozonation to treat a raw landfill leachate sample that presented ec50 of 2 04 and after oxidation the samples presented no ecotoxicity to the same organisms in this work the sample after microfiltration and the final sample after ro did not present acute ecotoxicity to the organisms evaluated the results of ecotoxicity along with the previous results presented in this work demonstrate that the treatment that is proposed o3 mf ro is capable of fitting landfill leachates to the standards in force for discharge in fresh water bodies finally it is important to stress that the final destination of the concentrates retained by the membrane another important problem associated with the use of ro to treat wastewaters in general may be performed in the case of landfill leachate by reintroducing it to the solid waste pile of the landfill besides being economically feasible historically this reintroduction has shown to be quite propitious causing no additional harm to the landfill and no significant alterations in leachate composition 54 although it should still be considered in the long term at the same time as previously discussed ozonation might be more valuable as a pretreatment to reverse osmosis then other methods like coagulation flocculation and fenton process since the first one does not generate residues that would add to the ro concentrate in the recirculation to the landfill 4 conclusions this work demonstrates the great capacity of ozonation and microfiltration processes to work as pretreatments for reverse osmosis membranes in the treatment of landfill leachate the combinations between both methods were especially effective for the reduction of leachate s fouling potential presenting mfi reductions higher than 99 8 the sample that went through ozonation followed by microfiltration showed final mfi under 20 s l2 which is considerably smaller than the 3 34 106 s l2 presented by the raw leachate it was possible to notice the benefits of using ozonation prior to the microfiltration step when compared to the opposite order not only because of the smaller mfi value obtained 19 53 s l2 instead of 5095 s l2 but also for the permeate flux improvement during microfiltration step chemical cleaning showed to be effective for recovering the microfiltration membrane permeability since cleaning baths of sodium hypochlorite and sodium percarbonate were capable of increasing more than 6 times the water permeability of the clogged module finally the characterizations of both ro permeate streams indicate that the proposed treatment route presents a great potential to properly treat a wastewater as complex as landfill leachate the use of ozonation and microfiltration prior to the ro step would vastly improve this membrane s lifespan reducing the costs with constant replacements the final treated samples presented reductions higher than 97 for almost all parameters evaluated when compared to the values of their respective untreated samples they were also within the ranges established for discharge in fresh water bodies according to the local standards in force and did not present any acute ecotoxicity for vibrio fischeri as well it is worth mentioning that despite the technical efficacy presented in this study ozonation and membrane separation processes may possibly be very expensive for practical applications especially when high ozone doses are required for the treatment which seems to be the case it is crucial to perform an economic evaluation prior to the application of this treatment

discharge 13 15 ro membranes are capable of retaining organic pollutants and inorganic salts making it able to properly treat complex wastewaters such as landfill leachate 16 however this technology struggles with the decrease of permeate flux over operational time 17 18 this can be caused by concentration polarization a reversible effect of accumulation of solutes on membrane surface or fouling a partially or totally irreversible effect of membrane alterations 10 19 the permeate fluxes may get so diminished over operational time that the membrane application is not viable especially with more restrictive membranes like ro 20 previous investigation suggests that ro inefficiencies are usually caused by improper feed pretreatment 21 thus the use of adequate pretreatment steps may help overcome this issue the use of microfiltration mf membranes have been considered a good pretreatment method for ro processes since early evaluations 21 22 mainly due to their ability to retain microorganisms and suspended solids species that could greatly intensify fouling on ro membranes 23 these studies highlighted however the advantages of associating mf to other pretreatment methods that would reduce biofouling propensity which can cause permeate flux and selectivity reductions on both mf and ro membranes 23 one option is ozonation a process that degrades contaminants by the action of a gas stream containing ozone that is fed to the wastewater 24 ozone may directly oxidize organic matter or generate hydroxyl radicals oh highly oxidative chemical species that non selectively degrade organic matter and microorganisms 25 ozonation has been effectively applied to reduce membrane fouling during surface and groundwater treatment 26 29 and the combination of oxidation processes and microfiltration has been successfully used in the treatment of landfill leachate to act as pretreatment to high pressure membranes 30 31 in this scenario the goal of this work is to evaluate the combination of microfiltration and ozonation processes that provides better efficacy of fouling reduction of a leachate from a sanitary landfill located at the metropolitan region of rio de janeiro state brazil the modified fouling index mfi was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and all pretreated leachates the chosen pretreatment route was then applied to different leachate samples before feeding them to an ro membrane these samples were characterized before and after each treatment step in order to verify the step s contribution to the treatment as a whole toxicity tests were also performed to evaluate the impact of this process combination on the local biota the findings of this work are expected to generate relevant information concerning the viability of this treatment option for landfill leachate worldwide additionally an effective pretreatment is supposed to minimize costs with ro membrane replacements due to the improvement in its lifespan 2 materials and methods for this work leachate samples were collected from the equalization pond of a landfill located at the metropolitan region of rio de janeiro state brazil the samples were stored refrigerated at temperature lower than 10 c until the moment of pretreatment 2 1 pretreatment combinations the pretreatment routes evaluated were composed of ozonation process and or submerged microfiltration membrane process as described in fig 1 the evaluation of their efficiencies was made through modified fouling index mfi which is an index that describes the fouling potential of a specific liquid sample during filtration processes it was first described by schippers and verdouw 32 as an improved alternative to the silt density index sdi with the advantage of being proportional to the concentration of colloidal and suspended matters also previous results have reported that sdi do not describe the fouling potential of landfill leachate as well as mfi since sdi values of efficiently pretreated leachate samples did not change much while mfi values indeed greatly reduced 33 2 2 modified fouling index although it is a mere indication of how fouling formation will behave during filtration in the actual membrane system mfi allows the assessment of the fouling potential through the use of a small liquid sample and disposable membranes it is assessed in a pressurized system where the liquid sample percolates a 0 45 Î¼m millipore membrane with 47 mm in diameter at 0 2 mpa 30 psi and at room temperature 25 c fig 2 illustrates the mfi unit scheme a chart of the inverse of filtration rate t v as a function of permeate stream volume v is plotted mfi is defined as the slope of the chart s straight region 34 the steeper the slope the greater the capacity of the liquid to cause fouling the establishment of fouling indexes like mfi is important for the design of treatment systems with reverse osmosis ro membranes since wastewaters that present excessive indexes may cause irreversible deposition on the membrane reducing the permeate stream flux and harming the process performance 30 35 2 3 ozonation ozonation tests were all performed in an ozonation unit put together for this particular assays fig 3 illustrates a scheme of such unit ozonation unit is composed of an o3 generator an analyzer of o3 concentration on the gas stream a semi continuous reactor where leachate is batch fed before the unit s start whilst gas stream is continuously fed two o3 destruction baths and an altered foam collecting vessel as well as all the hoses and manual valves necessary to ensure a proper gas flow through the unit the semi continuous reactor needs to be batch fed with the sample to be ozonated before the operation starts ph adjustment to the specific value of each experiment was previously done with 50 w w naoh solution or with commercial hcl solution purity of 37 these elevated concentrations were necessary in order to minimize dilution effects in the sample that might mask the results during operation the unit is continuously fed with a gas stream containing 99 5 of o2 at the gauge pressure of 62 kpa 9 psi and with a fixed flow rate of 5 l min following instructions of the o3 generator manufacturer the gas stream flows into the generator where o3 is produced from the o2 molecules by the action of an electrical discharge usual operation happens with valve a1 open and valves a2 and a3 closed so that the generator s outlet gas stream feeds the semi continuous reactor through a diffuser plate to divide it into small bubbles at regular time intervals these three valves switch in order to reintroduce the recovered leachate in the foam collecting vessel to the reactor the o3 analyzer continuously measures o3 concentrations in the gas stream in terms of g m3 valves b1 and b2 allow the measurement of o3 concentration in the feed gas stream or in the exhausted gas stream the difference between these two throughout the assay is used to estimate the o3 dose fed to the leachate the process stops by ceasing the gas stream feeding previous results have shown that the higher the o3 dose the higher the reduction of fouling potential and that the operational ph should be evaluated on a case by case basis 36 therefore all ozonation assays in this work happened with a sample volume of 1 l with a fixed o3 mass of 1 g transferred to it the operational ph evaluated were 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 12 0 the efficiency of ozonation process was assessed by means of mfi reduction measured in triplicate 2 4 submerged microfiltration the microfiltration assays took place at a submerged mf system whose scheme is illustrated in fig 4 the unit is composed of a leachate tank where the mf module 0 1 0 4 Î¼m hollow fiber membranes 0 1 m2 of permeation area pam membranas rio de janeiro brazil is submerged in the wastewater to be treated a pressure gauge a vacuum pump and an air compressor the pump applies a continuous negative pressure 0 1 mpa in the interior of the hollow fibers which causes the permeable compounds in the leachate to be sucked in and led to a collecting vessel while the non permeable compounds accumulate in the tank the air compressor injects bubbles inside the module at a continuous flow rate fair of 2 5 l h in order to create stirring that reduces the concentration polarization effect in the vicinities of membrane surface the microfiltration was applied both on the raw leachate and on the leachate after ozonation in the best evaluated operational ph each mf cycle lasted 150 min with an initial leachate volume of 5 l inside the tank the permeate flux behavior over time was observed three methods of chemical cleaning were evaluated to be applied in between mf cycles in order to reduce fouling effects and recover the module s permeability the efficiency of each cleaning method was assessed by a recuperation factor which represents the membrane s water permeability lp after chemical cleaning calculated over the one from the clogged membrane right before the cleaning process the three cleaning methods were a 3 g l sodium hypochlorite naclo bath for 1 h b 1 g l citric acid c6h8o7 bath for 24 h followed by 50 g l sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5h2o2 bath for 30 min c 0 1 g l sodium hypochlorite naclo bath for 24 h followed by 50 g l sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5h2o2 bath for 30 min the method with highest recuperation factor was later applied in between permeation cycles for both raw and ozonated leachate samples of raw leachate after microfiltration were also submitted to the ozonation process in the same operational ph as for the raw leachate to produce samples pretreated by route 4 then samples of leachate after all five pretreatment routes had their mfi values assessed in triplicate in order to establish the best pretreatment route prior to ro step 2 5 reverse osmosis the chosen best pretreatment route was applied to two leachate samples from the same landfill collected in different moments the pretreated leachates were submitted to an ro step in a system that is similar to the one used for mfi assessment and illustrated in fig 2 but with an ro membrane tw30 1812 100 dow filmtec miami usa instead of a mf one the ro operations lasted for 6 5 h at a feeding pressure of 0 5 mpa 73 psi with initial volumes of pretreated leachate in the feeding tank equal to 20 l the permeate flux behavior over time was observed at each treatment step samples were analyzed through the following parameters along with their analytical method according to apha 37 and

the lower the ec50 the higher the samples ecotoxicity to vibrio fischeri organisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozonation table 1 presents the results in triplicate of mfi for raw leachate and for its ozonated samples in different initial ph values the curves from which mfi values were obtained are displayed in appendix a it is possible to notice that the ozonation process presents higher mfi reduction efficiencies between ph 8 0 and 10 0 being slightly higher for ph 8 0 which is beneficial for this application since it is close to the natural ph range of the leachate samples between 7 0 and 8 0 at ph 8 0 this ozonation process showed to be capable of causing a significant reduction of mfi which is almost 90 lower than the one of raw leachate this mfi reduction percentage is similar to values reported before by ozonation applied to similar landfill leachate samples 36 on the other hand it has also been reported that the use of ozonation may enhance the fouling potential of landfill leachate 14 which once again demonstrates the need of evaluating the best treatment route on a case by case basis in the literature higher ph values are usually reported to cause improvements in ozonation process efficiency for instance ph 11 was reported to provide the best cod reduction 39 and abs254 reduction 40 of a mature landfill leachate it is known that the ph exerts major influence on the degradation mechanisms of ozonation since higher ph values tend to generate hydroxyl radicals starting an indirect degradation while lower ph values are more propense to undergo the direct ozone degradation which is more selective to cyclic and unsaturated organic compounds 41 in an intermediate ph value as the one observed in this work it is admitted that both mechanisms take place which seem to favor the mfi reduction of this leachate the ph 8 0 was therefore established as the one in which ozonation process must occur in all ozonation assays presented henceforth 3 2 submerged microfiltration table 2 presents the results of chemical cleaning methods applied to the clogged mf membrane module to recover its water permeability lp after operation cycles of 150 min at 0 1 mpa with raw leachate the curves from which lp values were extracted are presented in appendix b cleaning method c 0 1 g l sodium hypochlorite bath for 24 h followed by 50 g l sodium percarbonate bath for 30 min showed the highest recovery factor among the evaluated routes comparing cleaning methods b and c it is clear that the alkaline solution was more effective for recovering the membrane s permeability than the acidic one also comparing methods a and c it seems that the addition of a cleaning step with peroxide based product helped enhance the recovery factor all this information suggests that leachate fouling on the mf membrane is mainly caused by organic colloids particulate materials and microorganisms rather than by inorganic scaling since alkaline cleaning solutions are normally used for organic and colloidal fouling acidic cleaning solutions for inorganic scaling and peroxide is used for membrane disinfection reducing biofouling 42 this same behavior was observed by torres 30 when evaluating cleaning procedures for microfiltration membranes applied to treat landfill leachate method c was therefore established as the cleaning method and was applied between every permeation cycle described henceforth fig 5 presents the normalized permeate flux i e the immediate permeate fluxes j divided by the initial permeate flux j0 over time on the mf membranes permeations were made with raw leachate or ozonated leachate at ph 8 0 after each 150 min of permeation the established chemical cleaning method was applied in order to recover the permeate flux the curves in fig 5 show the benefits of applying an ozonation step prior to the mf one since the permeate fluxes of the ozonated samples remain further above the flux values of the raw leachate samples throughout the whole operation this same benefit has been previously reported when applying ozonation to humic acid solutions prior to mf membranes 43 the permeate flux of raw leachate samples instantly drops to less than 10 of the initial permeation in the chemically cleaned membrane module not only is the flux decay attenuated for the ozonated sample but also its final value at the steady state seems to settle at a value that is much closer to the initial permeate flux these results corroborate the ones presented in table 1 which indicates that ozonation can greatly reduce leachate s capacity of causing fouling on mf membranes they are also in accordance with mfi great reductions by ozonation reported in previous work 36 3 3 pretreatment combinations after applying an ozonation step to a previously microfiltered leachate sample in the same operational conditions that were used in the raw ones ph 8 0 mo3 1 g vleachate 1 l all pretreatment routes described in fig 1 were performed and their mfi assessment in triplicate are presented in table 3 the curves from which mfi values were obtained are displayed in appendix c these results point to the great capacity of both technologies to reduce the fouling potential of leachate both individually and in combination since all pretreatment routes reached values of mfi reduction close to 90 0 or higher it is curious to observe that the leachate sample after microfiltration still presents a considerably high mfi value which in theory should not happen once the mfi assessment takes place at a disposable mf membrane 0 45 Î¼m it is only intuitive that the submerged mf step would retain all compounds capable of depositing on the membrane surface of the later mfi apparatus reducing it to values close to zero the observation of mfi still elevated for the sample after mf step could be caused by differences between filtration operations or even between the membranes materials of submerged microfiltration process and mfi assessment however the most probable explanation is in the fact that fouling besides harming permeate flux also hampers the membrane selectivity 23 thus the quick fouling formation observed through the accentuated permeate flux drop of raw leachate fig 5 is also responsible for lowering the submerged microfiltration membrane selectivity and therefore reducing the permeate stream quality this phenomenon is one more reason for combining both pretreatment technologies the combinations between both methods were especially effective presenting mfi reductions higher than 99 8 in both cases the sample that went through ozonation followed by microfiltration additionally to presenting higher permeate fluxes during mf step showed final mfi under 20 s l2 which is considerably smaller than the 3 34 106 s l2 presented by the raw leachate this value is half of the one obtained by torres 30 who used fenton reaction another advanced oxidation process aop method followed by submerged mf to reduce the mfi of a stabilized landfill leachate of rio de janeiro this indicates that ozonation may act more efficiently than fenton reaction in this pretreatment route besides holding the advantage of not generating sludge during oxidation it is also 30 times lower than the one obtained by alfaia et al 33 who used coagulation flocculation processes to reduce leachate s mfi which points that the combination of oxidation and separation methods is much more efficient for that purpose than the conventional treatments finally chang et al 44 reported the use of sequential coagulation flocculation microfiltration and ultrafiltration to reduce the mfi of previously biotreated leachate samples from a six year closed landfill in taiwan the authors obtained an mfi reduction from 550 000 s l2 which is already six times lower than the raw leachate of this work to 28 5 s l2 which is a little higher than the final mfi value of this work even with the extra uf final step also ozonation may be more advantageous as an ro pretreatment than these two other methods fenton and coagulation flocculation since it does not generate residues that would add to the ro concentrate in the recirculation to the landfill this characteristic fits the recently approved law 9055 of the state of rio de janeiro brazil 45 which establishes that the re introduction of residues from leachate treatment to the landfill of origin is allowed as long as it does not exceed 1 3 in volume or mass of the leachate generated by it an mfi value of 20 s l2 is still above the intervals usually described as proper for water treatment through ro membranes between 0 and 1 s l2 46 or between 0 and 2 s l2 35 however there is no consensus among the scientific community about such intervals for ro membrane application on wastewater treatments either way this value is 170 000 times smaller than the mfi of raw leachate which represents a substantial improvement for the process in terms of fouling reduction route 5 was therefore selected as the best pretreatment prior to the ro step and the whole treatment was applied to leachate samples collected from this same landfill in two distinct moments samples a and b in order to validate the efficacy of this process 3 4 reverse osmosis the normalized permeate flux behavior in the reverse osmosis system of these two pretreated samples samples a and b over operational time is illustrated in fig 6 the charts in fig 6 show that the permeate flux drop is not very accentuated maintaining itself above 80 of its initial value after 6 5 h of operation for both leachate samples which reinforces the efficacy of the pretreatment method applied in preserving the ro permeability table 4 presents the characterization of both these samples a and b in their raw forms and after each treatment step including the final permeation in the ro membrane firstly it is important to observe that although both leachate samples are from the same landfill a short period of time between sampling is enough to cause some change in its composition which highlights the importance of a treatment process that is able to properly treat a wide range of concentrations of different pollutants overall the characterization results demonstrate the great importance of all treatment steps where each of them is responsible for the improvement of leachate quality in different parameters at different efficiency ratios the complete treatment route is responsible for expressive pollutant reductions above 97 for almost all evaluated parameters ph for both leachate samples is higher after ozonation which is due to the ph adjustment prior to this process and natural ph variation during oxidation reactions such elevation shows influence on the leachate alkalinity since the excessive free hydroxyls elevate the alkalinity measurement making ozonated samples present higher alkalinity than the raw ones in both cases ph and alkalinity did not change much during mf step but alkalinity greatly reduced during ro step probably due to the retention of carbonates and bicarbonates by the ro membrane the evaluation of organic matter content demonstrated that ozonation had significant effect on its reduction which can be perceived both by cod and by abs254 values in both cases the efficiency of cod and abs254 observed are similar or higher to what is commonly observed in the literature when ozonation is applied to leachate treatment 13 14 47 the same effect was not observed by mf step where these parameters did not change much which suggests that the biggest part of organic matter still in the samples after ozonation is dissolved not suspended this remaining organic matter was effectively removed by the ro step which results in an overall organic matter reduction close 99 for both parameters the ozonation step presents a small reduction of ammonia nitrogen which is a bit further removed by the mf step the reduction of ammonia concentration by both steps is probably caused by air stripping i e a mass transfer of gas dissolved in a liquid phase to a gaseous stream that contains lower concentration of such gas a phenomenon called desorption 46 air stripping is commonly applied for the removal of ammonia from landfill leachate and it is highly effective when the ph is adjusted to values above 11 but not that much for lower operational ph values as the one of this work 15 48 since both pretreatment steps encompass a gas stream that is continuously fed to the leachate throughout the process their bubbles were able to carry some of the dissolved gaseous ammonia however the biggest reduction takes place on the ro membrane where almost all the remaining ammonia nitrogen is retained the greatest contribution of mf step to the leachate quality seem to be in the reduction of turbidity a parameter that is associated to the presence of suspended matter which is greatly responsible for membrane fouling 23 it makes sense since this treatment step was applied mainly as a way to preserve the ro membrane lifespan rather than as a method to directly improve the leachate quality ozonation also reduced partially the turbidity prior to mf step and the remaining turbidity after mf was greatly removed by ro membrane presenting overall reductions higher than 99 in both cases as for color reduction ozonation step showed to be particularly effective being responsible for most of its removal this observation corroborates results previously published in the literature which report that color is the parameter the most affected by ozonation when applied in the treatment of landfill leachate 13 47 the same observation occurred when ozonation was applied to leachate samples from landfills in rio de janeiro state 36 in the present work the whole process caused an overall color reduction above 99 where ozonation alone was responsible for the removal of more than 80 of it when analyzing the chloride ions concentrations as expected it is clear that ro step was the sole responsible for their reductions above 97 in both cases which leads to final chloride concentrations much lower than what is established by national standards in force for fresh water bodies cl 250 mg l 49 other parameters that are specified in local resolutions for wastewater discharge in water bodies 50 51 are also within the range established 5 0 ph 9 0 cod 200 mgo2 l n nh3 20 mg l for both ro permeates which suggests that this treatment route is capable of fitting landfill leachates to proper discharge conditions table 5 presents the results of vibrio fischeri acute ecotoxicity for leachate sample b at each step of treatment keeping in mind that the lower the ec50 the higher to ecotoxicity to vibrio fischeri organisms it is clear that each treatment step significantly contributes to the reduction of ecotoxicity of leachate it is important to highlight that no treatment step caused a toxicity improvement which is likely to happen for oxidation processes like ozonation 24 this phenomenon was indeed reported by silva et al 52 who evaluated the use of ozonation to treat landfill leachate and observed that while the raw leachate showed an average ec50 of 13 15 to vibrio fischeri the samples after treatment presented average ec50 of 1 74 and 1 18 for ozone doses of 0 5 go3 l and 1 5 go3 l respectively torres 30 used a combination of aop fenton process and submerged microfiltration to treat landfill leachate and observed an ec50 improvement from 9 4 in the raw sample to 70 5 in the treated one to vibrio fischeri despite the great toxicity reduction the process was not able to fully remove the toxicity to these organisms this information suggests an advantage of using ozonation instead of fenton process for the oxidation step of this treatment since in the present work the sample after ozonation and microfiltration steps showed no toxicity 100 to the same organisms this hypothesis is corroborated by the work of bastos 53 who applied ozonation to treat a raw landfill leachate sample that presented ec50 of 2 04 and after oxidation the samples presented no ecotoxicity to the same organisms in this work the sample after microfiltration and the final sample after ro did not present acute ecotoxicity to the organisms evaluated the results of ecotoxicity along with the previous results presented in this work demonstrate that the treatment that is proposed o3 mf ro is capable of fitting landfill leachates to the standards in force for discharge in fresh water bodies finally it is important to stress that the final destination of the concentrates retained by the membrane another important problem associated with the use of ro to treat wastewaters in general may be performed in the case of landfill leachate by reintroducing it to the solid waste pile of the landfill besides being economically feasible historically this reintroduction has shown to be quite propitious causing no additional harm to the landfill and no significant alterations in leachate composition 54 although it should still be considered in the long term at the same time as previously discussed ozonation might be more valuable as a pretreatment to reverse osmosis then other methods like coagulation flocculation and fenton process since the first one does not generate residues that would add to the ro concentrate in the recirculation to the landfill 4 conclusions this work demonstrates the great capacity of ozonation and microfiltration processes to work as pretreatments for reverse osmosis membranes in the treatment of landfill leachate the combinations between both methods were especially effective for the reduction of leachate s fouling potential presenting mfi reductions higher than 99 8 the sample that went through ozonation followed by microfiltration showed final mfi under 20 s l2 which is considerably smaller than the 3 34 106 s l2 presented by the raw leachate it was possible to notice the benefits of using ozonation prior to the microfiltration step when compared to the opposite order not only because of the smaller mfi value obtained 19 53 s l2 instead of 5095 s l2 but also for the permeate flux improvement during microfiltration step chemical cleaning showed to be effective for recovering the microfiltration membrane permeability since cleaning baths of sodium hypochlorite and sodium percarbonate were capable of increasing more than 6 times the water permeability of the clogged module finally the characterizations of both ro permeate streams indicate that the proposed treatment route presents a great potential to properly treat a wastewater as complex as landfill leachate the use of ozonation and microfiltration prior to the ro step would vastly improve this membrane s lifespan reducing the costs with constant replacements the final treated samples presented reductions higher than 97 for almost all parameters evaluated when compared to the values of their respective untreated samples they were also within the ranges established for discharge in fresh water bodies according to the local standards in force and did not present any acute ecotoxicity for vibrio fischeri as well it is worth mentioning that despite the technical efficacy presented in this study ozonation and membrane separation processes may possibly be very expensive for practical applications especially when high ozone doses are required for the treatment which seems to be the case it is crucial to perform an economic evaluation prior to the application of this treatment

13391,the intrinsic hydrophobicity of poly vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene pvdf hpf membranes seriously hampers its application in the field of oily sewage treatment the superhydrophilic surface transition of pvdf hpf membranes can be achieved by the addition of inorganic nanoparticles nevertheless the improvement of water remediation capacity may not be outstanding due to the

and industries processing including exploration petrochemical transportation metal finishing and the frequent oil spill accidents 1 6 severe environmental pollution and ecological imbalance have raised an increasing concern in advanced technology for efficient purification of oily wastewater 7 8 in particular oil in water emulsions are chemically stable and difficult to remove making them a bottleneck for oil in water separation the advantages of membrane execution such as low cost and simple operation make it possible for the treatment of oily wastewater 3 among all membrane substrate materials pvdf hpf a copolymer of poly vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene has come into the light for its high mechanical and corrosion resistance however the low surface energy and inherent hydrophobicity of pvdf hpf ineluctably lead to serious membrane contamination problems such as the adhesion and plugging of oil droplet and surfactant and make the membrane surface interface susceptible to oil droplet accumulation during sieving operations resulting in deterioration of water flux and service life 9 therefore it is imperative to further develop multifunctional membranes with high wettability to separate o w emulsions easily and efficiently inspired by the wetting behavior of fish scales and lotus leaves many researchers have developed superwetting materials in recent years 10 12 including superhydrophobic underwater superoleophilic materials 13 15 and superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic sus materials 16 18 in fact the density of water is greater than that of oil which tends to form a water barrier above the hydrophobic membrane and inhibits oil penetration 19 for the separation of o w emulsions or water rich oil water mixtures superhydrophilic wca 0 and underwater superoleophobic uoca 150 membranes are more easily achieved in our previous study 20 it was mentioned that the chemical composition and roughness of the solid surface are crucial for the construction of sus surfaces therefore the doping of hydrophilic inorganic nanoparticles and the formation of hydrophilic rough structures are necessary it is reported that bentonite has been widely used as modified filler into nanocomposite membranes 21 it has a great deal of potential for composite modification of materials owing to their natural abundance environmental protection hydrophilicity low cost large surface area and good biocompatibility 22 nevertheless natural bentonite encounters problems of poor dispersion and adsorption capacity in wastewater treatment the separation performance of mmms on bentonite can be improved by modifying bentonite 23 zhu et al 24 prepared hybrid matrix membranes by incorporating montmorillonite nanosheets modified by chitosan into a polymer matrix to obtain good dye desalination performance dong et al 25 constructed an montmorillonite filled nanocomposite reverse osmosis membrane that had enhanced separation performance and improved antifouling properties unsatisfactorily after a preliminary study it was found that simple montmorillonite could not achieve the desired filtration effect on o w emulsion and the montmorillonite needed to be modified or with the help of other nanoparticles recently the bioinspired dopamine separation membranes have been considered as a highly efficient separation materials 26 27 nevertheless the high cost of dopamine monomers seriously impedes their widespread application fortunately low cost plant polyphenols such as ga tannic acid and allantoin have been widely utilized in various composite materials due to the strong binding affinity of substances containing catechol and pyrogallol group 7 zhan et al 28 compared the binding strength of three copolymers bearing phenol catechol and gallol groups proposed that tridentate structure exhibited stronger adhesive performances than bidentate structure possessing a remarkable abundance of interfacial interaction and chemical cross linking remarkably ga can generate multifunctional coatings by michael addition schiff base reaction under alkaline conditions with the aid of amino or sulfhydryl terminated substances 7 yang et al 7 prepared hydrophilic pvdf membranes by co cultivating the pristine membranes in an alkaline buffer solution containing ga and aptes which was achieved by the virtue of mussel inspired coatings and in situ silicification the abundant amino groups on hpei can be covalently linked to ga thus endowing higher positive surface charge and better separation properties to the coatings cheng et al 29 designed a versatile and excellent surface wetting coating via schiff base and michael addition reactions of ga with catechol structures and carboxyl groups and pei with amino groups current membrane modification research often tends to the multi functional coating or the co blending modification of membrane failing to focus on the advantages of both inspired by the above mentioned researchers we modified the membrane internally with the help of bentonite and then modified the membrane externally with ga and hpei hoping to fully combine the advantages of the modified materials and maximize the performance of the membrane herein inlight of the internal doping modification and external surface coating modification we put forward a modification method with internal and external coupling first the inner modified membranes kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were prepared by the phase inversion method using nano based bentonite modified by kh590 the kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were subsequently fabricated by external coating using ga and hyperbranched hpei for separation of o w emulsions among them ga has abundant hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups in the structure and its oxidation product benzoquinone can also be served as an active intermediate platform it can not only undergo michael addition reaction with the sulfhydryl group of kna bentonite but also undergo schiff base reaction or michael addition reaction with the amino group of hpei see fig 1 thus constructing a sulfhydryl quinone amino covalent bridge realizing the coupling of internal and external modification and also indirectly prompting the hpei nanocrystals to be uniformly dispersed additionally the coupling also realized the rough nanopapillae like structure created by the kna bentonite nanocrystals and ga aptes hpei multilayers together by integrating the respective advantages of hydrophilicity and rough structures the prepared membranes achieved not only superhydrophilicity but also efficient o w separation in a word the desired effectiveness of the as prepared kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms enlighten the great promise for their further

membranes evaluation the wettability of membranes evaluation was conducted using the water contact angle wca underwater oil contact experiment and water flux wf the wca of different membranes reflecting the wettability of the water membrane contact surface was measured by a contact angle goniometer dsa25 kruss germany with di water as the liquid around 5 points were arbitrarily selected on the membrane surface to get the averaged water contact angle value 36 the underwater oil contact experiment the membrane sample was pasted on the surface of the glass sheet put into a transparent beaker with deionized water and oil red stained petroleum ether was sprayed onto the underwater membrane surface with a syringe to observe and record the adhesion of oil droplets on the membrane surface the wf highlighting the wettability of the membranes was determined using a lab made dead end filtration setup the thoroughly washed membrane was loaded in a cup type ultrafiltration device msc300 shanghai mosu science equipment co ltd with an efficient filtration area of 33 49 cm2 to minimize compaction effects the pressure was stabilized 0 2 mpa to compact the pre wetted membranes for 10 min and then kept 0 2 mpa to calculate the water flux after reaching steady state the average of 3 measurements was utilized for a same sample the wf was determined by the following eq 1 1 j w 3 v

experiments firstly 0 09 g of span 80 was added to 10 g of soybean oil diesel hexane petroleum ether by ultrasonic dispersion at 70 c for 30 min 0 9 g of tween 80 was dissolved to 1 l of water by mechanical stirring for 30 min and then the two were mixed and mechanically stirred at high speed for 7 d to obtain a stable o w emulsion the oil flux of is defined as the flux of membrane filtration

and t is the permeation time of oil h the or of the membrane was calculated from the test results with the following eq 3 3 or c 0 c 1 c 1 100 where or is the oil rejection rate of the membrane c 0 c

antioxidation test of membrane the of and or of the membrane were tested after putting the membrane into the air for one month acid resistance alkali resistance and salt tolerance of membrane the of and or of the membranes were tested by placing them in hcl ph 1 naoh ph 12 and saturated nacl solutions for 48 h respectively the stability of the membranes to cope with long time natural environment and harsh environmental conditions is tested by antioxidation test acid resistance alkali resistance and salt tolerance test 3 results and discussion 3 1 specific surface area and porosity analysis table 2 shows the specific surface area pore size and pore volume of na bentonite and kna bentonite from the table it could be obtained that the pore size of the samples before and after modification is about 3 nm which did not change much and they were all within the pore size range of microporous and mesoporous materials most of which were mesoporous in addition the pore volume was not very different but the specific surface area of kna bentonite was reduced to 35 4 m2 g 1 indicating that kh590 may have entered the intermolecular layer 37 fig 3 enunciates the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of na bentonite and kna bentonite which illustrated that the model was an obvious h3 lag iv isotherm indicating that na bentonite and kna bentonite were a mixture of microporous and mesoporous materials in the results in table 2 the average pore size of kna bentonite increased compared with na bentonite but not significantly implying that a small portion of kh590 molecules entered the interlayer of bentonite the decrease of specific surface area and the increase of average pore size of kna bentonite indicated that kh590 existed in the interlayer or interpore of bentonite blocking part of the pore size resulting in the decrease of surface area similar results have also been reported for yao 37 3 2 characterization of morphology and structure fig 4 shows the sem images of the changes in surface morphology before and after the internal modification of pvdf hpf mmms bentonite it could be seen that the surface pores of the pristine pvdf hpf membrane and 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were similar and the pore structure is consistent indicating that kna bentonite did not affect the formation and structure of the membrane however it could not be ignored that a small number of kna bentonite particles were observed on the surface of 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms in fig 4 d which might be responsible for the decreased wca of 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms compared to the pristine membrane in fig 4 g specifically this attributed to the large number of hydroxyl groups on the end face of kna bentonite e g silanol groups aluminum magnesium iron hydroxyl groups at the end face of kna bentonite the wettability of kna bentonite pvdf ga aptes hpei mmms can be further achieved by the external and internal coupling modification of kna bentonite and ga aptes hpei fig 5 shows the sem images of surface morphology changes of the pvdf hpf membrane before and after external modification from fig 5 a b it could be seen that a large number of rough microsphere structures were covered the surface and pore channel of membrane after the external surface modification and the surface and pore channel of membrane also became rough which indicated that the silicon containing ends of aptes were successfully hydrolyzed and condensed into round spherical silicon containing oligomers 38 further the phenolic hydroxyl group in ga was autoxidized to benzoquinone in weakly alkaline tris hcl buffer solution in which benzoquinone not only autopolymerized and cross linked with ga to make covalent bonds between ga molecules but also underwent michael addition reaction or schiff base reaction with the amino group of hipe and aptes so that the covalent bridge of quinone amino was constructed and the round spherical particles became rough 39 from the sem images of pvdf hpf membranes modified with different contents of kna bentonite coupled with external surface in fig 5 c g it could be seen that the surface and pore channels of membrane had appeared rough particles in different degrees absolutely there were also lumps produced by the aggregation of particles and the lumps increased with the increase of kna bentonite content the average bulk volume of 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms was 0 922 Î¼m while the average bulk volume of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms reached 8 479 Î¼m which was a 9 fold increase this was attributed to the michael addition or schiff base reaction of the sulfhydryl group on the surface of kna bentonite with the oxide benzoquinone of ga in the internal modification 40 which achieved the crosslinking of the sulfhydryl quinon covalent bridge the rich hydrophilic groups binding the nanopapillae like structures to conferred amazed wettability to the membrane 3 3 ftir analysis fig 6 a shows the ftir of na bentonite and kna bentonite in which the main absorption vibration peaks of bentonite 3621 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of al o h 915 cm 1 is also al o h stretching vibration but it is a sensitive peak 3432 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of interlayer water hydroxyl 1637 cm 1 is the bending vibration of hydroxyl 1035 cm 1 and 798 cm 1 are the antisymmetric contraction vibration of si o si 520 cm 1 is the coupling vibration of si o m metal ions 470 cm 1 is the coupling vibration of m o were same basically indicating that the basic skeleton of bentonite had not done change during the modification process 37 however compared with na bentonite the intensity of almost all peaks of kna bentonite was enhanced which indicated that the covalent bonds had formed by dehydration reaction both of the surface hydroxyl group of na bent and kh590 leading to an increase in the interatomic distance and an increase in the corresponding dipole moment change notably new absorption peaks appeared at 2936 cm 1 and 2556 cm 1 for kna bentonite which were assigned to stretching vibration absorption peaks of ch and sh of kh590 respectively 41 collectively kh590 had grafted onto the surface of na bentonite successfully as shown in fig 6 b the absorption peaks were essentially the same for both of membranes in the low wavelength range of less than 1500 cm 1 so the substrate materials of membrane were both pvdf hpf materials it is well known that the crystalline phase of pvdf hpf mainly depends on the chain segment of pvdf the Î± crystalline phase of pvdf hpf was exhibited mainly before formation and after the Î² crystalline phase peaks were more obvious at 1275 cm 1 835 cm 1 510 cm 1 and 470 cm 1 and the Î± crystalline phase disappeared especially with the addition of kna bentonite the Î² crystalline phase increased indicating that kh590 modified bentonite could improve the role of crystalline nuclei and increased the crystallinity of pvdf hpf 42 significantly the ftir of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms showed the stretching vibration of methylene ch of kh590 at 2930 cm 1 while the asymmetric stretching vibration of si o si at 1041 cm 1 the coupling vibration of m o at 470 cm 1 the stretching vibration of ch at 3019 cm 1 the enhanced deformation vibration peaks of methylene at 1400 cm 1 and the increased hydroxyl vibration of the conjoined state at 3323 cm 1 had indirectly indicated that the addition of kna bentonite improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane 41 fig 6 c displays the ftir of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms and 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes mmms compared with 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms the newly added nh peaks of aptes from 1509 cm 1 to 1540 cm 1 the migration of the broadened si o si peak from 1041 cm 1 to 1070 cm 1 the weakened ch peak at 1400 cm 1 and the enhanced cn peak at 1376 cm 1 evidenced that aptes has been coupled into the coating 43 on the other hand the oh peak between 3000 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 was supposed to be caused by the abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups on the ga surface the above description indicated that ga coated the surface of the pvdf hpf membrane successfully as a key component in the coating and this was the reason for the significant improvement in wettability correspondingly in fig 6 d the newly added antisymmetric stretching vibration peaks of broad nh at 3366 cm 1 the stretching vibration peaks of nh at 1661 cm 1 the stretching characteristic peaks of cn at 1400 cm 1 and 1175 cm 1 all explained that hpei had been grafted onto the membrane coating successfully and also indicated the improved hydrophilicity of the membrane potentially 44 3 4 wettability analysis the surface hydrophilicity can form a hydration layer on the surface of the membrane or on the inner side of the pores which effectively prevents membrane contamination according to the wca diagram of each stage of the pvdf hpf membrane in fig 7 a it could be obtained that the wca of the membrane had dropped straight down from 75 7 of the pristine pvdf hpf membrane to 28 8 of the 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms after the internal modification of kna bentonite then after the external surface modification by ga aptes hpei the wca of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms dropped directly and rapidly to 0 which was certainly attributed to the membrane with rich nanopapillae like structure and hydrophilic functional groups of membrane from the diagram of wca at various ratios of kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms in fig 7 b it was known that the wca had decreased from 26 7 to 0 with the increase of kna bentonite and the slope of decrease had been the same basically indicating that kna bentonite provided help in hydrophilicity based on the analysis of the above sem and ftir results it was because the sulfhydryl groups on the surface of kna bentonite reacted with the benzoquinone of ga aptes resulting in the microsphere structure of ga aptes purposefully aggregated in the vicinity of kna bentonite in this paper the underwater oil contact situation of kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms was also tested at various ratios as shown in fig 7 c the membrane surface showed a yellow color after internal and external coupling modification compared with the pristine membrane the modified kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms all showed some degree of adhesion to oil droplets although they are superhydrophobic particularly 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms exhibited less adhesion which corresponds to the superhydrophilicity of the membrane so 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms possessed sus performance the wf of the membrane also reflects the hydrophilicity of the membrane visually from the wf of kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms at various ratios in fig 7 d it was obvious that the wf of the membrane had showed a qualitative enhancement from 1628 22 39 l m 2 h 1 of the pristine membrane to 5966 31 21 l m 2 h 1of the1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms after the internal and external coupling modification an improvement of 266 directly yielding a large improvement of the membrane infiltration by the internal and external coupling modification 3 5 selection and stability performance analysis fig 8 a shows the of and or of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms in soybean oil diesel hexane petroleum ether oil in water emulsions it was clear that the membrane had reached the maximum of of 2369 5 49 l m 2 h 1 and or of 99 3 in o w emulsions separating petroleum ether and the of and or of the other emulsions had been also larger than 1940 63 71 l m 2 h 1 and 97 99 the of in the o w emulsion of na bentonite pvdf hpf mmms separated petroleum ether was 1946 8 49 l m 2 h 1 and the flux increased by 422 7 l m 2 h 1 after the internal and external coupling modification indicating that the ga aptes hpei modification also improved the selectivity of the membrane the frr and wca of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms for 10 cycles could visually reflect the antifouling performance of the membrane fig 8 b shows the antifouling performance change curve of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms which illuminated that the frr of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms decreased from 97 62 to 87 38 initially unexpectedly the decreasing trend of frr was slow during the first five cycles and steepens after further cycles which was consistent with the results of the rising wca of the membrane in cyclic filtration this phenomenon might be caused by the instability of the coating or the accumulation of oil so that the membrane was limited in the number of cycles in filtration of oil in water emulsions fig 8 c proclaims the stability of the membrane and the stability of the coating under various harsh conditions after one month of sitting at room temperature the of of the membrane only decreased by 105 61 l m 2 h 1 and the or only decreased by 0 28 however when the membrane was in saturated solutions of ph 1 ph 12 and nacl the of of the membrane decreased by 982 41 l m 2 h 1 922 48 l m 2 h 1 and 915 79 l m 2 h 1 and the or of the membranes decreased by 3 07 2 66 and 2 38 respectively which implied that the antioxidant performance of the membranes was expected but the acid and alkali resistance and salt resistance of the membranes were challenged and this result might be due to the fact that the membranes were subjected to strong acid strong alkali and high salt solutions table 3 summarizes the performance of the membranes prepared in this paper compared with different membranes in the relevant literature it could be seen that the membrane prepared in this paper with external modification has better performance than the bentonite membrane alone compared with other externally modified membranes the membrane achieved superhydrophilicity stronger permeability and higher selectivity using internal and external modification of bentonite and benzoquinone 4 conclusions in summary ultrafiltration membrane treatment of oily sewage has always been a hotspot in the field of membrane separation and the problem of membrane cleanliness has also been a difficult point in the field of membrane separation in this paper kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms were prepared by internal and external coupling modification of membranes using the internal modification of kna bentonite in synergy with the external surface coating modification of ga aptes hpei by studying the effect of different ratios of kna bentonite on membrane properties the optimal membrane achieved the transition from hydrophilic to sus performance on the basis of kna bentonite nano doping the intermediate product benzoquinone of ga aptes was used to connect the sulfhydryl group on the surface of kna bentonite and the amino group on the surface of hpei which endowed the membrane surface with abundant hydrophilic groups and rough nanopapillae like structure resulting in a direct and rapid reduction of wca of the membrane to 0 undeniably the superhydrophilic feature of the membrane greatly contributed to the membrane permeability with a water flux of about 5966 31 21 l m 2 h 1 the underwater superoleophobicity further precipitated the high efficiency o w emulsion separation of 2369 5 49 l m 2 h 1 and or 99 3 furthermore the prepared membranes exhibited an outstanding antifouling property and anti aging property taken together the kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms has simple preparation route which makes it have great potential in treating oily wastewater and shows fascinating promise for applying in large scale declaration of competing interest

13391,the intrinsic hydrophobicity of poly vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene pvdf hpf membranes seriously hampers its application in the field of oily sewage treatment the superhydrophilic surface transition of pvdf hpf membranes can be achieved by the addition of inorganic nanoparticles nevertheless the improvement of water remediation capacity may not be outstanding due to the addition of small or excessive amounts of nanomaterials herein a highly active mixed matrix membranes mmms were prepared by an internal and external coupling strategy of mixing and surface modification firstly 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane kh590 modified sodium bentonite kna bentonite was used as nanofiller to prepare pvdf hpf mmms by phase inversion method subsequently the assembly of plant derived gallic acid ga and Î³ aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes couple kna bentonite and polyethyleneimine hpei as an intermediate component aims to constructed a nanostructured coating the excellent superhydrophilicity could be achieved on pvdf hpf mmms by nanopapillae like structures and sulfhydryl quinone amino covalent bridge the optimal pvdf hpf mmms possessed favorable water flux 5966 31 21 l m 2 h 1 under 0 2 mpa 266 higher than the pristine membrane highly efficient separation ability for oil in water o w emulsion 2369 5 49 l m 2 h 1 and operable antifouling performance the flux recovery rate decreased by 10 24 after 10 cycles moreover the oil rejection could be almost wholly restored after one month of standing at room temperature indicating that the modified mmms

and industries processing including exploration petrochemical transportation metal finishing and the frequent oil spill accidents 1 6 severe environmental pollution and ecological imbalance have raised an increasing concern in advanced technology for efficient purification of oily wastewater 7 8 in particular oil in water emulsions are chemically stable and difficult to remove making them a bottleneck for oil in water separation the advantages of membrane execution such as low cost and simple operation make it possible for the treatment of oily wastewater 3 among all membrane substrate materials pvdf hpf a copolymer of poly vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene has come into the light for its high mechanical and corrosion resistance however the low surface energy and inherent hydrophobicity of pvdf hpf ineluctably lead to serious membrane contamination problems such as the adhesion and plugging of oil droplet and surfactant and make the membrane surface interface susceptible to oil droplet accumulation during sieving operations resulting in deterioration of water flux and service life 9 therefore it is imperative to further develop multifunctional membranes with high wettability to separate o w emulsions easily and efficiently inspired by the wetting behavior of fish scales and lotus leaves many researchers have developed superwetting materials in recent years 10 12 including superhydrophobic underwater superoleophilic materials 13 15 and superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic sus materials 16 18 in fact the density of water is greater than that of oil which tends to form a water barrier above the hydrophobic membrane and inhibits oil penetration 19 for the separation of o w emulsions or water rich oil water mixtures superhydrophilic wca 0 and underwater superoleophobic uoca 150 membranes are more easily achieved in our previous study 20 it was mentioned that the chemical composition and roughness of the solid surface are crucial for the construction of sus surfaces therefore the doping of hydrophilic inorganic nanoparticles and the formation of hydrophilic rough structures are necessary it is reported that bentonite has been widely used as modified filler into nanocomposite membranes 21 it has a great deal of potential for composite modification of materials owing to their natural abundance environmental protection hydrophilicity low cost large surface area and good biocompatibility 22 nevertheless natural bentonite encounters problems of poor dispersion and adsorption capacity in wastewater treatment the separation performance of mmms on bentonite can be improved by modifying bentonite 23 zhu et al 24 prepared hybrid matrix membranes by incorporating montmorillonite nanosheets modified by chitosan into a polymer matrix to obtain good dye desalination performance dong et al 25 constructed an montmorillonite filled nanocomposite reverse osmosis membrane that had enhanced separation performance and improved antifouling properties unsatisfactorily after a preliminary study it was found that simple montmorillonite could not achieve the desired filtration effect on o w emulsion and the montmorillonite needed to be modified or with the help of other nanoparticles recently the bioinspired dopamine separation membranes have been considered as a highly efficient separation materials 26 27 nevertheless the high cost of dopamine monomers seriously impedes their widespread application fortunately low cost plant polyphenols such as ga tannic acid and allantoin have been widely utilized in various composite materials due to the strong binding affinity of substances containing catechol and pyrogallol group 7 zhan et al 28 compared the binding strength of three copolymers bearing phenol catechol and gallol groups proposed that tridentate structure exhibited stronger adhesive performances than bidentate structure possessing a remarkable abundance of interfacial interaction and chemical cross linking remarkably ga can generate multifunctional coatings by michael addition schiff base reaction under alkaline conditions with the aid of amino or sulfhydryl terminated substances 7 yang et al 7 prepared hydrophilic pvdf membranes by co cultivating the pristine membranes in an alkaline buffer solution containing ga and aptes which was achieved by the virtue of mussel inspired coatings and in situ silicification the abundant amino groups on hpei can be covalently linked to ga thus endowing higher positive surface charge and better separation properties to the coatings cheng et al 29 designed a versatile and excellent surface wetting coating via schiff base and michael addition reactions of ga with catechol structures and carboxyl groups and pei with amino groups current membrane modification research often tends to the multi functional coating or the co blending modification of membrane failing to focus on the advantages of both inspired by the above mentioned researchers we modified the membrane internally with the help of bentonite and then modified the membrane externally with ga and hpei hoping to fully combine the advantages of the modified materials and maximize the performance of the membrane herein inlight of the internal doping modification and external surface coating modification we put forward a modification method with internal and external coupling first the inner modified membranes kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were prepared by the phase inversion method using nano based bentonite modified by kh590 the kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were subsequently fabricated by external coating using ga and hyperbranched hpei for separation of o w emulsions among them ga has abundant hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups in the structure and its oxidation product benzoquinone can also be served as an active intermediate platform it can not only undergo michael addition reaction with the sulfhydryl group of kna bentonite but also undergo schiff base reaction or michael addition reaction with the amino group of hpei see fig 1 thus constructing a sulfhydryl quinone amino covalent bridge realizing the coupling of internal and external modification and also indirectly prompting the hpei nanocrystals to be uniformly dispersed additionally the coupling also realized the rough nanopapillae like structure created by the kna bentonite nanocrystals and ga aptes hpei multilayers together by integrating the respective advantages of hydrophilicity and rough structures the prepared membranes achieved not only superhydrophilicity but also efficient o w separation in a word the desired effectiveness of the as prepared kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms enlighten the great promise for their further practical application toward environmental remediation fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pvdf hpf was supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china bentonite was purchased

120 c for 24 h the na bentonite was sonicated and dispersed in ethanol aqueous solution then the appropriate amount of kh590 was added and the ph was adjusted to 4 the sonication was continued for 5 min and then transferred to a reflux stirring device at 80 c for 10 h after cooling the washing was repeated to remove the excess kh590 and the kna bentonite was obtained after drying at 120 c for 24 h pvdf hpf mmms were fabricated by phase inversion method 33 35 with pvp as pore former and dmac as solvent firstly kna bentonite of different mass ratios 0 wt 0 3 wt 0 6 wt 0 9 wt 1 2 wt 1 5 wt were ultrasonically dissolved in dmf then pvdf hpf 15 0 wt and pvp 5 0 wt were added and mechanically stirred in a water bath at 60 c for 12 h to obtain homogeneous membrane casting solution the solution was vacuum pumped for 30 min to release bubbles formed during the stirring process subsequently the degassed solution was cast onto the automatic wire rod coater by a wire rod with 100 Î¼m gap finally the glass plate was placed in a deionized water bath to conduct the phase inversion process after 24 h the prepared kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were immersed into a deionized water glycerol 1 1 bath for backup the specific ratios of the synthesis process are shown in table 1 below the fabrication of the kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms are shown in fig 2 below 2 3 fabrication of kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms the fabrication of the kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms were shown in fig 2 for starters kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were pre wetted with ethanol solution for 60 min soaked in deionized water for another 60 min to wash away the ethanol and then dried in air then 0 5 g of ga was dissolved in 25 ml of tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 5 and a certain amount of aptes was dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol afterward the prepared membranes were added to a ga aptes mixture consisting of two solutions and the kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes mmms membranes were obtained by shaking and soaking for 12 h repeated washing with deionized water and ethanol and drying at 60 c next an appropriate amount of hpei was dissolved in 20 ml of anhydrous methanol solution and the above kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes mmms were infiltrated in this solution for 12 h and then cleaned with ethanol and dried at 60 c to obtain kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms 2 4 characterization of membranes 2 4 1 membrane characterization the morphology surface and cross section of the membranes was observed by scanning electron microscope sem supra 55 zeiss germany equipment cross section

membranes evaluation the wettability of membranes evaluation was conducted using the water contact angle wca underwater oil contact experiment and water flux wf the wca of different membranes reflecting the wettability of the water membrane contact surface was measured by a contact angle goniometer dsa25 kruss germany with di water as the liquid around 5 points were arbitrarily selected on the membrane surface to get the averaged water contact angle value 36 the underwater oil contact experiment the membrane sample was pasted on the surface of the glass sheet put into a transparent beaker with deionized water and oil red stained petroleum ether was sprayed onto the underwater membrane surface with a syringe to observe and record the adhesion of oil droplets on the membrane surface the wf highlighting the wettability of the membranes was determined using a lab made dead end filtration setup the thoroughly washed membrane was loaded in a cup type ultrafiltration device msc300 shanghai mosu science equipment co ltd with an efficient filtration area of 33 49 cm2 to minimize compaction effects the pressure was stabilized 0 2 mpa to compact the pre wetted membranes for 10 min and then kept 0 2 mpa to calculate the water flux after reaching steady state the average of 3 measurements was utilized for a same sample the wf was determined by the following eq 1 1 j w 3 v a t 1 t 2 t 3 where j w is the wf l m 2 h 1 v is the volume of penetrative water l a is the effective membrane area m2 and t is the permeation time of water h 2 4 3 emulsion preparation and separation experiments firstly 0 09 g of span 80 was added to 10 g of soybean oil diesel hexane petroleum ether by ultrasonic dispersion at 70 c for 30 min 0 9 g of tween 80 was dissolved to 1 l of water by mechanical stirring for 30 min and then the two were mixed and mechanically stirred at high speed for 7 d to obtain a stable o w emulsion the oil flux of is defined as the flux of membrane filtration of o w emulsion the oil rejection or is defined as the rejection rate of membrane filtration of o w emulsion the membrane sample with a diameter of 10 cm was placed in a magnetic ultrafiltration cup

calculate the of j o of the membrane the concentration of oily sewage before and after filtration was measured by oil concentration analyzer in water et 1200 shanghai continental science instrument co ltd in a 4 cm cuvette the calculation formula is shown in the following eq 2 2 j o 3 v o a t 1 t 2 t 3 where j o is the of l m 2 h 1 v o is the volume of emulsion l a is the effective membrane area m2 and t is the permeation time of oil h the or of the membrane was calculated from the test results with the following eq 3 3 or c 0 c 1 c 1 100 where or is the oil rejection rate of the membrane c 0 c 1 is the the concentration of oil in water emulsion before after separation 2 4 4 long term stability test the antifouling performance of the membrane is denoted by the water flux recovery rate frr and the contact angle change after the above mentioned oil water emulsion flux test the membrane was thoroughly cleaned with deionized water and ethanol and then the water flux test and contact angle test were performed in this way for 10 cycles and the frr of the membrane flux recovery rate was calculated using the following eq 4 4 frr j wn j w 100 where frr is the flux recovery rate of the membrane j w represents the original pure water flux of the membrane l m 2 h 1 j wn represents the pure water flux of the membrane for the n times after the oil in water emulsion test l m 2 h 1 antioxidation test of membrane the of and or of the membrane were tested after putting the membrane into the air for one month acid resistance alkali resistance and salt tolerance of membrane the of and or of the membranes were tested by placing them in hcl ph 1 naoh ph 12 and saturated nacl solutions for 48 h respectively the stability of the membranes to cope with long time natural environment and harsh environmental conditions is tested by antioxidation test acid resistance alkali resistance and salt tolerance test 3 results and discussion 3 1 specific surface area and porosity analysis table 2 shows the specific surface area pore size and pore volume of na bentonite and kna bentonite from the table it could be obtained that the pore size of the samples before and after modification is about 3 nm which did not change much and they were all within the pore size range of microporous and mesoporous materials most of which were mesoporous in addition the pore volume was not very different but the specific surface area of kna bentonite was reduced to 35 4 m2 g 1 indicating that kh590 may have entered the intermolecular layer 37 fig 3 enunciates the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of na bentonite and kna bentonite which illustrated that the model was an obvious h3 lag iv isotherm indicating that na bentonite and kna bentonite were a mixture of microporous and mesoporous materials in the results in table 2 the average pore size of kna bentonite increased compared with na bentonite but not significantly implying that a small portion of kh590 molecules entered the interlayer of bentonite the decrease of specific surface area and the increase of average pore size of kna bentonite indicated that kh590 existed in the interlayer or interpore of bentonite blocking part of the pore size resulting in the decrease of surface area similar results have also been reported for yao 37 3 2 characterization of morphology and structure fig 4 shows the sem images of the changes in surface morphology before and after the internal modification of pvdf hpf mmms bentonite it could be seen that the surface pores of the pristine pvdf hpf membrane and 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms were similar and the pore structure is consistent indicating that kna bentonite did not affect the formation and structure of the membrane however it could not be ignored that a small number of kna bentonite particles were observed on the surface of 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms in fig 4 d which might be responsible for the decreased wca of 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms compared to the pristine membrane in fig 4 g specifically this attributed to the large number of hydroxyl groups on the end face of kna bentonite e g silanol groups aluminum magnesium iron hydroxyl groups at the end face of kna bentonite the wettability of kna bentonite pvdf ga aptes hpei mmms can be further achieved by the external and internal coupling modification of kna bentonite and ga aptes hpei fig 5 shows the sem images of surface morphology changes of the pvdf hpf membrane before and after external modification from fig 5 a b it could be seen that a large number of rough microsphere structures were covered the surface and pore channel of membrane after the external surface modification and the surface and pore channel of membrane also became rough which indicated that the silicon containing ends of aptes were successfully hydrolyzed and condensed into round spherical silicon containing oligomers 38 further the phenolic hydroxyl group in ga was autoxidized to benzoquinone in weakly alkaline tris hcl buffer solution in which benzoquinone not only autopolymerized and cross linked with ga to make covalent bonds between ga molecules but also underwent michael addition reaction or schiff base reaction with the amino group of hipe and aptes so that the covalent bridge of quinone amino was constructed and the round spherical particles became rough 39 from the sem images of pvdf hpf membranes modified with different contents of kna bentonite coupled with external surface in fig 5 c g it could be seen that the surface and pore channels of membrane had appeared rough particles in different degrees absolutely there were also lumps produced by the aggregation of particles and the lumps increased with the increase of kna bentonite content the average bulk volume of 0 3 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms was 0 922 Î¼m while the average bulk volume of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms reached 8 479 Î¼m which was a 9 fold increase this was attributed to the michael addition or schiff base reaction of the sulfhydryl group on the surface of kna bentonite with the oxide benzoquinone of ga in the internal modification 40 which achieved the crosslinking of the sulfhydryl quinon covalent bridge the rich hydrophilic groups binding the nanopapillae like structures to conferred amazed wettability to the membrane 3 3 ftir analysis fig 6 a shows the ftir of na bentonite and kna bentonite in which the main absorption vibration peaks of bentonite 3621 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of al o h 915 cm 1 is also al o h stretching vibration but it is a sensitive peak 3432 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of interlayer water hydroxyl 1637 cm 1 is the bending vibration of hydroxyl 1035 cm 1 and 798 cm 1 are the antisymmetric contraction vibration of si o si 520 cm 1 is the coupling vibration of si o m metal ions 470 cm 1 is the coupling vibration of m o were same basically indicating that the basic skeleton of bentonite had not done change during the modification process 37 however compared with na bentonite the intensity of almost all peaks of kna bentonite was enhanced which indicated that the covalent bonds had formed by dehydration reaction both of the surface hydroxyl group of na bent and kh590 leading to an increase in the interatomic distance and an increase in the corresponding dipole moment change notably new absorption peaks appeared at 2936 cm 1 and 2556 cm 1 for kna bentonite which were assigned to stretching vibration absorption peaks of ch and sh of kh590 respectively 41 collectively kh590 had grafted onto the surface of na bentonite successfully as shown in fig 6 b the absorption peaks were essentially the same for both of membranes in the low wavelength range of less than 1500 cm 1 so the substrate materials of membrane were both pvdf hpf materials it is well known that the crystalline phase of pvdf hpf mainly depends on the chain segment of pvdf the Î± crystalline phase of pvdf hpf was exhibited mainly before formation and after the Î² crystalline phase peaks were more obvious at 1275 cm 1 835 cm 1 510 cm 1 and 470 cm 1 and the Î± crystalline phase disappeared especially with the addition of kna bentonite the Î² crystalline phase increased indicating that kh590 modified bentonite could improve the role of crystalline nuclei and increased the crystallinity of pvdf hpf 42 significantly the ftir of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms showed the stretching vibration of methylene ch of kh590 at 2930 cm 1 while the asymmetric stretching vibration of si o si at 1041 cm 1 the coupling vibration of m o at 470 cm 1 the stretching vibration of ch at 3019 cm 1 the enhanced deformation vibration peaks of methylene at 1400 cm 1 and the increased hydroxyl vibration of the conjoined state at 3323 cm 1 had indirectly indicated that the addition of kna bentonite improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane 41 fig 6 c displays the ftir of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms and 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes mmms compared with 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms the newly added nh peaks of aptes from 1509 cm 1 to 1540 cm 1 the migration of the broadened si o si peak from 1041 cm 1 to 1070 cm 1 the weakened ch peak at 1400 cm 1 and the enhanced cn peak at 1376 cm 1 evidenced that aptes has been coupled into the coating 43 on the other hand the oh peak between 3000 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 was supposed to be caused by the abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups on the ga surface the above description indicated that ga coated the surface of the pvdf hpf membrane successfully as a key component in the coating and this was the reason for the significant improvement in wettability correspondingly in fig 6 d the newly added antisymmetric stretching vibration peaks of broad nh at 3366 cm 1 the stretching vibration peaks of nh at 1661 cm 1 the stretching characteristic peaks of cn at 1400 cm 1 and 1175 cm 1 all explained that hpei had been grafted onto the membrane coating successfully and also indicated the improved hydrophilicity of the membrane potentially 44 3 4 wettability analysis the surface hydrophilicity can form a hydration layer on the surface of the membrane or on the inner side of the pores which effectively prevents membrane contamination according to the wca diagram of each stage of the pvdf hpf membrane in fig 7 a it could be obtained that the wca of the membrane had dropped straight down from 75 7 of the pristine pvdf hpf membrane to 28 8 of the 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf mmms after the internal modification of kna bentonite then after the external surface modification by ga aptes hpei the wca of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms dropped directly and rapidly to 0 which was certainly attributed to the membrane with rich nanopapillae like structure and hydrophilic functional groups of membrane from the diagram of wca at various ratios of kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms in fig 7 b it was known that the wca had decreased from 26 7 to 0 with the increase of kna bentonite and the slope of decrease had been the same basically indicating that kna bentonite provided help in hydrophilicity based on the analysis of the above sem and ftir results it was because the sulfhydryl groups on the surface of kna bentonite reacted with the benzoquinone of ga aptes resulting in the microsphere structure of ga aptes purposefully aggregated in the vicinity of kna bentonite in this paper the underwater oil contact situation of kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms was also tested at various ratios as shown in fig 7 c the membrane surface showed a yellow color after internal and external coupling modification compared with the pristine membrane the modified kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms all showed some degree of adhesion to oil droplets although they are superhydrophobic particularly 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms exhibited less adhesion which corresponds to the superhydrophilicity of the membrane so 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms possessed sus performance the wf of the membrane also reflects the hydrophilicity of the membrane visually from the wf of kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms at various ratios in fig 7 d it was obvious that the wf of the membrane had showed a qualitative enhancement from 1628 22 39 l m 2 h 1 of the pristine membrane to 5966 31 21 l m 2 h 1of the1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms after the internal and external coupling modification an improvement of 266 directly yielding a large improvement of the membrane infiltration by the internal and external coupling modification 3 5 selection and stability performance analysis fig 8 a shows the of and or of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms in soybean oil diesel hexane petroleum ether oil in water emulsions it was clear that the membrane had reached the maximum of of 2369 5 49 l m 2 h 1 and or of 99 3 in o w emulsions separating petroleum ether and the of and or of the other emulsions had been also larger than 1940 63 71 l m 2 h 1 and 97 99 the of in the o w emulsion of na bentonite pvdf hpf mmms separated petroleum ether was 1946 8 49 l m 2 h 1 and the flux increased by 422 7 l m 2 h 1 after the internal and external coupling modification indicating that the ga aptes hpei modification also improved the selectivity of the membrane the frr and wca of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms for 10 cycles could visually reflect the antifouling performance of the membrane fig 8 b shows the antifouling performance change curve of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms which illuminated that the frr of 1 5 kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms decreased from 97 62 to 87 38 initially unexpectedly the decreasing trend of frr was slow during the first five cycles and steepens after further cycles which was consistent with the results of the rising wca of the membrane in cyclic filtration this phenomenon might be caused by the instability of the coating or the accumulation of oil so that the membrane was limited in the number of cycles in filtration of oil in water emulsions fig 8 c proclaims the stability of the membrane and the stability of the coating under various harsh conditions after one month of sitting at room temperature the of of the membrane only decreased by 105 61 l m 2 h 1 and the or only decreased by 0 28 however when the membrane was in saturated solutions of ph 1 ph 12 and nacl the of of the membrane decreased by 982 41 l m 2 h 1 922 48 l m 2 h 1 and 915 79 l m 2 h 1 and the or of the membranes decreased by 3 07 2 66 and 2 38 respectively which implied that the antioxidant performance of the membranes was expected but the acid and alkali resistance and salt resistance of the membranes were challenged and this result might be due to the fact that the membranes were subjected to strong acid strong alkali and high salt solutions table 3 summarizes the performance of the membranes prepared in this paper compared with different membranes in the relevant literature it could be seen that the membrane prepared in this paper with external modification has better performance than the bentonite membrane alone compared with other externally modified membranes the membrane achieved superhydrophilicity stronger permeability and higher selectivity using internal and external modification of bentonite and benzoquinone 4 conclusions in summary ultrafiltration membrane treatment of oily sewage has always been a hotspot in the field of membrane separation and the problem of membrane cleanliness has also been a difficult point in the field of membrane separation in this paper kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms were prepared by internal and external coupling modification of membranes using the internal modification of kna bentonite in synergy with the external surface coating modification of ga aptes hpei by studying the effect of different ratios of kna bentonite on membrane properties the optimal membrane achieved the transition from hydrophilic to sus performance on the basis of kna bentonite nano doping the intermediate product benzoquinone of ga aptes was used to connect the sulfhydryl group on the surface of kna bentonite and the amino group on the surface of hpei which endowed the membrane surface with abundant hydrophilic groups and rough nanopapillae like structure resulting in a direct and rapid reduction of wca of the membrane to 0 undeniably the superhydrophilic feature of the membrane greatly contributed to the membrane permeability with a water flux of about 5966 31 21 l m 2 h 1 the underwater superoleophobicity further precipitated the high efficiency o w emulsion separation of 2369 5 49 l m 2 h 1 and or 99 3 furthermore the prepared membranes exhibited an outstanding antifouling property and anti aging property taken together the kna bentonite pvdf hpf ga aptes hpei mmms has simple preparation route which makes it have great potential in treating oily wastewater and shows fascinating promise for applying in large scale declaration of competing interest

economy and urbanization requires more energy for the improving industries and activities energy consumption is projected to increase by 35 from 2014 to 2035 1 currently the use of fossil fuels is causing global climate change which is mainly due to the release of pollutants such as nitrogen and sulfur oxides cox soot ash bitumen droplets and other organic pollutants a set of environmental issues caused by severe and persistent dependence on fossil fuels include air pollution acid rain and global warming greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 80 from 1970 to 2004 and are also projected to increase by 52 between 2005 and 2050 2 due to the primary energy crisis the necessity of focusing on renewable energy options has played a significant role in recent studies 1 in various researches a number of renewable energy sources such as solar energy wind power hydroelectric power biomass and biofuels have been studied biogas production from biomass has several advantages including the simultaneous advantages of energy production and organic waste management easy storage and transportation the availability of natural gas infrastructure and minimal negative impact on the environment during the production process among various biofuels biohydrogen has been mentioned as emerging potential technology for transition in the long term for cleaner energy and to develop sustainable transport systems 3 5 a variety of technologies namely thermal electrolytic and biochemical processes can be used to produce the h2 molecule the main thermochemical technologies used extensively nowadays are steam reforming sr partial oxidation pox and autothermal reforming atr 6 since these processes require high energy and have greenhouse effect thus hydrogen production from renewable sources like biomass and municipal or industrial wastes draws great attention the two major pathways for the bioresource conversion to hydrogen are the biochemical conversion i e anaerobic digestion or dark fermentation thermochemical conversion i e combustion or gasification or using microbial electrolysis cells mecs 7 the wastewaters are a rich source of organic nutrients which supports the growth of hydrogen producers along with the disposal of waste and energy recovery among various processes used for wastewater treatment such as physico chemical biological processes advanced oxidation processes photocatalytic reactions adsorption filtration and membrane processes biological processes has been known as one of the best cost effective and high performing solutions for secondary treatment 8 14 type of hydrogen application plays a key role for choosing the fuel and processing system for hydrogen production among the various hydrogen production processes less energy is used through the biological method since it can be accomplished at moderate operational conditions 15 thus biohydrogen production through fermentation is more feasible economic and simple and received more attention in recent years 16 biomass derived hydrogen production is affected by various factors such as reactor type biomass type inoculum and operational conditions as reported in the literature various reactor types stirred tank bubble column airlift and membrane reactors are used for biohydrogen production 7 17 18 membrane bioreactors mbrs with different scales types and structures have recently emerged as an effective systems for wastewater treatment as well as hydrogen production integrating conventional anaerobic fermenters with membrane technology leads to the anaerobic mbrs anmbrs which is considered as an innovative technology in biohydrogen production more details and information can be found in a recent review on anmbrs 19 21 beside the classical mbr classifications introduced in the literature anmbr can be developed by coupling gas separation membranes instead of a water purifier filter to a hydrogen production fermenter i e stirred tank reactor it plays an essential role in the purification of hydrogen coming from the bioreactor these systems are generally introduced as membrane gas separation based bioreactor mgsbr in the hydrogen separation membrane module the feed mixture coming from the fermentation bioreactor is separated into two flows a a hydrogen enriched flow permeate in which the purity depends on the membrane perm selectivity and b a non permeated retentate stream consisting of no energetic value products such as co2 and n2 due to complexity of the system various parameters such as impeller rotational speed membrane characteristics and permeability mass transfer coefficient are affecting the mgsbr performance moreover all the parameters affecting the process and enabling the success of this process are not easy to be set accordingly application of computational models for enabling the prediction and subsequent testing of a large number of parameters that influence the system performance seems crucial 22 computational fluid dynamics cfd is a powerful design tool which could be used for simultaneous modeling of the microbial growth kinetics hydrodynamics aeration and membrane separation modules msms coupled to bioreactors 23 it could simulate the fluid flow regarding the effects of sludge rheology and give a comprehensive quantitative explanation of its hydrodynamics predicting the performance of the reactor precisely by using semi empirical formula which otherwise could result hard to be achieved by conventional experiments cfd modeling of msms may facilitate the optimization of all the design variables such as reactor geometry nutrient removal and energy consumption affecting both organism growth and filtration aspects 17 generally application of cfd to msm systems is particularly difficult and requires special computational efforts various researches have been reported in the literature to evaluate the cfd simulation for different applications and hydrodynamic analysis 24 26 since the performance and efficiency of a hydrogen production bioreactor is affected by many design and operational characteristics and hydrodynamic parameters it is necessary to recognize the optimal conditions of factors as well as their mutual interactions achieving this purpose by applying conventional optimizing methods like univariate method is time consuming and of high cost response surface methodology rsm has been found to be an accurate useful and cost effective tool for predicting the relationship between the limited number of input and output parameters rsm is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques which can be applied for developing improving and optimizing the process variables and minimizes the number of combination of variables while the precision of the predicted response remains properly although there is already a considerable amount of researches utilizing cfd and rsm separately few studies from different scientific areas have been reported as application of both techniques together 27 combining optimization methodologies such as design of experiments doe with numerical models avoids expensive and time consuming experiments while allowing for obtaining optimal conditions using different input combinations however it should be notified that although several simulators are commercialized for biogas production through anaerobic digestion but none of them are available for biohydrogen since biohydrogen production processes are less mature than anaerobic fermentation and there is a major lack of robust models for fermentation processes a comprehensive comparative study is conducted by chezeau and vial 28 on various modeling strategies that can be used for prediction of biohydrogen production yield and productivity various modeling methods such as the empirical semi empirical equations statistical approaches distributed models nonideal and compartmental models structured unstructured kinetic models artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithms gas from the simplest to the most advanced are addresses as well as cfd coupled with a population balance approach pba method it is worth noting that the performance of any biohydrogen process depends on the optimization of various factors along with biohydrogen production maximizing and preventing malfunction of the bioreactor this goal is achievable through applying cfd rsm combined method which is a good compromise for the future application of distributed models to bioreactors because they take effect of different operational parameters hydrodynamics and industrial constraints into account and can maintain reasonable computation costs at the same time silva and rouboa 29 coupled the results obtained from a 2d multiphase eulerian eulerian biomass gasification model developed by cfd technique with rsm to find the best operating conditions to produce syngas for different applications the most appropriate operation conditions which guaranteed both the best response and minimal variations caused by effective factors was found using cfd rsm combined method in another work enhanced removal of nitrate and phosphate from wastewater by c vulgaris was investigated using rsm and cfd techniques and the effect of baffle on mixing performance thus on bioremoval efficiency was studied 30 in the study conducted by banik et al 31 rsm was coupled with cfd to investigate the optimum operating parameters and hydrodynamic behavior of rectangular sheet membrane in order to enhance permeate flux cfd simulation was implemented to visualize the feed and permeate sides concentration profile of membrane subjected to rsm predicted optimum condition yang et al 27 studied the controlling of reversible membrane fouling due to cake layer formation and foulants deposition by optimizing mbr hydrodynamics through the combination of cfd and doe sludge concentration was considered as the most influencing parameter on the responses and was optimized for the reduction of reversible fouling in the submerged mbr consequently the results of all the mentioned works proved the capability of combining rsm with cfd to decrease experimental procedures while enabling process optimization to the best of our knowledge there is no current research addressing the modeling and simulation of the mgsbr used for biohydrogen production using cfd rsm technique our approach aims to develop a 2d cfd model of a general wastewater treatment and biohydrogen production system coupled to a hydrogen membrane separation unit to achieve standardization and generalization of this novel bioreactor for further full scale applications this approach requires five main steps which are further developed 1 cfd simulation of the biohydrogen production along with sucrose biodegradation in a stirred fermenter operating in batch modality 2 cfd simulation of the hydrogen separation membrane unit 3 developing a mgsbr by integration of the stirred fermenter with the membrane unit operating in batch recycle mode 4 applying cfd based rsm technique for evaluating the main and interaction effects of the studied parameters in the mgsbr 5 performing an optimization with the goal of maximizing biohydrogen production in the proposed mgsbr 2 cfd modeling due to the integration of physical and biological processes and the coupling of fluid dynamics kinetics and mass transfer phenomena in the mgsbr cfd was used for simulation of the studied system thus a 2d transient simulation using eulerian eulerian two fluid model was conducted using comsol multiphysics 5 4 software to study the multiphase flow dynamics and bioreaction in the stirred bioreactor 2 1 reactor geometry and meshing in the present study the bioreactor setup based on the experimental conditions used by mu et al 32 was simulated the general approach was to conduct a baseline cfd analysis for a batch stirred tank reactor with a total capacity of 5 l the bioreactor was simulated to operate in batch and batch recycle flow mode for biohydrogen generation a general schematic of the bioreactor can be observed in fig 1 a where the mixer impeller is also shown sucrose was used as the single substrate with amount of 35 0 g l for biohydrogen production via anaerobic activated sludge process a six bladed impeller with the rushton turbine design and external diameter of 8 7 cm fig 1b was used for maintaining homogeneity in the bioreactor the geometric characteristics of the bioreactor setup is summarized in table 1 the temperature was maintained at the level of 35 0 c and naoh was used to keep a ph level of 5 5 in the reactor as reported in the literature 32 the aeration of the bioreactor introduced as a recycle flow was supplied by a sparger located at the bottom of the reactor discretization of the computational domain was performed using unstructured free triangular meshes known for their supremacy in mesh quality and calculation convergence control local meshes near the wall and impeller blades were refined and mesh size increased to improve the numerical accuracy and stability fig 1c a mesh with higher element numbers result in more accurate simulation results and accordingly higher computational cost and time thus a mesh independency check was conducted to determine the optimized grid number and the results can be found in section 3 1 1 2 1 1 governing equations the cfd model combines the liquid and gas hydrodynamics and formulates and solves the fundamental mass and momentum balance equations the discrete governing equations describing the momentum and mass transfer phenomena were solved repeatedly for the control volume until convergence was obtained the perturbation equations were also solved continuously along with the continuity the navier stokes and the energy equations the equation of momentum transport for liquid phase is as follows 33 1 Ï l Ï l u l t Ï l Ï l u l u l p Ï l

simulation of a complex mgsbr mainly depends on application of proper turbulence models by cfd which could precisely characterize the present flow fields the precise modeling of turbulent condition in reactors are complex since there is a continuous random change in velocity and other flow properties which are made by eddies with a wide range of length and time scales among a large family of turbulence closures the standard k É turbulence model is frequently used for modeling of medium to large scale applications it is a tradeoff between computational accuracy and efficiency and is based

coefficient volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla is recognized as an important parameter for determining the efficiency and possibility of increasing the reactor scale especially for bioreactors 32 in a bioreactor the level of mass available for mass transfer is not easily measured however the kla expression which is the product of the mass transfer coefficient and the surface area could be easily measured which is representative of the bioreactor productivity 36 kla values are affected by various factors such as stirring speed air flow rate temperature environmental properties composition viscosity etc and reactor geometry for example with increasing stirrer speed or air flow rate kla tends to increase as the area between the gas and liquid interface increases however higher speeds of mixing can cause shear forces between cells in the medium and can lead to cell damage in this study our goal is to measure kla for hydrogen which is calculated by eq 15 proposed by

dense palladium based membranes a tubular pdag membrane is selected to be housed in a msm coupled with the bioreactor for separating and hydrogen recovering high grade biohydrogen fig 2 shows the 2d scheme of the single tubular pdag membrane with a length of 141 mm and a diameter of 10 mm which is plotted according to the geometrical characteristics reported by santucci et al 38 and the experimental data in the referred research were also used for the validation of the developed cfd model a 2d axisymmetric model based on cfd method is created and meshed fig 2b to investigate the biohydrogen separation from the biogas outlet flow of the bioreactor the integration the fermenter and the pdag separation unit the mgsbr is illustrated in fig 2c for the model validation it is assumed that only hydrogen may permeate through the pdag membrane and the hydrogen permeating flux is calculated and compared with the experimental data reported in the literature 38 39 in the mgsbr simulations a gas mixture containing co2 and h2 is assumed to constitute the feed entering the msm a sweep gas is also introduced into the msm pure hydrogen is collected into the permeate stream shell side due to the full hydrogen perm selectivity of the pdag membrane while a co2 rich stream is collected in the retentate side in the lumen side in this study two mass transfer equations are used for the permeate and retentate domains as follows 39 29 j i u c i r i 30 j i d i c i where c i represent species concentration i mol m3 d i diffusion coefficient m2 s r i reaction rate for species i mol

behavior present in the bioreactor some simplifying assumptions were applied in the present work the cfd study is carried out considering water as the liquid phase continuous phase and the non newtonian nature of the mixed liquor is neglected the effect of fluid property is not significant on the mixing performance of the bioreactor thus sludge rheology was neglected in the simulations and the liquid phase is assumed as a homogenous and incompressible phase 41 43 the gas phase dispersed phase is assumed to be a mixture of h2 and co2 defined as biogas in the simulation of the recycle batch mode operating system it is also assumed that the biogas and inlet gas bubbles were distributed as spherical rigid particles with an average diameter of 1 mm in the mixture and interaction between bubbles e g collisions coalescence or break up of bubbles was ignored isothermal conditions are maintained in the reactor tank a time step of 0 001 s was used to ensure the result may converge at 10 3 as maximum residual between two iterations 2 3 1 fermenter bcs suitable boundary conditions are necessary to solve the governing equations such as mass transfer continuity and momentum in this work the total volume of the fermenter was assumed as the computational domain for the bioreactor simulation at the centerline symmetrical conditions were applied to reduce the calculation time fig 2a the boundary conditions for all reactor walls were set as no slip for the liquid phase and no gas flux for the gas phase the ambient pressure was set for the outlet surface slip wall condition is selected for the upper surfaces and degassing boundary condition is employed on the upper surfaces 2 3 2 membrane unit bcs due to symmetric geometry of the membrane a symmetry boundary condition was used to simplify the calculation and reduce the run times for cfd simulation of the membrane unit the main assumptions for membrane unit are reported below ideal gas steady state flow and isothermal conditions were assumed the hydrogen permeation follows solution diffusion mechanism axial mixing assumed to be negligible for gaseous molecules the pressure drop on the feed and permeate side was neglected the boundaries for the other walls were all stationary and there was a no fluid slip condition at the membrane surface the boundary conditions for retentate and permeate sides are presented in table 3 2 4 experimental design a better understanding of the proposed system requires using several experimental or numerical runs considering an extended set of operational conditions and affective parameters without using a systematic approach like design of experiment method this will become a very hard task to accomplish the mathematical and statistical based rsm technique is a widely used method consisting of a set of mathematical techniques that describe the relation between input and output parameters for modeling and optimizing purposes rsm can generate large amounts of information from a small number of experiments that can aid in making intelligent decisions 44 45 a polynomial model could be generated using rsm for the experiments design useful to predict the responses of interest within the design region this rsm model estimates the combination of the input parameters yielding an optimal response through fast running approximation of the simulation process in this paper simulated results were used as a complete dataset for training the response surface which is used later in the optimization procedure initial ph of the medium the inlet flow rate of the recycled gas and the impeller speed each at three levels will act as independent variables as depicted in table 4 these three factors will be combined under the framework of a central composite design ccd as the most frequently used strategy with 20 runs table 4 a cfd based rsm was established for model fitting of numerical experiments instead of physical data that yield the highest produced hydrogen as response the second order polynomial model was used to analyze the numerical data and to evaluate the relationship between response and model parameters as follows 31 34 y Î² 0 Î² 1 a Î² 2 b Î² 3 c Î² 11 a 2 Î² 22 b 2 Î² 33 c 2 Î² 12 ab Î² 13 ac Î² 23 bc where y is the response hydrogen produced a b and c are independent variables Î²0 is the constant coefficient Î²i s Î²ii s and Î²ij s are interaction coefficients of linear quadratic and the second order terms respectively the amount of hydrogen produced was processed by eq 34 including an analysis of variables anova to obtain the interactions between the process independent variables and dependent variable the response the quality assessment of the model was represented by the coefficient of determination r2 and r2 adj the statistical significance was investigated with the f test p values and adequate precision ratio design expert software v11 1 2 was used to analyze the data and the regression coefficients were computed with the aid of this software 3 results and discussion 3 1 cfd simulations 3 1 1 meshing independency and model validation as a preliminary test the grid independency check was performed to ensure the independence of the simulation results from the mesh grid size the amount of hydrogen produced l in the bioreactor was investigated for four modes of mesh construction namely coarse normal fine and finer consisting of 3075 7475 16 909 and 39 494 elements respectively as shown in fig 3 a the amount of the hydrogen produced in coarse mode differs significantly from normal and fine modes but there is a slight difference between fine and finer modes it is obvious that the simulation results tended to be stable when the grid number was set at 16909 thus the fine mesh mode was selected as the optimal mesh size which makes an equilibrium between accuracy and computational burden in this study understanding whether the results obtained from simulation are consistent with the results of the experimental system is a crucial step for model reliability for validation of the developed cfd model simulation results of substrate consumption profile initial sucrose concentration of 25 g l ph 5 5 temperature of 35 c versus fermentation time was depicted in fig 4 a and b and compared with the experimental dataset reported by mu et al 32 a maximum relative error of 9 was found between the experimental and the numerical data which was considered acceptable hence the results confirm that the generated mesh had an acceptable quality and that the numerical model and boundary conditions for the bioreactor were selected and configured properly in order to consider the developed model as a valid approach for further process simulations 3 1 2 substrate consumption kinetic modeling a coupled transient cfd model by coupling the biochemical reactions and kinetics with fluid dynamics was developed to simulate the substrate and products kinetics in the bioreactor the kinetics of substrate consumption profile and rate were simulated using modified gompertz equation as shown in fig 4a and b an increasing trend is observed for substrate consumption during fermentation time until reaching zero gradient condition the former is indicative of sucrose depletion as a single substrate in the batch mode operating bioreactor as shown in fig 4b the rate of sucrose consumption increased until reaching a maximum peak at a rate of 1 62 g l h after 15 h under fermentation the maximum substrate consumption rate was achieved when about 40 of the initial sucrose was utilized and the rate decrease could be attributed to the substrate limitation for the biomass in the medium the sucrose consumption rate decreased until reaching zero after 45 h under fermentation as a proof of the end of the bioreaction 3 1 3 biohydrogen production kinetic modeling the coupled cfd biokinetics model was also used to study the dynamic behavior of biohydrogen production in the batch bioreactor according to the literature 46 acetate and butyrate are the predominant volatile fatty acids vfas that could be produced in the biohydrogen generation process as a simplified assumption the presence of other solvents and vfas was neglected in this study and only acetate and butyrate pathways were considered as the main hydrogen production pathways therefore the stoichiometric equations eqs 35 37 indicating the biohydrogen production from sucrose were considered as follows 35 c 12 h 22 o 11 h 2 o 2c 6 h 12 o 6 36 c 6 h 12 o 6 2h 2 o 2ch 3 cooh 2co 2 4h 2 37 c 6 h 12 o 6 ch 3 ch 2 ch 2 cooh 2co 2 2h 2 the biohydrogen production amount and rate are shown in fig 4c and d respectively as expected an increasing trend was obtained by the simulations of the hydrogen production profile and 18 8 l of hydrogen is achieved by the end of the reaction based on the simulation results the maximum hydrogen production rate of 1 65 l h was attained within 15 h under fermentation which was comparable to the experimental data however as illustrated in fig 4c and d the hydrogen production amount and rate resulted to be directly and proportionately related to the sucrose consumption rate the higher the sucrose consumption rate the higher the biohydrogen production rate sucrose as the only carbon source in the proposed process is the main precursor for subsequent products and hydrogen production through decarboxylation and proton reduction accordingly high concentration and availability of sucrose in the first half of the reaction improves the hydrogen generation significantly moreover its reduction in the second half of the reaction could be attributed to the decrease of sucrose concentration which is in accordance with higher biomass concentration in the bioreactor as similarly reported in literature 42 47 the cfd kinetics modeling was also applied for simulating the butyrate and acetate formation during the hydrogen production bioprocess among various metabolites produced during this process butyrate is generated simultaneously with the biohydrogen hence a high hydrogen yield may be commonly related to the butyrate production the butyrate to acetate ratio is often introduced as an indicator of the extent of biohydrogen generation according to the literature 48 49 efficient hydrogen production occurred for butyrate acetate ratio between 2 6 and 4 based on the simulation results at initial sucrose concentration of 25 g l the butyrate acetate ratio was equal to 2 83 which indicated that the hydrogen producing metabolism was dominant in this process 3 1 4 effect of impeller speed since the experimental evaluation of the effect of the impeller speed on mixing process can be a hard and expensive task cfd modeling was used in this study to analyze the mixing effect on the biological activity in the biohydrogen production process the appropriate design and operation of the mixer promotes better mixing regime and sufficient flow velocity making substrate more available and resulting in efficient mass transfer in the reactor with least possible dead zones thus for a comprehensive evaluation the effect of mixing conditions in improving the efficiency of the process should be considered simultaneously in terms of mass transfer shear stress velocity vectors and the composition of microbial consortia table 5 shows the amount of hydrogen production at different impeller speeds including 100 120 200 and 250 rpm which ranges from 18 22 l for 100 rpm to 18 32 l for 250 rpm an insignificant increase of less than 0 5 was then observed in the biohydrogen generation as a function of an increase of mixer speed probably because of the sufficient flow homogeneity achieved at the reaction zone due to the formation of turbulent eddies even at low rotation speeds it may be concluded that a rapid rotation kinetics should not be considered as a direct consequence of a higher biohydrogen production potential moreover higher shear stress could be attained at higher impeller speeds potentially damaging microbial cells due to induced hydromechanical stress thus regarding the negligible improvement of biohydrogen efficiency at high impeller speeds 100 rpm was considered as the optimal operating parameter which could also save input energy and consequently increase net energy yield from the bioreactor this results are in agreement with that found by ding et al 33 in which the impeller speed range of 90 110 rpm was found to be more suitable for hydrogen production the influence of speed also affects the flow pattern and velocity distribution the velocity distribution and biohydrogen concentration distribution for impeller speeds of 100 and 250 rpm are shown in fig 5 a slight difference is illustrated between two impeller speeds and the results are in accordance with the above mentioned discussions the generated velocity vectors display the pumping action of the impeller and favorable liquid circulation the velocity distribution allows that the dissolved biohydrogen may move toward the headspace of the reactor resulting in the biohydrogen release in the bioreactor and in the decrease of biogas partial pressure as well mixing characteristic effects on hydrogen production rate was also studied by srirugsa et al 50 using cfd technique and according to the results larger dead zones were appeared for low mixing speeds 10 50 rpm in comparison to high speeds 100 150 rpm thus ineffective biohydrogen production was attained due to poor mixing of substrates in the bioreactor similar results were also found in the literature 33 51 53 3 1 5 effect of temperature and membrane thickness in gas separation membrane unit according to the kinetic evaluation conducted in this study the biogas produced during the sucrose consumption reaction included hydrogen and carbon dioxide which need to be separated to recover high grade hydrogen and capture the carbon dioxide thus a msm is proposed to be coupled to the bioreactor for biohydrogen purification purpose a tubular self supported pdag membrane was considered in the housing inside the msm its performance was simulated and validated in this study according to the experimental results of santucci et al 38 the hydrogen present in the biogas stream outlet stream of the bioreactor passes through the membrane as a desirable product and carbon dioxide rich current enters to the bioreactor as a recycle flow for enhancement of mixing fig 6 shows the hydrogen permeating flux against the hydrogen partial pressure square root difference between retentate and permeate sides in the temperature range from 473 to 623 k considering three membrane thicknesses 84 150 and 200 Î¼m for the experimental and simulated systems by increasing the temperature from 473 to 623 k at a constant thickness of 84 Î¼m the hydrogen permeating flux increased by 15 similarly to the 150 and 200 Î¼m membrane thicknesses nevertheless the mass transport resistance offered by higher membrane thickness at a constant temperature is responsible for lower hydrogen permeating fluxes as shown in fig 6a increasing the thickness from 84 to 200 Î¼m at 473 k involved a reduction of the flux by 58 the same trend is also reported by jin et al 54 and a significant increase is seen in hydrogen permeation flux by decreasing the membrane layer thickness from 230 to 20 nm according to the arrhenius equation higher temperature induces higher hydrogen permeating flux due to an emphasized hydrogen permeability in the meantime a higher feed pressure induces an increased hydrogen permeation driving force in terms of a higher transmembrane pressure on the contrary the higher the membrane thickness the lower the hydrogen permeating flux as a consequence of a lower hydrogen permeability through the membrane higher bulk diffusion resistance to the mass transport the cfd simulations of this study resulted in good according to the simulation results the biogas produced in the bioreactor at 308 k ph 5 5 and mixing speed of 120 rpm was obtained as 18 26 and 27 73 l of hydrogen and carbon dioxide respectively assuming the biogas produced in the bioreactor as reported above may enter the msm housing the 84 Î¼m thick pdag membrane at 473 k the simulation showed to reach a hydrogen recovery of around 31 the hydrogen recovery for the other membrane thicknesses as a function of operating temperature were reported in table 6 as expected raising of the temperature an improvement in hydrogen recovery was achieved the effect of temperature on hydrogen permeation flux is also studied by ben mansour et al 40 and it was reported that increasing the feeding temperature from 300 c to 500 c would improve the hydrogen permeation flux by 35 regardless of the feeding pressure value this result is in accordance with the results found in our study 3 1 6 volumetric mass transfer coefficient the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla is an important hydrodynamic characteristic for evaluating the performance of the bioreactor the described msm was assumed to be attached to the stirred bioreactor to begin the simulations in the novel mgsbr configuration the bioreactor was operated in batch recycling mode by purging the liquid phase with the co2 enriched flow of the retentate stream coming out from the msm the recycled flow introduced into the bioreactor was considered as spherical bubbles with constant average diameter the simulated values of kla in the different impeller speeds 100 120 200 and 250 rpm and recycle gas flow rates 0 0001 0 0002 0 0003 and 0 0004 m3 s were presented in fig 7 kla value enhancement is achieved by increasing the recycle gas flow rate as well as impeller speed the increase of gas flow rate leads in elevation of bubble generation and gas holdup in the bioreactor consequently increasing kla value due to increase of the interfacial area between the liquid phase and the gas bubbles moreover the increase of impeller speed in the bioreactor could result in an increase of fluid velocity and agitation as well as turbulent dissipation rate in the system and boosts the mass transfer coefficient consequently the results are consistent with the results reported in literature 55 availability of the substrate in the bioreactor and hence biohydrogen production is dependent on preparing a better mixing regime by using proper impeller speed therefore the effect of impeller speed on biohydrogen generation with without recycle flow was studied and the results are shown in table 7 a slight increase is observed in the biohydrogen production without recycle flow which can be explained by improved mass transfer providing the desired liquid circulation this phenomenon enhances the biohydrogen production by facilitating gas liquid mass transfer of the biohydrogen dissolved in the liquid phase toward the headspace and reducing the biohydrogen partial pressure inside the tank poor mixing of reactor medium could also lead to generation of dead zones and hence ineffective biogas production although these parameters could effectively improve the reactor efficiency a negligible enhancement was obtained in the biohydrogen generation by increasing the impeller speed from 100 to 250 rpm the insignificant effect of recycle flow which could have a synergistic mixing effect on the homogeneity of the bioreactor was also observed in the simulations this could be attributed to the efficient homogeneity of the bioreactor and absence of dead zones even in low impeller speeds these interpretations are in accordance with the results shown in fig 5b which demonstrate the proper homogeneity of the system regarding the fact that the reduced speeds favor an energy saving and increase the net energy yield of the process the impeller speed of 120 rpm could be used as the optimal operating parameter in this study which is in the range of those reported in the literature 33 the simulations showed a slight decrease in the hydrogen production in recycle mode condition with high impeller speeds this phenomenon could be due to the fact that intense agitation and turbulent flow conditions re 103 clearly impair the hydrogen production process by slowing down the metabolic activity of the butyric acid pathway 33 52 56 57 3 1 7 determination of kinetic parameters further study on proper hydrogen generation at different operating conditions requires accurate kinetic data at the studied conditions for this reason the kinetic data reported by wong et al 46 for biohydrogen production from glucose was used as they worked at 310 15 k thus the hmax value should be extracted for 308 15 k value of temperature used in this simulation study therefore a polynomial regression was applied to the experimental data reported by wong et al 46 for hmax at different fermentation temperatures and the following polynomial equation eq 37 was achieved the regression results are also presented in fig 8 37 h max 0 0062 t 3 0 5794 t 2 16 67 t 159 3 it is worth of noting that glucose was used as the main substrate in the research conducted by wong et al 46 instead of sucrose thus the stoichiometric conversions should be applied to attain the exact results for sucrose considering eq 34 according to the results achieved in fig 8 and eq 37 the hmax of 5 53 mol h2 mol glucose was obtained at 308 15 k which equals to 11 06 mol h2 mol sucrose regarding eq 34 the value of hmax achieved from our simulation study was 10 035 mol h2 mol sucrose error of 9 which shows the reliability of proposed cfd simulations the maximum hydrogen yield achieved in this study is significantly higher than the maximum value reported by gavala et al 58 and bankoyi et al 20 which were 1 7 mol h2 mol glucose and 1 91 mol h2 mol glucose respectively by verifying the applicability of the kinetic data reported in the literature the data presented in table 8 were used for further simulating the system at different ph conditions and 310 15 k changing the ph in a fermentation process can modify the metabolic mechanism of microorganisms that produces hydrogen altering the reactive pathway of the intermediate production and ultimately reducing the biohydrogen production fig 9 as shown in this figure the maximum amount of biohydrogen 23 7 l was achieved at ph 6 which was in accordance with the maximum biohydrogen production rate of 1 334 l h by increasing the ph to 8 a decline of 17 9 was observed in the hydrogen production reaching 19 4 l the hydrogen production was zero at ph 4 which was indicative of intensive cell growth inhibition under highly acidic condition at ph 5 a lag phase of about 12 h was shown which was dedicated to the adaptation of activated sludge to the acidic medium reaching a hydrogen production of 18 4 l after 45 h the results showed that the hydrogen generation was strongly influenced by the ph confirming that the optimum ph for biohydrogen production is slightly related to acidic condition these results are in agreement and supported by observational studies reported in the related literature ph 6 6 5 56 59 likewise in the research conducted by gavala et al 58 ph 6 was found as the optimum ph in which maximum hydrogen yields was obtained 3 2 statistical analysis a large experimental procedure considers significant costs and when a model is able to effectively simulate the target responses important savings can be achieved simultaneously logistical difficulties related to experimental work are also avoided despite the prediction of biohydrogen production the cfd model is unable to select the best operating conditions in a straightforward way this could be achieved combining the cfd model with a response surface method which avoids expensive and time consuming experiments rsm can generate large amounts of information from a small number of experiments and it is able to assess the interaction effects between the variables on the responses along with determining the optimal operating conditions however in multivariable processes including various potentially effective parameters the process analysis with an initial screening design before optimization seems to be necessary a three level ccd scheme was used to demonstrate the relative importance of the selected effective factors for the optimization of biohydrogen generation using cfd experiments the complete design matrix together with the predicted response values are given in table 4 numerical experiments as cfd based simulations were performed according to the shown experimental plan the quadratic regression equation for biohydrogen production in terms of coded values of the factors is given by eq 38 38 y 23 77 1 86 a 0 0282 b 0 0114 c 0 0177 a 2 0 0440 b 2 0 0327 c 2 3 00 ab 0 0016 ac 0 0224 bc the final empirical model presents a good visualization of the effects of each effective parameter and their interactions on the response the positive sign in front of the model terms indicates synergistic effect while the negative sign indicates antagonistic effect of the factor on the response the anova was performed statistically to evaluate the quality of the developed model as shown in table 9 based on a 95 confidence level the second order quadratic model was confirmed to be well significant regarding the resulted f value 53 370 22 and the p value 0 05 this result gave an indication that the model was adequate for hydrogen production within the range of variables studied based on the anova results the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9998 indicating that the model provides a perfect correlation between the independent variables and the response the value of r2 adj 0 9996 exhibited that only less than 1 of the variation could not be explained by the model adequate precision of 546 55 indicates adequate signal for the model to be used to navigate the design space and a ratio greater than 4 is desirable the three dimensional response surfaces were plotted based on the fitted second order polynomial equation as presented in fig 10 which illustrates the effects of ph inlet gas flow rate and impeller speed on biohydrogen generation according to contour plots the ph factor has the highest effect on hydrogen production and the maximum hydrogen is produced in the ph range from 6 to 6 5 the effect of ph factor is in accordance with the coefficient obtained in eq 38 as well as the f test value of the anova table hydrogen production is influenced slightly by increasing inlet gas flow rate and impeller speed which is also in compliance with the results reported in sections 3 1 4 and 3 1 5 3 2 1 optimization of the process optimization is an indispensable step for comprehensive designing modeling and applying for a large scale process optimization is a mathematical technique of selecting optimal values from the available input dataset by systematically choosing the independent variables within the predefined boundary and predicting the best value of the response numerical response optimization helps to find the factor setting that fulfill the desired requirements simultaneously in order to achieve the maximum biohydrogen production in the proposed mgsbr using cfd based numerical experiments the optimum level of the variables were found from the developed mathematical ccd model both weight and importance were set at 1 and the criterion was set in range for the studied variables to maximize the response biohydrogen production the optimum conditions suggested by the cfd based rsm model was ph 6 3 impeller speed of 115 and inlet gas flow rate of 2 4 10 5 with maximum hydrogen production of 24 1 l the optimal parameters were also confirmed by the analysis of 3d response surface plots for the model among various optimal conditions suggested by the model these conditions were selected since lower impeller speed and inlet gas flow rate could avoid inhibition of biohydrogen production while it is high enough to maintain the flow homogeneity and ensure solid suspension 34 furthermore the predicted values are economically more energy efficient and less stressful to the microbial system present in the bioreactor according to the literature h2 production could be completely inhibited at acidic condition and favorable ph for h2 production usually occurs at the slightly acidic condition ph 6 moreover growth and activity of methanogens and acetobacteria would significantly be surpassed in ph values about 6 however the predicted optimal results in this study were completely in agreement with these explanations 22 46 the obtained results completely follows the aim of the research in presenting a numerical methodology within the framework of the cfd technique combined with design of experiments to obtain stable and high quality hydrogen production from a biochemical reaction 4 conclusion in this work a comprehensive study was performed on cfd simulation of a new configuration of mbr named as membrane based gas separation bioreactor developed by integrating a hydrogen producing fermenter and a pdag based msm for hydrogen purification the two phase turbulent flow field of the bioreactor was proposed to be used for biohydrogen generation in batch and batch recycle modes using sucrose as a substrate and modeled with an eulerian eulerian two fluid model approach the implemented cfd simulation offered an advantage in showing the dynamic behavior of the system by incorporating sub models of biokinetics hydrodynamic parameters and mass transfer profiles for biohydrogen production and purification in the mgsbr the simulation results were found to be in good agreement with those obtained through experimentation and reported in the literature since various hydrodynamic and operational parameters play key roles in biohydrogen production a first attempt was made in this article by combining statistical methods with the cfd model for designing and optimizing the novel mgsbr system as one of the broadly used rsm schemes the three level ccd was utilized to design the numerical experiments and evaluate the interaction effects of ph impeller speed and inlet gas flow rate of hydrogen production as the response the ph of the substrate medium was found to be more affecting the biohydrogen production and its maximum value of 24 1 l was predicted to be obtained at optimum conditions this work suggested an approach for the predictive simulation of a complex biological process and separation unit through numerical and statistical modeling based on cfd and rsm the consequence of the proposed investigation technique was a comprehensive and accurate estimation of different affective operational and designing parameters providing a practical tool for the optimization and bioreactor scale up this theoretical study demonstrated that the proposed mgsbr may be potentially useful in the simultaneous biological wastewater treatment and hydrogen production and purification overall it is believed that the cfd coupled with rsm has proven to be a time saving and cost effective approach for the assessment of the performance of the bioreactor moreover the modeled mgsbr possessed good potential for real case of simultaneous biohydrogen production and purification further studies are warranted to shed more light on the interplay of various operational and membrane conditions for maximizing biohydrogen separation due to complexity of the proposed system effect of other affective parameters such as pressure feed concentration operation time membrane surface area etc could also be evaluated according to the developed cfd rsm combined method a task which remains for future studies moreover concentration polarization fouling along with process cost evaluations and economic analysis may be a priority subject for future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13392,a membrane gas separation based bioreactor mgsbr as a novel configuration of membrane bioreactors mbrs for biohydrogen production is proposed and simulated in this study a coupled transient computational fluid dynamic cfd biokinetics modified gompertz equation model was developed to simulate the batch stirred fermenter integrated to the pdag membrane unit the turbulent gas liquid fluid dynamics substrate consumption cumulative h2 production and volumetric mass transfer coefficient were predicted by the numerical simulations a slight increase is seen in biohydrogen production by sparging the mgsbr with co2 concentrated recycle flow indicating no significant mass transfer limitations in the system finally the established cfd model was coupled with response surface methodology rsm to find the best operating conditions for ph inlet gas flow rate and impeller speed to maximize the biohydrogen production the cfd based rsm results gave the optimum conditions as ph 6 2 impeller speed of 115 and inlet gas flow rate of 2 4 10 5 that leads to maximum hydrogen production of 24 09 l this work confirms the potential interest of the proposed mgsbr for biohydrogen production and the

economy and urbanization requires more energy for the improving industries and activities energy consumption is projected to increase by 35 from 2014 to 2035 1 currently the use of fossil fuels is causing global climate change which is mainly due to the release of pollutants such as nitrogen and sulfur oxides cox soot ash bitumen droplets and other organic pollutants a set of environmental issues caused by severe and persistent dependence on fossil fuels include air pollution acid rain and global warming greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 80 from 1970 to 2004 and are also projected to increase by 52 between 2005 and 2050 2 due to the primary energy crisis the necessity of focusing on renewable energy options has played a significant role in recent studies 1 in various researches a number of renewable energy sources such as solar energy wind power hydroelectric power biomass and biofuels have been studied biogas production from biomass has several advantages including the simultaneous advantages of energy production and organic waste management easy storage and transportation the availability of natural gas infrastructure and minimal negative impact on the environment during the production process among various biofuels biohydrogen has been mentioned as emerging potential technology for transition in the long term for cleaner energy and to develop sustainable transport systems 3 5 a variety of technologies namely thermal electrolytic and biochemical processes can be used to produce the h2 molecule the main thermochemical technologies used extensively nowadays are steam reforming sr partial oxidation pox and autothermal reforming atr 6 since these processes require high energy and have greenhouse effect thus hydrogen production from renewable sources like biomass and municipal or industrial wastes draws great attention the two major pathways for the bioresource conversion to hydrogen are the biochemical conversion i e anaerobic digestion or dark fermentation thermochemical conversion i e combustion or gasification or using microbial electrolysis cells mecs 7 the wastewaters are a rich source of organic nutrients which supports the growth of hydrogen producers along with the disposal of waste and energy recovery among various processes used for wastewater treatment such as physico chemical biological processes advanced oxidation processes photocatalytic reactions adsorption filtration and membrane processes biological processes has been known as one of the best cost effective and high performing solutions for secondary treatment 8 14 type of hydrogen application plays a key role for choosing the fuel and processing system for hydrogen production among the various hydrogen production processes less energy is used through the biological method since it can be accomplished at moderate operational conditions 15 thus biohydrogen production through fermentation is more feasible economic and simple and received more attention in recent years 16 biomass derived hydrogen production is affected by various factors such as reactor type biomass type inoculum and operational conditions as reported in the literature various reactor types stirred tank bubble column airlift and membrane reactors are used for biohydrogen production 7 17 18 membrane bioreactors mbrs with different scales types and structures have recently emerged as an effective systems for wastewater treatment as well as hydrogen production integrating conventional anaerobic fermenters with membrane technology leads to the anaerobic mbrs anmbrs which is considered as an innovative technology in biohydrogen production more details and information can be found in a recent review on anmbrs 19 21 beside the classical mbr classifications introduced in the literature anmbr can be developed by coupling gas separation membranes instead of a water purifier filter to a hydrogen production fermenter i e stirred tank reactor it plays an essential role in the purification of hydrogen coming from the bioreactor these systems are generally introduced as membrane gas separation based bioreactor mgsbr in the hydrogen separation membrane module the feed mixture coming from the fermentation bioreactor is separated into two flows a a hydrogen enriched flow permeate in which the purity depends on the membrane perm selectivity and b a non permeated retentate stream consisting of no energetic value products such as co2 and n2 due to complexity of the system various parameters such as impeller rotational speed membrane characteristics and permeability mass transfer coefficient are affecting the mgsbr performance moreover all the parameters affecting the process and enabling the success of this process are not easy to be set accordingly application of computational models for enabling the prediction and subsequent testing of a large number of parameters that influence the system performance seems crucial 22 computational fluid dynamics cfd is a powerful design tool which could be used for simultaneous modeling of the microbial growth kinetics hydrodynamics aeration and membrane separation modules msms coupled to bioreactors 23 it could simulate the fluid flow regarding the effects of sludge rheology and give a comprehensive quantitative explanation of its hydrodynamics predicting the performance of the reactor precisely by using semi empirical formula which otherwise could result hard to be achieved by conventional experiments cfd modeling of msms may facilitate the optimization of all the design variables such as reactor geometry nutrient removal and energy consumption affecting both organism growth and filtration aspects 17 generally application of cfd to msm systems is particularly difficult and requires special computational efforts various researches have been reported in the literature to evaluate the cfd simulation for different applications and hydrodynamic analysis 24 26 since the performance and efficiency of a hydrogen production bioreactor is affected by many design and operational characteristics and hydrodynamic parameters it is necessary to recognize the optimal conditions of factors as well as their mutual interactions achieving this purpose by applying conventional optimizing methods like univariate method is time consuming and of high cost response surface methodology rsm has been found to be an accurate useful and cost effective tool for predicting the relationship between the limited number of input and output parameters rsm is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques which can be applied for developing improving and optimizing the process variables and minimizes the number of combination of variables while the precision of the predicted response remains properly although there is already a considerable amount of researches utilizing cfd and rsm separately few studies from different scientific areas have been reported as application of both techniques together 27 combining optimization methodologies such as design of experiments doe with numerical models avoids expensive and time consuming experiments while allowing for obtaining optimal conditions using different input combinations however it should be notified that although several simulators are commercialized for biogas production through anaerobic digestion but none of them are available for biohydrogen since biohydrogen production processes are less mature than anaerobic fermentation and there is a major lack of robust models for fermentation processes a comprehensive comparative study is conducted by chezeau and vial 28 on various modeling strategies that can be used for prediction of biohydrogen production yield and productivity various modeling methods such as the empirical semi empirical equations statistical approaches distributed models nonideal and compartmental models structured unstructured kinetic models artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithms gas from the simplest to the most advanced are addresses as well as cfd coupled with a population balance approach pba method it is worth noting that the performance of any biohydrogen process depends on the optimization of various factors along with biohydrogen production maximizing and preventing malfunction of the bioreactor this goal is achievable through applying cfd rsm combined method which is a good compromise for the future application of distributed models to bioreactors because they take effect of different operational parameters hydrodynamics and industrial constraints into account and can maintain reasonable computation costs at the same time silva and rouboa 29 coupled the results obtained from a 2d multiphase eulerian eulerian biomass gasification model developed by cfd technique with rsm to find the best operating conditions to produce syngas for different applications the most appropriate operation conditions which guaranteed both the best response and minimal variations caused by effective factors was found using cfd rsm combined method in another work enhanced removal of nitrate and phosphate from wastewater by c vulgaris was investigated using rsm and cfd techniques and the effect of baffle on mixing performance thus on bioremoval efficiency was studied 30 in the study conducted by banik et al 31 rsm was coupled with cfd to investigate the optimum operating parameters and hydrodynamic behavior of rectangular sheet membrane in order to enhance permeate flux cfd simulation was implemented to visualize the feed and permeate sides concentration profile of membrane subjected to rsm predicted optimum condition yang et al 27 studied the controlling of reversible membrane fouling due to cake layer formation and foulants deposition by optimizing mbr hydrodynamics through the combination of cfd and doe sludge concentration was considered as the most influencing parameter on the responses and was optimized for the reduction of reversible fouling in the submerged mbr consequently the results of all the mentioned works proved the capability of combining rsm with cfd to decrease experimental procedures while enabling process optimization to the best of our knowledge there is no current research addressing the modeling and simulation of the mgsbr used for biohydrogen production using cfd rsm technique our approach aims to develop a 2d cfd model of a general wastewater treatment and biohydrogen production system coupled to a hydrogen membrane separation unit to achieve standardization and generalization of this novel bioreactor for further full scale applications this approach requires five main steps which are further developed 1 cfd simulation of the biohydrogen production along with sucrose biodegradation in a stirred fermenter operating in batch modality 2 cfd simulation of the hydrogen separation membrane unit 3 developing a mgsbr by integration of the stirred fermenter with the membrane unit operating in batch recycle mode 4 applying cfd based rsm technique for evaluating the main and interaction effects of the studied parameters in the mgsbr 5 performing an optimization with the goal of maximizing biohydrogen production in the proposed mgsbr 2 cfd modeling due to the integration of physical and biological processes and the coupling of fluid dynamics kinetics and mass transfer phenomena in the mgsbr cfd was used for simulation of the studied system thus a 2d transient simulation using eulerian eulerian two fluid model was conducted using comsol multiphysics 5 4 software to study the multiphase flow dynamics and bioreaction in the stirred bioreactor 2 1 reactor geometry and meshing in the present study the bioreactor setup based on the experimental conditions used by mu et al 32 was simulated the general approach was to conduct a baseline cfd analysis for a batch stirred tank reactor with a total capacity of 5 l the bioreactor was simulated to operate in batch and batch recycle flow mode for biohydrogen generation a general schematic of the bioreactor can be observed in fig 1 a where the mixer impeller is also shown sucrose was used as the single substrate with amount of 35 0 g l for biohydrogen production via anaerobic activated sludge process a six bladed impeller with the rushton turbine design and external diameter of 8 7 cm fig 1b was used for maintaining homogeneity in the bioreactor the geometric characteristics of the bioreactor setup is summarized in table 1 the temperature was maintained at the level of 35 0 c and naoh was used to keep a ph level of 5 5 in the reactor as reported in the literature 32 the aeration of the bioreactor introduced as a recycle flow was supplied by a sparger located at the bottom of the reactor discretization of the computational domain was performed using unstructured free triangular meshes known for their supremacy in mesh quality and calculation convergence control local meshes near the wall and impeller blades were refined and mesh size increased to improve the numerical accuracy and stability fig 1c a mesh with higher element numbers result in more accurate simulation results and accordingly higher computational cost and time thus a mesh independency check was conducted to determine the optimized grid number and the results can be found in section 3 1 1 2 1 1 governing equations the cfd model combines the liquid and gas hydrodynamics and formulates and solves the fundamental mass and momentum balance equations the discrete governing equations describing the momentum and mass transfer phenomena were solved repeatedly for the control volume until convergence was obtained the perturbation equations were also solved continuously along with the continuity the navier stokes and the energy equations the equation of momentum transport for liquid phase is as follows 33 1 Ï l Ï l u l t Ï l Ï l u l u l p Ï l

simulation of a complex mgsbr mainly depends on application of proper turbulence models by cfd which could precisely characterize the present flow fields the precise modeling of turbulent condition in reactors are complex since there is a continuous random change in velocity and other flow properties which are made by eddies with a wide range of length and time scales among a large family of turbulence closures the standard k É turbulence model is frequently used for modeling of medium to large scale applications it is a tradeoff between computational accuracy and efficiency and is based on the eddy viscosity concept hence the standard k É model is applied in this work to simulate turbulence by the turbulent bubbly flow module this model adds turbulent viscosity to the equation of

coefficient volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla is recognized as an important parameter for determining the efficiency and possibility of increasing the reactor scale especially for bioreactors 32 in a bioreactor the level of mass available for mass transfer is not easily measured however the kla expression which is the product of the mass transfer coefficient and the surface area could be easily measured which is representative of the bioreactor productivity 36 kla values are affected by various factors such as stirring speed air flow rate temperature environmental properties composition viscosity etc and reactor geometry for example with increasing stirrer speed or air flow rate kla tends to increase as the area between the gas and liquid interface increases however higher speeds of mixing can cause shear forces between cells in the medium and can lead to cell damage in this study our goal is to measure kla for hydrogen which is calculated by eq 15 proposed by

experimental data in the referred research were also used for the validation of the developed cfd model a 2d axisymmetric model based on cfd method is created and meshed fig 2b to investigate the biohydrogen separation from the biogas outlet flow of the bioreactor the integration the fermenter and the pdag separation unit the mgsbr is illustrated in fig 2c for the model validation it is assumed that only hydrogen may permeate through the pdag membrane and the hydrogen permeating flux is calculated and compared with the experimental data reported in the literature 38 39 in the mgsbr simulations a gas mixture containing co2 and h2 is assumed to constitute the feed entering the msm a sweep gas is also introduced into the msm pure hydrogen is collected into the permeate stream shell

behavior present in the bioreactor some simplifying assumptions were applied in the present work the cfd study is carried out considering water as the liquid phase continuous phase and the non newtonian nature of the mixed liquor is neglected the effect of fluid property is not significant on the mixing performance of the bioreactor thus sludge rheology was neglected in the simulations and the liquid phase is assumed as a homogenous and incompressible phase 41 43 the gas phase dispersed phase is assumed to be a mixture of h2 and co2 defined as biogas in the simulation of the recycle batch mode operating system it is also assumed that the biogas and inlet gas bubbles were distributed as spherical rigid particles with an average diameter of 1 mm in the mixture and interaction between bubbles e g collisions coalescence or break up of bubbles was ignored isothermal conditions are maintained in the reactor tank a time step of 0 001 s was used to ensure the result may converge at 10 3 as maximum residual between two iterations 2 3 1 fermenter bcs suitable boundary conditions are necessary to solve the governing equations such as mass transfer continuity and momentum in this work the total volume of the fermenter was assumed as the computational domain for the bioreactor simulation at the centerline symmetrical conditions were applied to reduce the calculation time fig 2a the boundary conditions for all reactor walls were set as no slip for the liquid phase and no gas flux for the gas phase the ambient pressure was set for the outlet surface slip wall condition is selected for the upper surfaces and degassing boundary condition is employed on the upper surfaces 2 3 2 membrane unit bcs due to symmetric geometry of the membrane a symmetry boundary condition was used to simplify the calculation and reduce the run times for cfd simulation of the membrane unit the main assumptions for membrane unit are reported below ideal gas steady state flow and isothermal conditions were assumed the hydrogen permeation follows solution diffusion mechanism axial mixing assumed to be negligible for gaseous molecules the pressure drop on the feed and permeate side was neglected the boundaries for the other walls were all stationary and there was a no fluid slip condition at the membrane surface the boundary conditions for retentate and permeate sides are presented in table 3 2 4 experimental design a better understanding of the proposed system requires using several experimental or numerical runs considering an extended set of operational conditions and affective parameters without using a systematic approach like design of experiment method this will become a very hard task to accomplish the mathematical and statistical based rsm technique is a widely used method consisting of a set of mathematical techniques that describe the relation between input and output parameters for modeling and optimizing purposes rsm can generate large amounts of information from a small number of experiments that can aid in making intelligent decisions 44 45 a polynomial model could be generated using rsm for the experiments design useful to predict the responses of interest within the design region this rsm model estimates the combination of the input parameters yielding an optimal response through fast running approximation of the simulation process in this paper simulated results were used as a complete dataset for training the response surface which is used later in the optimization procedure initial ph of the medium the inlet flow rate of the recycled gas and the impeller speed each at three levels will act as independent variables as depicted in table 4 these three factors will be combined under the framework of a central composite design ccd as the most frequently used strategy with 20 runs table 4 a cfd based rsm was established for model fitting of numerical experiments instead of physical data that yield the highest produced hydrogen as response the second order polynomial model was used to analyze the numerical data and to evaluate the relationship between response and model parameters as follows 31 34 y Î² 0 Î² 1 a Î² 2 b Î² 3 c Î² 11 a 2 Î² 22 b 2 Î² 33 c 2 Î² 12 ab Î² 13 ac Î² 23 bc where y is the response hydrogen produced a b and c are independent variables Î²0 is the constant coefficient Î²i s Î²ii s and Î²ij s are interaction coefficients of linear quadratic and the second order terms respectively the amount of hydrogen produced was processed by eq 34 including an analysis of variables anova to obtain the interactions between the process independent variables and dependent variable the response the quality assessment of the model was represented by the coefficient of determination r2 and r2 adj the statistical significance was investigated with the f test p values and adequate precision ratio design expert software v11 1 2 was used to analyze the data and the regression coefficients were computed with the aid of this software 3 results and discussion 3 1 cfd simulations 3 1 1 meshing independency and model validation as a preliminary test the grid independency check was performed to ensure the independence of the simulation results from the mesh grid size the amount of hydrogen produced l in the bioreactor was investigated for four modes of mesh construction namely coarse normal fine and finer consisting of 3075 7475 16 909 and 39 494 elements respectively as shown in fig 3 a the amount of the hydrogen produced in coarse mode differs significantly from normal and fine modes but there is a slight difference between fine and finer modes it is obvious that the simulation results tended to be stable when the grid number was set at 16909 thus the fine mesh mode was selected as the optimal mesh size which makes an equilibrium between accuracy and computational burden in this study understanding whether the results obtained from simulation are consistent with the results of the experimental system is a crucial step for model reliability for validation of the developed cfd model simulation results of substrate consumption profile initial sucrose concentration of 25 g l ph 5 5 temperature of 35 c versus fermentation time was depicted in fig 4 a and b and compared with the experimental dataset reported by mu et al 32 a maximum relative error of 9 was found between the experimental and the numerical data which was considered acceptable hence the results confirm that the generated mesh had an acceptable quality and that the numerical model and boundary conditions for the bioreactor were selected and configured properly in order to consider the developed model as a valid approach for further process simulations 3 1 2 substrate consumption kinetic modeling a coupled transient cfd model by coupling the biochemical reactions and kinetics with fluid dynamics was developed to simulate the substrate and products kinetics in the bioreactor the kinetics of substrate consumption profile and rate were simulated using modified gompertz equation as shown in fig 4a and b an increasing trend is observed for substrate consumption during fermentation time until reaching zero gradient condition the former is indicative of sucrose depletion as a single substrate in the batch mode operating bioreactor as shown in fig 4b the rate of sucrose consumption increased until reaching a maximum peak at a rate of 1 62 g l h after 15 h under fermentation the maximum substrate consumption rate was achieved when about 40 of the initial sucrose was utilized and the rate decrease could be attributed to the substrate limitation for the biomass in the medium the sucrose consumption rate decreased until reaching zero after 45 h under fermentation as a proof of the end of the bioreaction 3 1 3 biohydrogen production kinetic modeling the coupled cfd biokinetics model was also used to study the dynamic behavior of biohydrogen production in the batch bioreactor according to the literature 46 acetate and butyrate are the predominant volatile fatty acids vfas that could be produced in the biohydrogen generation process as a simplified assumption the presence of other solvents and vfas was neglected in this study and only acetate and butyrate pathways were considered as the main hydrogen production pathways therefore the stoichiometric equations eqs 35 37 indicating the biohydrogen production from sucrose were considered as follows 35 c 12 h 22 o 11 h 2 o 2c 6 h 12 o 6 36 c 6 h 12 o 6 2h 2 o 2ch 3 cooh 2co 2 4h 2 37 c 6 h 12 o 6 ch 3 ch 2 ch 2 cooh 2co 2 2h 2 the biohydrogen production amount and rate are shown in fig 4c and d respectively as expected an increasing trend was obtained by the simulations of the hydrogen production profile and 18 8 l of hydrogen is achieved by the end of the reaction based on the simulation results the maximum hydrogen production rate of 1 65 l h was attained within 15 h under fermentation which was comparable to the experimental data however as illustrated in fig 4c and d the hydrogen production amount and rate resulted to be directly and proportionately related to the sucrose consumption rate the higher the sucrose consumption rate the higher the biohydrogen production rate sucrose as the only carbon source in the proposed process is the main precursor for subsequent products and hydrogen production through decarboxylation and proton reduction accordingly high concentration and availability of sucrose in the first half of the reaction improves the hydrogen generation significantly moreover its reduction in the second half of the reaction could be attributed to the decrease of sucrose concentration which is in accordance with higher biomass concentration in the bioreactor as similarly reported in literature 42 47 the cfd kinetics modeling was also applied for simulating the butyrate and acetate formation during the hydrogen production bioprocess among various metabolites produced during this process butyrate is generated simultaneously with the biohydrogen hence a high hydrogen yield may be commonly related to the butyrate production the butyrate to acetate ratio is often introduced as an indicator of the extent of biohydrogen generation according to the literature 48 49 efficient hydrogen production occurred for butyrate acetate ratio between 2 6 and 4 based on the simulation results at initial sucrose concentration of 25 g l the butyrate acetate ratio was equal to 2 83 which indicated that the hydrogen producing metabolism was dominant in this process 3 1 4 effect of impeller speed since the experimental evaluation of the effect of the impeller speed on mixing process can be a hard and expensive task cfd modeling was used in this study to analyze the mixing effect on the biological activity in the biohydrogen production process the appropriate design and operation of the mixer promotes better mixing regime and sufficient flow velocity making substrate more available and resulting in efficient mass transfer in the reactor with least possible dead zones thus for a comprehensive evaluation the effect of mixing conditions in improving the efficiency of the process should be considered simultaneously in terms of mass transfer shear stress velocity vectors and the composition of microbial consortia table 5 shows the amount of hydrogen production at different impeller speeds including 100 120 200 and 250 rpm which ranges from 18 22 l for 100 rpm to 18 32 l for 250 rpm an insignificant increase of less than 0 5 was then observed in the biohydrogen generation as a function of an increase of mixer speed probably because of the sufficient flow homogeneity achieved at the reaction zone due to the formation of turbulent eddies even at low rotation speeds it may be concluded that a rapid rotation kinetics should not be considered as a direct consequence of a higher biohydrogen production potential moreover higher shear stress could be attained at higher impeller speeds potentially damaging microbial cells due to induced hydromechanical stress thus regarding the negligible improvement of biohydrogen efficiency at high impeller speeds 100 rpm was considered as the optimal operating parameter which could also save input energy and consequently increase net energy yield from the bioreactor this results are in agreement with that found by ding et al 33 in which the impeller speed range of 90 110 rpm was found to be more suitable for hydrogen production the influence of speed also affects the flow pattern and velocity distribution the velocity distribution and biohydrogen concentration distribution for impeller speeds of 100 and 250 rpm are shown in fig 5 a slight difference is illustrated between two impeller speeds and the results are in accordance with the above mentioned discussions the generated velocity vectors display the pumping action of the impeller and favorable liquid circulation the velocity distribution allows that the dissolved biohydrogen may move toward the headspace of the reactor resulting in the biohydrogen release in the bioreactor and in the decrease of biogas partial pressure as well mixing characteristic effects on hydrogen production rate was also studied by srirugsa et al 50 using cfd technique and according to the results larger dead zones were appeared for low mixing speeds 10 50 rpm in comparison to high speeds 100 150 rpm thus ineffective biohydrogen production was attained due to poor mixing of substrates in the bioreactor similar results were also found in the literature 33 51 53 3 1 5 effect of temperature and membrane thickness in gas separation membrane unit according to the kinetic evaluation conducted in this study the biogas produced during the sucrose consumption reaction included hydrogen and carbon dioxide which need to be separated to recover high grade hydrogen and capture the carbon dioxide thus a msm is proposed to be coupled to the bioreactor for biohydrogen purification purpose a tubular self supported pdag membrane was considered in the housing inside the msm its performance was simulated and validated in this study according to the experimental results of santucci et al 38 the hydrogen present in the biogas stream outlet stream of the bioreactor passes through the membrane as a desirable product and carbon dioxide rich current enters to the bioreactor as a recycle flow for enhancement of mixing fig 6 shows the hydrogen permeating flux against the hydrogen partial pressure square root difference between retentate and permeate sides in the temperature range from 473 to 623 k considering three membrane thicknesses 84 150 and 200 Î¼m for the experimental and simulated systems by increasing the temperature from 473 to 623 k at a constant thickness of 84 Î¼m the hydrogen permeating flux increased by 15 similarly to the 150 and 200 Î¼m membrane thicknesses nevertheless the mass transport resistance offered by higher membrane thickness at a constant temperature is responsible for lower hydrogen permeating fluxes as shown in fig 6a increasing the thickness from 84 to 200 Î¼m at 473 k involved a reduction of the flux by 58 the same trend is also reported by jin et al 54 and a significant increase is seen in hydrogen permeation flux by decreasing the membrane layer thickness from 230 to 20 nm according to the arrhenius equation higher temperature induces higher hydrogen permeating flux due to an emphasized hydrogen permeability in the meantime a higher feed pressure induces an increased hydrogen permeation driving force in terms of a higher transmembrane pressure on the contrary the higher the membrane thickness the lower the hydrogen permeating flux as a consequence of a lower hydrogen permeability through the membrane higher bulk diffusion resistance to the mass transport the cfd simulations of this study resulted in good according to the simulation results the biogas produced in the bioreactor at 308 k ph 5 5 and mixing speed of 120 rpm was obtained as 18 26 and 27 73 l of hydrogen and carbon dioxide respectively assuming the biogas produced in the bioreactor as reported above may enter the msm housing the 84 Î¼m thick pdag membrane at 473 k the simulation showed to reach a hydrogen recovery of around 31 the hydrogen recovery for the other membrane thicknesses as a function of operating temperature were reported in table 6 as expected raising of the temperature an improvement in hydrogen recovery was achieved the effect of temperature on hydrogen permeation flux is also studied by ben mansour et al 40 and it was reported that increasing the feeding temperature from 300 c to 500 c would improve the hydrogen permeation flux by 35 regardless of the feeding pressure value this result is in accordance with the results found in our study 3 1 6 volumetric mass transfer coefficient the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla is an important hydrodynamic characteristic for evaluating the performance of the bioreactor the described msm was assumed to be attached to the stirred bioreactor to begin the simulations in the novel mgsbr configuration the bioreactor was operated in batch recycling mode by purging the liquid phase with the co2 enriched flow of the retentate stream coming out from the msm the recycled flow introduced into the bioreactor was considered as spherical bubbles with constant average diameter the simulated values of kla in the different impeller speeds 100 120 200 and 250 rpm and recycle gas flow rates 0 0001 0 0002 0 0003 and 0 0004 m3 s were presented in fig 7 kla value enhancement is achieved by increasing the recycle gas flow rate as well as impeller speed the increase of gas flow rate leads in elevation of bubble generation and gas holdup in the bioreactor consequently increasing kla value due to increase of the interfacial area between the liquid phase and the gas bubbles moreover the increase of impeller speed in the bioreactor could result in an increase of fluid velocity and agitation as well as turbulent dissipation rate in the system and boosts the mass transfer coefficient consequently the results are consistent with the results reported in literature 55 availability of the substrate in the bioreactor and hence biohydrogen production is dependent on preparing a better mixing regime by using proper impeller speed therefore the effect of impeller speed on biohydrogen generation with without recycle flow was studied and the results are shown in table 7 a slight increase is observed in the biohydrogen production without recycle flow which can be explained by improved mass transfer providing the desired liquid circulation this phenomenon enhances the biohydrogen production by facilitating gas liquid mass transfer of the biohydrogen dissolved in the liquid phase toward the headspace and reducing the biohydrogen partial pressure inside the tank poor mixing of reactor medium could also lead to generation of dead zones and hence ineffective biogas production although these parameters could effectively improve the reactor efficiency a negligible enhancement was obtained in the biohydrogen generation by increasing the impeller speed from 100 to 250 rpm the insignificant effect of recycle flow which could have a synergistic mixing effect on the homogeneity of the bioreactor was also observed in the simulations this could be attributed to the efficient homogeneity of the bioreactor and absence of dead zones even in low impeller speeds these interpretations are in accordance with the results shown in fig 5b which demonstrate the proper homogeneity of the system regarding the fact that the reduced speeds favor an energy saving and increase the net energy yield of the process the impeller speed of 120 rpm could be used as the optimal operating parameter in this study which is in the range of those reported in the literature 33 the simulations showed a slight decrease in the hydrogen production in recycle mode condition with high impeller speeds this phenomenon could be due to the fact that intense agitation and turbulent flow conditions re 103 clearly impair the hydrogen production process by slowing down the metabolic activity of the butyric acid pathway 33 52 56 57 3 1 7 determination of kinetic parameters further study on proper hydrogen generation at different operating conditions requires accurate kinetic data at the studied conditions for this reason the kinetic data reported by wong et al 46 for biohydrogen production from glucose was used as they worked at 310 15 k thus the hmax value should be extracted for 308 15 k value of temperature used in this simulation study therefore a polynomial regression was applied to the experimental data reported by wong et al 46 for hmax at different fermentation temperatures and the following polynomial equation eq 37 was achieved the regression results are also presented in fig 8 37 h max 0 0062 t 3 0 5794 t 2 16 67 t 159 3 it is worth of noting that glucose was used as the main substrate in the research conducted by wong et al 46 instead of sucrose thus the stoichiometric conversions should be applied to attain the exact results for sucrose considering eq 34 according to the results achieved in fig 8 and eq 37 the hmax of 5 53 mol h2 mol glucose was obtained at 308 15 k which equals to 11 06 mol h2 mol sucrose regarding eq 34 the value of hmax achieved from our simulation study was 10 035 mol h2 mol sucrose error of 9 which shows the reliability of proposed cfd simulations the maximum hydrogen yield achieved in this study is significantly higher than the maximum value reported by gavala et al 58 and bankoyi et al 20 which were 1 7 mol h2 mol glucose and 1 91 mol h2 mol glucose respectively by verifying the applicability of the kinetic data reported in the literature the data presented in table 8 were used for further simulating the system at different ph conditions and 310 15 k changing the ph in a fermentation process can modify the metabolic mechanism of microorganisms that produces hydrogen altering the reactive pathway of the intermediate production and ultimately reducing the biohydrogen production fig 9 as shown in this figure the maximum amount of biohydrogen 23 7 l was achieved at ph 6 which was in accordance with the maximum biohydrogen production rate of 1 334 l h by increasing the ph to 8 a decline of 17 9 was observed in the hydrogen production reaching 19 4 l the hydrogen production was zero at ph 4 which was indicative of intensive cell growth inhibition under highly acidic condition at ph 5 a lag phase of about 12 h was shown which was dedicated to the adaptation of activated sludge to the acidic medium reaching a hydrogen production of 18 4 l after 45 h the results showed that the hydrogen generation was strongly influenced by the ph confirming that the optimum ph for biohydrogen production is slightly related to acidic condition these results are in agreement and supported by observational studies reported in the related literature ph 6 6 5 56 59 likewise in the research conducted by gavala et al 58 ph 6 was found as the optimum ph in which maximum hydrogen yields was obtained 3 2 statistical analysis a large experimental procedure considers significant costs and when a model is able to effectively simulate the target responses important savings can be achieved simultaneously logistical difficulties related to experimental work are also avoided despite the prediction of biohydrogen production the cfd model is unable to select the best operating conditions in a straightforward way this could be achieved combining the cfd model with a response surface method which avoids expensive and time consuming experiments rsm can generate large amounts of information from a small number of experiments and it is able to assess the interaction effects between the variables on the responses along with determining the optimal operating conditions however in multivariable processes including various potentially effective parameters the process analysis with an initial screening design before optimization seems to be necessary a three level ccd scheme was used to demonstrate the relative importance of the selected effective factors for the optimization of biohydrogen generation using cfd experiments the complete design matrix together with the predicted response values are given in table 4 numerical experiments as cfd based simulations were performed according to the shown experimental plan the quadratic regression equation for biohydrogen production in terms of coded values of the factors is given by eq 38 38 y 23 77 1 86 a 0 0282 b 0 0114 c 0 0177 a 2 0 0440 b 2 0 0327 c 2 3 00 ab 0 0016 ac 0 0224 bc the final empirical model presents a good visualization of the effects of each effective parameter and their interactions on the response the positive sign in front of the model terms indicates synergistic effect while the negative sign indicates antagonistic effect of the factor on the response the anova was performed statistically to evaluate the quality of the developed model as shown in table 9 based on a 95 confidence level the second order quadratic model was confirmed to be well significant regarding the resulted f value 53 370 22 and the p value 0 05 this result gave an indication that the model was adequate for hydrogen production within the range of variables studied based on the anova results the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9998 indicating that the model provides a perfect correlation between the independent variables and the response the value of r2 adj 0 9996 exhibited that only less than 1 of the variation could not be explained by the model adequate precision of 546 55 indicates adequate signal for the model to be used to navigate the design space and a ratio greater than 4 is desirable the three dimensional response surfaces were plotted based on the fitted second order polynomial equation as presented in fig 10 which illustrates the effects of ph inlet gas flow rate and impeller speed on biohydrogen generation according to contour plots the ph factor has the highest effect on hydrogen production and the maximum hydrogen is produced in the ph range from 6 to 6 5 the effect of ph factor is in accordance with the coefficient obtained in eq 38 as well as the f test value of the anova table hydrogen production is influenced slightly by increasing inlet gas flow rate and impeller speed which is also in compliance with the results reported in sections 3 1 4 and 3 1 5 3 2 1 optimization of the process optimization is an indispensable step for comprehensive designing modeling and applying for a large scale process optimization is a mathematical technique of selecting optimal values from the available input dataset by systematically choosing the independent variables within the predefined boundary and predicting the best value of the response numerical response optimization helps to find the factor setting that fulfill the desired requirements simultaneously in order to achieve the maximum biohydrogen production in the proposed mgsbr using cfd based numerical experiments the optimum level of the variables were found from the developed mathematical ccd model both weight and importance were set at 1 and the criterion was set in range for the studied variables to maximize the response biohydrogen production the optimum conditions suggested by the cfd based rsm model was ph 6 3 impeller speed of 115 and inlet gas flow rate of 2 4 10 5 with maximum hydrogen production of 24 1 l the optimal parameters were also confirmed by the analysis of 3d response surface plots for the model among various optimal conditions suggested by the model these conditions were selected since lower impeller speed and inlet gas flow rate could avoid inhibition of biohydrogen production while it is high enough to maintain the flow homogeneity and ensure solid suspension 34 furthermore the predicted values are economically more energy efficient and less stressful to the microbial system present in the bioreactor according to the literature h2 production could be completely inhibited at acidic condition and favorable ph for h2 production usually occurs at the slightly acidic condition ph 6 moreover growth and activity of methanogens and acetobacteria would significantly be surpassed in ph values about 6 however the predicted optimal results in this study were completely in agreement with these explanations 22 46 the obtained results completely follows the aim of the research in presenting a numerical methodology within the framework of the cfd technique combined with design of experiments to obtain stable and high quality hydrogen production from a biochemical reaction 4 conclusion in this work a comprehensive study was performed on cfd simulation of a new configuration of mbr named as membrane based gas separation bioreactor developed by integrating a hydrogen producing fermenter and a pdag based msm for hydrogen purification the two phase turbulent flow field of the bioreactor was proposed to be used for biohydrogen generation in batch and batch recycle modes using sucrose as a substrate and modeled with an eulerian eulerian two fluid model approach the implemented cfd simulation offered an advantage in showing the dynamic behavior of the system by incorporating sub models of biokinetics hydrodynamic parameters and mass transfer profiles for biohydrogen production and purification in the mgsbr the simulation results were found to be in good agreement with those obtained through experimentation and reported in the literature since various hydrodynamic and operational parameters play key roles in biohydrogen production a first attempt was made in this article by combining statistical methods with the cfd model for designing and optimizing the novel mgsbr system as one of the broadly used rsm schemes the three level ccd was utilized to design the numerical experiments and evaluate the interaction effects of ph impeller speed and inlet gas flow rate of hydrogen production as the response the ph of the substrate medium was found to be more affecting the biohydrogen production and its maximum value of 24 1 l was predicted to be obtained at optimum conditions this work suggested an approach for the predictive simulation of a complex biological process and separation unit through numerical and statistical modeling based on cfd and rsm the consequence of the proposed investigation technique was a comprehensive and accurate estimation of different affective operational and designing parameters providing a practical tool for the optimization and bioreactor scale up this theoretical study demonstrated that the proposed mgsbr may be potentially useful in the simultaneous biological wastewater treatment and hydrogen production and purification overall it is believed that the cfd coupled with rsm has proven to be a time saving and cost effective approach for the assessment of the performance of the bioreactor moreover the modeled mgsbr possessed good potential for real case of simultaneous biohydrogen production and purification further studies are warranted to shed more light on the interplay of various operational and membrane conditions for maximizing biohydrogen separation due to complexity of the proposed system effect of other affective parameters such as pressure feed concentration operation time membrane surface area etc could also be evaluated according to the developed cfd rsm combined method a task which remains for future studies moreover concentration polarization fouling along with process cost evaluations and economic analysis may be a priority subject for future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13393,a first step in assessing the potential of the hydrothermally treated sludge as a fermentation medium or as fertiliser among other more innovative uses is to study in depth the compositional changes that take place during the hydrothermal treatment of secondary sewage sludge thus the present study analyses for the first time the effects of the reaction time temperature pressure and atmosphere on the properties of the hydrolysates obtained and in particular on the fate of the four main macronutrients c n p and k under the most aggressive operational conditions tested 200 c 50 bar 210 min and oxidising atmosphere 76 of total suspended solids were disintegrated and 94 96 12 and 41 of c n p and k were solubilised with the majority of these changes occurring during the first 60 min of treatment nevertheless these conditions also resulted in significant mineralisation of the organic carbon 77 total chemical oxygen demand reduction and the formation of notable concentrations of ammonium around 64 g kg dry matter and small amounts of nitrates and nitrites 0 14 g kg dry matter after long reaction times the re alkalinisation of the reaction medium favoured the binding of soluble p to dissolved metal ions and its subsequent precipitation temperature and type of atmosphere did not significantly influence the soluble k concentration suggesting that this element mainly interacts with tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances in the raw sludge finally pressure did not have significant effects on the final macronutrient composition of the treated sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge nitrogen phosphorus potassium hydrothermal treatments 1 introduction the huge amounts of sludge that are unavoidably generated during the secondary treatment of municipal wastewaters continue to be one of the main problems in wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 within the european union the latest data available for spain on sewage sludge production 2016 place it as the second largest producer with 1174 4 thousand tonnes generated 2 as its management represents up to 50 of the total operational costs in wwtp 3 valorisation strategies are being developed as a way of reducing the environmental and economic impact 4 due to its composition sludge can be used as a cheap renewable source of energy and or materials such as nutrients proteins and adsorbents 5 10 however sludge also contains organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah dioxins and furans pcdd f polychlorinated biphenyls pcb detergent and pharmaceutical residues personal care products endocrine disruptors synthetic steroids pathogens and heavy metals 11 currently the main research efforts on sludge management are being focused on optimising traditional sludge treatments such as anaerobic digestion 12 13 pyrolysis 14 15 or gasification 16 and on developing new ways of valorising sludge to recover energy and new resources such as proteins enzymes bioplastics volatile fatty acids and new biofuels 6 17 19 it is interesting to point out that many of these traditional and new ways of sludge management require sludge solubilisation as a previous and necessary step 20 25 among the techniques available for this purpose hydrothermal treatments are one of the most attractive alternatives 21 26 28 sludge is subjected in a dense liquid phase to reduce volume to high temperatures and pressures above 100 c and 0 101 mpa which destroy cells and hydrolyse molecules 23 29 30 compared to other methods they do not require expensive devices do not release harmful emissions into the air improve the characteristics of settleability and filterability stabilise the sludge and reduce energy consumption 31 hydrothermal treatments are categorised depending on the type of atmosphere that is employed if this atmosphere includes air pure oxygen or any other oxidant the process is called wet oxidation wo whereas if treatment is carried out under an inert atmosphere it is known as thermal hydrolysis th 23 there is a large amount of literature on hydrothermal sludge treatments analysing the effect of the main operating variables temperature pressure ph and gas flow rate 1 23 32 34 and promoters such as metal salts h2o2 and persulfate 35 38 on a large number of physical chemical rheological and texturometric parameters as well as on the final composition of the hydrolysate 27 34 39 40 despite the extensive research on the effect of thermal hydrolysis or wet oxidation on the solubilisation and transformations of c from sludge their impacts on other macroelements have scarcely been studied to the best of our knowledge the most complete studies to date covering this topic corresponds to sun et al 41 who analysed the evolution of the main macronutrients during the thermal hydrolysis of a 50 diluted dewatered sewage sludge at temperatures between 180 c and 240 c and to lu et al 42 who analysed the release of c n p k amino acids and metals after 30 min of thermal hydrolysis at different temperatures apart from this malhotra and garg 3 studied carbon and ammonium concentrations during the hydrothermal treatment of secondary sludge at different temperatures 140 160 and 180 c ph 3 3 6 3 and 9 3 times 2 3 5 and 5 h after reaching the set temperature and oxidation coefficients 0 0 25 and 0 5 however only one nitrogen species ammonium was analysed and no attention was paid to the evolution of other nitrogen species such as nitrites nitrates or organic nitrogen either soluble or not similarly different studies have examined the redistribution of nitrogen in different products but during hydrothermal liquefaction or carbonisation treatments of sludge where dewatered sludge was employed as the raw material and hydrochars and oily phases were also formed 43 44 regarding phosphorus research efforts have focused on its recovery after combining hydrothermal treatments or carbonisation with other subsequent separation methods but not on its behaviour during these treatments nor the effect of oxygen 45 49 therefore there are no studies specifically dealing with the effect of the main operational parameters time pressure temperature and atmosphere during the hydrothermal treatments of wet sewage sludge on the fate of the four macroelements c n p and k simultaneously what stands out most is that neither the changes occurring during the heating period when the solubilisation rate is the highest nor the effect of an oxidising atmosphere has been thoroughly analysed yet moreover dewatered sewage sludge is commonly used as a feedstock despite the fact that previous drying is unnecessary because hydrothermal treatments use water as a reagent 26 the aim of this research was to study in depth the compositional changes that take place during the hydrothermal treatment of secondary sewage sludge for this purpose the effects of the main operational parameters time temperature pressure and atmosphere on the fate of the four macronutrients c n p and k and the most important physicochemical parameters were analysed such knowledge would be very useful when deciding the use of hydrothermally treated sludge as a fermentation medium for the bioproduction of metabolites biogas vfa bioplastics and so on 50 51 or as fertiliser directly or after a previous transformation 52 among others 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge secondary sludge thickened by dissolved air flotation was collected from a wastewater treatment plant in

parameters whether measured in the liquid or solid phase have been expressed in g kg dry matter in the initial sludge in order to compare results with those from other sludges used by different researchers regardless of the solid content of the feedstock dry matter content was obtained by difference in weight between raw sewage sludge and after drying at 105 c 2 3 2 elemental analysis soluble total organic stoc and inorganic ic carbon concentrations were measured using a shimadzu toc v csh device concentrations of nitrogen as nitrites nitrates ammonium and organic nitrogen in the

digested by the microwave acid digestion method was also analysed 6 ml of hno3 and 2 ml of a 30 h2o2 solution were added to 100 mg of dried sludge and a microwave instrument was used ethos one milestone systems the procedure employed is described in the application note hpr en 25 of milestone 54 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operational conditions on carbon solubilisation fig 1 shows the changes in the main physicochemical properties including the soluble organic carbon concentration during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge under different temperatures and atmospheres as the effects of the main operating conditions on these parameters have already been profusely studied 55 56 they will be briefly explained in this section additionally fig s 2 in the supplementary material shows the evolution of tss the first observation to make is that during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge under an inert atmosphere a higher and faster release of soluble compounds was observed when the temperature was increased in this sense both scod and stoc increased at first as a result of the initial breakage of cells produced by the hydrolysis reactions and then they remained constant because the released compounds were not oxidised due to the absence of oxygen 34 this absence of oxidation reactions under inert atmospheres also explained why tcod remained almost constant during all the thermal hydrolysis experiments regardless of the temperature selected moreover the hydrolysis caused a change in the colour of the supernatant it being more intense at high temperatures this was attributed to the formation of biorefractory molecules called melanoidins due to maillard reactions 57 regarding the effect of an oxidising atmosphere the presence of oxygen was only relevant at high temperatures in fact scod tcod and stoc behaved quite similar under both atmospheres at 100 c indicating the little oxidation of organic matter at low temperatures once the temperature was increased the impact of an oxidising atmosphere in comparison to an inert one on the main physicochemical sludge properties became noticeable for temperatures higher than 150 c oxidation reactions began to be important so scod initially increased due to hydrolysis reactions but after reaching a maximum it decreased due to the oxidation of the previously solubilised organic matter to co2 and water 40 it is interesting to point out that high temperatures not only accelerated the oxidation reactions but also the hydrolysis ones it was also conspicuous that stoc also initially increased from 7 2 0 6 g c kg dry matter to 278 4 g c kg dry matter during the wet oxidation of sludge at 150 c but after 165 min this value remained constant for the rest of the reaction time on the other hand when the temperature was stepped up to 200 c the stoc value reached a maximum 225 2 g c kg dry matter after only 60 min but then decreased to 125 3 g c kg dry matter during the last 150 min of reaction thus comparing scod and stoc values it was deduced that the oxidation reactions were negligible at 100 c but as the temperature rose the dissolved organic matter was partially oxidised at 150 c stoc remained constant but scod decreased or even totally mineralised to carbon dioxide if the temperature was high enough at 200 c both scod and stoc decreased in fact the accumulation of partially oxidised intermediate compounds at high temperatures 200 c was indirectly confirmed by the increase in the colour number which also registered a maximum after 60 min of the experiment coinciding with the maximum of the scod after this time the coloured compounds started to be degraded as shown by the stoc behaviour additionally the concentration of inorganic carbon in the liquid fraction was negligible regardless of treatment and reaction time since the co2 formed during wet oxidation was desorbed by the gas stream as for the evolution of carbon in the solid fraction see fig s 3 in the supplementary material it agrees with the solubilisation trend previously described for stoc furthermore the mineralisation of the compounds during wet oxidation can be observed in the balance included in fig s 4 in the supplementary material since co2 formation only occurred in the presence of oxygen finally the effect of oxygen pressure on the main physicochemical characteristics of the hydrolysed sludge was studied by carrying out experiments at 10 50 and 90 bar see fig s 5 in the supplementary material results revealed that an increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration had a positive impact on the sludge solubilisation but also speeded up the subsequent mineralisation of the solubilised organic matter to co2 and water 40 3 2 effect of operational conditions on nitrogen solubilisation research continued by investigating the effects of temperature and type of atmosphere oxidising or inert on the concentrations of the different nitrogen species during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge in the presence of oxygen wet oxidation and nitrogen thermal hydrolysis at different temperatures 100 150 and 200 c fig 2 as in the case of carbon at the lowest temperature tested 100 c the changes in the concentrations of the different types of nitrogen during wet oxidation and thermal hydrolysis were quite similar fig 2a showed that the percentage of nitrogen in the non solubilised sludge barely decreased during the experiments at 100 c this suggests that there was no preferential solubilisation of nitrogen in comparison with other chemical elements of the sludge at low temperatures in presence of oxygen this final reduction was slightly higher than under an inert atmosphere as would be expected because the degradation was speeded up by the oxidising atmosphere it can also be deduced from fig 2b that the solubilisation of organic nitrogen mainly occurred during the first 60 min probably due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances with nitrogen in their composition 3 after this time the concentration of soluble organic nitrogen increased slightly suggesting that the breaking up of cells at this temperature took place slowly the final decrease observed in the soluble organic nitrogen concentrations during the last 50 min of treatment at 100 c could be explained by the hydrolysis and or oxidation of organic nitrogen to inorganic compounds regarding the inorganic nitrogen species formed the concentration of nitrogen as nitrates or nitrites species was negligible so their formation from organic nitrogen could be discarded ammonium however was the main inorganic nitrogen species generated being its concentration in the liquid phase doubled in absence of oxygen and quadrupled in its presence at the end of the hydrothermal treatments at 100 c nevertheless the effects of the atmosphere on the fate of soluble and non soluble nitrogen became evident at higher temperatures due to nitrogen speciation is attributed to oxidation reactions and the degradation of proteins 3 56 this was also in line with the absence of significant differences in the evolution of the main physicochemical parameters for those same conditions fig 1 so although increasing the temperature above 100 c involved a significant reduction in the percentage of non solubilised nitrogen in the solid sludge fraction this was more pronounced under an oxidising atmosphere and at higher temperatures as an example the nitrogen content of the non solubilised sludge fraction decreased from an initial value of 66 300 600 mg n kg dry matter to 16 000 800 or 2906 4 mg n kg dry matter after 210 min of hydrothermal treatment in absence or presence of oxygen respectively at the highest temperature 200 c moving on to soluble organic nitrogen its concentration increased during the first minutes of reaction reaching a maximum and then started to decrease this was attributed to the existence of two reactions in series the initial solubilisation of nitrogen from the solid phase of the sludge due to bacterial lysis and the subsequent degradation of the solubilised proteins with ammonium as the final product 3 it can be easily deduced from fig 2a and d that both reactions are favoured by high temperatures and or the presence of oxygen during the hydrothermal treatment which is reasonable taking into account that more aggressive conditions caused not only faster bacterial lysis but also a higher degree of denaturation and degradation of proteins with the corresponding generation of ammonium as a by product at this point it should be stressed that due to the high temperatures and the constant gas flow passing through the reaction medium ammonium was partially desorbed so its concentration was deduced from a nitrogen mass balance see fig s 4 in the supplementary material as expected the rate of formation of ammonium during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge was accelerated by employing higher temperatures and or the presence of an oxidising atmosphere which involved faster degradation of the solubilised proteins so around 47 of the initial nitrogen in the sludge was converted to ammonium after 210 min of treatment at 150 c under an inert atmosphere whereas this percentage increased to 75 or 87 if temperature was 200 c or oxygen was employed as oxidant respectively in fact under the most severe conditions 200 c and oxygen only 5 of the solubilised nitrogen remained in organic form in this specific case it is also interesting to note a gradual increase in the nitrate concentration during the hydrothermal treatment from 60 min to the end of the experiment reaching a final value of 130 mg no2 no3 kg dry matter this suggests a low degree of nitrification of ammonium which was only appreciable under the most aggressive conditions tested 200 c and with oxygen regarding the effect of the oxygen pressure on nitrogen speciation during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge see fig s 6 in the supplementary material results revealed that no significant differences were to be observed in the changes undergone by the main nitrogen species at the different pressures tested which ranged from 10 to 90 bar only a slight increase in the concentration of nitrates and nitrites concentration was observed at high oxygen pressures due to a lower solubilisation of the organic nitrogen at 10 bar therefore it can be concluded that this operational parameter is not determining during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge 3 3 effect of operational conditions on phosphorus solubilisation fig 3 shows the behaviour of solubilised phosphorus and potassium during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge at different atmospheres and temperatures their non solubilised concentrations and the mass balances before and after the treatments at different temperatures can be seen in figs s 3 and s 4 in the supplementary material before discussing the effect of operational conditions on phosphorus and potassium solubilisation it is important to note that both have been considered as inorganic nutrients in the case of phosphorus this was because sludge is mainly composed of inorganic phosphorus and its main form in solution is phosphate 58 59 when analysing the effect of temperature on phosphorus evolution as was observed for carbon and nitrogen this parameter also increased the phosphorus solubilisation rate which was to be expected due to higher cellular lysis nevertheless temperature did not have any significant effect on the maximum solubilised amount only on the time required to achieve it thus focussing on wet oxidation at 100 c the maximum concentration of soluble p was reached after 120 min with a value of 4000 400 mg p kg dry matter at 150 c this was reached after 120 min as well with a value of 5600 300 mg p kg dry matter and at 200 c after 60 min with a value of 5120 40 mg p kg dry matter these values for solubilised phosphorus corresponded to around 30 of the initial amount in the raw sludge it should be also stressed that soluble phosphorus only decreased after reaching a maximum at the highest temperature tested this was related to variation in the ph high temperatures caused faster tss reduction see fig s 2 in the supplementary material and higher initial acidification of the solution resulting in increased formation of po4 3 in the liquid phase after a while the ph increased again fig 1 and the alkaline medium favoured the binding of phosphorus with metal ions present in the solution fe ca al and its subsequent precipitation which involved a reduction in the soluble p concentration 59 regarding its evolution during thermal hydrolysis the degree of solubilisation achieved was lower in absence of oxygen thus maximum phosphorus solubilisation during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge in absence of oxygen was around 18 for all the temperatures in comparison to the 32 achieved under an oxidising atmosphere again this behaviour is closely related to the changes in ph during the hydrothermal treatment thermal hydrolysis caused lower acidification of the hydrolysed sludge leading to the formation of po4 3 in the liquid phase to a lesser extent than during wet oxidation further experiments were conducted to better understand the oxygen effect fig s 7 in the supplementary material shows the changes in soluble phosphorus during the hydrothermal treatment at different pressures it was observed that increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration produced greater solubilisation of p reaching a maximum value of 5700 600 mg p kg dry matter at 90 bar in comparison to 5600 300 mg p kg dry matter at 50 bar and 4410 40 mg p kg dry matter at 10 bar as can be seen in fig s 5 in the supplementary material the higher the pressure employed the greater was the acidification of the sample during the treatment and therefore the higher the formation of po4 3 in the liquid phase 3 4 effect of operational conditions on potassium solubilisation finally soluble potassium concentrations were also measured during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge carried out at different temperatures and atmospheres fig 3 results revealed that neither changing the temperature nor the type of atmosphere produced significant impacts on the solubilisation rate or the final soluble potassium concentration which reached a maximum of around 3100 400 mg k kg dry matter after approximately 30 min regardless of the temperature atmosphere or pressure tested see fig s 7 in the supplementary material this constant value corresponds to around 57 of the total potassium in the raw sludge and suggests that potassium was mainly associated with tightly bound eps these extracellular polymers are easily solubilised even at low temperatures explaining the increase in the soluble concentration during the first minutes of treatment when the heating up of the reactor occurred 30 60 3 5 comparison fig 4 shows the proportions of the non solubilised macroelements in the dry matter of the sludge before being treated or after 210 min of thermal hydrolysis or wet oxidation at 100 150 and 200 c as previously explained slight tss reductions were observed at the lowest experimental temperature 100 c regardless of the atmosphere selected see fig s 2 in the supplementary material at this temperature the possibility of preferential solubilisation of some elements in comparison to others could also be discarded the proportions of each element remaining approximately constant after the treatments however when the temperature was increased to 150 c or 200 c solubilisation of the sludge was clearly evident as was a decrease in the proportion of nitrogen in the non solubilised fraction in comparison to the other elements these effects were more marked under the most aggressive conditions that is to say at high temperatures and or in presence of oxygen so nitrogen represented 6 6 of the initial weight of the dried sludge but this percentage decreased to 0 3 in the non solubilised sludge fraction after wet oxidation at 200 c under the same conditions the percentages of solid carbon phosphorus and potassium changed from 34 1 1 6 and 0 4 in the raw sludge to 2 0 1 4 and 0 3 respectively after the hydrothermal treatment it is interesting to remember that these conditions also caused a 76 reduction in tss which decreased from 27 g tss kg sludge in the initial sample to 7 g tss kg sludge in the sample treated at 200 c under an oxidising atmosphere nevertheless no significant effect of the dissolved oxygen concentration on the final elemental composition of the non solubilised fraction of the sludge was observed at least over the range of pressures studied see fig s 8 in the supplementary material focusing now on the liquid phase fig 5 shows the proportions of the main elements in the liquid phases of the initial sludge and the hydrolysates obtained after 210 min of the corresponding hydrothermal treatment as might be expected a significant increase in the solubilised amount of the different elements studied was observed after the hydrothermal treatments nevertheless as has already been explained a higher temperature and or the employment of an oxidising atmosphere did not necessarily imply a higher content of these elements in the liquid phase even when these conditions improve the disintegration of the solid fraction this is due to two previously mentioned processes the formation of carbon dioxide by oxidation reactions and the precipitation of phosphorus at alkaline ph in addition an increase in the amount of inorganic nitrogen also occurred due to the degradation of organic nitrogen containing compounds into ammonium the formation of which was accelerated under the most aggressive conditions of temperature and in presence of oxygen it is interesting to stress that the corg norg p k mass ratio for the liquid phase of the raw sludge was 100 8 3 0 5 17 9 whereas this parameter after 210 min at 200 c of thermal hydrolysis was 100 0 8 0 5 1 7 or in the case of wet oxidation 100 2 7 1 6 2 4 therefore it can be concluded that at the highest temperature tested an inert atmosphere produced a decrease in either the norg corg or k corg ratios due to the faster solubilisation of carbon in comparison with the rates corresponding to the other elements moreover part of the organic nitrogen was converted into ammonium and released from the liquid medium in contrast the p corg ratio was maintained owing to their solubilisations were comparable on the other hand the oxidising atmosphere caused smaller reductions in the norg corg and k corg ratios in comparison to an inert one because a fraction of the solubilised organic carbon was oxidised to co2 nevertheless the p corg ratio increased during the wet oxidation treatment because the formation rate of co2 was higher than the precipitation rate of po4 3 nevertheless it should be remembered that the content of the four elements here discussed increased in terms of their absolute concentrations eventually as demonstrated above increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration did not produce significant impacts on the final elemental composition in the liquid phase at least over the range of pressures tested 10 90 bar see fig s 9 in the supplementary material 4 conclusions this study has provided for the first time a profound understanding of the effect of the hydrothermal treatments on the fate of the four main macronutrients c n p and k in sewage sludge which is important because this hydrolysed feedstock is of considerable interest for use as a fertiliser or as a fermentation medium regarding carbon results revealed that the oxidation reactions were negligible at 100 c but as the temperature rose the dissolved organic matter was mineralised to carbon dioxide focusing on nitrogen increasing the temperature led under both types of atmosphere to a higher degree of solubilisation of this element the effect being greater in presence of oxygen in the specific case of soluble organic nitrogen its solubilisation occurred mainly during the first minutes of treatment due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances and afterwards this organic nitrogen was degraded to ammonium especially at high temperatures and under an oxidising atmosphere with phosphorus solubilisation also occurred at the beginning of the treatments but then as the temperature increased it re precipitated in the form of po4 3 resulting in a decrease in the soluble phosphorus in addition for all the conditions tested fast initial solubilisation of potassium was observed during the first 30 min and then the soluble concentration achieved remained almost constant until the end of the experiments finally pressure did not have significant effects on the final macronutrient composition of the sludge hydrolysate over the range tested 10 90 bar declaration

13393,a first step in assessing the potential of the hydrothermally treated sludge as a fermentation medium or as fertiliser among other more innovative uses is to study in depth the compositional changes that take place during the hydrothermal treatment of secondary sewage sludge thus the present study analyses for the first time the effects of the reaction time temperature pressure and atmosphere on the properties of the hydrolysates obtained and in particular on the fate of the four main macronutrients c n p and k under the most aggressive operational conditions tested 200 c 50 bar 210 min and oxidising atmosphere 76 of total suspended solids were disintegrated and 94 96 12 and 41 of c n p and k were solubilised with the majority of these changes occurring during the first 60 min of treatment nevertheless these conditions also resulted in significant mineralisation of the organic carbon 77 total chemical oxygen demand reduction and the formation of notable concentrations of ammonium around 64 g kg dry matter and small amounts of nitrates and nitrites 0 14 g kg dry matter after long reaction times the re alkalinisation of the reaction medium favoured the binding of soluble p to dissolved metal ions and its subsequent precipitation temperature and type of atmosphere did not significantly influence the soluble k concentration suggesting that this element mainly interacts with tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances in the raw sludge finally pressure did not have significant effects on the final macronutrient composition of the treated sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge nitrogen phosphorus potassium hydrothermal treatments 1 introduction the huge amounts of sludge that are unavoidably generated during the secondary treatment of municipal wastewaters continue to be one of the main problems in wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 within the european union the latest data available for spain on sewage sludge production 2016 place it as the second largest producer with 1174 4 thousand tonnes generated 2 as its management represents up to 50 of the total operational costs in wwtp 3 valorisation strategies are being developed as a way of reducing the environmental and economic impact 4 due to its composition sludge can be used as a cheap renewable source of energy and or materials such as nutrients proteins and adsorbents 5 10 however sludge also contains organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah dioxins and furans pcdd f polychlorinated biphenyls pcb detergent and pharmaceutical residues personal care products endocrine disruptors synthetic steroids pathogens and heavy metals 11 currently the main research efforts on sludge management are being focused on optimising traditional sludge treatments such as anaerobic digestion 12 13 pyrolysis 14 15 or gasification 16 and on developing new ways of valorising sludge to recover energy and new resources such as proteins enzymes bioplastics volatile fatty acids and new biofuels 6 17 19 it is interesting to point out that many of these traditional and new ways of sludge management require sludge solubilisation as a previous and necessary step 20 25 among the techniques available for this purpose hydrothermal treatments are one of the most attractive alternatives 21 26 28 sludge is subjected in a dense liquid phase to reduce volume to high temperatures and pressures above 100 c and 0 101 mpa which destroy cells and hydrolyse molecules 23 29 30 compared to other methods they do not require expensive devices do not release harmful emissions into the air improve the characteristics of settleability and filterability stabilise the sludge and reduce energy consumption 31 hydrothermal treatments are categorised depending on the type of atmosphere that is employed if this atmosphere includes air pure oxygen or any other oxidant the process is called wet oxidation wo whereas if treatment is carried out under an inert atmosphere it is known as thermal hydrolysis th 23 there is a large amount of literature on hydrothermal sludge treatments analysing the effect of the main operating variables temperature pressure ph and gas flow rate 1 23 32 34 and promoters such as metal salts h2o2 and persulfate 35 38 on a large number of physical chemical rheological and texturometric parameters as well as on the final composition of the hydrolysate 27 34 39 40 despite the extensive research on the effect of thermal hydrolysis or wet oxidation on the solubilisation and transformations of c from sludge their impacts on other macroelements have scarcely been studied to the best of our knowledge the most complete studies to date covering this topic corresponds to sun et al 41 who analysed the evolution of the main macronutrients during the thermal hydrolysis of a 50 diluted dewatered sewage sludge at temperatures between 180 c and 240 c and to lu et al 42 who analysed the release of c n p k amino acids and metals after 30 min of thermal hydrolysis at different temperatures apart from this malhotra and garg 3 studied carbon and ammonium concentrations during the hydrothermal treatment of secondary sludge at different temperatures 140 160 and 180 c ph 3 3 6 3 and 9 3 times 2 3 5 and 5 h after reaching the set temperature and oxidation coefficients 0 0 25 and 0 5 however only one nitrogen species ammonium was analysed and no attention was paid to the evolution of other nitrogen species such as nitrites nitrates or organic nitrogen either soluble or not similarly different studies have examined the redistribution of nitrogen in different products but during hydrothermal liquefaction or carbonisation treatments of sludge where dewatered sludge was employed as the raw material and hydrochars and oily phases were also formed 43 44 regarding phosphorus research efforts have focused on its recovery after combining hydrothermal treatments or carbonisation with other subsequent separation methods but not on its behaviour during these treatments nor the effect of oxygen 45 49 therefore there are no studies specifically dealing with the effect of the main operational parameters time pressure temperature and atmosphere during the hydrothermal treatments of wet sewage sludge on the fate of the four macroelements c n p and k simultaneously what stands out most is that neither the changes occurring during the heating period when the solubilisation rate is the highest nor the effect of an oxidising atmosphere has been thoroughly analysed yet moreover dewatered sewage sludge is commonly used as a feedstock despite the fact that previous drying is unnecessary because hydrothermal treatments use water as a reagent 26 the aim of this research was to study in depth the compositional changes that take place during the hydrothermal treatment of secondary sewage sludge for this purpose the effects of the main operational parameters time temperature pressure and atmosphere on the fate of the four macronutrients c n p and k and the most important physicochemical parameters were analysed such knowledge would be very useful when deciding the use of hydrothermally treated sludge as a fermentation medium for the bioproduction of metabolites biogas vfa bioplastics and so on 50 51 or as fertiliser directly or after a previous transformation 52 among others 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge secondary sludge thickened by dissolved air flotation was collected from a wastewater treatment plant in

milestone systems the procedure employed is described in the application note hpr en 25 of milestone 54 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operational conditions on carbon solubilisation fig 1 shows the changes in the main physicochemical properties including the soluble organic carbon concentration during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge under different temperatures and atmospheres as the effects of the main operating conditions on these parameters have already been profusely studied 55 56 they will be briefly explained in this section additionally fig s 2 in the supplementary material shows the evolution of tss the first observation to make is that during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge under an inert atmosphere a higher and faster release of soluble compounds was observed when the temperature was increased in this sense both scod and stoc increased at first as a result of the initial breakage of cells produced by the hydrolysis reactions and then they remained constant because the released compounds were not oxidised due to the absence of oxygen 34 this absence of oxidation reactions under inert atmospheres also explained why tcod remained almost constant during all the thermal hydrolysis experiments regardless of the temperature selected moreover the hydrolysis caused a change in the colour of the supernatant it being more intense at high temperatures this was attributed to the formation of biorefractory molecules called melanoidins due to maillard reactions 57 regarding the effect of an oxidising atmosphere the presence of oxygen was only relevant at high temperatures in fact scod tcod and stoc behaved quite similar under both atmospheres at 100 c indicating the little oxidation of organic matter at low temperatures once the temperature was increased the impact of an oxidising atmosphere in comparison to an inert one on the main physicochemical sludge properties became noticeable for temperatures higher than 150 c oxidation reactions began to be important so scod initially increased due to hydrolysis reactions but after reaching a maximum it decreased due to the oxidation of the previously solubilised organic matter to co2 and water 40 it is interesting to point out that high temperatures not only accelerated the oxidation reactions but also the hydrolysis ones it was also conspicuous that stoc also initially increased from 7 2 0 6 g c kg dry matter to 278 4 g c kg dry matter during the wet oxidation of sludge at 150 c but after 165 min this value remained constant for the rest of the reaction time on the other hand when the temperature was stepped up to 200 c the stoc value reached a maximum 225 2 g c kg dry matter after only 60 min but then decreased to 125 3 g c kg dry matter during the last 150 min of reaction thus comparing scod and stoc values it was deduced that the oxidation reactions were negligible at 100 c but as the temperature rose the dissolved organic matter was partially oxidised at 150 c stoc remained constant but scod decreased or even totally mineralised to carbon dioxide if the temperature was high enough at 200 c both scod and stoc decreased in fact the accumulation of partially oxidised intermediate compounds at high temperatures 200 c was indirectly confirmed by the increase in the colour number which also registered a maximum after 60 min of the experiment coinciding with the maximum of the scod after this time the coloured compounds started to be degraded as shown by the stoc behaviour additionally the concentration of inorganic carbon in the liquid fraction was negligible regardless of treatment and reaction time since the co2 formed during wet oxidation was desorbed by the gas stream as for the evolution of carbon in the solid fraction see fig s 3 in the supplementary material it agrees with the solubilisation trend previously described for stoc furthermore the mineralisation of the compounds during wet oxidation can be observed in the balance included in fig s 4 in the supplementary material since co2 formation only occurred in the presence of oxygen finally the effect of oxygen pressure on the main physicochemical characteristics of the hydrolysed sludge was studied by carrying out experiments at 10 50 and 90 bar see fig s 5 in the supplementary material results revealed that an increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration had a positive impact on the sludge solubilisation but also speeded up the subsequent mineralisation of the solubilised organic matter to co2 and water 40 3 2 effect of operational conditions on nitrogen solubilisation research continued by investigating the effects of temperature and type of atmosphere oxidising or inert on the concentrations of the different nitrogen species during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge in the presence of oxygen wet oxidation and nitrogen thermal hydrolysis at different temperatures 100 150 and 200 c fig 2 as in the case of carbon at the lowest temperature tested 100 c the changes in the concentrations of the different types of nitrogen during wet oxidation and thermal hydrolysis were quite similar fig 2a showed that the percentage of nitrogen in the non solubilised sludge barely decreased during the experiments at 100 c this suggests that there was no preferential solubilisation of nitrogen in comparison with other chemical elements of the sludge at low temperatures in presence of oxygen this final reduction was slightly higher than under an inert atmosphere as would be expected because the degradation was speeded up by the oxidising atmosphere it can also be deduced from fig 2b that the solubilisation of organic nitrogen mainly occurred during the first 60 min probably due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances with nitrogen in their composition 3 after this time the concentration of soluble organic nitrogen increased slightly suggesting that the breaking up of cells at this temperature took place slowly the final decrease observed in the soluble organic nitrogen concentrations during the last 50 min of treatment at 100 c could be explained by the hydrolysis and or oxidation of organic nitrogen to inorganic compounds regarding the inorganic nitrogen species formed the concentration of nitrogen as nitrates or nitrites species was negligible so their formation from organic nitrogen could be discarded ammonium however was the main inorganic nitrogen species generated being its concentration in the liquid phase doubled in absence of oxygen and quadrupled in its presence at the end of the hydrothermal treatments at 100 c nevertheless the effects of the atmosphere on the fate of soluble and non soluble nitrogen became evident at higher temperatures due to nitrogen speciation is attributed to oxidation reactions and the degradation of proteins 3 56 this was also in line with the absence of significant differences in the evolution of the main physicochemical parameters for those same conditions fig 1 so although increasing the temperature above 100 c involved a significant reduction in the percentage of non solubilised nitrogen in the solid sludge fraction this was more pronounced under an oxidising atmosphere and at higher temperatures as an example the nitrogen content of the non solubilised sludge fraction decreased from an initial value of 66 300 600 mg n kg dry matter to 16 000 800 or 2906 4 mg n kg dry matter after 210 min of hydrothermal treatment in absence or presence of oxygen respectively at the highest temperature 200 c moving on to soluble organic nitrogen its concentration increased during the first minutes of reaction reaching a maximum and then started to decrease this was attributed to the existence of two reactions in series the initial solubilisation of nitrogen from the solid phase of the sludge due to bacterial lysis and the subsequent degradation of the solubilised proteins with ammonium as the final product 3 it can be easily deduced from fig 2a and d that both reactions are favoured by high temperatures and or the presence of oxygen during the hydrothermal treatment which is reasonable taking into account that more aggressive conditions caused not only faster bacterial lysis but also a higher degree of denaturation and degradation of proteins with the corresponding generation of ammonium as a by product at this point it should be stressed that due to the high temperatures and the constant gas flow passing through the reaction medium ammonium was partially desorbed so its concentration was deduced from a nitrogen mass balance see fig s 4 in the supplementary material as expected the rate of formation of ammonium during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge was accelerated by employing higher temperatures and or the presence of an oxidising atmosphere which involved faster degradation of the solubilised proteins so around 47 of the initial nitrogen in the sludge was converted to ammonium after 210 min of treatment at 150 c under an inert atmosphere whereas this percentage increased to 75 or 87 if temperature was 200 c or oxygen was employed as oxidant respectively in fact under the most severe conditions 200 c and oxygen only 5 of the solubilised nitrogen remained in organic form in this specific case it is also interesting to note a gradual increase in the nitrate concentration during the hydrothermal treatment from 60 min to the end of the experiment reaching a final value of 130 mg no2 no3 kg dry matter this suggests a low degree of nitrification of ammonium which was only appreciable under the most aggressive conditions tested 200 c and with oxygen regarding the effect of the oxygen pressure on nitrogen speciation during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge see fig s 6 in the supplementary material results revealed that no significant differences were to be observed in the changes undergone by the main nitrogen species at the different pressures tested which ranged from 10 to 90 bar only a slight increase in the concentration of nitrates and nitrites concentration was observed at high oxygen pressures due to a lower solubilisation of the organic nitrogen at 10 bar therefore it can be concluded that this operational parameter is not determining during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge 3 3 effect of operational conditions on phosphorus solubilisation fig 3 shows the behaviour of solubilised phosphorus and potassium during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge at different atmospheres and temperatures their non solubilised concentrations and the mass balances before and after the treatments at different temperatures can be seen in figs s 3 and s 4 in the supplementary material before discussing the effect of operational conditions on phosphorus and potassium solubilisation it is important to note that both have been considered as inorganic nutrients in the case of phosphorus this was because sludge is mainly composed of inorganic phosphorus and its main form in solution is phosphate 58 59 when analysing the effect of temperature on phosphorus evolution as was observed for carbon and nitrogen this parameter also increased the phosphorus solubilisation rate which was to be expected due to higher cellular lysis nevertheless temperature did not have any significant effect on the maximum solubilised amount only on the time required to achieve it thus focussing on wet oxidation at 100 c the maximum concentration of soluble p was reached after 120 min with a value of 4000 400 mg p kg dry matter at 150 c this was reached after 120 min as well with a value of 5600 300 mg p kg dry matter and at 200 c after 60 min with a value of 5120 40 mg p kg dry matter these values for solubilised phosphorus corresponded to around 30 of the initial amount in the raw sludge it should be also stressed that soluble phosphorus only decreased after reaching a maximum at the highest temperature tested this was related to variation in the ph high temperatures caused faster tss reduction see fig s 2 in the supplementary material and higher initial acidification of the solution resulting in increased formation of po4 3 in the liquid phase after a while the ph increased again fig 1 and the alkaline medium favoured the binding of phosphorus with metal ions present in the solution fe ca al and its subsequent precipitation which involved a reduction in the soluble p concentration 59 regarding its evolution during thermal hydrolysis the degree of solubilisation achieved was lower in absence of oxygen thus maximum phosphorus solubilisation during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge in absence of oxygen was around 18 for all the temperatures in comparison to the 32 achieved under an oxidising atmosphere again this behaviour is closely related to the changes in ph during the hydrothermal treatment thermal hydrolysis caused lower acidification of the hydrolysed sludge leading to the formation of po4 3 in the liquid phase to a lesser extent than during wet oxidation further experiments were conducted to better understand the oxygen effect fig s 7 in the supplementary material shows the changes in soluble phosphorus during the hydrothermal treatment at different pressures it was observed that increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration produced greater solubilisation of p reaching a maximum value of 5700 600 mg p kg dry matter at 90 bar in comparison to 5600 300 mg p kg dry matter at 50 bar and 4410 40 mg p kg dry matter at 10 bar as can be seen in fig s 5 in the supplementary material the higher the pressure employed the greater was the acidification of the sample during the treatment and therefore the higher the formation of po4 3 in the liquid phase 3 4 effect of operational conditions on potassium solubilisation finally soluble potassium concentrations were also measured during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge carried out at different temperatures and atmospheres fig 3 results revealed that neither changing the temperature nor the type of atmosphere produced significant impacts on the solubilisation rate or the final soluble potassium concentration which reached a maximum of around 3100 400 mg k kg dry matter after approximately 30 min regardless of the temperature atmosphere or pressure tested see fig s 7 in the supplementary material this constant value corresponds to around 57 of the total potassium in the raw sludge and suggests that potassium was mainly associated with tightly bound eps these extracellular polymers are easily solubilised even at low temperatures explaining the increase in the soluble concentration during the first minutes of treatment when the heating up of the reactor occurred 30 60 3 5 comparison fig 4 shows the proportions of the non solubilised macroelements in the dry matter of the sludge before being treated or after 210 min of thermal hydrolysis or wet oxidation at 100 150 and 200 c as previously explained slight tss reductions were observed at the lowest experimental temperature 100 c regardless of the atmosphere selected see fig s 2 in the supplementary material at this temperature the possibility of preferential solubilisation of some elements in comparison to others could also be discarded the proportions of each element remaining approximately constant after the treatments however when the temperature was increased to 150 c or 200 c solubilisation of the sludge was clearly evident as was a decrease in the proportion of nitrogen in the non solubilised fraction in comparison to the other elements these effects were more marked under the most aggressive conditions that is to say at high temperatures and or in presence of oxygen so nitrogen represented 6 6 of the initial weight of the dried sludge but this percentage decreased to 0 3 in the non solubilised sludge fraction after wet oxidation at 200 c under the same conditions the percentages of solid carbon phosphorus and potassium changed from 34 1 1 6 and 0 4 in the raw sludge to 2 0 1 4 and 0 3 respectively after the hydrothermal treatment it is interesting to remember that these conditions also caused a 76 reduction in tss which decreased from 27 g tss kg sludge in the initial sample to 7 g tss kg sludge in the sample treated at 200 c under an oxidising atmosphere nevertheless no significant effect of the dissolved oxygen concentration on the final elemental composition of the non solubilised fraction of the sludge was observed at least over the range of pressures studied see fig s 8 in the supplementary material focusing now on the liquid phase fig 5 shows the proportions of the main elements in the liquid phases of the initial sludge and the hydrolysates obtained after 210 min of the corresponding hydrothermal treatment as might be expected a significant increase in the solubilised amount of the different elements studied was observed after the hydrothermal treatments nevertheless as has already been explained a higher temperature and or the employment of an oxidising atmosphere did not necessarily imply a higher content of these elements in the liquid phase even when these conditions improve the disintegration of the solid fraction this is due to two previously mentioned processes the formation of carbon dioxide by oxidation reactions and the precipitation of phosphorus at alkaline ph in addition an increase in the amount of inorganic nitrogen also occurred due to the degradation of organic nitrogen containing compounds into ammonium the formation of which was accelerated under the most aggressive conditions of temperature and in presence of oxygen it is interesting to stress that the corg norg p k mass ratio for the liquid phase of the raw sludge was 100 8 3 0 5 17 9 whereas this parameter after 210 min at 200 c of thermal hydrolysis was 100 0 8 0 5 1 7 or in the case of wet oxidation 100 2 7 1 6 2 4 therefore it can be concluded that at the highest temperature tested an inert atmosphere produced a decrease in either the norg corg or k corg ratios due to the faster solubilisation of carbon in comparison with the rates corresponding to the other elements moreover part of the organic nitrogen was converted into ammonium and released from the liquid medium in contrast the p corg ratio was maintained owing to their solubilisations were comparable on the other hand the oxidising atmosphere caused smaller reductions in the norg corg and k corg ratios in comparison to an inert one because a fraction of the solubilised organic carbon was oxidised to co2 nevertheless the p corg ratio increased during the wet oxidation treatment because the formation rate of co2 was higher than the precipitation rate of po4 3 nevertheless it should be remembered that the content of the four elements here discussed increased in terms of their absolute concentrations eventually as demonstrated above increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration did not produce significant impacts on the final elemental composition in the liquid phase at least over the range of pressures tested 10 90 bar see fig s 9 in the supplementary material 4 conclusions this study has provided for the first time a profound understanding of the effect of the hydrothermal treatments on the fate of the four main macronutrients c n p and k in sewage sludge which is important because this hydrolysed feedstock is of considerable interest for use as a fertiliser or as a fermentation medium regarding carbon results revealed that the oxidation reactions were negligible at 100 c but as the temperature rose the dissolved organic matter was mineralised to carbon dioxide focusing on nitrogen increasing the temperature led under both types of atmosphere to a higher degree of solubilisation of this element the effect being greater in presence of oxygen in the specific case of soluble organic nitrogen its solubilisation occurred mainly during the first minutes of treatment due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances and afterwards this organic nitrogen was degraded to ammonium especially at high temperatures and under an oxidising atmosphere with phosphorus solubilisation also occurred at the beginning of the treatments but then as the temperature increased it re precipitated in the form of po4 3 resulting in a decrease in the soluble phosphorus in addition for all the conditions tested fast initial solubilisation of potassium was observed during the first 30 min and then the soluble concentration achieved remained almost constant until the end of the experiments finally pressure did not have significant effects on the final macronutrient composition of the sludge hydrolysate over the range tested 10 90 bar declaration

13394,to enhance the removal of wastewater treatment plant effluent organic matter the electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof method for simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc was established emdof exhibited better dissolved organic matters dom removal efficiency than the electrocoagulation membrane ecm and ozonation membrane om processes under optimal operating conditions i e current density 10 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min emdof achieved dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 and color removal efficiencies of 35 22 71 48 69 44 respectively within 990 min the turbidity of the emdof effluent stabilized at 0 ntu the normalized flux j j0 of emdof was lower than that of om under the same ozone dosage but higher than that of ecm under the same current density sfc removed the sludge from the membrane surface and better eliminated the reversible membrane fouling the j j0 restored by sfc reached 90 of the preliminary stage and stabilized at 63 in the later stages scanning electron microscopy and particle size distributions showed that larger flocs and more porous cake layers formed with emdof than with ecm resulting in superior membrane fouling mitigation keywords electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation membrane fouling simultaneous filtration and cleaning advanced treatment 1 introduction the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtp represents an important resource that must undergo advanced treatment before it can be used to alleviate the water crisis due to its large amount and relatively high quality over wastewater 1 however dissolved organic matters dom in wwtp effluent poses challenges to water reclamation owing to containing hormones pharmaceuticals and personal care products that are harmful to human health and ecological security 2 3 our previous work has shown that there are synergistic effects between ozone and coagulants soc in the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation process e hoc which is effective for dom removal 4 filtration is usually needed to separate flocs from the mixture after e hoc for which membranes are one of the most effective technologies 5 6 however the high costs resulting from membrane fouling limit the widescale application of membrane filtration 7 8 some studies have demonstrated that using electrocoagulation ec as a pretreatment effectively mitigated membrane fouling 9 ec assisted membrane bioreactors electro mbrs which placed the membrane modules between the electrodes experienced a fouling rate that was 7 8 times lower than traditional mbrs due to enhanced adsorption and oxidation of foulants and compressibility of sludge 10 the similar setup but without biological oxidation referred to as an electro coagulation membrane reactor ecmr increased the porosity and polarity of the cake layer by coagulation and an applied electric field resulting in water flux of the ecmr 87 2 higher than that of ec ultrafiltration 77 8 11 another study improved the normalized water flux from 70 1 to 89 4 by substituting the al anode for an fe anode due to there being more porous al flocs in ecmr 12 in addition advanced oxidation processes aops exhibited remarkably good performance in mitigating membrane fouling when using membrane filtration ozonation and coagulation in a single reactor with a membrane filtration integrated dissolved ozone flotation mdof process the generation of hydroxyl radicals was enhanced and a thinner and more loosely structured cake layer was formed resulting in reduced membrane fouling 13 ceramic membranes cm coated with cufeo4 had lower irreversible fouling resistance compared with conventional cm created via peroxymonosulfate activation for humic acid ha treatment because such an activation changes the ha properties as well as the interactions between ha and the membrane which retained more ha particles above membrane which could be easily removed by hydraulic cleaning 14 wu et al increased the relative flux by more than 15 via an electro peroxone process wherein the membrane is fixed under the carbon cloth cathode resulting in a better performance than either single electrolysis or ozonation assisted filtration 15 normally after membrane filtration periodic physical methods e g aeration 16 relaxation 17 backwashing 18 19 or chemical methods hydrogen peroxide 20 sodium hydroxide 21 or other agents 22 are employed to clean the fouled membrane however traditional physical and chemical cleaning still disrupt the filtration process so they need to be simplified to reduce their impact on the reactor operation 23 in this study a novel process involving electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof was developed to enhance dom removal and realize simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc the optimal emdof operational conditions for organic matter removal and water flux were determined this study has provided a water treatment process with an innovative membrane cleaning method which is of great significance for improving the efficiency and applicability of membrane filtration processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the raw water used in this study came from the final sedimentation tank effluent of a wwtp in xi an china the raw water quality parameters were dissolved organic carbon doc 5 418 0 228 mg l uv254 0 085 0 001

device shown in fig 1 a the reactor was a rectangular plexiglass tank with an effective size 10 cm 8 cm 6 cm the water was supplied by peristaltic pump a magnetic stirrer ika color squid germany provided constant stirring a piece of 500 mesh stainless steel screen was adopted as the cathode and iron plate as the anode the electrodes were placed parallel to each other 2 cm apart both anode and cathode were sanded before use the experimental power supply was a regulated dc power supply wuxi anais jp5200d the ozone was supplied by ozone generator with an oxygen source jinan sankang sk cfq 3p and controlled by a gas flow meter the membrane module was the dead end membrane module shown in fig 1 b the filter membrane was a poly tetra fluoroethylene ptfe membrane with a pore size of 0 1 Î¼m chosen for its resistance to ozone 24 the above mentioned 500 mesh stainless steel screen was fixed behind the membrane and a wire was employed to connect the stainless steel cathode and the power supply the effective filtration area of the membrane was 12 cm2 a peristaltic pump was used to provide constant pressure filtration an electronic balance was set up at the output and connected to a computer to record water flux variability before the start of the experiment anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the raw water to serve as the electrolyte retaining the electrical conductivity of 9 ms cm after dissolution the raw water was fed to the reactor by a peristaltic pump after the electrode and filter membrane were flooded the dc power supply and the ozone generator were turned on and different current densities 0 5 10 or 15 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rates 0 50 100 200 or 300 ml min were instantly set the current density was calculated through the applied current and the effective area of anode according to the formula 1 a i s where a is current density i is current intensity s is effective aera of anode the current density was adjusted by changing current intensity 12 the peristaltic pump for the water outlet was then opened and the reaction was initiated the reactor was continuously stirred by magnetic stirrer at a speed of 100 r min when the effluent peristaltic pump was operating one connected membrane module was used as the filter unit and the other membrane module was connected to the power supply as the cathode unit after filtering for 90 min the single pole double throw switch and the effluent peristaltic pump were adjusted the adjustment resulted in the filter unit and the electrode unit being interchanged the action of the new electrode unit which was fouled during the previous filtering cycle also performed in situ self cleaning of the membrane in this study a single membrane was used as the research object to explore the changes in effluent water quality and membrane flux during the filtration cycling process when the aeration was turned off the ozone aeration volume was 0 ml min and the treatment process became electrocoagulation membrane ecm process when the dc power supply was turned off the current density was 0 ma cm2 and the treatment process became ozonation membrane om process when the aeration and dc power supply were turned off at the same time the raw water was directly filtered by the membrane for aeration the mixture of oxygen and ozone was employed for aeration the amount of effective ozone dosage was determined by iodine stoichiometric titration 25 the aeration rate of 50 100 200 300 ml min corresponded to the effective ozone dosage of 0 004 0 010 0 016 0 024 mg ml respectively 2 3 analytical methods the doc was measured with a tocvcph analyzer manufactured by shimadzu japan the sample was acidified with sulfuric acid and held under a pure nitrogen flow for 3 min before measurement uv254 and color were measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer after being filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m filter the turbidity was measured with the portable hanna hi93703 1 turbidity meter the conductivity was measured by a ddb 303a conductivity detector inesa shanghai analysis of membrane surface morphology was conducted using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini sem 300 particle size distributions were acquired using a microtrac sync laser particle size distribution analyzer the flux j was calculated using equation 2 j v s t where v is the volume of the collected permeate within the operation time s is the effective area of the membrane and t is the operation time 26 the initial flux j0 of the membrane was measured with deionized water while the permeate flux j was recorded continuously with raw water 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance the effect of current density and ozone aeration rate on dom removal performance was tested which was shown in fig 2 compared with ecm and om emdof provided a significant improvement in doc removal for the om process an aeration rate of 300 ml min achieved the best treatment effect with doc and uv254 removal efficiencies of 16 10 and 83 33 respectively in the ec process increasing the current density benefitted doc removal and its removal efficiency was 16 41 at 15 ma cm2 however the removal efficiency of uv254 did not increase by much as current density increased the emdof process had the best doc and uv254 removal efficiencies with a current density of 10 ma cm2 and an ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min achieving 35 22 and 71 48 removal respectively on the one hand ozone is conducive to the generation of oxidize organics from hydroxyl radicals oh 27 and it promotes the production of polymeric coagulants to improve the coagulation efficiency 28 on the other hand as the current density is increased the dissolution of the iron anode and the rate of ozone reduction at the cathode were accelerated in this way more coagulant and more oh were produced along with more bubbles which promoted the removal of organic matter by air flotation 29 32 under optimal operating conditions the doc removal efficiency in emdof was greater than the sum of ecm and om alone indicating that soc was active during the emdof process 4 when the ozone aeration rate was increased from 200 ml min to 300 ml min the doc removal efficiencies under the different current densities decreased by 3 5 excess ozone destabilized the flocs and over oxidized the macro molecular organic matter to small molecular organic matter that was difficult to remove by coagulation which reduced the doc removal efficiency 33 35 the increase of ozone aeration was conducive to the removal of color the highest removal efficiency was 69 44 demonstrating that the strong oxidizing properties of ozone can effectively remove colored groups from water this was consistent with previous research 36 37 compared with ecm the turbidity of the emdof effluent was significantly lower when the ecm process was adopted the turbidities of the effluent corresponding to the current densities of 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 and 15 ma cm2 were 34 ntu 78 ntu and 82 ntu respectively when 50 ml min ozone was introduced the turbidity at the same current densities dropped to 2 28 ntu 3 21 ntu and 5 55 ntu respectively the effluent turbidity continued to decrease as the ozone aeration rate increased eventually reaching 0 ntu the flocs formed by the ec were smaller than the membrane pores and easily passed through resulting in the ecm effluent having higher turbidity the turbidity decreased significantly when ozone was introduced which demonstrated the coagulation assisting effect that ozone has ozone promoted the aggregation of smaller flocs into larger ones that were easily intercepted by the membrane thereby reducing the turbidity of the effluent 38 with a current density of 10 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min the effluent from a single membrane module was studied and the quality of effluent over 11 working cycles is shown in fig 3 the doc in the incoming and outgoing water was about 5 3 5 5 mg l and 3 3 3 7 mg l respectively and the removal efficiency was maintained at about 35 the uv254 and color removal efficiencies were maintained at about 71 and 69 respectively the turbidity of the mixture was 400 800 ntu which was much higher than the raw water due to the abundance of flocs produced by electrocoagulation after filtration the turbidity of the effluent was 0 ntu while the turbidity was obviously different before and after filtration doc uv254 and color were not indicating that the filter membrane only plays an important role in the removal of turbidity while the removal of doc uv254 and color depended on ozone oxidation coagulation and any coupled action between them the water quality of the continuous effluent over 11 cycles did not fluctuate much indicating that emdof had a relatively stable treatment effect in addition considering the application of the emdof process energy consumption was calculated through the volume of treated wwtp effluent and the electrical energy consumption under 10 ma cm2 of current density emdof required less electrical energy 1 4 kwh m3 than a membrane electro oxidizer 7 56 kwh m3 17 more importantly emdof requiring no any energy for membrane cleaning which saved more energy for full scale application 3 2 membrane flux the membrane normalized fluxes under different operating conditions are shown in fig 4 ozone displayed a significant mitigating effect on membrane fouling the om process had ozone aeration rates of 50 ml min and 200 ml min and compared with the direct filtration current density 0 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate 0 ml min of raw water its membrane normalized flux j j0 was 22 and 68 higher respectively ozone can oxidize macromolecular organic matter in water into small molecules that easily pass through the membrane s pores resulting in low doc removal efficiency but mitigating membrane fouling 2 39 for the emdof process the improvement in membrane flux due to ozone was not obvious under a low current density 5 ma cm2 the aeration rates of 0 ml min 50 ml min and 200 ml min corresponded to j j0 values of 33 34 and 42 respectively as the current density increased the effect of ozone on the membrane flux increased an increase in aeration rate from 0 ml min to 200 ml min increased j j0 by 15 and 24 at current densities of 10 ma cm2 and 15 ma cm2 respectively this showed that emdof effectively removed organic matters through soc to reduce the internal membrane fouling at the same time the coagulation assisting effect of ozone facilitated the formation of a porous cake layer to reduce membrane fouling 13 in the ecm process the increase in current density sped up the rate of membrane fouling the times required for j j0 to drop to half under the three different current densities 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 and 15 ma cm2 were 42 min 32 min and 15 min respectively this was because more flocs formed at higher current densities 4 which accelerated membrane fouling when the ozone aeration rate was 200 ml min increases in current density had little effect on the membrane flux which further illustrated the importance of the emdof process in controlling membrane fouling while improving the efficiency of organic matter removal the sfc cleaning effect was tested at a current density of 10 ma cm2 and an ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min in this system the fouled membrane was cleaned in situ by the bubbles generated from the cathode the effects of the 10 cleaning cycles can be seen in fig 5 the j j0 was restored to 90 after the first cleaning and was about 63 after 5 cleaning cycles the degree of membrane fouling was relatively light in the preliminary stage so the in situ cleaning of the electrode membrane fouling was more effective since each subsequent filtration aggregated more membrane fouling the cleaning effect gradually decreased each cycle after five cleaning cycles the cleaning effect stabilized indicating that the irreversible membrane fouling had reached its peak after 5 cycles the in situ cleaning only removed the reversible fouling and the cleaning effect on the irreversible pollution was limited therefore j j0 could not be restored its originally high level by in situ cleaning 3 3 cake layer analysis in order to explore the effect of ozone aeration rate on the fouling layer sem and particle size distribution analyses of the fouled membrane surface were conducted after filtering for 90 min comparing the surface morphologies of emdof and ecm fig 6 emdof had an increased number of pores on the surface of the cake layer the larger number of pores maintained a good membrane flux and mitigated membrane fouling the particle size distribution of the emdof cake layer shown in fig 7 indicating that the introduction of ozone led to the formation of larger flocs when a current density of 10 ma cm2 was introduced as the aeration rate increased from 0 ml min to 200 ml min the dominant particle size of the flocs increased from 176 0 Î¼m to 248 9 Î¼m and the proportion of the dominant particles increased from 15 75 to 18 57 also the value of d50 was increased from 135 3 Î¼m to 186 4 Î¼m ozone increased the number of oxygen containing functional groups which makes it more likely they will combine with coagulant to form larger flocs 28 the formation of a fluffy cake layer on the membrane surface can function as an additional filter that alleviates membrane fouling 40 after several filtration cycles sample membranes from before and after cleaning were taken for analysis fig 8 before cleaning point 1 there was a large amount of brown sludge on the surface of the membrane made of the ferric hydroxide flocs produced by electrocoagulation with the iron anode after cleaning point 2 the sludge on the membrane surface had been mostly removed indicating that the in situ cleaning was able to effectively remove the contaminated layer from the membrane surface this was confirmed by the sem images which showed that before cleaning the membrane surface was covered by a large amount of sludge and after cleaning the sludge had been removed this result showed that in situ cleaning performed well when cleaning external membrane fouling but had a limited impact on internal membrane fouling 4 conclusion to prevent the filtering process from being interrupted frequently by the cleaning process a novel electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof process was developed and investigated for enhanced dom removal and simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc in the emdof process the removal efficiencies of doc uv254 and color from the wwtp effluent reached 35 22 71 48 and 62 38 respectively under optimal treatment conditions with a final effluent turbidity of 0 ntu the effluent quality was relatively stable during the 990 min with a current density of 10 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min at the same time emdof effectively mitigated membrane fouling and the membrane normalized flux was increased by 15 compared with ecm the sfc effect effectively cleaned the reversible pollution on the membrane the membrane normalized flux could be restored to 90 of the initial flux after multiple cycles of filtration and cleaning the membrane normalized flux remained stable at 63 declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgements this work was supported by the

13394,to enhance the removal of wastewater treatment plant effluent organic matter the electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof method for simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc was established emdof exhibited better dissolved organic matters dom removal efficiency than the electrocoagulation membrane ecm and ozonation membrane om processes under optimal operating conditions i e current density 10 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min emdof achieved dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 and color removal efficiencies of 35 22 71 48 69 44 respectively within 990 min the turbidity of the emdof effluent stabilized at 0 ntu the normalized flux j j0 of emdof was lower than that of om under the same ozone dosage but higher than that of ecm under the same current density sfc removed the sludge from the membrane surface and better eliminated the reversible membrane fouling the j j0 restored by sfc reached 90 of the preliminary stage and stabilized at 63 in the later stages scanning electron microscopy and particle size distributions showed that larger flocs and more porous cake layers formed with emdof than with ecm resulting in superior membrane fouling mitigation keywords electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation membrane fouling simultaneous filtration and cleaning advanced treatment 1 introduction the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtp represents an important resource that must undergo advanced treatment before it can be used to alleviate the water crisis due to its large amount and relatively high quality over wastewater 1 however dissolved organic matters dom in wwtp effluent poses challenges to water reclamation owing to containing hormones pharmaceuticals and personal care products that are harmful to human health and ecological security 2 3 our previous work has shown that there are synergistic effects between ozone and coagulants soc in the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation process e hoc which is effective for dom removal 4 filtration is usually needed to separate flocs from the mixture after e hoc for which membranes are one of the most effective technologies 5 6 however the high costs resulting from membrane fouling limit the widescale application of membrane filtration 7 8 some studies have demonstrated that using electrocoagulation ec as a pretreatment effectively mitigated membrane fouling 9 ec assisted membrane bioreactors electro mbrs which placed the membrane modules between the electrodes experienced a fouling rate that was 7 8 times lower than traditional mbrs due to enhanced adsorption and oxidation of foulants and compressibility of sludge 10 the similar setup but without biological oxidation referred to as an electro coagulation membrane reactor ecmr increased the porosity and polarity of the cake layer by coagulation and an applied electric field resulting in water flux of the ecmr 87 2 higher than that of ec ultrafiltration 77 8 11 another study improved the normalized water flux from 70 1 to 89 4 by substituting the al anode for an fe anode due to there being more porous al flocs in ecmr 12 in addition advanced oxidation processes aops exhibited remarkably good performance in mitigating membrane fouling when using membrane filtration ozonation and coagulation in a single reactor with a membrane filtration integrated dissolved ozone flotation mdof process the generation of hydroxyl radicals was enhanced and a thinner and more loosely structured cake layer was formed resulting in reduced membrane fouling 13 ceramic membranes cm coated with cufeo4 had lower irreversible fouling resistance compared with conventional cm created via peroxymonosulfate activation for humic acid ha treatment because such an activation changes the ha properties as well as the interactions between ha and the membrane which retained more ha particles above membrane which could be easily removed by hydraulic cleaning 14 wu et al increased the relative flux by more than 15 via an electro peroxone process wherein the membrane is fixed under the carbon cloth cathode resulting in a better performance than either single electrolysis or ozonation assisted filtration 15 normally after membrane filtration periodic physical methods e g aeration 16 relaxation 17 backwashing 18 19 or chemical methods hydrogen peroxide 20 sodium hydroxide 21 or other agents 22 are employed to clean the fouled membrane however traditional physical and chemical cleaning still disrupt the filtration process so they need to be simplified to reduce their impact on the reactor operation 23 in this study a novel process involving electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof was developed to enhance dom removal and realize simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc the optimal emdof operational conditions for organic matter removal and water flux were determined this study has provided a water treatment process with an innovative membrane cleaning method which is of great significance for improving the efficiency and applicability of membrane filtration processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the raw water used in this study came from the final sedimentation tank effluent of a wwtp in xi an china the raw water quality parameters were dissolved organic carbon doc 5 418 0 228 mg l uv254 0 085 0 001 cm 1 color 0 024 0 001 c u turbidity 1 74 0 29 ntu ph 7 36 0 18 and conductivity 0 92 ms cm 2 2 experimental setup the experiment was carried out using the electrocoagulation membrane ozone flotation device shown in fig 1 a the reactor was a rectangular plexiglass tank with an effective size 10 cm 8 cm 6 cm the water was supplied by peristaltic pump a magnetic stirrer ika color squid germany provided constant stirring a piece of 500 mesh stainless steel screen was adopted as the cathode and iron plate as the anode the electrodes were placed parallel to each other 2 cm apart both anode and cathode were sanded before use the experimental power supply was a regulated dc power supply wuxi anais jp5200d the ozone was supplied by ozone generator with an oxygen source jinan sankang sk cfq 3p and controlled by a gas flow meter the membrane module was the dead end membrane module shown in fig 1 b the filter membrane was a poly tetra fluoroethylene ptfe membrane with a pore size of 0 1 Î¼m chosen for its resistance to ozone 24 the above mentioned 500 mesh stainless steel screen was fixed behind the membrane and a wire was employed to connect the stainless steel cathode and the power supply the effective filtration area of the membrane was 12 cm2 a peristaltic pump was used to provide constant pressure filtration an electronic balance was set up at the output and connected to a computer to record water flux variability before the start of the experiment anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the raw water to serve as the electrolyte retaining the electrical conductivity of 9 ms cm after dissolution the raw water was fed to the reactor by a peristaltic pump after the electrode and filter membrane were flooded the dc power supply and the ozone generator were turned on and different current densities 0 5 10 or 15 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rates 0 50 100 200 or 300 ml min were instantly set the current density was calculated through the applied current and the effective area of anode according to the formula 1 a i s where a is current density i is current intensity s is effective aera of anode the current density was adjusted by changing current intensity 12 the peristaltic pump for the water outlet was then opened and the reaction was initiated the reactor was continuously stirred by magnetic stirrer at a speed of 100 r min when the effluent peristaltic pump was operating one connected membrane module was used as the filter unit and the other membrane module was connected to the power supply as the cathode unit after filtering for 90 min the single pole double throw switch and the effluent peristaltic pump were adjusted the adjustment resulted in the filter unit and the electrode unit being interchanged the action of the new electrode unit which was fouled during the previous filtering cycle also performed in situ self cleaning of the membrane in this study a single membrane was used as the research object to explore the changes in effluent water quality and membrane flux during the filtration cycling process when the aeration was turned off the ozone aeration volume was 0 ml min and the treatment process became electrocoagulation membrane ecm process when the dc power supply was turned off the current density was 0 ma cm2 and the treatment process became ozonation membrane om process when the aeration and dc power supply were turned off at the same time the raw water was directly filtered by the membrane for aeration the mixture of oxygen and ozone was employed for aeration the amount of effective ozone dosage was determined by iodine stoichiometric titration 25 the aeration rate of 50 100 200 300 ml min corresponded to the effective ozone dosage of 0 004 0 010 0 016 0 024 mg ml respectively 2 3 analytical methods the doc was measured with a tocvcph analyzer manufactured by shimadzu japan the sample was acidified with sulfuric acid and held under a pure nitrogen flow for 3 min before measurement uv254 and color were measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer after being filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m filter the turbidity was measured with the portable hanna hi93703 1 turbidity meter the conductivity was measured by a ddb 303a conductivity detector inesa shanghai analysis of membrane surface morphology was conducted using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini sem 300 particle size distributions were acquired using a microtrac sync laser particle size distribution analyzer the flux j was calculated using equation 2 j v s t where v is the volume of the collected permeate within the operation time s is the effective area of the membrane and t is the operation time 26 the initial flux j0 of the membrane was measured with deionized water while the permeate flux j was recorded continuously with raw water 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance the effect of current density and ozone aeration rate on dom removal performance was tested which was shown in fig 2 compared with ecm and om emdof provided a significant improvement in doc removal for the om process an aeration rate of 300 ml min achieved the best treatment effect with doc and uv254 removal efficiencies of 16 10 and 83 33 respectively in the ec process increasing the current density benefitted doc removal and its removal efficiency was 16 41 at 15 ma cm2 however the removal efficiency of uv254 did not increase by much as current density increased the emdof process had the best doc and uv254 removal efficiencies with a current density of 10 ma cm2 and an ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min achieving 35 22 and 71 48 removal respectively on the one hand ozone is conducive to the generation of oxidize organics from hydroxyl radicals oh 27 and it promotes the production of polymeric coagulants to improve the coagulation efficiency 28 on the other hand as the current density is increased the dissolution of the iron anode and the rate of ozone reduction at the cathode were accelerated in this way more coagulant and more oh were produced along with more bubbles which promoted the removal of organic matter by air flotation 29 32 under optimal operating conditions the doc removal efficiency in emdof was greater than the sum of ecm and om alone indicating that soc was active during the emdof process 4 when the ozone aeration rate was increased from 200 ml min to 300 ml min the doc removal efficiencies under the different current densities decreased by 3 5 excess ozone destabilized the flocs and over oxidized the macro molecular organic matter to small molecular organic matter that was difficult to remove by coagulation which reduced the doc removal efficiency 33 35 the increase of ozone aeration was conducive to the removal of color the highest removal efficiency was 69 44 demonstrating that the strong oxidizing properties of ozone can effectively remove colored groups from water this was consistent with previous research 36 37 compared with ecm the turbidity of the emdof effluent was significantly lower when the ecm process was adopted the turbidities of the effluent corresponding to the current densities of 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 and 15 ma cm2 were 34 ntu 78 ntu and 82 ntu respectively when 50 ml min ozone was introduced the turbidity at the same current densities dropped to 2 28 ntu 3 21 ntu and 5 55 ntu respectively the effluent turbidity continued to decrease as the ozone aeration rate increased eventually reaching 0 ntu the flocs formed by the ec were smaller than the membrane pores and easily passed through resulting in the ecm effluent having higher turbidity the turbidity decreased significantly when ozone was introduced which demonstrated the coagulation assisting effect that ozone has ozone promoted the aggregation of smaller flocs into larger ones that were easily intercepted by the membrane thereby reducing the turbidity of the effluent 38 with a current density of 10 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min the effluent from a single membrane module was studied and the quality of effluent over 11 working cycles is shown in fig 3 the doc in the incoming and outgoing water was about 5 3 5 5 mg l and 3 3 3 7 mg l respectively and the removal efficiency was maintained at about 35 the uv254 and color removal efficiencies were maintained at about 71 and 69 respectively the turbidity of the mixture was 400 800 ntu which was much higher than the raw water due to the abundance of flocs produced by electrocoagulation after filtration the turbidity of the effluent was 0 ntu while the turbidity was obviously different before and after filtration doc uv254 and color were not indicating that the filter membrane only plays an important role in the removal of turbidity while the removal of doc uv254 and color depended on ozone oxidation coagulation and any coupled action between them the water quality of the continuous effluent over 11 cycles did not fluctuate much indicating that emdof had a relatively stable treatment effect in addition considering the application of the emdof process energy consumption was calculated through the volume of treated wwtp effluent and the electrical energy consumption under 10 ma cm2 of current density emdof required less electrical energy 1 4 kwh m3 than a membrane electro oxidizer 7 56 kwh m3 17 more importantly emdof requiring no any energy for membrane cleaning which saved more energy for full scale application 3 2 membrane flux the membrane normalized fluxes under different operating conditions are shown in fig 4 ozone displayed a significant mitigating effect on membrane fouling the om process had ozone aeration rates of 50 ml min and 200 ml min and compared with the direct filtration current density 0 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate 0 ml min of raw water its membrane normalized flux j j0 was 22 and 68 higher respectively ozone can oxidize macromolecular organic matter in water into small molecules that easily pass through the membrane s pores resulting in low doc removal efficiency but mitigating membrane fouling 2 39 for the emdof process the improvement in membrane flux due to ozone was not obvious under a low current density 5 ma cm2 the aeration rates of 0 ml min 50 ml min and 200 ml min corresponded to j j0 values of 33 34 and 42 respectively as the current density increased the effect of ozone on the membrane flux increased an increase in aeration rate from 0 ml min to 200 ml min increased j j0 by 15 and 24 at current densities of 10 ma cm2 and 15 ma cm2 respectively this showed that emdof effectively removed organic matters through soc to reduce the internal membrane fouling at the same time the coagulation assisting effect of ozone facilitated the formation of a porous cake layer to reduce membrane fouling 13 in the ecm process the increase in current density sped up the rate of membrane fouling the times required for j j0 to drop to half under the three different current densities 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 and 15 ma cm2 were 42 min 32 min and 15 min respectively this was because more flocs formed at higher current densities 4 which accelerated membrane fouling when the ozone aeration rate was 200 ml min increases in current density had little effect on the membrane flux which further illustrated the importance of the emdof process in controlling membrane fouling while improving the efficiency of organic matter removal the sfc cleaning effect was tested at a current density of 10 ma cm2 and an ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min in this system the fouled membrane was cleaned in situ by the bubbles generated from the cathode the effects of the 10 cleaning cycles can be seen in fig 5 the j j0 was restored to 90 after the first cleaning and was about 63 after 5 cleaning cycles the degree of membrane fouling was relatively light in the preliminary stage so the in situ cleaning of the electrode membrane fouling was more effective since each subsequent filtration aggregated more membrane fouling the cleaning effect gradually decreased each cycle after five cleaning cycles the cleaning effect stabilized indicating that the irreversible membrane fouling had reached its peak after 5 cycles the in situ cleaning only removed the reversible fouling and the cleaning effect on the irreversible pollution was limited therefore j j0 could not be restored its originally high level by in situ cleaning 3 3 cake layer analysis in order to explore the effect of ozone aeration rate on the fouling layer sem and particle size distribution analyses of the fouled membrane surface were conducted after filtering for 90 min comparing the surface morphologies of emdof and ecm fig 6 emdof had an increased number of pores on the surface of the cake layer the larger number of pores maintained a good membrane flux and mitigated membrane fouling the particle size distribution of the emdof cake layer shown in fig 7 indicating that the introduction of ozone led to the formation of larger flocs when a current density of 10 ma cm2 was introduced as the aeration rate increased from 0 ml min to 200 ml min the dominant particle size of the flocs increased from 176 0 Î¼m to 248 9 Î¼m and the proportion of the dominant particles increased from 15 75 to 18 57 also the value of d50 was increased from 135 3 Î¼m to 186 4 Î¼m ozone increased the number of oxygen containing functional groups which makes it more likely they will combine with coagulant to form larger flocs 28 the formation of a fluffy cake layer on the membrane surface can function as an additional filter that alleviates membrane fouling 40 after several filtration cycles sample membranes from before and after cleaning were taken for analysis fig 8 before cleaning point 1 there was a large amount of brown sludge on the surface of the membrane made of the ferric hydroxide flocs produced by electrocoagulation with the iron anode after cleaning point 2 the sludge on the membrane surface had been mostly removed indicating that the in situ cleaning was able to effectively remove the contaminated layer from the membrane surface this was confirmed by the sem images which showed that before cleaning the membrane surface was covered by a large amount of sludge and after cleaning the sludge had been removed this result showed that in situ cleaning performed well when cleaning external membrane fouling but had a limited impact on internal membrane fouling 4 conclusion to prevent the filtering process from being interrupted frequently by the cleaning process a novel electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof process was developed and investigated for enhanced dom removal and simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc in the emdof process the removal efficiencies of doc uv254 and color from the wwtp effluent reached 35 22 71 48 and 62 38 respectively under optimal treatment conditions with a final effluent turbidity of 0 ntu the effluent quality was relatively stable during the 990 min with a current density of 10 ma cm2 and ozone aeration rate of 200 ml min at the same time emdof effectively mitigated membrane fouling and the membrane normalized flux was increased by 15 compared with ecm the sfc effect effectively cleaned the reversible pollution on the membrane the membrane normalized flux could be restored to 90 of the initial flux after multiple cycles of filtration and cleaning the membrane normalized flux remained stable at 63 declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgements this work was supported by the
