24690,active management of fire dependent ecosystems for specific species leads to complex tradeoffs which affect conservation outcomes to other species therefore a multi species evaluation of management actions is required habitat suitability models hsms can help in predicting the likelihood of species occurrence using corresponding environmental variables and empirical relationships that link occurrence with specific environmental conditions incorporating multiple species into hsms and relating them to habitat dynamics is crucial for ecosystems that require active management with prescribed fire to address this issue we developed multi species hsm driven within an existing population model of the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem to assess the suitability of an ecosystem given different fire management strategies and environmental conditions the population model used in this study provides spatial and temporal changes of longleaf pine hardwood habitat structure in response to fire these habitat values are used by the hsm to calculate habitat suitability for three threatened and endangered faunal species of this ecosystem which all thrive with frequent fire but have unique habitat requirements transient habitat conditions are traced to predict longleaf pine ecosystem trajectories under various management strategies thereby evaluating current land management actions such as thinning or prescribed fire frequencies we tested a suite of environmental conditions to emphasize the sensitivity of the species to different fire management actions the results of our modeling suggest that maximum suitable habitat for all three species can be achieved with fire frequency occurring at approximately once every three years the modeling results support current management actions and provide a new habitat assessment tool that incorporates ecological factors for multiple species thus providing for habitat optimization keywords habitat suitability model pou longleaf pine hardwood fire management 1 introduction assessing the status and trends of landscape scale habitat conditions is an ever pressing need for land managers to maintain a suite of ecological services and wildlife habitats fischer et al 2009 hiers et al 2012 dudney et al 2018 proper management of wildlife habitat requires models to project future habitat conditions based on current or projected management operations marzluff et al 2002 vospernik and reimoser 2008 seidl et al 2011 incorporating multi species dynamics of particular fauna into the forest fire management models is an essential step for future conservation and forest management decision making stephens et al 2019 interdisciplinary modeling approaches can offer new insights on assessing the optimal habitat conditions where multiple species co exist typically forested areas are managed for multiple species of concern but each species may respond differently to different aspects of the environment consequently management decisions that optimize for one species could have unintended negative consequences on another species hiers et al 2016 conlisk et al 2015 stephens et al 2019 as such conservation managers apply multiple species models to derive spatially explicit landscape priorities in biodiversity hotspots faleiro et al 2013 or define resilience strategies independent of species belote et al 2017 anderson et al 2016 such designs however do not link active management decisions to ecosystem dynamics where both affect species response and overall conservation success carroll et al 2015 in particular active fire management decisions are complex for multiple species and could lead to divergent conservation outcomes stephen et al 2019 the longleaf pine ecosystem pinus palustris mill is one of the most fire prone and biodiverse ecosystems in the world noss et al 2015 and the reliance on prescribed fire for its conservation provides an archetypal opportunity to address the complex interaction of management decisions and habitat suitability for multiple species as such understanding how fire management could be adapted for the conservation of biodiversity and defining future habitat variation is a critical need loudermilk et al 2016 linking both mechanistic ecosystem trajectories and species response to change is essential for the conservation of fire dependent longleaf pine hardwood ecosystems in this study we linked mechanistic ecosystem trajectories and species response by using a pre existing spatially explicit longleaf pine hardwood population model loudermilk et al 2011 and the newly developed habitat suitability model hsm for multiple species to evaluate tradeoffs in active management i e prescribed fire and timber harvest on conservation outcomes we applied our hsm to three species of concern to evaluate the long term effects of fire dynamics and management strategies more specifically our hsm explores multi species habitat suitability both through time and space representing the sensitivity of these species to fine scale changes in managed fire regimes and resulting habitat structure the main objective of this study was to evaluate different fire conditions combined with random mast scenarios on three species of interest within longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem we also tested the resilience of this ecosystem to radical management decision such as complete hardwood tree removal building knowledge of differing fire frequencies on the suitability of multiple species habitats will likely offer crucial insights into optimizing fire regimes for the maximum benefit of many endemic and endangered species in these fire dependent ecosystems 2 method 2 1 overview to assess the habitat of the three selected species in the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem we developed an hsm adapted to conditions of the forest at eglin air force base afb florida usa ensuring the persistence and well being of these species is critical to eglin s mission we selected two endangered species red cockaded woodpecker rcw leuconotropicus borealis gopher tortoise gt gopherus polyphemus and one species of special concern southern fox squirrel sfs sciurus niger from the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem to simulate habitat changes within the longleaf pine hardwood forests of eglin afb we used the existing longleaf pine hardwood model llm which incorporates tree demography plant competition fuel accumulation and general fire characteristics loudermilk et al 2011 the llm is flexible enough to examine the consequences of altering critical longleaf ecosystem processes i e the effect of forest fires on longleaf pine hardwood demography and analyzing forest structure the schematic representation of the communication between the two models is shown in fig 1 and both modeling approaches are described in detail in the sections below the configuration parameters used in the model shown in table b2 first we set up the initial distribution of the longleaf pine llp and hardwood hw trees for a given domain llm generates a random number at the beginning of each year that defines the fire frequency and seed masting cycle frequency the llm model calculates values for llp and hw tree height age and number of trees per grid cell yearly which is then passed to the hsm based on the parameters provided by the llm the hsm calculates corresponding probability of use pou for each species we utilize the notion of pou which defines the likelihood of the current habitat usage by each individual species see perkins et al 2008 we use species specific pou metrics to quantify how suitable the current year habitat is for all three species 2 2 longleaf pine hardwood model a full description of the llm model was given in loudermilk et al 2011 but here we summarized the model details required for understanding the current modeling workflow the llm is a spatially explicit longleaf pine hardwood population model that uses a lattice based approach silvertown et al 1992 where trees within raster grid cells 5 m 5 m interact with nearby cells trees based on adjacency and distance loudermilk et al 2011 spatial interactions include seed dispersal or clonal rhizomatous spreading fecundity inter and intra species plant competition impacts on growth and mortality as well as effects of tree density on fine fuel distribution and accumulation and subsequently fire severity a random number calculated at a yearly time step determines whether a fire event and a pine seed masting event occur during the reproductive stage 10 longleaf pine trees and 10 hardwood trees establish in an empty cell with individual mortality incidences causing a natural thinning effect as the cell or trees within a cell age the new trees do not start growing in a cell until all trees of a similar type die growth in height meter m occurs at the cell scale where all trees of a tree type within a cell grow and age together mortality for an individual tree could be from competition fire or other natural causes each cell in the model includes both longleaf pines and hardwoods as well as wiregrass hardwoods are purposefully generalized to represent native southern hardwoods mainly quercus spp but also diospyros spp prunus spp and sassafras spp that re sprout after fire and have similar life history traits the llm employs three mortality functions death from competition intrinsic mortality and fire each tree within a cell is evaluated individually for each of these mortality types specifically for intrinsic or other natural causes of death such as disease lightning and windthrow the llm used a size distribution of mortality rates estimated from census data platt et al 1988 and associated models of seedling mortality cropper and loudermilk 2006 loudermilk and cropper 2007 we setup llm using tested parametrization for the forest at eglin air force base afb florida usa to set up the initial tree distribution in the llm model we followed the methodology described in loudermilk et al 2011 where hws were randomly placed in 10 of the area or each grid cell at 0 5 m height and 1 year old lps were randomly placed in 20 of each gridcell at 20 m height and 100 years old we ran the llm for 200 years to allow the model to equilibrate itself using the default model setup from loudermilk et al 2011 in the equilibrium simulation we used 25 fire probability average of 4 year fire return interval through time and 15 mast probability every probability criteria in the llm model is defined as an occurrence of the given event if a randomly generated number is less than or equal to assigned criteria i e for 25 fire probability fire would occur if a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 is less than or equal to 0 25 2 3 habitat suitability model below we present a metric that we developed to assess the quality of habitat for a species within a longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem of the eglin afb developed hsm was driven by the llm fig 1 to simulate endangered species habitat over time in response to fire management at the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem for all three species of interest we used the probability of use pou number to quantify the likelihood of the current habitat usage by each species perkins et al 2008 out of the three species of interest only rcw uses habitat variables to derive the pou where habitat variables are constraints defining the habitat for a species the other two species use empirically derived relationships to calculate the respective pous a higher pou means more accommodating habitat for a species in the corresponding subsections below we describe in more detail the metric and relationships used to derive pou for every three species 2 3 1 red cockaded woodpecker suitable habitat for rcw is defined by old and large pine trees sparsely distributed over a large area not typically exceeding 80 trees per ha heppell et al 1994 walters et al 2002 at eglin afb the rcw habitat requires a pine dominated overstory but the reduced abundance of hardwoods in the canopy and midstory does not preclude suitable habitat designation when fire is excluded from longleaf pine systems hardwoods and other pine species i e sand pine pinus clausa var immuginata at eglin afb eventually replace longleaf pine as the dominant overstory species provencher et al 2001 rcw nest abandonment has been documented on multiple occasions when excessive hardwood midstory encroachment has occurred rcws may abandon their nests when midstory encroachment is within close proximity to active rcw cavity trees davenport et al 2000 walters et al 2002 that is why periodic surface fires are required to maintain an open midstory and diverse understory james et al 2001 in the llm we manipulate fire frequency via the fire probability parameter table 1 summarizes the habitat suitability parameters for rcw within the llm model realm it is important to note that each geographic location might have its own unique set of parameters e g characteristics such as tree height tree age tree density etc defining rcw habitat and may need to be adjusted accordingly table 1 serves as input for the hsm constraining rcw habitat corresponding to the eglin forest we populate suitability range and an optimal number of suitable trees n 0 representing expert knowledge columns based on published literature e g james et al 2004 mitchell et al 2006 as well as from observations from on site experts and co authors kevin hiers louise loudermilk and brett williams the n 0 r range describes the distribution of habitat suitability when an area has fewer or more than one optimal number of trees per variable from table 1 we have n 4 habitat variables all weighted equally in calculating habitat suitability and the modeling domain is divided into m subsets a subset represents a smaller area within the domain for example we divide the total area of the current domain is 25 25 cells to smaller areas of 5 5 size then we calculate a suitability score s i j for each habitat variable in each area subset the p o u r c w comprised of suitability scores of all n habitat variables and averaged over m subset areas 1 p o u r c w 1 n 1 m s i j where 2 s i j e n i n 0 i 2 2 σ i 2 here n 0 represents an optimal number of suitable trees i e a number of trees in an area that should optimally fall within the suitability range for each habitat variable n is the number provided by llm for the corresponding habitat variable σ is the variance of suitable trees s i j varies from 0 to 1 and uses normalized gaussian distribution function ngdf to produce a score defining how well is calculated by the llm habitat value match with n 0 the indexes i and j represent habitat variable and the subset of the area a respectively one can increase σ to further improve the pou if appropriate however high σ values can effectively increase suitability range leading to unconstrained high pou to constrain the suitability range within a physically reasonable range it is important to use fixed σ allowing zero ngdf values and use the suitability range to control the allowed spread around zero here we fixed σ to be equal to 2 noting this number generates a reasonable shape of the score distribution below we visualize suitability scores for n n 0 values of 1 1 and 2 each score in fig 2 corresponds to the intersection of the red line with ngdf for one of the three selected values of n n 0 s 1 s 1 0 82 and s 2 0 61 for each habitat variable from table 1 we count the number of trees that fall between the corresponding suitability range and compare this number of trees to the corresponding n 0 by changing the habitat variable constraints in table 1 we can make it more or less likely for a certain variable to get a high score in a specific landscape for example we increase the range of allowed high scores for a particular n 0 by increasing r values an area receives the highest score if the number of trees that fall within the suitability range for a specific habitat variable is an integer value between n 0 r and n 0 r taking into account that there can be multiple ideal numbers of trees for a specific variable when r does not equal 0 the distance between observed n and the set of ideal values between n 0 r and n 0 r is calculated as follows 3 d 0 i f n 0 r n n 0 r m i n n n 0 r n n 0 r o t h e r w i s e for example for the first habitat variable from table 1 we compare the number of llp trees between ages 70 and 450 in each grid subset area to n 0 of 5 where r is 1 the highest score associated with having 4 to 6 trees in the area that satisfy these age conditions fig 3 illustrates the values for r 1 using values from the previous example see fig 2 s 1 s 1 1 0 and s 2 0 88 more detailed example of the effect of the range choice on the p o u r c w can be found in appendix a 2 3 2 southern fox squirrel sfs holds a key ecological role in the longleaf pine hardwood forest ecosystem hilliard 1979 kantola and humphrey 1990 engstrom 1993 acorns and pine seeds provide a seasonal food source for the sfs while at the same time sfs plays a functional role in seedling reproduction by caching acorns and seeds in the ground kantola 1986 whitaker and hamilton 1998 natureserve 2005 it is well documented that sfss prefer open park like longleaf pine forests and avoid closed canopy hardwood forests kantola 1992 whitaker and hamilton 1998 conner et al 1999 however large individual hardwood trees are critical for loafing sites and daytime refugia as well as for nesting conner and godbois 2003 kantola 1992 complete hardwood removal especially with herbicide use therefore negatively affects sfs s optimal habitat boone et al 2017 perkins et al 2008 determined the ratio of mature pine to hardwood relative to random areas and quantified hardwood patch size and distribution within sfs home ranges this ratio of mature pine to hardwood is used to define optimal sfs habitat fig 4 to be consistent with the p o u r c w scale we normalized the original p o u s f s so that it varies from 0 to 1 in all our simulations we use normalized p o u s f s and refer to is as p o u s f s we used the mature pine to hardwood ratio to quantify the sfs habitat in the llm hsm model here we adjusted the original relationship to be consistent with the probability of habitat use relationship defined by perkins et al 2008 2 3 3 gopher tortoise gt gt requires adequate sunlight penetration for nest incubation and to permit groundcover growth of herbaceous foods auffenberg and franz 1982 reduction in sunlight on the ground restricts energy supply required for gt thermoregulation clutch development and production of food resources mcrae et al 1981 boglioli et al 2000 periodic fire to maintain suitable vegetation structure and plant species composition is required to maintain gt habitat increasing canopy cover and density of hardwoods lead to declining habitat quality for the gopher tortoise aresco and guyer 1999 mccoy et al 2006 yager et al 2007 catano et al 2014 used lidar to study gt habitat and derived the functional relationship between canopy cover and burrow abandonment at wekiwa springs state park wssp in central florida usa in this study we adopted that relationship with slight modification by changing the abandonment relationship to the pou to be consistent with the previous metric see fig 5 similarly to the p o u s f s we normalized the original p o u g t such it varies from 0 to 1 in all our simulations we use normalized p o u g t and refer to is as p o u g t both sfs and gt relationships utilize ngdf formulation with the corresponding modifications we use the total area of 15 15m2 to calculate the percent canopy in the hsm we count the number of empty gridcells within the 3 3 area the cell is empty if there are no trees greater than 1 m height within a given gridcell the canopy area is calculated by dividing a number of non empty cells over the total number of gridcells within the 3 3 area 2 4 simulation scenario design we varied the fire and seed masting probabilities to address the sensitivity of each species to different habitat trajectories as such we ran the llm hsm model using six fire scenarios 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 and four mast scenarios 0 15 30 45 we assessed the ensemble simulations and output longleaf pine and hardwood distributions over a 200 year period after the llm equilibrium phase see section 2 1 to identify the optimal long term management strategy we averaged simulated pou trajectories over the entire simulation period to promote rcw population survival and to represent a common management strategy in rcw management we applied the enforced hardwood tree removal scenario hiers et al 2014 we choose two fire management scenarios 30 and 50 fire probability corresponding to the 15 masting scenario we tested 30 fire probability because it is the lowest fire management scenario that corresponds to the close to optimal condition for maintaining healthy longleaf pine hardwood forest loudermilk et al 2011 the 50 fire probability was chosen as a more active management strategy we remove all hardwood trees from the domain for the first ten years and then let them respond using different regeneration resprouting scenarios 1 5 and default 10 correspondingly within a cell area here we tested the resilience of the hardwood trees to re establish themselves by using these different resprouting scenarios assuming natural resprouting after the 10 year time interval although the low resprouting scenario 1 is unlikely in reality due to the extent of hardwoods in most xeric longleaf pine ecosystems it represents a range of hardwood resiliency in a prescribed fire program 3 results 3 1 llm hsm scale and parameter sensitivities the model successfully captured nuanced habitat preferences of all species and showed divergent responses to simulated ecosystem processes of longleaf pine masting and changes in fire frequency through 24 different permutation scenarios of fire frequencies 6 and mast frequencies 4 we found that pous trajectories are less sensitive to changes in mast frequencies and more sensitive to changes in fire frequencies the number of average runs per scenario is described in appendix b not surprisingly the scenario with 0 fire probability no fires over 200 years resulted in equally unsuitable conditions for all species fig 6 a 10 fire probability was enough to rescue gt from a negatively trending pou relative to the total fire exclusion case but rcw and sfs still showed a negative trend over the 200 year span the low likelihood of fire events was negatively affecting pou in a cumulative fashion by allowing the accumulation of hardwood trees which were less preferred by rcw the remaining fire probability scenarios 10 showed improved habitat conditions for all species the p o u r c w stopped having a strong decreasing trend with fire probability of greater than 20 whereas the p o u s f s only stopped having a strong decreasing trend with fire probability of greater than 30 if masting was at higher levels fig 6 the sfs and gt time series showed larger amplitude oscillations likely because rcw was a mean of four factors to summarize the pou for each species we averaged the pous over the simulated time period and plotted the results in the form of a matrix table shown in fig 7 the matrix table shows that total fire exclusion for 200 years dramatically decreases pou relative to even a 20 fire probability scenario for all three species the p o u r c w only ranges from 0 6 to 0 72 for the fire probabilities of 20 to 50 which makes it less sensitive to changes in fire probability after at least 20 fire probability while the average pou sharply increases for both gt and rcw from the fire exclusion 0 case to the minimal fire probability 10 case sfs average pou sharply increases from the 10 to the 20 fire probability this suggests that the least amount of effort to apply fire is insufficient to increase the average pou for all three species simultaneously the average p o u r c w increases with more frequent fires as well as p o u g t the p o u s f s consistently showed that sfs habitat suitability is at its maximum in the 30 fire scenario summarizing results from fig 7 we conclude that 30 fire probability is the lowest prescribed fire management level at which all 3 species have close to maximum pou for the scenarios we simulated in addition we ran similar scenarios for different domain sizes 15 15 and 50 50 gridcells correspondingly using the same habitat variable setup we found that pous do not depend on the domain size for this hsm approach this result affirms that even when modeling smaller domain sizes we are averaging sufficient gridcells to capture similar tree demography that drives pou for each species 3 2 hardwood removal case the hardwood removal experiment showed the high resiliency of the longleaf pine hardwood forest but also showed that this management strategy could be harmful for sfs habitat while hardwoods were able to recover even under 1 regeneration scenario and 30 fire probability fig 8 hardwoods struggled to reach maturity for the scenario with sprout area equal to 1 thus given their reliance on isolated canopy hardwoods p o u s f s was relatively low compared to p o u r c w for much of the simulation time in the 50 fire scenario even in the 30 fire scenario the p o u s f s oscillated to low values sometime for several consecutive years hardwood tree removal improves p o u r c w over first 20 years since it takes 10 years for the hardwoods to reach the midstory in the llm demographic model the p o u s f s increases as soon as hardwoods reach their maturity 10 yrs old in all cases shown on fig 8 the average p o u r c w varies from 0 6 to 0 65 which is less than p o u r c w for the similar mast probability 15 this numerical experiment indicated that if the habitat is poor enough for sfs in years with low population numbers this could increase the danger of local sfs extinction unless nearby habitat with greater hardwood abundance was available for immigration these simulations suggest that hardwood tree removal is not an effective management strategy for multi species optimization not just because it creates unfavorable conditions for sfs but it is also less optimal for the rcw in comparison to the similar cases without hardwood removal 4 discussion balancing the habitat needs of multiple species will be critical for sustaining resilient ecosystems and biodiversity in a rapidly changing future hiers et al 2016 particularly where managed fire regimes can produce unintended conservation outcomes the modeling framework developed in this study shows how the population model of the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem of the southeastern u s can be linked with a multiple species habitat model to assess the long term effect of the different fire management strategies our modeling approach offers realistic and nuanced tradeoffs between practical fire management strategies and habitat suitability for the three species of conservation concern fig 7 for example at 30 fire probability average p o u r c w is near its maximum and average p o u s f s is at its maximum but average p o u g t is much lower than its maximum across all masting scenarios on the other hand at 50 fire probability average p o u g t and average p o u r c w are at their maxima for most masting scenarios but average p o u s f s is much lower than its maximum across all masting scenarios our results suggest that the habitat is more suitable for 2 out of the 3 species in different combinations for 30 and 50 fire probabilities these model outputs could allow managers to more objectively evaluate management strategies such as whether umbrella species conservation simberloff 1998 can sustain other rare taxa in the llm longleaf competition was directly impacted by tree size within the cell and its neighboring trees more explicitly the competition index parameter was a function of tree heights of both tree types that are larger than itself found in immediately adjacent cells and was calibrated with literature values in the original model similar approaches have been used successfully in lattice type models to represent neighborhood plant competition drake and weishampel 2001 there are however space partitioning models where each individual tree has an area associated with it and depends on the number of trees around it and the distance to those neighboring trees e g liao et al 2013 as fire is the main driver of tree species dynamics in the llm and this ecosystem refining these competition parameters would likely be unnecessary we used two approaches to define species habitat habitat suitability parameters table 1 and empirically derived relationships the empirical approach does not have much flexibility and should be used as a rule for example we cannot relax empirical relations in p o u s f s or p o u g t like we did in the habitat suitability parameters for the rcw approach by adjusting the r value the habitat suitability parameters approach is more flexible and can be adjusted based on prior knowledge about species habitat preferences reflecting the utility and relative simplicity of this approach table 1 collecting corresponding species data in the form of the habitat variable table applied to the corresponding ecosystem can simplify and standardize hsm data preparation and diversify the number of species that can be tested by the coupled model to better understand each of the habitat suitability parameter responses to pou it is important to run multiple scenarios to ensure that any divergence of the multiple solutions is well understood we do not consider the spatial fire structure in the llm model in the current version of the llm model fire acts on the entire domain consuming all the fuels in the cell which is a safe assumption given that the vast majority of fire in the ecosystem uses prescribed burning to achieve these objectives more explicitly incorporating spatially structured fire would largely be through the addition of unconsumed fuel patches which would lead to more heterogeneous probability use numbers however that should not have a major impact on our pou because it is an average over a number of subsets m see eq 1 to study the effect of the spatial fire disturbance it could be useful to split the domain on several study areas and calculate pous for the corresponding areas which could be the topic of future modeling and was noted within the original model manuscript our modeling framework illustrates both the nuanced sensitivity of different co existing species to habitat conditions that are controlled by small changes to a fire regime but also allows for flexibility in management decision space for example if the goal is to sustain the average p o u g t but resources e g time personnel etc are limiting fire probability as low as 10 could be used for a time without compromising objectives however such strategy would be insufficient for avoiding an p o u s f s decline figs 7 and 8 notwithstanding negative impacts on floral diversity or creating critical fuel conditions kirkman et al 2004 when all three species are taken into consideration a fire probability of at least 30 would result in non declining trends for pou for all three species this methodology can augment a cost benefit analysis of increasing fire frequency by comparing the species pou cost of decreasing fire frequency against the logistical cost of increasing fire frequency if logistical costs led to a push for decreased fire frequency models of this hsm type could demonstrate the tradeoff of which species would see a corresponding decline in habitat usage even if other species were able to sustain stable pou the llm hsm only evaluates the suitability of the condition for each species independently the interaction between species is likely minimal and indirect but would require coupling with a separate model and beyond the scope of the current study in this study simulated p o u r c w compares well with the habitat preferences reported in empirical studies allowing for exploration of realistic management decisions on multispecies conservation james et al 2004 study which suggested a high frequency fire regime is required for maintenance of optimal rcw habitat in addition the hardwood thinning experiment modeled here is relevant to real management strategies such james et al 2004 recommendation for hardwood thinning when their density increased to 30 within a given area this stands in contrast to boone et al 2017 who showed that sfs occurrence is positively correlated with hardwood densities when evaluating prescribed fire and herbicide application treatments although in our simulation we do not directly report hardwood densities simulated high p o u s f s values are partially driven with a higher number of hardwood trees through the llm demographic modeling when considering species tradeoffs of management the documented benefit to rcw boone et al 2017 was countered over the long run by a negative impact on sfs through the loss of hardwoods fig 8 our results showed that certain fire return intervals result in presence of hardwoods that would maintain quality habitat for the sfs and should not hinder habitat conditions for the rcw and gt controlled presence of hardwoods has a positive feedback on sfs no adverse effects on the other two species and also has been found to provide resilience to longleaf pine regeneration following canopy loss through facilitation effects loudermilk et al 2016 it is expected that even the best fire management strategies can be interrupted with abrupt changes in climate such as hurricanes and floods further work for modeling multi species response to fire management will need to incorporate the impact of extreme climate events into hsm using managed disturbance regimes to influence habitat suitability could serve as an effective tool for defining patterns in habitat trajectory the coupled llm hsm model used in this study shows the opportunity to gain further understanding between long term interactions between species habitat quality and management while additional species habitat interaction data could increase hsm fidelity the nuanced differences in habitat preferences for these three well studied species contain sufficient detail to capture divergent needs over longer time frames than management plans typically consider when focusing on one species 5 conclusion developed in this study hsm uses two approaches to define species habitat habitat suitability parameters p o u r c w and empirically derived relationships p o u s f s and p o u g t collecting corresponding species data in the form of the habitat suitability parameters applied to the corresponding ecosystem in our case longleaf pine hardwood forest can standardize hsm data preparation in addition studies that address relationships between faunal species and longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem might diversify the number of species that can be tested within this modeling framework multi species modeling studies are important for understanding the interaction between desired habitat conditions and management activities through time by considering multiple species land managers can optimize managed disturbance regimes to promote a range of habitat conditions that collectively favor many species of concern the tradeoffs seen in these three species which all live and thrive in the frequently burned longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern u s are subtle but important considerations for active conservation management our approach offers a new tool that can provide a realistic assessment of the effectiveness and tradeoffs of conservation strategies either as a species based evaluation of species independent resilience planning anderson et al 2016 or as a tool to adjust management to optimize as many keystone and foundational species as possible in a rapidly changing future the relevance of any rule based habitat model is expected to decrease as climate change alters forest processes over longer time periods future efforts to understand species response could also benefit from linking hsms to predictive ecosystem process based models that account for potential climate driven changes in habitat trajectories this work is a critical first step towards understanding the complex interactions of fire frequency and

a the effect of range on p o u r c w the range of suitable trees parameter table 1 allows flexibility in the rcw s choice of habitat typically in nature there exists a variability or distribution of values defining a given species preferred habitat the rcw literature varies in recommendations concerning a range of old growth tree densities that could be considered suitable and optimal habitat james et al 2004 mitchell et al 2006 since we fix the distribution term in the hsm model we allow flexibility by changing the range value we ran the llm hsm for three different range values 0 1 and 2 to demonstrate the effect of r fig a1 illustrates a spatial snapshot of longleaf pine and hardwood total tree count and tree age distribution corresponding to a transient run with the default fire 25 and mast probabilities 15 this snapshot corresponds to the last year of the simulation the white dotted lines indicate the boundaries of subsets area this fire probability and mast probability scenario resulted in an abundant longleaf pine population and inter mixed re sprouting hardwoods the high number of trees per cell in figure a1a and a1b indicates that those cells correspond to young trees less than 10 yr old low nonzero tree count in a cell indicate mature trees typically the older the tree gets the fewer trees tend to occupy the same cell this can be seen from figure a1c and a1d where older trees correspond to the cells with one or two trees per cell the low abundance of the hardwood in this run was expected due to the selected fire scenario the hardwood tree count shown in figure a1b is one of the random combinations which is not necessarily representative for other similar runs due to the stochasticity of the llm model to illustrate the effect of r choice on the p o u r c w we use the same random number series for all three different r runs fig a2 shows the total simulated tree count and total number of the mature trees i e trees older than 10 years for longleaf pine and hardwood respectively spikes in longleaf pine older than 10 years correspond with dips in the total longleaf pine population because older longleaf pine outcompete smaller younger trees and tend to have fewer neighboring trees the corresponding tree count time series for both longleaf pine and hardwood displays the sudden decreases during fire years and sudden spikes during successful recruitment events additional sudden spikes in the total longleaf pine population indicate when a cohort of trees reaches maturity similarly the sudden reduction in the hardwood counts corresponds to fire years whereas sudden increase in tree population suggests new tree recruitment figure a2b represents p o u r c w dynamics for three different range values the r 0 has the lowest p o u r c w because it is unlikely that the tree distributions from the llm model will have exactly the mean preferred number of trees falling within the suitability range for each of the four habitat variables from table 1 on any given year for high values of r we expect p o u r c w to approach 1 corresponding to an rcw population that is highly insensitive to the values of the habitat variables in the table 1 increasing r improves the p o u r c w by allowing wider variability range for the rcw habitat variables in all our simulation presented in this study we choose r 1 corresponding to an intermediate level of rcw flexibility with respect to habitat variable values appendix b determining number runs per scenario to identify the trajectories of the species habitat over time we averaged multiple runs simulated with the same fire and mast probabilities since here we were interested in the trajectories rather than spread we identified the optimal number of runs required to produce those trajectories we ran the model 100 times see fig b1 a and then averaged across all runs 50 runs and 5 runs it can be seen from fig b1b that the trajectories averaged over five runs compare well with average trajectories over a hundred runs in addition averaging over only five runs allowed a significant reduction in computation time table b1 
24690,active management of fire dependent ecosystems for specific species leads to complex tradeoffs which affect conservation outcomes to other species therefore a multi species evaluation of management actions is required habitat suitability models hsms can help in predicting the likelihood of species occurrence using corresponding environmental variables and empirical relationships that link occurrence with specific environmental conditions incorporating multiple species into hsms and relating them to habitat dynamics is crucial for ecosystems that require active management with prescribed fire to address this issue we developed multi species hsm driven within an existing population model of the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem to assess the suitability of an ecosystem given different fire management strategies and environmental conditions the population model used in this study provides spatial and temporal changes of longleaf pine hardwood habitat structure in response to fire these habitat values are used by the hsm to calculate habitat suitability for three threatened and endangered faunal species of this ecosystem which all thrive with frequent fire but have unique habitat requirements transient habitat conditions are traced to predict longleaf pine ecosystem trajectories under various management strategies thereby evaluating current land management actions such as thinning or prescribed fire frequencies we tested a suite of environmental conditions to emphasize the sensitivity of the species to different fire management actions the results of our modeling suggest that maximum suitable habitat for all three species can be achieved with fire frequency occurring at approximately once every three years the modeling results support current management actions and provide a new habitat assessment tool that incorporates ecological factors for multiple species thus providing for habitat optimization keywords habitat suitability model pou longleaf pine hardwood fire management 1 introduction assessing the status and trends of landscape scale habitat conditions is an ever pressing need for land managers to maintain a suite of ecological services and wildlife habitats fischer et al 2009 hiers et al 2012 dudney et al 2018 proper management of wildlife habitat requires models to project future habitat conditions based on current or projected management operations marzluff et al 2002 vospernik and reimoser 2008 seidl et al 2011 incorporating multi species dynamics of particular fauna into the forest fire management models is an essential step for future conservation and forest management decision making stephens et al 2019 interdisciplinary modeling approaches can offer new insights on assessing the optimal habitat conditions where multiple species co exist typically forested areas are managed for multiple species of concern but each species may respond differently to different aspects of the environment consequently management decisions that optimize for one species could have unintended negative consequences on another species hiers et al 2016 conlisk et al 2015 stephens et al 2019 as such conservation managers apply multiple species models to derive spatially explicit landscape priorities in biodiversity hotspots faleiro et al 2013 or define resilience strategies independent of species belote et al 2017 anderson et al 2016 such designs however do not link active management decisions to ecosystem dynamics where both affect species response and overall conservation success carroll et al 2015 in particular active fire management decisions are complex for multiple species and could lead to divergent conservation outcomes stephen et al 2019 the longleaf pine ecosystem pinus palustris mill is one of the most fire prone and biodiverse ecosystems in the world noss et al 2015 and the reliance on prescribed fire for its conservation provides an archetypal opportunity to address the complex interaction of management decisions and habitat suitability for multiple species as such understanding how fire management could be adapted for the conservation of biodiversity and defining future habitat variation is a critical need loudermilk et al 2016 linking both mechanistic ecosystem trajectories and species response to change is essential for the conservation of fire dependent longleaf pine hardwood ecosystems in this study we linked mechanistic ecosystem trajectories and species response by using a pre existing spatially explicit longleaf pine hardwood population model loudermilk et al 2011 and the newly developed habitat suitability model hsm for multiple species to evaluate tradeoffs in active management i e prescribed fire and timber harvest on conservation outcomes we applied our hsm to three species of concern to evaluate the long term effects of fire dynamics and management strategies more specifically our hsm explores multi species habitat suitability both through time and space representing the sensitivity of these species to fine scale changes in managed fire regimes and resulting habitat structure the main objective of this study was to evaluate different fire conditions combined with random mast scenarios on three species of interest within longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem we also tested the resilience of this ecosystem to radical management decision such as complete hardwood tree removal building knowledge of differing fire frequencies on the suitability of multiple species habitats will likely offer crucial insights into optimizing fire regimes for the maximum benefit of many endemic and endangered species in these fire dependent ecosystems 2 method 2 1 overview to assess the habitat of the three selected species in the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem we developed an hsm adapted to conditions of the forest at eglin air force base afb florida usa ensuring the persistence and well being of these species is critical to eglin s mission we selected two endangered species red cockaded woodpecker rcw leuconotropicus borealis gopher tortoise gt gopherus polyphemus and one species of special concern southern fox squirrel sfs sciurus niger from the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem to simulate habitat changes within the longleaf pine hardwood forests of eglin afb we used the existing longleaf pine hardwood model llm which incorporates tree demography plant competition fuel accumulation and general fire characteristics loudermilk et al 2011 the llm is flexible enough to examine the consequences of altering critical longleaf ecosystem processes i e the effect of forest fires on longleaf pine hardwood demography and analyzing forest structure the schematic representation of the communication between the two models is shown in fig 1 and both modeling approaches are described in detail in the sections below the configuration parameters used in the model shown in table b2 first we set up the initial distribution of the longleaf pine llp and hardwood hw trees for a given domain llm generates a random number at the beginning of each year that defines the fire frequency and seed masting cycle frequency the llm model calculates values for llp and hw tree height age and number of trees per grid cell yearly which is then passed to the hsm based on the parameters provided by the llm the hsm calculates corresponding probability of use pou for each species we utilize the notion of pou which defines the likelihood of the current habitat usage by each individual species see perkins et al 2008 we use species specific pou metrics to quantify how suitable the current year habitat is for all three species 2 2 longleaf pine hardwood model a full description of the llm model was given in loudermilk et al 2011 but here we summarized the model details required for understanding the current modeling workflow the llm is a spatially explicit longleaf pine hardwood population model that uses a lattice based approach silvertown et al 1992 where trees within raster grid cells 5 m 5 m interact with nearby cells trees based on adjacency and distance loudermilk et al 2011 spatial interactions include seed dispersal or clonal rhizomatous spreading fecundity inter and intra species plant competition impacts on growth and mortality as well as effects of tree density on fine fuel distribution and accumulation and subsequently fire severity a random number calculated at a yearly time step determines whether a fire event and a pine seed masting event occur during the reproductive stage 10 longleaf pine trees and 10 hardwood trees establish in an empty cell with individual mortality incidences causing a natural thinning effect as the cell or trees within a cell age the new trees do not start growing in a cell until all trees of a similar type die growth in height meter m occurs at the cell scale where all trees of a tree type within a cell grow and age together mortality for an individual tree could be from competition fire or other natural causes each cell in the model includes both longleaf pines and hardwoods as well as wiregrass hardwoods are purposefully generalized to represent native southern hardwoods mainly quercus spp but also diospyros spp prunus spp and sassafras spp that re sprout after fire and have similar life history traits the llm employs three mortality functions death from competition intrinsic mortality and fire each tree within a cell is evaluated individually for each of these mortality types specifically for intrinsic or other natural causes of death such as disease lightning and windthrow the llm used a size distribution of mortality rates estimated from census data platt et al 1988 and associated models of seedling mortality cropper and loudermilk 2006 loudermilk and cropper 2007 we setup llm using tested parametrization for the forest at eglin air force base afb florida usa to set up the initial tree distribution in the llm model we followed the methodology described in loudermilk et al 2011 where hws were randomly placed in 10 of the area or each grid cell at 0 5 m height and 1 year old lps were randomly placed in 20 of each gridcell at 20 m height and 100 years old we ran the llm for 200 years to allow the model to equilibrate itself using the default model setup from loudermilk et al 2011 in the equilibrium simulation we used 25 fire probability average of 4 year fire return interval through time and 15 mast probability every probability criteria in the llm model is defined as an occurrence of the given event if a randomly generated number is less than or equal to assigned criteria i e for 25 fire probability fire would occur if a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 is less than or equal to 0 25 2 3 habitat suitability model below we present a metric that we developed to assess the quality of habitat for a species within a longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem of the eglin afb developed hsm was driven by the llm fig 1 to simulate endangered species habitat over time in response to fire management at the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem for all three species of interest we used the probability of use pou number to quantify the likelihood of the current habitat usage by each species perkins et al 2008 out of the three species of interest only rcw uses habitat variables to derive the pou where habitat variables are constraints defining the habitat for a species the other two species use empirically derived relationships to calculate the respective pous a higher pou means more accommodating habitat for a species in the corresponding subsections below we describe in more detail the metric and relationships used to derive pou for every three species 2 3 1 red cockaded woodpecker suitable habitat for rcw is defined by old and large pine trees sparsely distributed over a large area not typically exceeding 80 trees per ha heppell et al 1994 walters et al 2002 at eglin afb the rcw habitat requires a pine dominated overstory but the reduced abundance of hardwoods in the canopy and midstory does not preclude suitable habitat designation when fire is excluded from longleaf pine systems hardwoods and other pine species i e sand pine pinus clausa var immuginata at eglin afb eventually replace longleaf pine as the dominant overstory species provencher et al 2001 rcw nest abandonment has been documented on multiple occasions when excessive hardwood midstory encroachment has occurred rcws may abandon their nests when midstory encroachment is within close proximity to active rcw cavity trees davenport et al 2000 walters et al 2002 that is why periodic surface fires are required to maintain an open midstory and diverse understory james et al 2001 in the llm we manipulate fire frequency via the fire probability parameter table 1 summarizes the habitat suitability parameters for rcw within the llm model realm it is important to note that each geographic location might have its own unique set of parameters e g characteristics such as tree height tree age tree density etc defining rcw habitat and may need to be adjusted accordingly table 1 serves as input for the hsm constraining rcw habitat corresponding to the eglin forest we populate suitability range and an optimal number of suitable trees n 0 representing expert knowledge columns based on published literature e g james et al 2004 mitchell et al 2006 as well as from observations from on site experts and co authors kevin hiers louise loudermilk and brett williams the n 0 r range describes the distribution of habitat suitability when an area has fewer or more than one optimal number of trees per variable from table 1 we have n 4 habitat variables all weighted equally in calculating habitat suitability and the modeling domain is divided into m subsets a subset represents a smaller area within the domain for example we divide the total area of the current domain is 25 25 cells to smaller areas of 5 5 size then we calculate a suitability score s i j for each habitat variable in each area subset the p o u r c w comprised of suitability scores of all n habitat variables and averaged over m subset areas 1 p o u r c w 1 n 1 m s i j where 2 s i j e n i n 0 i 2 2 σ i 2 here n 0 represents an optimal number of suitable trees i e a number of trees in an area that should optimally fall within the suitability range for each habitat variable n is the number provided by llm for the corresponding habitat variable σ is the variance of suitable trees s i j varies from 0 to 1 and uses normalized gaussian distribution function ngdf to produce a score defining how well is calculated by the llm habitat value match with n 0 the indexes i and j represent habitat variable and the subset of the area a respectively one can increase σ to further improve the pou if appropriate however high σ values can effectively increase suitability range leading to unconstrained high pou to constrain the suitability range within a physically reasonable range it is important to use fixed σ allowing zero ngdf values and use the suitability range to control the allowed spread around zero here we fixed σ to be equal to 2 noting this number generates a reasonable shape of the score distribution below we visualize suitability scores for n n 0 values of 1 1 and 2 each score in fig 2 corresponds to the intersection of the red line with ngdf for one of the three selected values of n n 0 s 1 s 1 0 82 and s 2 0 61 for each habitat variable from table 1 we count the number of trees that fall between the corresponding suitability range and compare this number of trees to the corresponding n 0 by changing the habitat variable constraints in table 1 we can make it more or less likely for a certain variable to get a high score in a specific landscape for example we increase the range of allowed high scores for a particular n 0 by increasing r values an area receives the highest score if the number of trees that fall within the suitability range for a specific habitat variable is an integer value between n 0 r and n 0 r taking into account that there can be multiple ideal numbers of trees for a specific variable when r does not equal 0 the distance between observed n and the set of ideal values between n 0 r and n 0 r is calculated as follows 3 d 0 i f n 0 r n n 0 r m i n n n 0 r n n 0 r o t h e r w i s e for example for the first habitat variable from table 1 we compare the number of llp trees between ages 70 and 450 in each grid subset area to n 0 of 5 where r is 1 the highest score associated with having 4 to 6 trees in the area that satisfy these age conditions fig 3 illustrates the values for r 1 using values from the previous example see fig 2 s 1 s 1 1 0 and s 2 0 88 more detailed example of the effect of the range choice on the p o u r c w can be found in appendix a 2 3 2 southern fox squirrel sfs holds a key ecological role in the longleaf pine hardwood forest ecosystem hilliard 1979 kantola and humphrey 1990 engstrom 1993 acorns and pine seeds provide a seasonal food source for the sfs while at the same time sfs plays a functional role in seedling reproduction by caching acorns and seeds in the ground kantola 1986 whitaker and hamilton 1998 natureserve 2005 it is well documented that sfss prefer open park like longleaf pine forests and avoid closed canopy hardwood forests kantola 1992 whitaker and hamilton 1998 conner et al 1999 however large individual hardwood trees are critical for loafing sites and daytime refugia as well as for nesting conner and godbois 2003 kantola 1992 complete hardwood removal especially with herbicide use therefore negatively affects sfs s optimal habitat boone et al 2017 perkins et al 2008 determined the ratio of mature pine to hardwood relative to random areas and quantified hardwood patch size and distribution within sfs home ranges this ratio of mature pine to hardwood is used to define optimal sfs habitat fig 4 to be consistent with the p o u r c w scale we normalized the original p o u s f s so that it varies from 0 to 1 in all our simulations we use normalized p o u s f s and refer to is as p o u s f s we used the mature pine to hardwood ratio to quantify the sfs habitat in the llm hsm model here we adjusted the original relationship to be consistent with the probability of habitat use relationship defined by perkins et al 2008 2 3 3 gopher tortoise gt gt requires adequate sunlight penetration for nest incubation and to permit groundcover growth of herbaceous foods auffenberg and franz 1982 reduction in sunlight on the ground restricts energy supply required for gt thermoregulation clutch development and production of food resources mcrae et al 1981 boglioli et al 2000 periodic fire to maintain suitable vegetation structure and plant species composition is required to maintain gt habitat increasing canopy cover and density of hardwoods lead to declining habitat quality for the gopher tortoise aresco and guyer 1999 mccoy et al 2006 yager et al 2007 catano et al 2014 used lidar to study gt habitat and derived the functional relationship between canopy cover and burrow abandonment at wekiwa springs state park wssp in central florida usa in this study we adopted that relationship with slight modification by changing the abandonment relationship to the pou to be consistent with the previous metric see fig 5 similarly to the p o u s f s we normalized the original p o u g t such it varies from 0 to 1 in all our simulations we use normalized p o u g t and refer to is as p o u g t both sfs and gt relationships utilize ngdf formulation with the corresponding modifications we use the total area of 15 15m2 to calculate the percent canopy in the hsm we count the number of empty gridcells within the 3 3 area the cell is empty if there are no trees greater than 1 m height within a given gridcell the canopy area is calculated by dividing a number of non empty cells over the total number of gridcells within the 3 3 area 2 4 simulation scenario design we varied the fire and seed masting probabilities to address the sensitivity of each species to different habitat trajectories as such we ran the llm hsm model using six fire scenarios 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 and four mast scenarios 0 15 30 45 we assessed the ensemble simulations and output longleaf pine and hardwood distributions over a 200 year period after the llm equilibrium phase see section 2 1 to identify the optimal long term management strategy we averaged simulated pou trajectories over the entire simulation period to promote rcw population survival and to represent a common management strategy in rcw management we applied the enforced hardwood tree removal scenario hiers et al 2014 we choose two fire management scenarios 30 and 50 fire probability corresponding to the 15 masting scenario we tested 30 fire probability because it is the lowest fire management scenario that corresponds to the close to optimal condition for maintaining healthy longleaf pine hardwood forest loudermilk et al 2011 the 50 fire probability was chosen as a more active management strategy we remove all hardwood trees from the domain for the first ten years and then let them respond using different regeneration resprouting scenarios 1 5 and default 10 correspondingly within a cell area here we tested the resilience of the hardwood trees to re establish themselves by using these different resprouting scenarios assuming natural resprouting after the 10 year time interval although the low resprouting scenario 1 is unlikely in reality due to the extent of hardwoods in most xeric longleaf pine ecosystems it represents a range of hardwood resiliency in a prescribed fire program 3 results 3 1 llm hsm scale and parameter sensitivities the model successfully captured nuanced habitat preferences of all species and showed divergent responses to simulated ecosystem processes of longleaf pine masting and changes in fire frequency through 24 different permutation scenarios of fire frequencies 6 and mast frequencies 4 we found that pous trajectories are less sensitive to changes in mast frequencies and more sensitive to changes in fire frequencies the number of average runs per scenario is described in appendix b not surprisingly the scenario with 0 fire probability no fires over 200 years resulted in equally unsuitable conditions for all species fig 6 a 10 fire probability was enough to rescue gt from a negatively trending pou relative to the total fire exclusion case but rcw and sfs still showed a negative trend over the 200 year span the low likelihood of fire events was negatively affecting pou in a cumulative fashion by allowing the accumulation of hardwood trees which were less preferred by rcw the remaining fire probability scenarios 10 showed improved habitat conditions for all species the p o u r c w stopped having a strong decreasing trend with fire probability of greater than 20 whereas the p o u s f s only stopped having a strong decreasing trend with fire probability of greater than 30 if masting was at higher levels fig 6 the sfs and gt time series showed larger amplitude oscillations likely because rcw was a mean of four factors to summarize the pou for each species we averaged the pous over the simulated time period and plotted the results in the form of a matrix table shown in fig 7 the matrix table shows that total fire exclusion for 200 years dramatically decreases pou relative to even a 20 fire probability scenario for all three species the p o u r c w only ranges from 0 6 to 0 72 for the fire probabilities of 20 to 50 which makes it less sensitive to changes in fire probability after at least 20 fire probability while the average pou sharply increases for both gt and rcw from the fire exclusion 0 case to the minimal fire probability 10 case sfs average pou sharply increases from the 10 to the 20 fire probability this suggests that the least amount of effort to apply fire is insufficient to increase the average pou for all three species simultaneously the average p o u r c w increases with more frequent fires as well as p o u g t the p o u s f s consistently showed that sfs habitat suitability is at its maximum in the 30 fire scenario summarizing results from fig 7 we conclude that 30 fire probability is the lowest prescribed fire management level at which all 3 species have close to maximum pou for the scenarios we simulated in addition we ran similar scenarios for different domain sizes 15 15 and 50 50 gridcells correspondingly using the same habitat variable setup we found that pous do not depend on the domain size for this hsm approach this result affirms that even when modeling smaller domain sizes we are averaging sufficient gridcells to capture similar tree demography that drives pou for each species 3 2 hardwood removal case the hardwood removal experiment showed the high resiliency of the longleaf pine hardwood forest but also showed that this management strategy could be harmful for sfs habitat while hardwoods were able to recover even under 1 regeneration scenario and 30 fire probability fig 8 hardwoods struggled to reach maturity for the scenario with sprout area equal to 1 thus given their reliance on isolated canopy hardwoods p o u s f s was relatively low compared to p o u r c w for much of the simulation time in the 50 fire scenario even in the 30 fire scenario the p o u s f s oscillated to low values sometime for several consecutive years hardwood tree removal improves p o u r c w over first 20 years since it takes 10 years for the hardwoods to reach the midstory in the llm demographic model the p o u s f s increases as soon as hardwoods reach their maturity 10 yrs old in all cases shown on fig 8 the average p o u r c w varies from 0 6 to 0 65 which is less than p o u r c w for the similar mast probability 15 this numerical experiment indicated that if the habitat is poor enough for sfs in years with low population numbers this could increase the danger of local sfs extinction unless nearby habitat with greater hardwood abundance was available for immigration these simulations suggest that hardwood tree removal is not an effective management strategy for multi species optimization not just because it creates unfavorable conditions for sfs but it is also less optimal for the rcw in comparison to the similar cases without hardwood removal 4 discussion balancing the habitat needs of multiple species will be critical for sustaining resilient ecosystems and biodiversity in a rapidly changing future hiers et al 2016 particularly where managed fire regimes can produce unintended conservation outcomes the modeling framework developed in this study shows how the population model of the longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem of the southeastern u s can be linked with a multiple species habitat model to assess the long term effect of the different fire management strategies our modeling approach offers realistic and nuanced tradeoffs between practical fire management strategies and habitat suitability for the three species of conservation concern fig 7 for example at 30 fire probability average p o u r c w is near its maximum and average p o u s f s is at its maximum but average p o u g t is much lower than its maximum across all masting scenarios on the other hand at 50 fire probability average p o u g t and average p o u r c w are at their maxima for most masting scenarios but average p o u s f s is much lower than its maximum across all masting scenarios our results suggest that the habitat is more suitable for 2 out of the 3 species in different combinations for 30 and 50 fire probabilities these model outputs could allow managers to more objectively evaluate management strategies such as whether umbrella species conservation simberloff 1998 can sustain other rare taxa in the llm longleaf competition was directly impacted by tree size within the cell and its neighboring trees more explicitly the competition index parameter was a function of tree heights of both tree types that are larger than itself found in immediately adjacent cells and was calibrated with literature values in the original model similar approaches have been used successfully in lattice type models to represent neighborhood plant competition drake and weishampel 2001 there are however space partitioning models where each individual tree has an area associated with it and depends on the number of trees around it and the distance to those neighboring trees e g liao et al 2013 as fire is the main driver of tree species dynamics in the llm and this ecosystem refining these competition parameters would likely be unnecessary we used two approaches to define species habitat habitat suitability parameters table 1 and empirically derived relationships the empirical approach does not have much flexibility and should be used as a rule for example we cannot relax empirical relations in p o u s f s or p o u g t like we did in the habitat suitability parameters for the rcw approach by adjusting the r value the habitat suitability parameters approach is more flexible and can be adjusted based on prior knowledge about species habitat preferences reflecting the utility and relative simplicity of this approach table 1 collecting corresponding species data in the form of the habitat variable table applied to the corresponding ecosystem can simplify and standardize hsm data preparation and diversify the number of species that can be tested by the coupled model to better understand each of the habitat suitability parameter responses to pou it is important to run multiple scenarios to ensure that any divergence of the multiple solutions is well understood we do not consider the spatial fire structure in the llm model in the current version of the llm model fire acts on the entire domain consuming all the fuels in the cell which is a safe assumption given that the vast majority of fire in the ecosystem uses prescribed burning to achieve these objectives more explicitly incorporating spatially structured fire would largely be through the addition of unconsumed fuel patches which would lead to more heterogeneous probability use numbers however that should not have a major impact on our pou because it is an average over a number of subsets m see eq 1 to study the effect of the spatial fire disturbance it could be useful to split the domain on several study areas and calculate pous for the corresponding areas which could be the topic of future modeling and was noted within the original model manuscript our modeling framework illustrates both the nuanced sensitivity of different co existing species to habitat conditions that are controlled by small changes to a fire regime but also allows for flexibility in management decision space for example if the goal is to sustain the average p o u g t but resources e g time personnel etc are limiting fire probability as low as 10 could be used for a time without compromising objectives however such strategy would be insufficient for avoiding an p o u s f s decline figs 7 and 8 notwithstanding negative impacts on floral diversity or creating critical fuel conditions kirkman et al 2004 when all three species are taken into consideration a fire probability of at least 30 would result in non declining trends for pou for all three species this methodology can augment a cost benefit analysis of increasing fire frequency by comparing the species pou cost of decreasing fire frequency against the logistical cost of increasing fire frequency if logistical costs led to a push for decreased fire frequency models of this hsm type could demonstrate the tradeoff of which species would see a corresponding decline in habitat usage even if other species were able to sustain stable pou the llm hsm only evaluates the suitability of the condition for each species independently the interaction between species is likely minimal and indirect but would require coupling with a separate model and beyond the scope of the current study in this study simulated p o u r c w compares well with the habitat preferences reported in empirical studies allowing for exploration of realistic management decisions on multispecies conservation james et al 2004 study which suggested a high frequency fire regime is required for maintenance of optimal rcw habitat in addition the hardwood thinning experiment modeled here is relevant to real management strategies such james et al 2004 recommendation for hardwood thinning when their density increased to 30 within a given area this stands in contrast to boone et al 2017 who showed that sfs occurrence is positively correlated with hardwood densities when evaluating prescribed fire and herbicide application treatments although in our simulation we do not directly report hardwood densities simulated high p o u s f s values are partially driven with a higher number of hardwood trees through the llm demographic modeling when considering species tradeoffs of management the documented benefit to rcw boone et al 2017 was countered over the long run by a negative impact on sfs through the loss of hardwoods fig 8 our results showed that certain fire return intervals result in presence of hardwoods that would maintain quality habitat for the sfs and should not hinder habitat conditions for the rcw and gt controlled presence of hardwoods has a positive feedback on sfs no adverse effects on the other two species and also has been found to provide resilience to longleaf pine regeneration following canopy loss through facilitation effects loudermilk et al 2016 it is expected that even the best fire management strategies can be interrupted with abrupt changes in climate such as hurricanes and floods further work for modeling multi species response to fire management will need to incorporate the impact of extreme climate events into hsm using managed disturbance regimes to influence habitat suitability could serve as an effective tool for defining patterns in habitat trajectory the coupled llm hsm model used in this study shows the opportunity to gain further understanding between long term interactions between species habitat quality and management while additional species habitat interaction data could increase hsm fidelity the nuanced differences in habitat preferences for these three well studied species contain sufficient detail to capture divergent needs over longer time frames than management plans typically consider when focusing on one species 5 conclusion developed in this study hsm uses two approaches to define species habitat habitat suitability parameters p o u r c w and empirically derived relationships p o u s f s and p o u g t collecting corresponding species data in the form of the habitat suitability parameters applied to the corresponding ecosystem in our case longleaf pine hardwood forest can standardize hsm data preparation in addition studies that address relationships between faunal species and longleaf pine hardwood ecosystem might diversify the number of species that can be tested within this modeling framework multi species modeling studies are important for understanding the interaction between desired habitat conditions and management activities through time by considering multiple species land managers can optimize managed disturbance regimes to promote a range of habitat conditions that collectively favor many species of concern the tradeoffs seen in these three species which all live and thrive in the frequently burned longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern u s are subtle but important considerations for active conservation management our approach offers a new tool that can provide a realistic assessment of the effectiveness and tradeoffs of conservation strategies either as a species based evaluation of species independent resilience planning anderson et al 2016 or as a tool to adjust management to optimize as many keystone and foundational species as possible in a rapidly changing future the relevance of any rule based habitat model is expected to decrease as climate change alters forest processes over longer time periods future efforts to understand species response could also benefit from linking hsms to predictive ecosystem process based models that account for potential climate driven changes in habitat trajectories this work is a critical first step towards understanding the complex interactions of fire frequency and community structure which ultimately support the conservation of critical faunal species author contributions eej developed hsm coupled it with llm and performed all numerical simulations with

a the effect of range on p o u r c w the range of suitable trees parameter table 1 allows flexibility in the rcw s choice of habitat typically in nature there exists a variability or distribution of values defining a given species preferred habitat the rcw literature varies in recommendations concerning a range of old growth tree densities that could be considered suitable and optimal habitat

and mast probabilities 15 this snapshot corresponds to the last year of the simulation the white dotted lines indicate the boundaries of subsets area this fire probability and mast probability scenario resulted in an abundant longleaf pine population and inter mixed re sprouting hardwoods the high number of trees per cell in figure a1a and a1b indicates that those cells correspond to young trees less than 10 yr old low nonzero tree count in a cell indicate mature trees typically the older the tree gets the fewer trees tend to occupy the same cell this can be seen from figure a1c and a1d where older trees correspond to the cells with one or two trees per cell the low abundance of the hardwood in this run was expected due to the selected fire scenario the hardwood tree count shown in figure a1b is one of the random combinations which is not necessarily representative for other similar runs due to the stochasticity of the llm model to illustrate the effect of r choice on the p o u r c w we use the same random number series for all three different r runs fig a2 shows the total simulated tree count and total number of the mature trees i e trees older than 10 years for longleaf pine and hardwood respectively spikes in longleaf pine older than 10 years correspond with dips in the total longleaf pine population because older longleaf pine outcompete smaller younger trees and tend to have fewer neighboring trees the corresponding tree count time series for both longleaf pine and hardwood displays the sudden decreases during fire years and sudden spikes during successful recruitment events additional sudden spikes in the total longleaf pine population indicate when a cohort of trees reaches maturity similarly the sudden reduction in the hardwood counts corresponds to fire years whereas sudden increase in tree population suggests new tree recruitment figure a2b represents p o u r c w dynamics for three different range values the r 0 has the lowest p o u r c w because it is unlikely that the tree distributions from the llm model will have exactly the mean preferred number of trees falling within the suitability range for each of the four habitat variables from table 1 on any given year for high values of r we expect p o u r c w to approach 1 corresponding to an rcw population that is highly insensitive to the values of the habitat variables in the table 1 increasing r improves the p o u r c w by allowing wider variability range for the rcw habitat variables in all our simulation presented in this study we choose r 1 corresponding to an intermediate level of rcw flexibility with respect to habitat variable values appendix b determining number runs per scenario to identify the trajectories of the species habitat over time we averaged multiple runs simulated with the same fire and mast probabilities since here we were interested in the trajectories rather than spread we identified the optimal number of runs required to produce those trajectories we ran the model 100 times see fig b1 a and then averaged across all runs 50 runs and 5 runs it can be seen from fig b1b that the trajectories averaged over five runs compare well with average trajectories over a hundred runs in addition averaging over only five runs allowed a significant reduction in computation time table b1 
24691,a basic model structure was suggested to correlate the biological age of an organism with its aging development and multiplication this simple model had the similar basic assumptions as the degree day model but was more theoretical comprehensive and approachable the proposed methodological and mathematical framework was based on the same shape concept of various distributions of an organism a new term physi biological time was introduced to calculate the physi biological age which was the product of the chronological time maximum lifespan and development rate of the organism at the given environmental condition the physi biological time was used to normalize the distribution of an organism development under different environmental conditions so the development of the organism at one environmental condition with the maximum lifespan could be mapped to the development of the same organism at other environmental conditions the ageing mortality oviposition of adults of cryptolestes ferrugineus were used as an example to demonstrate the modeling method the prediction was consistent with the measured data published by different researchers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological age physiological age various development distributions the same shape concept cryptolestes ferrugineus physi biological model 1 introduction predicting the occurrence of an organism with an acceptable accuracy is essential for ecological study and pest control for example to control insect pests mathematical models should be developed to predict the development time of insect pests these predictions require the estimation of insect development time and the variation among individuals for each life stage and species under different environmental conditions such as fluctuating temperature variation of relative humidity rh different body sizes and stages of the insects food source and levels of crowding this adds another level of complexity to models already complicated by accounting for the variable times of development gramig et al 2015 different temperatures damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 discrepancies under constant or fluctuating temperatures nachman and gotoh 2015 differences between different organism sources and strains white and bell 1994b variation under different densities of the organism itself predators and parasites zhao et al 2019 and inconsistence between different studies conducted by different researchers models that predict this stochastic development distribution of organisms usually involves application of probability distributions and likelihood estimation these developed phenomenological models are similar except they used different 1 variables such as mean or median development time gramig et al 2015 or development rate 2 forms of frequency distribution such as probability or cumulative density function 3 types of probability distribution such as normal quadratic beta and 4 equations such as erlang probability distribution function weibull function and nonlinear functions with different assumptions nachman and gotoh 2015 the most commonly used model strategies in the prediction of insect pest population especially for insects are distributed delays jian et al 2007 cohort based nachman and gotoh 2015 leslie matrix based longstaff 1984 simulation based kawamoto et al 1989 and individual based zhao et al 2019 the most developed models are degree day model cayton et al 2015 nachman and gotoh 2015 nonlinear model nachman and gotoh 2015 and distribution delay model jian et al 2007 after considering all these factors the model will become too complex and not practicable in most cases a simple model structure which can be used to combine all these factors into the model structure is required development rate models which have a temperature driven structure have been developed from data usually collected under constant temperatures under nature conditions insects expose to temperature cycles with above and below daily mean temperatures using mean temperatures such as used by the degree day model will fail to account for such thermal complexity which may produce unrealistic estimates of biological development and multiplication regniere et al 2012 under any environmental condition the field metabolic rate of an organism is related to its basal metabolic rate and basal metabolic rate is usually measured under standard temperature of an organism under condition of minimum environmental and physical stress namely at rest with no temperature stress these metabolic rates follow the van t hoff arrhenius equation under conditions of minimum environmental and physical stress insects should have a maximum lifespan and this longest lifespan will be modified shortened by different environmental conditions through the enzyme interactions inside the organism a basic mathematical modeling structure could be developed to count this thermal metabolic complexity by using the concept of maximum lifespan because the shortened lifespan might be the reflection image of the maximum lifespan the concept of physiological or biological time is implicitly used in literatures even though in different ways straalen 1983 for example physiological time is referred to as the heat unit and measured in degree days or development accumulation vansickle 1977 denoted the physiological age as any suitable variable e g body size related to age and served as an indicator of life history events biological time is used in the field of biological rhythmicity and the biological clock is usually temperature independent to avoid the confusion of dimensions straalen 1983 suggested to express physiological time in units of chronological time such as days or weeks in the temperature dependence biological processes in poikilotherms a nonlinear transformation of a chronological time scale to physiological time scale should be involved which results in a certain temperature dependent process which becomes time invariant nachman and gotoh 2015 used the concept of the biological age and developed a model by assuming that the survival rate of an individual depends on both the ambient temperature and its biological age their model was the measurement of day degrees under the assumption biological age could not exceed an upper limit above which no further development will take place maximum biological age and there was a ratio between a biological age at an environmental condition verse the maximum biological age these published models based on biological or physiological age did not solve the problem of time variance and added another level of complexity because more parameters and more nonlinear equations were required and introduced this complexity became obvious in the model developed by cuff and hardman 1980 because both physiological and chronological time scale must be used to track insect ages in each sub stage of insects insect growth and development are mainly controlled by genes genes manipulate the growth rate by influencing capacities to find food and consume processes and assimilate food and the hormonal mechanisms responsible for controlling insect molting and sexual mature harrison et al 2012 these intrinsic factors are modulated by environmental factors such as food quality and temperature the distribution of development time of an organism is different under different temperatures a time scale which can normalize the various distributions should be developed from the view of an organism body ageing might be the result of physiological and biological advance in the chronological time scale the same stage of any species should have the same morphological change during the aging of the organism so the similar enzyme concentration and activity under the same environmental condition therefor mapping comparing and normalizing of the same organism stage among different environmental conditions under the physiological and chronological time scale might solve this time scale problem and simplify the model development the objectives of this study were to propose a formal methodological framework and develop a new simple method which can be used to calculate the development process of an organism insects were used as the example in this study with various development distributions under a normalized time scale and this normalized time scale can be used to combine all the exogenous and or endogenous factors this normalized time scale had the same dimension and function as that of chronological time and was termed as physi biological time scale in this study 2 concept and assumptions of the proposed model the development rate of an organism insect stage depends on the combination of its weather driven temperature and relative humidity in most cases development rate and effect of other environmental factors such as nutrition crowding food sources and or disease the development rate always remains even though this rate may be altered by exogenous and or endogenous factors taylor 1981 evaluated the development distribution of 54 species of insects and found that development rate curves have a similar form for most species of insects and the basic pattern is repeated for any insect stages or species at different environmental conditions from year to year and season to season at any particular location the principle supporting the same shape concept is that any organism at the same development stage requires the similar amount of energy even at different environmental conditions distributions of insect development time are usually skewed toward the longer times however authors argued that small differences in distribution shape do not negate the same shape modeling approach schoolfield et al 1981 the methodological framework proposed in this study was based on this basic principle this study defined a new term physi biological time to distinguish the time scales from the chronological time scale the chronological time is defined as the time recorded by clocks located on earth without time dilation and referred to as time or chronological time in this study therefore the chronological time is the time scale used in our daily life and has the units of hours days etc the physi biological time is the time of insect ageing due to biological and chemical enzyme reactions and morphological changes in biological systems the unit of the physi biological time was the same as that of the chronological time the predicted distribution and variation of an insect stage under the physi biological time scale could calculate the effect of both exogenous and or endogenous factors on the development of the stage such as ageing and morphological change consequently the entire population under exogenous and or endogenous conditions could be quantified to simplify the modelling structure the following assumptions were made 1 the development was acted upon both by exogenous and endogenous variables such as weather factors which determine the population change while the density dependent factors were primarily responsible for regulating the population about its average level of abundance turchin 1990 huffaker et al 1997 2 temperature main density independent factor was the driven factor influencing development rate and morphological change of insect stages 3 other environmental factors such as rh food source disease crowding influenced the developmental rate and morphological change by modifying the temperature driven development rate 3 interaction effects between other factors and temperature could be an addition or multiplication relationship 4 these interaction effects would influence both biological development rate and morphological change 5 the physi biological age which was evaluated on the physi biological time scale was influenced by the interaction effect of all the environmental factors and 6 the biological development rate and morphological change were mainly influenced by the physi biological age the hypotheses behind these assumptions mentioned above were that 1 metabolic rate enzyme activity which is mainly controlled by energy controlled developmental rate 2 these enzymes symmetrically distributed around some genetically determined mean concentration sharpe and demichele 1977 3 frequency distributions of development rate were symmetric and 4 the coefficients of variation of these distributions were relatively independent of temperature these assumptions are supported by modern ecological theories huffaker et al 1997 based on these assumptions the physi biological age of an organism was calculated as 1 b n b n 1 θ 0 θ r m d θ b n 1 θ 0 θ r m δ θ where bn and bn 1 are the physi biological age of the organism at θ and θ 1 chronological time respectively physi biological time scale day r is the mean development rate of the organism under a given environmental condition chronological time scale day 1 and the mean development rate is the reverse of the mean development time chronological time scale day m is the maximum lifespan of the organism under conditions of minimum environmental physical and ecological stress chronological scale day the environmental stress could be the temperature and rh stress the temperature associated with the maximum lifespan m should not be the optimum development temperature because organism usually has a high metabolic rate at the optimum development temperature which results in a short lifespan the temperature associated with the m should not be the diapause or hibernation temperatures because the organism experiences environmental stress under these temperatures the temperature associated with the m of stored grain insects should be between 20 and 25 c because insects could have a minimum stress and longest lifespan at this temperature range a homoeothermic animal will have the minimum environmental stress in its thermo neutral zone which is species dependent the physical stress could be the food source and nutrition stress the ecological stress could be the crowding living space and competition stress it was assumed the r did not change in the period of δ θ if the θ was small enough eq 1 had the similar format as that suggested by straalen 1983 and indicated that the maximum age of the insect could be larger than m if r δ θ 1 3 data used to develop and verify the model the development of cryptolestes ferrugineus stephens coleoptera laemophloeidae a common stored grain insect across the world white and bell 1994b was used as the example in this study the temperature and rh inside a stored grain bulk have a much slower change rate than that of the ambient weather because stored grain has low thermal conductivity and diffusivity insects are mostly acclimated to the temperature due to this low change rate therefore insect acclimation to their living environmental conditions was assumed and δ θ 1 day in this study the distribution and variation of development time of larvae pupae and adults were reported in literatures evans 1983 white 1984 jian et al 2007 and these published data were used to develop and verify the model the data used to develop the model were not used to verify and calibrate the developed model 4 procedure of model development 1 find the regression equation to estimate the effect of environmental factors on r value of the insect stage 2 find the m of the insect stage 3 calculate the bn value by using eq 1 and assuming bn 1 0 at the very beginning of the insect stage 4 a nonlinear equation was regressed by using the calculated bn and its corresponding cumulative percentage of emergence such as hatching molting egg laying and mortality at one or several environmental conditions 5 this regression equation was used to predict the percentage of emergence under the other environmental conditions in this article only regression equations were provided the reason was to avoid the complete mathematical formula so this new method proposed in this study could be widely accepted by researchers in different research fields 5 adult ageing and mortality 5 1 ageing rate adult ageing was evaluated by using the lifespan which was estimated by insect death time the reciprocal of the average longevity or lt50 was defined as the average ageing rate to find the effect of temperature on the average ageing rate published average longevities or lt50 of the adults at constant temperatures 70 to 75 rh and on wheat flour plus germ or whole wheat were used the data sources were 45 47 49 and 50 c from jian et al 2002 22 25 30 and 35 c from white and bell 1994b 9 and 13 5 c from evans 1981 0 c from evans 1983 6 12 c from smith 1970 and 10 c from fields 1990 all these reported longevities were measured after the insects were acclimated to the tested temperatures the seven models listed by regniere et al 2012 and other models in literatures were tested and found 1 no model could have r2 0 5 for these data with the wide temperature range 2 no model with the assumption of base and maximum development temperatures could fit the data at temperature 13 5 to 35 c with r2 0 5 and 3 the model developed by taylor 1981 could fit the data at temperatures 13 5 to 45 c with r2 0 98 therefore the average ageing rates at different temperatures and temperature ranges were regressed the following equations were the best equations based on the highest r2 2 r a t a c 10 6 e n t t 14 0 c r 2 0 91 e 1 e t f g 14 c t 14 0 c r 2 0 99 i e 0 5 t j k

equations in eq 2 had the closest values of ra t at 14 14 and 37 c respectively fig 1 bishop 1959 determined the effect of rh ɸ on the longevities of the adults the effect of rh was compared with that at 70 to 75 and these data showed the following relationship between ageing rate and the rh 3 r a ϕ a c ϕ 70 r a t ϕ 90 r 2 0 90 r a t ϕ 90 where ɸ relative humidity raɸ the ageing rate of adults at a temperature with ɸ relative humidity chronological scale day 1 a 1 734 0 0729 and c 0 7740 0 0793 the minimum value of the raɸ was 0 003101 d 1 at 21 c and 75 rh the value of 0 00301 d 1 indicated that the maximum value of the average biological age of an adult was 322 5 days under acclimated and non crowed condition at 70 to 75 rh white and bell 1994b reported the maximum lifespan of the female adults under non crowed condition was from 41 to 50 wk 287 to 350 days about 320 days and this occurred at 70 rh and 22 c without crowding based on the definition the m value was assumed as 320 days for the adults in eq 1 it was assumed the patch size inside a storage bin was big enough and the crowding was mainly caused by the adult and larval movement and interaction jian et al 2018a jian et al 2018b therefore only the density of live adults and larvae was used to calculate the crowding effect jian et al 2018b found the peak live adult density was approximated 400 to 700 adults kg of wheat at 30 c and 3200 to 4800 adults kg of wheat at 35 c live adult density decreased to 66 5 of the peaked live insect density in 28 d white and bell 1993 reported the mean life spans of adult beetles were 32 wk for adults individually isolated in separate vials while it was 14 13 and 12 weeks for groups of 30 adults with 10 15 and 20 males per vial white and bell 1993 suggested that life span of adults was inversely related to the rate at which it expends energy and to the injury incurred during copulation therefore it was assumed the insect life span linearly decreased with the increase of adult density after 80 of its peak density was reached 4 r a r a ϕ a c d d 320 a d u l t s k g 18 c t 32 c o r t 38 c r 2 0 64 r a ϕ e f d d 2560 a d u l t s k g 32 c t 38 c r 2 0 73 where

using eqs 1 to 4 regression of the calculated bn with its corresponding cumulated mortalities was conducted the following equation was the best model to calculate the adult mortalities at given bn this equation had the largest r2 smallest mean squared error mse and small even distributed residuals in the tested equations 5 m a a 1 e b n c e r 2 0 99 where ma cumulated mortality of adults at bn

used to verify the developed model 20 16 c fields and white 1997 0 c khan 1990 25 30 35 c white and bell 1994a 47 49 50 c jian et al 2002 the reason for using these data was that these mortalities were evaluated from 0 mortality up to 100 mortality at different time spans and the adults were acclimated at low temperatures 5 3 oviposition rate there are a few studies on oviposition rate of c ferruginous rilett 1949 smith 1966 white and bell 1993 1994a the maximum rate of oviposition is reached during the first week of adult life and this rate is linearly decreased to 0 with the ageing of adults smith 1965 white and bell 1993 adults mate in one or two days after emergence and oviposition starts shortly thereafter rilett 1949 adults that are 22 wk or older stop egg laying at 30 c and 75 rh white and bell 1993 the bio physical age at 30 c 75 rh and 22 wk was 190 days therefore it was assumed the adults with bio physical ages 2 d and 190 d could lay eggs the physi biological ages of adults bn under the tested conditions were calculated by using eqs 1 4 the cumulated number of oviposition under each tested condition was calculated by using the data reported by white and bell 1993 and smith 1965 the relationship between the calculated bn and cumulated number of oviposition at any reported condition was linear or quasi linear figs 2 and 3 and the r2 of the linear regression equation at all the tested conditions was 0 94 this relationship was modelled by the following equations 6 o r o e t o e o e b o e d b n 7 o e t a c t t 30 c r 2 0 97 n 1 e t e f t 30 c r 2 1 0 8 o e

were used to develop the eqs 6 9 1 regress the cumulated number of oviposition and the calculated bn at the reported environmental condition the regression equations were or b bn where b is the slope of the regression equation this regressed b values were used to find eqs 7 9 by using the following steps 2 regress the b values with the reported temperatures at 70 rh this regression equation is eq 7 which was used to calculate the effect of the temperature on the number of oviposition at 70 rh 3 calculate the ratio between the b value at 70 and that at other rh this calculated ratio was used to find eq 8 which was used to calculate the effect of rh on the number of oviposition at different temperatures 4 calculate the or by using eq 6 and o e b 1 at 27 5 c and 70 rh 5 calculate the ratio between the calculated or and the reported cumulated number of oviposition this calculated ratio was regressed with the corresponding bn this regression equation eq 9 estimated the effect of the bio physical age on the insect cumulate number of oviposition the following data published by smith 1965 were used to develop the model eqs 6 9 17 5 c with 40 70 and 90 rh 25 c with 40 70 and 90 rh 32 5 c with 70 rh 37 5 c with 40 70 and 90 rh and 40 c with 70 rh the following data published by smith 1965 and the data published by white and bell 1993 were used to verify the model because white and bell 1993 reported the oviposition rate during the entire lifespan of the females at 30 c and 75 rh 20 20 5 and 27 5 c with 70 rh 30 c with 40 70 and 90 rh and 35 c with 40 70 and 90 rh even though it was proven that the oviposition by adults are influenced by insect density rilett 1949 bishop 1959 smith 1966 white and bell 1993 the data in literatures are not consistent this insistency is caused by many reasons such as different methods and testing procedures insect strains food materials and insect containers used to check whether the developed model could predict the oviposition rate at different insect densities published in different studies data published by smith 1966 were used to develop the model and the data reported by white and bell 1993 were used to verify the developed model based on the average daily oviposition rate published by smith 1966 the effect of the insect density on the cumulated oviposition number could be estimated as 10 o e d a e c d r 2 0 91 where d insect density i kg the insect included larvae and adults a 0 3006 0 0788 and c 0 0034 0 0013 to verify whether the assumption of eq 6 was valid or not the calculated ln o e t under each environmental condition was linearly regressed with y 11 y ln o r m ln o e ln o e b ln o e d ln b n where orm is the measured number of cumulated oviposition by each female at a temperature rh and insect density the linear relationship between y and ln o e t indicates that the interaction effect of any pair of the following factors is negligible temperature rh physi biological age and insect density these negligible interaction effects prove that assumption of eq 6 is valid 6 data analysis sigmaplot version 11 systat software inc san jose ca usa was used to conduct the regression to find the best model the coefficient of determination r2 was evaluated the model with r2 0 65 was further investigated by evaluating the smallest mean squared error mse of the model the model with the largest r2 and smallest mse was chosen as the best model to evaluate the prediction trend linear regression between measured and predicted values was conducted and the boxplot of the residuals difference between predicted and measured values was draw only the best model was reported in this article standard error was presented when mean value was presented in this article 7 results 7 1 adult mortality the developed model predicted the average ageing rates and slightly over estimated the mortalities of adults at some environmental conditions figs 1 4 and 5 this over estimation was most at the beginning bn 300 d of the development of the adults at 25 c to 35 c and 47 c figs 5 and 6 this over estimation might be caused by the model development process because the model was developed based on the data at 22 c and 75 rh at 22 c and 75 rh the adults have a higher mortality at the beginning than that at higher than 22 c white and bell 1994 however the percentage differences between predicted and measured percentage of the daily mortalities at 25 30 35 and 47 c were 0 43 0 64 0 33 and 0 0 respectively generally speaking the model had a low prediction accuracy at higher than 47 c than that at other temperatures figs 4 and 5 adults at high temperatures might have different physical and biochemical reaction fields 1992 jian et al 2013 from that at optimal and low temperatures therefore using eq 5 to predict insect motility at heat treatment temperatures might have a high error this cold be caused by the assumptions which used to develop the models 7 2 oviposition the developed model eqs 6 10 could predict the measured cumulated number of oviposition reported by different researchers under the following conditions 20 0 22 5 27 5 30 0 c with 40 70 and 90 rh 35 0 c with 40 70 and 90 rh and at any insect density figs 2 and 3 when the rh was 90 the r2 of the regression equation between the predicted and measured cumulated number of oviposition was 0 98 this indicated the developed equations could predict the cumulated number of oviposition reported in different studies without under or over prediction if rh 90 fig 3 ln o e t and y had a linear relationship with r2 0 89 and p 0 001 fig 6 there were a larger variation when ln o e t 1 and ln o e t 1 which indicated 1 an interaction effect of any pair of the following factors temperature rh physi biological age and insect density and 2 variation under different environment conditions when rh 40 or 90 ln o e t 1 while ln o e t 1 when temperature was higher than 37 5 c therefore at an extreme temperature and or relativize humidity the assumption of eq 6 was not valid under the normal grain storage condition eq 6 could be used to predict the cumulated oviposition of females because the calculated bn already considered these interaction effects under these conditions 8 discussion this study demonstrated a formal methodological framework and novel method to predict insect development and multiplication with various distributions of development time among individuals under different environmental conditions with reasonable accuracy this method did not use probability and or likelihood estimation and is simpler than the published nonlinear and distribution delay models jian et al 2007 jian et al 2018a the reason for its simplicity and high accuracy is that the novel model used the information of the development of insect stages at one environmental condition the minimum environmental stress condition to map the development of the same insect stage at other environmental conditions this would avoid the errors caused by the morphological and enzyme change because the same insect stage of the same species has the similar morphological and enzyme change even under different environmental conditions sharpe and demichele 1977 this simple method was based on the same shape concept taylor 1981 the same shape would allow to normalize various distributions under different environmental conditions so that one equation can handle all these environmental factors and many distribution functions the fact that insect development at one environmental condition could be used to predict the distribution collected by different researchers at other environmental conditions proved the existence of the same shape and the reliability of this modeling method in this study the physi biological scale was nonlinearly transformed from the chronological time scale this nonlinear transformation made this novel developed mapping method possible the calculated physi biological age bn included the insect development information under any environmental condition because the mean development rate of the insect stage can be modified by considering any environmental condition therefore one regression equation is required for one insect stage to predict its percentage of emergence the data collected under laboratory conditions could be directly used to find the regression equation without knowing the probability or cumulative density function of frequency distribution of the insect development at other environmental conditions because the regression equation already has the information of the development probability or cumulative density function temperature is the only considered factor in almost all of the published models in the literature damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 because temperature is the most critical factor affecting insect development the critical constraint of the temperature driven models is that most of these models do not take into account other climatic variables cayton et al 2015 the main reason for not including these factors might be 1 the published temperature model is already very complex 2 the interaction effect between the temperature and other factors is not clear and 3 mathematical difficulty due to the above mentioned two reasons the novel model developed in this study used temperature as the major factor to calculate the insect development rate and the other factors can only modify this development rate linearly or nonlinearly this approach is consistent with 1 the same shape concept 2 the conclusion of symmetrical distribution around genetically determined mean concentration of enzymes sharpe and demichele 1977 and 3 certain units of heat energy are the basic requirement of organism development degree day model is the most widely used mathematical format in many research areas related to farming cayton et al 2015 even though different researchers used different mathematical equations to calculate degree days and used different assumptions to quantify the relationship between the sum of degree days and the development of the modelled organism the developed degree day models have a low prediction accuracy bryant et al 2002 the main reason causing this low accuracy might be the modeling method and the requirement of the base temperature degree day models apply the accumulated temperatures as the heat energy to establish the relationship between the development and environmental conditions without considering the additive effect of the accumulated energy and morphological change of the organisms organisms might have a mixture of liner and non linear development it is difficult to find the right equation because both linear and non linear models cannot individually represent the complete effect of environmental factors on an organism it might be a challenging task to find the base temperature because organisms under fluctuating temperature may not have a distinct low temperature development threshold and development rates become asymptotically smaller as temperature decreases the organism s response to high and low temperatures as well as to the specific methods used to estimate accumulated degree days can lead to markedly divergent model predictions therefore prediction of the degree day model is very sensitive to the tailored system region and time scale the model developed in this study used the physi biological scale and did not need the base temperature the m value in eq 1 can be easily evaluated because the evaluation condition is the environment at which the organism has the minimum environmental physical and ecological stress and has the longest lifespan this concept is the same as the basal metabolic rate in the study of animal physiology the physi biological time scale has the same assumption as the degree day model such as the organism at the same development stage requires the same amount of energy which can be applied to both plants and animals therefore the novel modeling method should have a wide application in many biological systems the environmental condition used to estimate the m value in eq 1 should be the condition at which organisms had minimum environmental physical and ecological stress the reason was that organism would have the longest lifespan without hindering development and lowest mortality under minimum stress and the experimental error at the longest lifespan should be small this study developed a simple tool to evaluate an organism s physi biological age and this physi biological age was directly related to the development multiplication ageing and mortality of the organism the m value in eq 1 could be estimated under reliable conditions the r value in eq 1 has been widely used in population modeling therefore the novel modeling method should be easily applied to many organisms credit autour staement this paper reported the single author work i acknowledged dr

24691,a basic model structure was suggested to correlate the biological age of an organism with its aging development and multiplication this simple model had the similar basic assumptions as the degree day model but was more theoretical comprehensive and approachable the proposed methodological and mathematical framework was based on the same shape concept of various distributions of an organism a new term physi biological time was introduced to calculate the physi biological age which was the product of the chronological time maximum lifespan and development rate of the organism at the given environmental condition the physi biological time was used to normalize the distribution of an organism development under different environmental conditions so the development of the organism at one environmental condition with the maximum lifespan could be mapped to the development of the same organism at other environmental conditions the ageing mortality oviposition of adults of cryptolestes ferrugineus were used as an example to demonstrate the modeling method the prediction was consistent with the measured data published by different researchers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological age physiological age various development distributions the same shape concept cryptolestes ferrugineus physi biological model 1 introduction predicting the occurrence of an organism with an acceptable accuracy is essential for ecological study and pest control for example to control insect pests mathematical models should be developed to predict the development time of insect pests these predictions require the estimation of insect development time and the variation among individuals for each life stage and species under different environmental conditions such as fluctuating temperature variation of relative humidity rh different body sizes and stages of the insects food source and levels of crowding this adds another level of complexity to models already complicated by accounting for the variable times of development gramig et al 2015 different temperatures damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 discrepancies under constant or fluctuating temperatures nachman and gotoh 2015 differences between different organism sources and strains white and bell 1994b variation under different densities of the organism itself predators and parasites zhao et al 2019 and inconsistence between different studies conducted by different researchers models that predict this stochastic development distribution of organisms usually involves application of probability distributions and likelihood estimation these developed phenomenological models are similar except they used different 1 variables such as mean or median development time gramig et al 2015 or development rate 2 forms of frequency distribution such as probability or cumulative density function 3 types of probability distribution such as normal quadratic beta and 4 equations such as erlang probability distribution function weibull function and nonlinear functions with different assumptions nachman and gotoh 2015 the most commonly used model strategies in the prediction of insect pest population especially for insects are distributed delays jian et al 2007 cohort based nachman and gotoh 2015 leslie matrix based longstaff 1984 simulation based kawamoto et al 1989 and individual based zhao et al 2019 the most developed models are degree day model cayton et al 2015 nachman and gotoh 2015 nonlinear model nachman and gotoh 2015 and distribution delay model jian et al 2007 after considering all these factors the model will become too complex and not practicable in most cases a simple model structure which can be used to combine all these factors into the model structure is required development rate models which have a temperature driven structure have been developed from data usually collected under constant temperatures under nature conditions insects expose to temperature cycles with above and below daily mean temperatures using mean temperatures such as used by the degree day model will fail to account for such thermal complexity which may produce unrealistic estimates of biological development and multiplication regniere et al 2012 under any environmental condition the field metabolic rate of an organism is related to its basal metabolic rate and basal metabolic rate is usually measured under standard temperature of an organism under condition of minimum environmental and physical stress namely at rest with no temperature stress these metabolic rates follow the van t hoff arrhenius equation under conditions of minimum environmental and physical stress insects should have a maximum lifespan and this longest lifespan will be modified shortened by different environmental conditions through the enzyme interactions inside the organism a basic mathematical modeling structure could be developed to count this thermal metabolic complexity by using the concept of maximum lifespan because the shortened lifespan might be the reflection image of the maximum lifespan the concept of physiological or biological time is implicitly used in literatures even though in different ways straalen 1983 for example physiological time is referred to as the heat unit and measured in degree days or development accumulation vansickle 1977 denoted the physiological age as any suitable variable e g body size related to age and served as an indicator of life history events biological time is used in the field of biological rhythmicity and the biological clock is usually temperature independent to avoid the confusion of dimensions straalen 1983 suggested to express physiological time in units of chronological time such as days or weeks in the temperature dependence biological processes in poikilotherms a nonlinear transformation of a chronological time scale to physiological time scale should be involved which results in a certain temperature dependent process which becomes time invariant nachman and gotoh 2015 used the concept of the biological age and developed a model by assuming that the survival rate of an individual depends on both the ambient temperature and its biological age their model was the measurement of day degrees under the assumption biological age could not exceed an upper limit above which no further development will take place maximum biological age and there was a ratio between a biological age at an environmental condition verse the maximum biological age these published models based on biological or physiological age did not solve the problem of time variance and added another level of complexity because more parameters and more nonlinear equations were required and introduced this complexity became obvious in the model developed by cuff and hardman 1980 because both physiological and chronological time scale must be used to track insect ages in each sub stage of insects insect growth and development are mainly controlled by genes genes manipulate the growth rate by influencing capacities to find food and consume processes and assimilate food and the hormonal mechanisms responsible for controlling insect molting and sexual mature harrison et al 2012 these intrinsic factors are modulated by environmental factors such as food quality and temperature the distribution of development time of an organism is different under different temperatures a time scale which can normalize the various distributions should be developed from the view of an organism body ageing might be the result of physiological and biological advance in the chronological time scale the same stage of any species should have the same morphological change during the aging of the organism so the similar enzyme concentration and activity under the same environmental condition therefor mapping comparing and normalizing of the same organism stage among different environmental conditions under the physiological and chronological time scale might solve this time scale problem and simplify the model development the objectives of this study were to propose a formal methodological framework and develop a new simple method which can be used to calculate the development process of an organism insects were used as the example in this study with various development distributions under a normalized time scale and this normalized time scale can be used to combine all the exogenous and or endogenous factors this normalized time scale had the same dimension and function as that of chronological time and was termed as physi biological time scale in this study 2 concept and assumptions of the proposed model the development rate of an organism insect stage depends on the combination of its weather driven temperature and relative humidity in most cases development rate and effect of other environmental factors such as nutrition crowding food sources and or disease the development rate always remains even though this rate may be altered by exogenous and or endogenous factors taylor 1981 evaluated the development distribution of 54 species of insects and found that development rate curves have a similar form for most species of insects and the basic pattern is repeated for any insect stages or species at different environmental conditions from year to year and season to season at any particular location the principle supporting the same shape concept is that any organism at the same development stage requires the similar amount of energy even at different environmental conditions distributions of insect development time are usually skewed toward the longer times however authors argued that small differences in distribution shape do not negate the same shape modeling approach schoolfield et al 1981 the methodological framework proposed in this study was based on this basic principle this study defined a new term physi biological time to distinguish the time scales from the chronological time scale the chronological time is defined as the time recorded by clocks located on earth without time dilation and referred to as time or chronological time in this study therefore the chronological time is the time scale used in our daily life and has the units of hours days etc the physi biological time is the time of insect ageing due to biological and chemical enzyme reactions and morphological changes in biological systems the unit of the physi biological time was the same as that of the chronological time the predicted distribution and variation of an insect stage under the physi biological time scale could calculate the effect of both exogenous and or endogenous factors on the development of the stage such as ageing and morphological change consequently the entire population under exogenous and or endogenous conditions could be quantified to simplify the modelling structure the following assumptions were made 1 the development was acted upon both by exogenous and endogenous variables such as weather factors which determine the population change while the density dependent factors were primarily responsible for regulating the population about its average level of abundance turchin 1990 huffaker et al 1997 2 temperature main density independent factor was the driven factor influencing development rate and morphological change of insect stages 3 other environmental factors such as rh food source disease crowding influenced the developmental rate and morphological change by modifying the temperature driven development rate 3 interaction effects between other factors and temperature could be an addition or multiplication relationship 4 these interaction effects would influence both biological development rate and morphological change 5 the physi biological age which was evaluated on the physi biological time scale was influenced by the interaction effect of all the environmental factors and 6 the biological development rate and morphological change were mainly influenced by the physi biological age the hypotheses behind these assumptions mentioned above were that 1 metabolic rate enzyme activity which is mainly controlled by energy controlled developmental rate 2 these enzymes symmetrically distributed around some genetically determined mean concentration sharpe and demichele 1977 3 frequency distributions of development rate were symmetric and 4 the coefficients of variation of these distributions were relatively independent of temperature these assumptions are supported by modern ecological theories huffaker et al 1997 based on these assumptions the physi biological age of an organism was calculated as 1 b n b n 1 θ 0 θ r m d θ b n 1 θ 0 θ r m δ θ where bn and bn 1 are the physi biological age of the organism at θ and θ 1 chronological time respectively physi biological time scale day r is the mean development rate of the organism under a given environmental condition chronological time scale day 1 and the mean development rate is the reverse of the mean development time chronological time scale day m is the maximum lifespan of the organism under conditions of minimum environmental physical and ecological stress chronological scale day the environmental stress could be the temperature and rh stress the temperature associated with the maximum lifespan m should not be the optimum development temperature because organism usually has a high metabolic rate at the optimum development temperature which results in a short lifespan the temperature associated with the m should not be the diapause or hibernation temperatures because the organism experiences environmental stress under these temperatures the temperature associated with the m of stored grain insects should be between 20 and 25 c because insects could have a minimum stress and longest lifespan at this temperature range a homoeothermic animal will have the minimum environmental stress in its thermo neutral zone which is species dependent the physical stress could be the food source and nutrition stress the ecological stress could be the crowding living space and competition stress it was assumed the r did not change in the period of δ θ if the θ was small enough eq 1 had the similar format as that suggested by straalen 1983 and indicated that the maximum age of the insect could be larger than m if r δ θ 1 3 data used to develop and verify the model the development of cryptolestes ferrugineus stephens coleoptera laemophloeidae a common stored grain insect across the world white and bell 1994b was used as the example in this study the temperature and rh inside a stored grain bulk have a much slower change rate than that of the ambient weather because stored grain has low thermal conductivity and diffusivity insects are mostly acclimated to the temperature due to this low change rate therefore insect acclimation to their living environmental conditions was assumed and δ θ 1 day in this study the distribution and variation of development time of larvae pupae and adults were reported in literatures evans 1983 white 1984 jian et al 2007 and these published data were used to develop and verify the model the data used to develop the model were not used to verify and calibrate the developed model 4 procedure of model development 1 find the regression equation to estimate the effect of environmental factors on r value of the insect stage 2 find the m of the insect stage 3 calculate the bn value by using eq 1 and assuming bn 1 0 at the very beginning of the insect stage 4 a nonlinear equation was regressed by using the calculated bn and its corresponding cumulative percentage of emergence such as hatching molting egg laying and mortality at one or several environmental conditions 5 this regression equation was used to predict the percentage of emergence under the other environmental conditions in this article only regression equations were provided the reason was to avoid the complete mathematical formula so this new method proposed in this study could be widely accepted by researchers in different research fields 5 adult ageing and mortality 5 1 ageing rate adult ageing was evaluated by using the lifespan which was estimated by insect death time the reciprocal of the average longevity or lt50 was defined as the average ageing rate to find the effect of temperature on the average ageing rate published average longevities or lt50 of the adults at constant temperatures 70 to 75 rh and on wheat flour plus germ or whole wheat were used the data sources were 45 47 49 and 50 c from jian et al 2002 22 25 30 and 35 c from white and bell 1994b 9 and 13 5 c from evans 1981 0 c from evans 1983 6 12 c from smith 1970 and 10 c from fields 1990 all these reported longevities were measured after the insects were acclimated to the tested temperatures the seven models listed by regniere et al 2012 and other models in literatures were tested and found 1 no model could have r2 0 5 for these data with the wide temperature range 2 no model with the assumption of base and maximum development temperatures could fit the data at temperature 13 5 to 35 c with r2 0 5 and 3 the model developed by taylor 1981 could fit the data at temperatures 13 5 to 45 c with r2 0 98 therefore the average ageing rates at different temperatures and temperature ranges were regressed the following equations were the best equations based on the highest r2 2 r a t a c 10 6 e n t t 14 0 c r 2 0 91 e 1 e t f g 14 c t 14 0 c r 2 0 99 i e 0 5 t j k

equations in eq 2 had the closest values of ra t at 14 14 and 37 c respectively fig 1 bishop 1959 determined the effect of rh ɸ on the longevities of the adults the effect of rh was compared with that at 70 to 75 and these data showed the following relationship between ageing rate and the rh 3 r a ϕ a c ϕ 70 r a t ϕ 90 r 2 0 90 r a t ϕ 90 where ɸ relative humidity raɸ the ageing rate of adults at a temperature with ɸ relative humidity chronological scale day 1 a 1 734 0 0729 and c 0 7740 0 0793 the minimum value of the raɸ was 0 003101 d 1 at 21 c and 75 rh the value of 0 00301 d 1 indicated that the maximum value of the average biological age of an adult was 322 5 days under acclimated and non crowed condition at 70 to 75 rh white and bell 1994b reported the maximum lifespan of the female adults under non crowed condition was from 41 to 50 wk 287 to 350 days about 320 days and this occurred at 70 rh and 22 c without crowding based on the definition the m value was assumed as 320 days for the adults in eq 1 it was assumed the patch size inside a storage bin was big enough and the crowding was mainly caused by the adult and larval movement and interaction jian et al 2018a jian et al 2018b therefore only the density of live adults and larvae was used to calculate the crowding effect jian et al 2018b found the peak live adult density was approximated 400 to 700 adults kg of wheat at 30 c and 3200 to 4800 adults kg of wheat at 35 c live adult density decreased to 66 5 of the peaked live insect density in 28 d white and bell 1993 reported the mean life spans of adult beetles were 32 wk for adults individually isolated in separate vials while it was 14 13 and 12 weeks for groups of 30 adults with 10 15 and 20 males per vial white and bell 1993 suggested that life span of adults was inversely related to the rate at which it expends energy and to the injury incurred during copulation therefore it was assumed the insect life span linearly decreased with the increase of adult density after 80 of its peak density was reached 4 r a r a ϕ a c d d 320 a d u l t s k g 18 c t 32 c o r t 38 c r 2 0 64 r a ϕ e f d d 2560 a d u l t s k g 32 c t 38 c r 2 0 73 where

using eqs 1 to 4 regression of the calculated bn with its corresponding cumulated mortalities was conducted the following equation was the best model to calculate the adult mortalities at given bn this equation had the largest r2 smallest mean squared error mse and small even distributed residuals in the tested equations 5 m a a 1 e b n c e r 2 0 99 where ma cumulated mortality of adults at bn

used to verify the developed model 20 16 c fields and white 1997 0 c khan 1990 25 30 35 c white and bell 1994a 47 49 50 c jian et al 2002 the reason for using these data was that these mortalities were evaluated from 0 mortality up to 100 mortality at different time spans and the adults were acclimated at low temperatures 5 3 oviposition rate there are a few studies on oviposition rate of c ferruginous rilett 1949 smith 1966 white and bell 1993 1994a the maximum rate of oviposition is reached during the first week of adult life and this rate is linearly decreased to 0 with the ageing of adults smith 1965 white and bell 1993 adults mate in one or two days after emergence and oviposition starts shortly thereafter rilett 1949 adults that are 22 wk or older stop egg laying at 30 c and 75 rh white and bell 1993 the bio physical age at 30 c 75 rh and 22 wk was 190 days therefore it was assumed the adults with bio physical ages 2 d and 190 d could lay eggs the physi biological ages of adults bn under the tested conditions were calculated by using eqs 1 4 the cumulated number of oviposition under each tested condition was calculated by using the data reported by white and bell 1993 and smith 1965 the relationship between the calculated bn and cumulated number of oviposition at any reported condition was linear or quasi linear figs 2 and 3 and the r2 of the linear regression equation at all the tested conditions was 0 94 this relationship was modelled by the following equations 6 o r o e t o e o e b o e d b n 7 o e t a c t t 30 c r 2 0 97 n 1 e t e f t 30 c r 2 1 0 8 o e

were used to develop the eqs 6 9 1 regress the cumulated number of oviposition and the calculated bn at the reported environmental condition the regression equations were or b bn where b is the slope of the regression equation this regressed b values were used to find eqs 7 9 by using the following steps 2 regress the b values with the reported temperatures at 70 rh this regression equation is eq 7 which was used to calculate the effect of the temperature on the number of oviposition at 70 rh 3 calculate the ratio between the b value at 70 and that at other rh this calculated ratio was used to find eq 8 which was used to calculate the effect of rh on the number of oviposition at different temperatures 4 calculate the or by using eq 6 and o e b 1 at 27 5 c and 70 rh 5 calculate the ratio between the calculated or and the reported cumulated number of oviposition this calculated ratio was regressed with the corresponding bn this regression equation eq 9 estimated the effect of the bio physical age on the insect cumulate number of oviposition the following data published by smith 1965 were used to develop the model eqs 6 9 17 5 c with 40 70 and 90 rh 25 c with 40 70 and 90 rh 32 5 c with 70 rh 37 5 c with 40 70 and 90 rh and 40 c with 70 rh the following data published by smith 1965 and the data published by white and bell 1993 were used to verify the model because white and bell 1993 reported the oviposition rate during the entire lifespan of the females at 30 c and 75 rh 20 20 5 and 27 5 c with 70 rh 30 c with 40 70 and 90 rh and 35 c with 40 70 and 90 rh even though it was proven that the oviposition by adults are influenced by insect density rilett 1949 bishop 1959 smith 1966 white and bell 1993 the data in literatures are not consistent this insistency is caused by many reasons such as different methods and testing procedures insect strains food materials and insect containers used to check whether the developed model could predict the oviposition rate at different insect densities published in different studies data published by smith 1966 were used to develop the model and the data reported by white and bell 1993 were used to verify the developed model based on the average daily oviposition rate published by smith 1966 the effect of the insect density on the cumulated oviposition number could be estimated as 10 o e d a e c d r 2 0 91 where d insect density i kg the insect included larvae and adults a 0 3006 0 0788 and c 0 0034 0 0013 to verify whether the assumption of eq 6 was valid or not the calculated ln o e t under each environmental condition was linearly regressed with y 11 y ln o r m ln o e ln o e b ln o e d ln b n where orm is the measured number of cumulated oviposition by each female at a temperature rh and insect density the linear relationship between y and ln o e t indicates that the interaction effect of any pair of the following factors is negligible temperature rh physi biological age and insect density these negligible interaction effects prove that assumption of eq 6 is valid 6 data analysis sigmaplot version 11 systat software inc san jose ca usa was used to conduct the regression to find the best model the coefficient of determination r2 was evaluated the model with r2 0 65 was further investigated by evaluating the smallest mean squared error mse of the model the model with the largest r2 and smallest mse was chosen as the best model to evaluate the prediction trend linear regression between measured and predicted values was conducted and the boxplot of the residuals difference between predicted and measured values was draw only the best model was reported in this article standard error was presented when mean value was presented in this article 7 results 7 1 adult mortality the developed model predicted the average ageing rates and slightly over estimated the mortalities of adults at some environmental conditions figs 1 4 and 5 this over estimation was most at the beginning bn 300 d of the development of the adults at 25 c to 35 c and 47 c figs 5 and 6 this over estimation might be caused by the model development process because the model was developed based on the data at 22 c and 75 rh at 22 c and 75 rh the adults have a higher mortality at the beginning than that at higher than 22 c white and bell 1994 however the percentage differences between predicted and measured percentage of the daily mortalities at 25 30 35 and 47 c were 0 43 0 64 0 33 and 0 0 respectively generally speaking the model had a low prediction accuracy at higher than 47 c than that at other temperatures figs 4 and 5 adults at high temperatures might have different physical and biochemical reaction fields 1992 jian et al 2013 from that at optimal and low temperatures therefore using eq 5 to predict insect motility at heat treatment temperatures might have a high error this cold be caused by the assumptions which used to develop the models 7 2 oviposition the developed model eqs 6 10 could predict the measured cumulated number of oviposition reported by different researchers under the following conditions 20 0 22 5 27 5 30 0 c with 40 70 and 90 rh 35 0 c with 40 70 and 90 rh and at any insect density figs 2 and 3 when the rh was 90 the r2 of the regression equation between the predicted and measured cumulated number of oviposition was 0 98 this indicated the developed equations could predict the cumulated number of oviposition reported in different studies without under or over prediction if rh 90 fig 3 ln o e t and y had a linear relationship with r2 0 89 and p 0 001 fig 6 there were a larger variation when ln o e t 1 and ln o e t 1 which indicated 1 an interaction effect of any pair of the following factors temperature rh physi biological age and insect density and 2 variation under different environment conditions when rh 40 or 90 ln o e t 1 while ln o e t 1 when temperature was higher than 37 5 c therefore at an extreme temperature and or relativize humidity the assumption of eq 6 was not valid under the normal grain storage condition eq 6 could be used to predict the cumulated oviposition of females because the calculated bn already considered these interaction effects under these conditions 8 discussion this study demonstrated a formal methodological framework and novel method to predict insect development and multiplication with various distributions of development time among individuals under different environmental conditions with reasonable accuracy this method did not use probability and or likelihood estimation and is simpler than the published nonlinear and distribution delay models jian et al 2007 jian et al 2018a the reason for its simplicity and high accuracy is that the novel model used the information of the development of insect stages at one environmental condition the minimum environmental stress condition to map the development of the same insect stage at other environmental conditions this would avoid the errors caused by the morphological and enzyme change because the same insect stage of the same species has the similar morphological and enzyme change even under different environmental conditions sharpe and demichele 1977 this simple method was based on the same shape concept taylor 1981 the same shape would allow to normalize various distributions under different environmental conditions so that one equation can handle all these environmental factors and many distribution functions the fact that insect development at one environmental condition could be used to predict the distribution collected by different researchers at other environmental conditions proved the existence of the same shape and the reliability of this modeling method in this study the physi biological scale was nonlinearly transformed from the chronological time scale this nonlinear transformation made this novel developed mapping method possible the calculated physi biological age bn included the insect development information under any environmental condition because the mean development rate of the insect stage can be modified by considering any environmental condition therefore one regression equation is required for one insect stage to predict its percentage of emergence the data collected under laboratory conditions could be directly used to find the regression equation without knowing the probability or cumulative density function of frequency distribution of the insect development at other environmental conditions because the regression equation already has the information of the development probability or cumulative density function temperature is the only considered factor in almost all of the published models in the literature damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 because temperature is the most critical factor affecting insect development the critical constraint of the temperature driven models is that most of these models do not take into account other climatic variables cayton et al 2015 the main reason for not including these factors might be 1 the published temperature model is already very complex 2 the interaction effect between the temperature and other factors is not clear and 3 mathematical difficulty due to the above mentioned two reasons the novel model developed in this study used temperature as the major factor to calculate the insect development rate and the other factors can only modify this development rate linearly or nonlinearly this approach is consistent with 1 the same shape concept 2 the conclusion of symmetrical distribution around genetically determined mean concentration of enzymes sharpe and demichele 1977 and 3 certain units of heat energy are the basic requirement of organism development degree day model is the most widely used mathematical format in many research areas related to farming cayton et al 2015 even though different researchers used different mathematical equations to calculate degree days and used different assumptions to quantify the relationship between the sum of degree days and the development of the modelled organism the developed degree day models have a low prediction accuracy bryant et al 2002 the main reason causing this low accuracy might be the modeling method and the requirement of the base temperature degree day models apply the accumulated temperatures as the heat energy to establish the relationship between the development and environmental conditions without considering the additive effect of the accumulated energy and morphological change of the organisms organisms might have a mixture of liner and non linear development it is difficult to find the right equation because both linear and non linear models cannot individually represent the complete effect of environmental factors on an organism it might be a challenging task to find the base temperature because organisms under fluctuating temperature may not have a distinct low temperature development threshold and development rates become asymptotically smaller as temperature decreases the organism s response to high and low temperatures as well as to the specific methods used to estimate accumulated degree days can lead to markedly divergent model predictions therefore prediction of the degree day model is very sensitive to the tailored system region and time scale the model developed in this study used the physi biological scale and did not need the base temperature the m value in eq 1 can be easily evaluated because the evaluation condition is the environment at which the organism has the minimum environmental physical and ecological stress and has the longest lifespan this concept is the same as the basal metabolic rate in the study of animal physiology the physi biological time scale has the same assumption as the degree day model such as the organism at the same development stage requires the same amount of energy which can be applied to both plants and animals therefore the novel modeling method should have a wide application in many biological systems the environmental condition used to estimate the m value in eq 1 should be the condition at which organisms had minimum environmental physical and ecological stress the reason was that organism would have the longest lifespan without hindering development and lowest mortality under minimum stress and the experimental error at the longest lifespan should be small this study developed a simple tool to evaluate an organism s physi biological age and this physi biological age was directly related to the development multiplication ageing and mortality of the organism the m value in eq 1 could be estimated under reliable conditions the r value in eq 1 has been widely used in population modeling therefore the novel modeling method should be easily applied to many organisms credit autour staement this paper reported the single author work i acknowledged dr

24692,nature reserves have been established globally to protect wild species however an issue remains how to determine the importance of core areas of nature reserves in maintaining the regional connectivity of corridors and the effectiveness of the core areas for species protection this study aims to solve this problem in an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone in the north eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau we used circuit theory to construct an ecological network for ungulate species an index core id was proposed to reflect the importance degree of core areas using the product of the average current value and the pixel number of the corridors the results showed that corridors are mainly located in the central and eastern regions of the study area which are areas with generally low resistance values we also generated the importance degree of core areas based on the core id index the spatial distribution of the importance degree of core areas is characterized by gradual weakening from east to west we found that the existing nature reserves are not sufficiently effective for the protection of ecological corridors and only 53 28 of corridors are under protection by nature reserves our study can guide conservation management in the study area and provide a reference method for determining the importance degree of core areas keywords circuit theory ecological corridor importance of core areas landscape connectivity the qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction in recent decades conflicts between wild species and human beings have attracted increased attention worldwide kuijper et al 2019 schley et al 2008 smeraldo et al 2020 thorn et al 2013 thouless and sakwa 1995 the main factors threatening wild species include the fragmentation of natural habitats fahrig 2003 sahraoui et al 2017 and the disturbance of movement pathways zhu et al 2005 although natural factors such as extreme climate events and geographical disasters can cause negative effects on wild species a large number of studies have shown that human activity is the foremost threat to the survival of wildlife herkert et al 2003 anthropogenic disturbances such as agricultural development y an et al 2020 road construction fu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 and mining activities su et al 2015 bear the most responsibility therefore many nature reserves have been established in most countries to protect wild species more than 2740 nature reserves have been established in china cao et al 2019 with the area and number of nature reserves increasing yearly the reduction of biodiversity and the deterioration of the ecological environment have improved xue and zheng 1994 however the effects of these improvements are still insufficient to reverse the downward trends guo and cui 2015 hao et al 2009 therefore china is stepping up efforts to establish and optimize a system of natural protected areas with national parks as the main body peng et al 2018 in the future the purpose of national parks in china will be to minimize the impact of human activities and to protect the natural landscape and biodiversity zhou and grumbine 2011 how to determine the boundaries and select the potential areas of national parks under the basic conditions of the vast national land area is a key scientific issue in the construction of the national park system in china every nature reserve is divided into three types of functional areas the core area buffer zone and experimental area wang et al 2011 among them the core area is the most important for wildlife protection the preserved natural state of the ecosystem and the concentrated distribution areas of rare and endangered animals and plants in the nature reserve are classified as the core area davison et al 1989 therefore in this study we focused on the importance of core areas to more precisely and effectively guide the allocation of conservation resources a buffer area is a zone of a certain area that can be drawn around the core area and only scientific research and observational activities are allowed the periphery of the buffer zone can be further divided into experimental areas at present 15 68 of the nature reserves in china are national level accounting for 65 66 of the total area of nature reserves wang et al 2016 such a large area ratio of national level nature reserves may lead to difficulties in the rational allocation of protection resources and ambiguities in protection priorities therefore there is an urgent need for the determination of the importance of the core areas of nature reserves which can provide a reference for the scientific management of nature reserves hockings 2004 there has been a trend in published research to solve the issue of wildlife protection through the establishment of ecological networks urban 2001 as an important component of ecological networks ecological corridors are essential for the migration of animals gene flow and other ecological processes mcrae et al 2016 the improvement of ecological corridors can contribute to solving ecological issues such as landscape fragmentation and habitat destruction leonard et al 2016 seoane et al 2010 several methods and software programs have been developed to construct ecological networks sahraoui et al 2017 these methods include the use of graph theory for landscape ecological assessment and planning zetterberg et al 2010 the determination of the relationship between the dispersal distance of mammals and the home range size of the mammals bowman et al 2002 and ecological corridor construction pittiglio et al 2014 the least cost path model was proposed by knaapen knaapen et al 1992 and is broadly used in research on species diffusion processes knaapen et al 1992 and analyses of landscape patterns adriaensen et al 2003 and ecological networks feng and sha 2006 yu 1996 the major deficiency of the least cost path model is that only one optimal path is provided between a pair of ecological sources circuit theory can solve this problem by demonstrating all possible pathways for wild species mcrae and paul 2007 in addition circuit theory incorporates structural connectivity and functional connectivity emphasizing the effect of permeability through fragmented landscapes on the movements of wild species mcrae et al 2008 dutta et al identified pinch points bottlenecks of corridors with a method combining the least cost distance and circuit theory dutta et al 2016 lechner et al presented multiscale connectivity planning in australia lechner et al 2015 recently circuit theory has been widely used in landscape connectivity evaluations considering the impacts of land cover change sahraoui et al 2017 and road construction boyle et al 2017 additionally many ecologists have used circuit theory to evaluate landscape connectivity and corridor quality aiming to determine the conservation priorities of ecological sources beier et al 2011 identifying the importance degree of core areas in regions that have unique wild species may be the most effective way to understand key targets in the process of biodiversity conservation hockings 2004 however a prescriptive standard has not yet been established lópez rodríguez and rosado 2017 considered the roof of the world the qinghai tibet plateau has an average elevation of over 4000 m li et al 2019 geographical factors form the distinctive climate conditions and unique ecosystems of the plateau zheng 1996 as the largest plateau in china it has extremely rich biodiversity zhang et al 2010 a large area of grassland covers the plateau and grows in the environment of extremely low temperatures zhong et al 2010 located in the north eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau the study area which is an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone is vitally important not only due to its geographical factors but also because of its unique biodiversity however the vegetation and biodiversity in the study area are vulnerable similarly to other regions of the qinghai tibet plateau the study area is extremely sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances li et al 2019 therefore several nature reserves have been established however the ecological protection of the area is still not optimistic for example the sanjiangyuan nature reserve is widely considered one key region among important global biodiversity areas dong et al 2010 myers et al 2000 after 10 years of protection ecological deterioration in the reserve has been preliminarily curbed and partially improved however the health status of the regional ecosystem is far from the ideal state and the biodiversity loss has not improved considerably sang et al 2011 existing human settlements and constructed roads also impact the protection effects of nature reserves this study selected ungulate species as the research species ungulates have strong movement and migration abilities given these above elements the determination of the core areas that are important for ungulate species was the key issue examined in this study we proposed a circuit based approach that uses core areas as the ecological source areas from which an individual different core area was removed each time to construct ecological networks then the variation degree of the landscape connectivity of ecological corridors was compared we also sought to solve the following issue can existing nature reserves effectively protect the migration and movement pathways of ungulate species we believe that the solutions to the above issues can provide a methodology framework based on circuit theory for use in determining the importance degrees of core areas this study also serves as an important reference for the conservation of nature reserves and the management of other landscapes similar to the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone located in the eastern region of the qinghai tibet plateau was selected as the study area according to the vegetation division of the plateau the study region has an area of 348 696 km2 and contains land from four provinces fig 1 grassland covers 80 4 of the total area and 13 4 of the total area is covered by bare land the terrain is dominated by the plateau with an average elevation of 4463 m the altitude gradually decreases from west to east the study area has a typical plateau alpine climate with an annual average temperature of 2 9 c the monthly average temperature ranges from 7 5 c in january to 12 5 c in july the annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 700 mm the region is quite rich in wild animal and plant resources wild plants such as ophiocordyceps sinensis saussurea involucrata fritillaria gentiana macrophylla angelica sinensis codonopsis pilosula and moschus can be found throughout most of the study area hundreds of wild animal species live in the study area some of which are listed as nationally protected wildlife mainly including crossoptilon crossoptilon tetraogallus tibetanus grus nigricollis pseudois nayaur moschus chrysogaster panthera uncia vulpes ferrilata and ursus arctos in this study we focused mainly on wild species that have strong movement and migration abilities therefore ungulate species were selected as the research species most of which are endangered due to natural and anthropogenic threats in the qinghai tibet plateau some ungulate species such as the tibetan wild ass equus kiang wild yak bos mutus and argali ovis ammon have been listed as national key protected animals according to the wildlife protection law of the people s republic of china without very fixed habitats these species have rough distribution areas buzzard et al 2010 inaddition the tibetan antelope pantholops hodgsonii has a strong migratory ability lian et al 2007 the tibetan gazelle procapra picticaudata and blue sheep pseudois nayaur are widelydistributed and have large populations as herbivores these species commonly inhabit alpine meadows at altitudes of 3000 to 6000 m the animals have the ability to endure hardship cold hunger and thirst and have strong adaptability to the environmental conditions of the alpine grassland 2 2 data sources the land use data in 2017 used in this study was downloaded from the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn this data contains a number of detailed land use categories according to the specific situation of the study area and the principal purpose of this study we generalized the land use categories into nine land use types forest cropland wetland bare land grassland shrubland water residential area and snow ice digital elevation model dem data with a resolution of 30 m was downloaded from the geospatial data cloud website http www gscloud cn which directly provides the elevation information of the study area mean annual ndvi normalized difference vegetation index data in 2017 with a pixel resolution of 1000 m was derived from mod13q1 data mod13q1 is the vegetation index of nasa s modis product this data is based on the maximum synthesis method and has been geometrically and atmospherically corrected the transportation infrastructure data 1 250000 scale in the vector format was obtained from the road network database of the national fundamental geographical information centre downloaded from http www ngcc cn we obtained village data from the 1 250000 scale basic database of the national fundamental geographical information center liu et al 2008 we also used the distribution data of nature reserves which was downloaded from the china nature reserve database 2 3 construction of the resistance surfaces as circuit theory is based on a hypothesis that assumes wild animals to be random walkers the assignment of resistance values becomes a critical part of the ecological network construction mcrae 2006 generally resistance values characterize the degree to which barriers affect the movements of wild species the greater the resistance value of a region is the harder it is for wild animals to pass through the region poor et al 2012 as many studies have suggested land use type is the most important factor impacting the distribution of wild species anzures dadda and manson 2006 in the study area two main natural factors the elevation and slope impact the movement routes of three ungulate species zeller et al 2012 in addition wildlife can be guided by the degree of vegetation cover and species on the qinghai tibet plateau are no exception kong et al 2010 they prefer vegetation intensive areas although they have strong adaptabilities to difficult conditions such as low vegetation density and bare land ndvi can characterize the degree of vegetation cover therefore we selected four variables land use type ndvi elevation and slope to facilitate the integration of natural barriers into the generation of the resistance surfaces the anthropogenic barriers represented by roads and villages were used to evaluate the impacts of human activities on core areas and corridors and to determine the key conservation core areas according to the degrees to which of ungulate species prefer certain habitat types each resistance factor was assigned a suite of resistance values according to different ranges chardon et al 2003 in this study the resistance values were determined for five degrees 1 for extremely suitable areas 10 for suitable areas 40 for sub suitable areas 60 for neutral areas 80 forunfavorable areas and 100 for barrier areas y an et al 2020 the specific assignment of resistance values is shown in table 1 all these single resistance layers were overlapped with equal weights to form a comprehensive resistance surface then this combined resistance data was converted to a raster layer with a resolution of 1000 m 2 4 determination of the importance degree of core areas through ecological network construction circuit theory assumes that the study area is a conductive surface and models all possible movement pathways of wild animals by injecting currents into the landscape mcrae et al 2008 the circuitscape software was designed to assess landscape connectivity and model ecological networks shah and mcrae 2008 in this study circuitscape 4 0 was used to perform the circuit theory calculations we input the resistance surface and ecological sources into the software and cumulative current maps that can be considered ecological networks were produced as outputs areas with high current values show that there are suitable potential pathways for the movement of wild species the specific ecological significances of the circuit theory elements are shown in the supplementary material in this study we determined the importance degree of core areas based on circuit theory combined with the graph theory method first we considered all 18 core areas to be ecological sources and input the core areas into the circuitscape software with the comprehensive resistance surface the complete ecological network was then generated then the core area denoted no 1 was removed from the suite of ecological sources and the remaining 17 core areas and the resistance surface were used to output the ecological network of no 1 following the same method for each repetition one core area was removed from the suite of ecological sources until the last core area no 18 had been removed thus we obtained a complete ecological network based on the consideration of all 18 core areas as ecological sources and 18 ecological networks based on 17 core areas as ecological sources after the ecological networks were constructed using circuit theory we defined the areas with current values greater than 0 4 as ecological corridors based on the distributions of the value ranges in the current maps to determine the importance degree of core areas we proposed a new index core id importance degree of core area considering the impact on both landscape connectivity and ecological corridors this index uses the product of the average current value of each corridor and the pixel number of the corridor to demonstrate the corridor quality which can reflect the importance degree of core area if the corridor quality is seriously impacted when a core area is removed this core area is determined to be important for maintaining landscape connectivity and corridors therefore the lower the core id index of a given core area is the higher the ranking order of the core area is cor e i d average current value of the corridor pixel number of the corridor 2 5 evaluation of the effectiveness of existing nature reserves for maintaining ecological corridors to optimize the layout of nature reserves and improve the effectiveness of the nature reserve network we evaluated the protection effectiveness of the existing nature reserves by overlaying the data of the whole nature reserve on the ecological corridors to more quantitatively demonstrate the protection efficiency we calculated the proportion of the area of nature reserves to the entire study area then we calculate the proportion of corridor areas under the protection of nature reserves to the total corridor area and to the whole nature reserves finally we obtained the ratios of the corridors in the core area buffer zone and experimental area in addition we calculated the road density and village number of each core area to determine which core areas were seriously impacted in an attempt to determine the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on ecological corridors we clipped the point data of human settlements in regions of ecological corridors 3 results 3 1 resistance analysis of the study area the resistance surfaces are shown in fig 2 in terms of land use the resistance situation of almost the whole area is optimistic the resistance factor of ndvi is large in the whole study area especially in the western and mid northern regions the resistance factor of the slope shows that a large area of the southern region is not suitable for the migration of ungulate species from the perspective of elevation the eastern area shows low resistance for the movement of wild species while most areas in the western region are under resistance values greater than 60 when analysed together the four maps of individual resistance factors reflect that the resistance situation in the east is better than that in the west through the overlay of these four single resistance factors a comprehensive resistance surface was generated as shown in fig 2e the overall resistance showed a significant decreasing trend from west to east with extremely high resistance values the regions indicated by the redcolor in the west are not suitable for the movement of ungulate species 3 2 the landscape connectivity analysis in the study area we generated 18 current density maps fig 3 and calculated the maximum and average current values of each map see the supplementary materials each result was based on the scenario in which one core area is removed it is obvious that the current maps of nos 12 and 13 are considerably different from the others almost all of the western regions in the maps of nos 12 and 13 are brown indicating that these regions are characterized by poor landscape connectivity for ungulate species therefore the absence of core areas in no 12 and 13 could cause a significant drop in landscape connectivity in the western region the cumulative current density map generated by the circuitscape 4 0 software is also shown in fig 3 in which all 18 core areas were considered ecological source areas the dark green areas denote regions with high current values indicating high landscape connectivity and the ecological corridors are mainly located in these regions regarding the spatial distribution of regions with good landscape connectivity these regions are mainly distributed in the middle and eastern parts of the study area these regions comprise areas with generally low resistance values and their current values tend to be higher overall than those in western regions the core areas are well connected in the mid northern and south eastern regions which is mainly due to the dense distribution of the core areas in these regions and the short distances between them some core areas are far apart from each other but can form good connections for instance there are good connections between the core areas of no 16 and no 9 no 14 and no 18 and no 14 and no 1 large areas of the regions between these three pairs of core areas have relatively low resistance values which makes it easier for currents to pass through and form strong landscape connectivity in contrast the distance between some core areas such as between no 8 and no 11 is very short but there is almost no connection between them more importantly not only the region between these two core areas but also almost the whole western region constituting nearly half of the study area has few areas with good landscape connectivity for these reasons the two basic elements that control the ecological network construction ecological sources and resistance surfaces are not optimal in the western region the number of ecological sources in the western region is lower than those in the central and eastern regions additionally the resistance values in the western region are generally higher than those in other regions these two reasons make it difficult for the current to pass easily through most areas of the western region resulting in poor overall landscape connectivity 3 3 the degree of importance of core areas for improving ecological corridors fig 4 shows the spatial distributions and areas of the ecological corridors under 18 scenarios the core id index results and their ranking orders are shown in table 2 ecological corridors are severely damaged when either core area no 14 or 18 is removed under these scenarios nearly half of the corridors are lost these two core areas play important roles in improving ecological corridors when core area no 9 is removed the loss of ecological corridors is very small and the area of ecological corridors is the largest in this scenario among the 18 scenarios therefore this core area has the lowest contribution to the connectivity between nature reserves in other words compared with other core areas the presence or absence of this core area has the least impact on changes in the area of ecological corridors therefore this core area obtained the lowest ranking finally we determined the final importance degree of core areas for improving ecological corridors based on the core id index as shown in table 2 the conservation priorities were identified the most important core area was no 14 and the least important core area was no 9 we spatialized the ranking order of the core areas in the study area the large figure in fig 6 an obvious trend is that the ranking order of the core areas decreases from east to west the no 9 core area is located in the central study area but it is not an important core area for maintaining ecological corridors and it has the lowest ranking order core areas no 14 and 18 which are located at the border of the study area have the highest ranking orders the spatialized ranking order of the core areas is consistent with the spatial distribution of the ecological corridors the importance degree of the core areas in the study area are characterized by a gradual weakening from east to west 3 4 analysis of the effectiveness of protection of nature reserves as shown in fig 4 there are only the mid northern mid southern and eastern regions of the study area contain several large area corridors resulting in relatively good connectivity in only a few small scale areas a large portion of the study area is faced with a serious situation consisting of poor landscape connectivity and few ecological corridors the existing core areas mainly the sanjiangyuan national nature reserve cannot support a high quality ecological network in the entire study area even if the complete nature reserves including not only the core areas but also the buffer zones and experimental areas are overlaid on the study area the result is still not ideal fig 5 the complete nature reserves have a large area accounting for 35 06 of the study area however the protection efficiency of the complete nature reserves is relatively low and only 16 11 of the whole nature reserves comprises corridors large areas of nature reserves and ecological corridors are distributed in the mid southern region but the area in which they overlap is not large the overlapping area is less than half of the corridor region in addition only 53 28 of the ecological corridors are located in the whole nature reserve area indicating that nearly half of the ecological corridors are not under effective protection we found that more than two thirds of the ecological corridors in nature reserves are distributed in experimental areas there are constructed roads and villages in almost all of the core areas fig 6 the number of roads differs greatly among these core areas it is extremely obvious that core areas nos 15 and 17 are severely disturbed by constructed roads more importantly there are only four core areas in the large region in the south eastern part of the study area therefore the protection effect of the core areas in this large scale region is not optimistic and still needs to be improved villages are densely distributed in some core areas such as nos 9 and 17 the bar graph quantitatively demonstrates the number of villages in core areas there are fewer than 5 villages in more than half of the core areas only the core areas nos 1 9 and 11 have more than 10 villages the core area no 17 has only 5 human settlements however the village distribution in no 17 is denser than in some core areas that have more than 5 villages mainly due to its small area therefore this core area is faced with severe pressure not only from transportation infrastructure but also from human settlements villages are extremely densely distributed in the ecological corridors in the red frame shown in fig 7 more importantly the western region of the study area has only one corridor and it is severely impacted by human settlements which will allow little movement or and few migration pathways for the three ungulate species the northern and eastern corridors are less disturbed by humans than the corridors in the south 4 discussions 4 1 analysis of key conservation core areas based on ranking order and anthropogenic disturbances after comprehensively considering the impacts of roads and settlements the core areas in the eastern region of the study area were generally found to be more seriously disturbed by both roads and villages however these core areas have high ranking orders indicating that they are more important for maintaining ecological corridors than core areas in other regions are therefore these core areas and corridors are preferable by both humans and ungulate species humans occupy some habitats and migratory corridors of wild species causing reductions in available living space and food of ungulate species liu et al 2017 therefore some human disturbances on species activities and migration will occur occasionally buij et al 2007 lin and li 2016 the negative effects of human activities in these core areas are more severe than the effects are in other core areas therefore the core areas in the eastern region should be the key conservation core areas and related scientific management measures should be implemented to mitigate pressures in these core areas there are also some core areas in the central and western regions that are disturbed by humans such as core area no 9 but these areas have low ranking orders therefore these areas are of low priority for conservation resource allocation however even though the removal of core area no 9 had the least impact on corridor loss compared with the removal of other core areas the area of ecological corridors in the resulting current map was still one third less than that the corridor area found when all core areas were considered ecological sources therefore although there is an order of conservation priority every core area of these nature reserves is extremely important for maintaining ecological corridors for ungulate species 4 2 the applicability of the circuit theory based approach to determine the importance degree of core areas in this study we proposed a new approach to determine the importance degree of core areas this approach is based on circuit theory which can explicitlyand quantitatively determine landscape connectivity and the area of ecological corridors pelletier et al 2014 in past studies the least cost path model was commonly used to construct ecological corridors but this method can only provide one optimal least cost path avon and bergès 2016 larue and nielsen 2008 however wild species cannot always choose the best path by themselves due to complex factors such as topography or vegetation types in a given landscape y an et al 2020 conversely circuit theory is based on the random walk theory so the cumulative current density map can show all the migration possibilities for wild animals this is more in line with the behavioural characteristics of animals andthuscanbe more scientific and realistic mcrae et al 2008 there have been many studies on the effectiveness of nature reserves these studies have mainly focused on management effectiveness including management teams management procedures and management techniques almeida et al 2016 geldmann et al 2015 however this research ignores that the premise of management effectiveness is whether a nature reserve can effectively protect wildlife therefore it is of great importance to evaluate the effectiveness of nature reserves for wildlife protection zhao et al 2014 for example if a nature reserve is of low importance in protecting wild animals but many management resources are allocated to it it will cause unreasonable allocation and the waste of resources wu et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of wildlife protection of existing nature reserves first then the effectiveness of management methods can be evaluated finally according to the comprehensive analyses of protection effectiveness and management effectiveness different targeted protection strategies can be adopted for different nature reserves the method for evaluating the protection effectiveness of nature reserves in this study was to construct an ecological network of the study area and then compare the effects of nature reserves on improving the ecological corridors this method was goal oriented and helped to provide a scientific basis for maximizing the protection effect this research also faced some challenges in fact the ranking order of the core areas was different between the evaluation standards of landscape connectivity and corridor area theoretically the determination of conservation priority usually uses only one standard among landscape connectivity corridor number and corridor area machado et al 2020 however this approach can only show the situation of ecological networks one sidedly ng et al 2013 therefore we recommend sorting the importance degree of core areas based on the new core id index which uses the indicators of corridor area and average current value to comprehensively calculate the corridor quality this new index considers the impacts on both the landscape connectivity and migration corridors of wild species nevertheless this new index has some limitations due to the need to manually remove each core area and repeatedly generate ecological networks this approach is more suitable for cases in which there are a small number of nature reserves in a study area this approach will be more troublesome when incorporating a large number of reserves because of the large number of necessary computations relative software programmes could be developed based on this proposed principal to solve this issue this approach might contribute to the creation of a new standard for the evaluation of the importance degrees of core areas in addition the construction of resistance surfaces was also challenging to make the ecological networks more accurate the construction of resistance surfaces in this study was based on multiple resistance factors rather than on only one factor such as land use type undoubtedly a resistance surface based on multiple resistance elements can more accurately and realistically reflect the degree of resistance to the movement or migration of wild animals in the study area spear et al 2010 however this approach also causes a new issue the proper weighting of these resistance factors most studies use the equal weight overlapping method or determine the weights based on expert opinions to date there is no fixed or accurate standard zeller et al 2012 studies by rayfield et al and beier et al have shown that different resistance weights can indeed lead to changes in corridor positions beier et al 2009 rayfield et al 2009 however the locations of the corridors did not change considerably and are still similar beier et al 2009 therefore in this study we used the equal weight superposition method to construct the multivariate resistance surfaces attempting to obtain the approximate area of the corridors the reasonable weight assignment of the resistance factors still needs further study 4 3 implications for future conservation management after evaluation of the protection effectiveness of nature reserves we found that more than two thirds of ecological corridors in nature reserves are distributed in experimental areas the protection status of these corridors is still insufficiently strict therefore we suggest that the core area and buffer zone be expanded scientifically to protect the ecological corridors more effectively wan et al 2015 we also found that four fifths of the large area nature reserves contain no corridors which indicates that most of the land in these nature reserves contributes little to corridor protection in these areas such as the nature reserve in the western part of the study area there are few ecological corridors that need to be protected therefore we suggest that the determination of the positions and boundaries of future national parks should consider the ecological corridors and core areas with high priorities xue and zheng 1994 based on the high ranking orders and high disturbance degrees of human activities we recommend reinforcing protections and strengthening the control of human activities in core areas in the eastern region of the study area in addition these core areas have small geographical areas so we suggest expanding their areas based on the condition of neighbouring regions some management suggestions can also be made for instance local governments can formulate and further improve relative regulations about wildlife protection some substantial behaviours can be popularized such as the establishment of food source bases for wild species okello and d amour 2008 5 conclusion we took an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone in the qinghai tibet plateau as the study area and proposed a new index based on circuit theory to compare the importance degree of core areas we also analysed the protection effectiveness of nature reserves based on the above results the following points were obtained first regions with good landscape connectivity are mainly distributed in the middle and eastern regions of the study area which is consistent with the spatial distribution of resistant values some core areas cannot be well connected even if there is a short distance between them second by comparing the importance degree indexes of the core areas based on the landscape connectivity and ecological corridor area under scenarios in which a different core area is removed each time we obtained the important order of the core areas from the most important core area no 14 to the least important core area no 9 the results of the spatial ranking order showed that the importance degrees of the core areas in the study area were characterized by a gradual weakening in the direction from east to west third we found that the protection effectiveness of nature reserves was very low and only 16 11 of the existing nature reserves comprise corridors nearly half of the whole ecological corridor area is not under effective protection therefore our results revealed that it is necessary to study the importance degree of core areas this study can also provide a method reference for the analysis of ecological networks and the determination of reasonable positions of national parks in the

24692,nature reserves have been established globally to protect wild species however an issue remains how to determine the importance of core areas of nature reserves in maintaining the regional connectivity of corridors and the effectiveness of the core areas for species protection this study aims to solve this problem in an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone in the north eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau we used circuit theory to construct an ecological network for ungulate species an index core id was proposed to reflect the importance degree of core areas using the product of the average current value and the pixel number of the corridors the results showed that corridors are mainly located in the central and eastern regions of the study area which are areas with generally low resistance values we also generated the importance degree of core areas based on the core id index the spatial distribution of the importance degree of core areas is characterized by gradual weakening from east to west we found that the existing nature reserves are not sufficiently effective for the protection of ecological corridors and only 53 28 of corridors are under protection by nature reserves our study can guide conservation management in the study area and provide a reference method for determining the importance degree of core areas keywords circuit theory ecological corridor importance of core areas landscape connectivity the qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction in recent decades conflicts between wild species and human beings have attracted increased attention worldwide kuijper et al 2019 schley et al 2008 smeraldo et al 2020 thorn et al 2013 thouless and sakwa 1995 the main factors threatening wild species include the fragmentation of natural habitats fahrig 2003 sahraoui et al 2017 and the disturbance of movement pathways zhu et al 2005 although natural factors such as extreme climate events and geographical disasters can cause negative effects on wild species a large number of studies have shown that human activity is the foremost threat to the survival of wildlife herkert et al 2003 anthropogenic disturbances such as agricultural development y an et al 2020 road construction fu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 and mining activities su et al 2015 bear the most responsibility therefore many nature reserves have been established in most countries to protect wild species more than 2740 nature reserves have been established in china cao et al 2019 with the area and number of nature reserves increasing yearly the reduction of biodiversity and the deterioration of the ecological environment have improved xue and zheng 1994 however the effects of these improvements are still insufficient to reverse the downward trends guo and cui 2015 hao et al 2009 therefore china is stepping up efforts to establish and optimize a system of natural protected areas with national parks as the main body peng et al 2018 in the future the purpose of national parks in china will be to minimize the impact of human activities and to protect the natural landscape and biodiversity zhou and grumbine 2011 how to determine the boundaries and select the potential areas of national parks under the basic conditions of the vast national land area is a key scientific issue in the construction of the national park system in china every nature reserve is divided into three types of functional areas the core area buffer zone and experimental area wang et al 2011 among them the core area is the most important for wildlife protection the preserved natural state of the ecosystem and the concentrated distribution areas of rare and endangered animals and plants in the nature reserve are classified as the core area davison et al 1989 therefore in this study we focused on the importance of core areas to more precisely and effectively guide the allocation of conservation resources a buffer area is a zone of a certain area that can be drawn around the core area and only scientific research and observational activities are allowed the periphery of the buffer zone can be further divided into experimental areas at present 15 68 of the nature reserves in china are national level accounting for 65 66 of the total area of nature reserves wang et al 2016 such a large area ratio of national level nature reserves may lead to difficulties in the rational allocation of protection resources and ambiguities in protection priorities therefore there is an urgent need for the determination of the importance of the core areas of nature reserves which can provide a reference for the scientific management of nature reserves hockings 2004 there has been a trend in published research to solve the issue of wildlife protection through the establishment of ecological networks urban 2001 as an important component of ecological networks ecological corridors are essential for the migration of animals gene flow and other ecological processes mcrae et al 2016 the improvement of ecological corridors can contribute to solving ecological issues such as landscape fragmentation and habitat destruction leonard et al 2016 seoane et al 2010 several methods and software programs have been developed to construct ecological networks sahraoui et al 2017 these methods include the use of graph theory for landscape ecological assessment and planning zetterberg et al 2010 the determination of the relationship between the dispersal distance of mammals and the home range size of the mammals bowman et al 2002 and ecological corridor construction pittiglio et al 2014 the least cost path model was proposed by knaapen knaapen et al 1992 and is broadly used in research on species diffusion processes knaapen et al 1992 and analyses of landscape patterns adriaensen et al 2003 and ecological networks feng and sha 2006 yu 1996 the major deficiency of the least cost path model is that only one optimal path is provided between a pair of ecological sources circuit theory can solve this problem by demonstrating all possible pathways for wild species mcrae and paul 2007 in addition circuit theory incorporates structural connectivity and functional connectivity emphasizing the effect of permeability through fragmented landscapes on the movements of wild species mcrae et al 2008 dutta et al identified pinch points bottlenecks of corridors with a method combining the least cost distance and circuit theory dutta et al 2016 lechner et al presented multiscale connectivity planning in australia lechner et al 2015 recently circuit theory has been widely used in landscape connectivity evaluations considering the impacts of land cover change sahraoui et al 2017 and road construction boyle et al 2017 additionally many ecologists have used circuit theory to evaluate landscape connectivity and corridor quality aiming to determine the conservation priorities of ecological sources beier et al 2011 identifying the importance degree of core areas in regions that have unique wild species may be the most effective way to understand key targets in the process of biodiversity conservation hockings 2004 however a prescriptive standard has not yet been established lópez rodríguez and rosado 2017 considered the roof of the world the qinghai tibet plateau has an average elevation of over 4000 m li et al 2019 geographical factors form the distinctive climate conditions and unique ecosystems of the plateau zheng 1996 as the largest plateau in china it has extremely rich biodiversity zhang et al 2010 a large area of grassland covers the plateau and grows in the environment of extremely low temperatures zhong et al 2010 located in the north eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau the study area which is an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone is vitally important not only due to its geographical factors but also because of its unique biodiversity however the vegetation and biodiversity in the study area are vulnerable similarly to other regions of the qinghai tibet plateau the study area is extremely sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances li et al 2019 therefore several nature reserves have been established however the ecological protection of the area is still not optimistic for example the sanjiangyuan nature reserve is widely considered one key region among important global biodiversity areas dong et al 2010 myers et al 2000 after 10 years of protection ecological deterioration in the reserve has been preliminarily curbed and partially improved however the health status of the regional ecosystem is far from the ideal state and the biodiversity loss has not improved considerably sang et al 2011 existing human settlements and constructed roads also impact the protection effects of nature reserves this study selected ungulate species as the research species ungulates have strong movement and migration abilities given these above elements the determination of the core areas that are important for ungulate species was the key issue examined in this study we proposed a circuit based approach that uses core areas as the ecological source areas from which an individual different core area was removed each time to construct ecological networks then the variation degree of the landscape connectivity of ecological corridors was compared we also sought to solve the following issue can existing nature reserves effectively protect the migration and movement pathways of ungulate species we believe that the solutions to the above issues can provide a methodology framework based on circuit theory for use in determining the importance degrees of core areas this study also serves as an important reference for the conservation of nature reserves and the management of other landscapes similar to the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone located in the eastern region of the qinghai tibet plateau was selected as the study area according to the vegetation division of the plateau the study region has an area of 348 696 km2 and contains land from four provinces fig 1 grassland covers 80 4 of the total area and 13 4 of the total area is covered by bare land the terrain is dominated by the plateau with an average elevation of 4463 m the altitude gradually decreases from west to east the study area has a typical plateau alpine climate with an annual average temperature of 2 9 c the monthly average temperature ranges from 7 5 c in january to 12 5 c in july the annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 700 mm the region is quite rich in wild animal and plant resources wild plants such as ophiocordyceps sinensis saussurea involucrata fritillaria gentiana macrophylla angelica sinensis codonopsis pilosula and moschus can be found throughout most of the study area hundreds of wild animal species live in the study area some of which are listed as nationally protected wildlife mainly including crossoptilon crossoptilon tetraogallus tibetanus grus nigricollis pseudois nayaur moschus chrysogaster panthera uncia vulpes ferrilata and ursus arctos in this study we focused mainly on wild species that have strong movement and migration abilities therefore ungulate species were selected as the research species most of which are endangered due to natural and anthropogenic threats in the qinghai tibet plateau some ungulate species such as the tibetan wild ass equus kiang wild yak bos mutus and argali ovis ammon have been listed as national key protected animals according to the wildlife protection law of the people s republic of china without very fixed habitats these species have rough distribution areas buzzard et al 2010 inaddition the tibetan antelope pantholops hodgsonii has a strong migratory ability lian et al 2007 the tibetan gazelle procapra picticaudata and blue sheep pseudois nayaur are widelydistributed and have large populations as herbivores these species commonly inhabit alpine meadows at altitudes of 3000 to 6000 m the animals have the ability to endure hardship cold hunger and thirst and have strong adaptability to the environmental conditions of the alpine grassland 2 2 data sources the land use data in 2017 used in this study was downloaded from the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn this data contains a number of detailed land use categories according to the specific situation of the study area and the principal purpose of this study we generalized the land use categories into nine land use types forest cropland wetland bare land grassland shrubland water residential area and snow ice digital elevation model dem data with a resolution of 30 m was downloaded from the geospatial data cloud website http www gscloud cn which directly provides the elevation information of the study area mean annual ndvi normalized difference vegetation index data in 2017 with a pixel resolution of 1000 m was derived from mod13q1 data mod13q1 is the vegetation index of nasa s modis product this data is based on the maximum synthesis method and has been geometrically and atmospherically corrected the transportation infrastructure data 1 250000 scale in the vector format was obtained from the road network database of the national fundamental geographical information centre downloaded from http www ngcc cn we obtained village data from the 1 250000 scale basic database of the national fundamental geographical information center liu et al 2008 we also used the distribution data of nature reserves which was downloaded from the china nature reserve database 2 3 construction of the resistance surfaces as circuit theory is based on a hypothesis that assumes wild animals to be random walkers the assignment of resistance values becomes a critical part of the ecological network construction mcrae 2006 generally resistance values characterize the degree to which barriers affect the movements of wild species the greater the resistance value of a region is the harder it is for wild animals to pass through the region poor et al 2012 as many studies have suggested land use type is the most important factor impacting the distribution of wild species anzures dadda and manson 2006 in the study area two main natural factors the elevation and slope impact the movement routes of three ungulate species zeller et al 2012 in addition wildlife can be guided by the degree of vegetation cover and species on the qinghai tibet plateau are no exception kong et al 2010 they prefer vegetation intensive areas although they have strong adaptabilities to difficult conditions such as low vegetation density and bare land ndvi can characterize the degree of vegetation cover therefore we selected four variables land use type ndvi elevation and slope to facilitate the integration of natural barriers into the generation of the resistance surfaces the anthropogenic barriers represented by roads and villages were used to evaluate the impacts of human activities on core areas and corridors and to determine the key conservation core areas according to the degrees to which of ungulate species prefer certain habitat types each resistance factor was assigned a suite of resistance values according to different ranges chardon et al 2003 in this study the resistance values were determined for five degrees 1 for extremely suitable areas 10 for suitable areas 40 for sub suitable areas 60 for neutral areas 80 forunfavorable areas and 100 for barrier areas y an et al 2020 the specific assignment of resistance values is shown in table 1 all these single resistance layers were overlapped with equal weights to form a comprehensive resistance surface then this combined resistance data was converted to a raster layer with a resolution of 1000 m 2 4 determination of the importance degree of core areas through ecological network construction circuit theory assumes that the study area is a conductive surface and models all possible movement pathways of wild animals by injecting currents into the landscape mcrae et al 2008 the circuitscape software was designed to assess landscape connectivity and model ecological networks shah and mcrae 2008 in this study circuitscape 4 0 was used to perform the circuit theory calculations we input the resistance surface and ecological sources into the software and cumulative current maps that can be considered ecological networks were produced as outputs areas with high current values show that there are suitable potential pathways for the movement of wild species the specific ecological significances of the circuit theory elements are shown in the supplementary material in this study we determined the importance degree of core areas based on circuit theory combined with the graph theory method first we considered all 18 core areas to be ecological sources and input the core areas into the circuitscape software with the comprehensive resistance surface the complete ecological network was then generated then the core area denoted no 1 was removed from the suite of ecological sources and the remaining 17 core areas and the resistance surface were used to output the ecological network of no 1 following the same method for each repetition one core area was removed from the suite of ecological sources until the last core area no 18 had been removed thus we obtained a complete ecological network based on the consideration of all 18 core areas as ecological sources and 18 ecological networks based on 17 core areas as ecological sources after the ecological networks were constructed using circuit theory we defined the areas with current values greater than 0 4 as ecological corridors based on the distributions of the value ranges in the current maps to determine the importance degree of core areas we proposed a new index core id importance degree of core area considering the impact on both landscape connectivity and ecological corridors this index uses the product of the average current value of each corridor and the pixel number of the corridor to demonstrate the corridor quality which can reflect the importance degree of core area if the corridor quality is seriously impacted when a core area is removed this core area is determined to be important for maintaining landscape connectivity and corridors therefore the lower the core id index of a given core area is the higher the ranking order of the core area is cor e i d average current value of the corridor pixel number of the corridor 2 5 evaluation of the effectiveness of existing nature reserves for maintaining ecological corridors to optimize the layout of nature reserves and improve the effectiveness of the nature reserve network we evaluated the protection effectiveness of the existing nature reserves by overlaying the data of the whole nature reserve on the ecological corridors to more quantitatively demonstrate the protection efficiency we calculated the proportion of the area of nature reserves to the entire study area then we calculate the proportion of corridor areas under the protection of nature reserves to the total corridor area and to the whole nature reserves finally we obtained the ratios of the corridors in the core area buffer zone and experimental area in addition we calculated the road density and village number of each core area to determine which core areas were seriously impacted in an attempt to determine the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on ecological corridors we clipped the point data of human settlements in regions of ecological corridors 3 results 3 1 resistance analysis of the study area the resistance surfaces are shown in fig 2 in terms of land use the resistance situation of almost the whole area is optimistic the resistance factor of ndvi is large in the whole study area especially in the western and mid northern regions the resistance factor of the slope shows that a large area of the southern region is not suitable for the migration of ungulate species from the perspective of elevation the eastern area shows low resistance for the movement of wild species while most areas in the western region are under resistance values greater than 60 when analysed together the four maps of individual resistance factors reflect that the resistance situation in the east is better than that in the west through the overlay of these four single resistance factors a comprehensive resistance surface was generated as shown in fig 2e the overall resistance showed a significant decreasing trend from west to east with extremely high resistance values the regions indicated by the redcolor in the west are not suitable for the movement of ungulate species 3 2 the landscape connectivity analysis in the study area we generated 18 current density maps fig 3 and calculated the maximum and average current values of each map see the supplementary materials each result was based on the scenario in which one core area is removed it is obvious that the current maps of nos 12 and 13 are considerably different from the others almost all of the western regions in the maps of nos 12 and 13 are brown indicating that these regions are characterized by poor landscape connectivity for ungulate species therefore the absence of core areas in no 12 and 13 could cause a significant drop in landscape connectivity in the western region the cumulative current density map generated by the circuitscape 4 0 software is also shown in fig 3 in which all 18 core areas were considered ecological source areas the dark green areas denote regions with high current values indicating high landscape connectivity and the ecological corridors are mainly located in these regions regarding the spatial distribution of regions with good landscape connectivity these regions are mainly distributed in the middle and eastern parts of the study area these regions comprise areas with generally low resistance values and their current values tend to be higher overall than those in western regions the core areas are well connected in the mid northern and south eastern regions which is mainly due to the dense distribution of the core areas in these regions and the short distances between them some core areas are far apart from each other but can form good connections for instance there are good connections between the core areas of no 16 and no 9 no 14 and no 18 and no 14 and no 1 large areas of the regions between these three pairs of core areas have relatively low resistance values which makes it easier for currents to pass through and form strong landscape connectivity in contrast the distance between some core areas such as between no 8 and no 11 is very short but there is almost no connection between them more importantly not only the region between these two core areas but also almost the whole western region constituting nearly half of the study area has few areas with good landscape connectivity for these reasons the two basic elements that control the ecological network construction ecological sources and resistance surfaces are not optimal in the western region the number of ecological sources in the western region is lower than those in the central and eastern regions additionally the resistance values in the western region are generally higher than those in other regions these two reasons make it difficult for the current to pass easily through most areas of the western region resulting in poor overall landscape connectivity 3 3 the degree of importance of core areas for improving ecological corridors fig 4 shows the spatial distributions and areas of the ecological corridors under 18 scenarios the core id index results and their ranking orders are shown in table 2 ecological corridors are severely damaged when either core area no 14 or 18 is removed under these scenarios nearly half of the corridors are lost these two core areas play important roles in improving ecological corridors when core area no 9 is removed the loss of ecological corridors is very small and the area of ecological corridors is the largest in this scenario among the 18 scenarios therefore this core area has the lowest contribution to the connectivity between nature reserves in other words compared with other core areas the presence or absence of this core area has the least impact on changes in the area of ecological corridors therefore this core area obtained the lowest ranking finally we determined the final importance degree of core areas for improving ecological corridors based on the core id index as shown in table 2 the conservation priorities were identified the most important core area was no 14 and the least important core area was no 9 we spatialized the ranking order of the core areas in the study area the large figure in fig 6 an obvious trend is that the ranking order of the core areas decreases from east to west the no 9 core area is located in the central study area but it is not an important core area for maintaining ecological corridors and it has the lowest ranking order core areas no 14 and 18 which are located at the border of the study area have the highest ranking orders the spatialized ranking order of the core areas is consistent with the spatial distribution of the ecological corridors the importance degree of the core areas in the study area are characterized by a gradual weakening from east to west 3 4 analysis of the effectiveness of protection of nature reserves as shown in fig 4 there are only the mid northern mid southern and eastern regions of the study area contain several large area corridors resulting in relatively good connectivity in only a few small scale areas a large portion of the study area is faced with a serious situation consisting of poor landscape connectivity and few ecological corridors the existing core areas mainly the sanjiangyuan national nature reserve cannot support a high quality ecological network in the entire study area even if the complete nature reserves including not only the core areas but also the buffer zones and experimental areas are overlaid on the study area the result is still not ideal fig 5 the complete nature reserves have a large area accounting for 35 06 of the study area however the protection efficiency of the complete nature reserves is relatively low and only 16 11 of the whole nature reserves comprises corridors large areas of nature reserves and ecological corridors are distributed in the mid southern region but the area in which they overlap is not large the overlapping area is less than half of the corridor region in addition only 53 28 of the ecological corridors are located in the whole nature reserve area indicating that nearly half of the ecological corridors are not under effective protection we found that more than two thirds of the ecological corridors in nature reserves are distributed in experimental areas there are constructed roads and villages in almost all of the core areas fig 6 the number of roads differs greatly among these core areas it is extremely obvious that core areas nos 15 and 17 are severely disturbed by constructed roads more importantly there are only four core areas in the large region in the south eastern part of the study area therefore the protection effect of the core areas in this large scale region is not optimistic and still needs to be improved villages are densely distributed in some core areas such as nos 9 and 17 the bar graph quantitatively demonstrates the number of villages in core areas there are fewer than 5 villages in more than half of the core areas only the core areas nos 1 9 and 11 have more than 10 villages the core area no 17 has only 5 human settlements however the village distribution in no 17 is denser than in some core areas that have more than 5 villages mainly due to its small area therefore this core area is faced with severe pressure not only from transportation infrastructure but also from human settlements villages are extremely densely distributed in the ecological corridors in the red frame shown in fig 7 more importantly the western region of the study area has only one corridor and it is severely impacted by human settlements which will allow little movement or and few migration pathways for the three ungulate species the northern and eastern corridors are less disturbed by humans than the corridors in the south 4 discussions 4 1 analysis of key conservation core areas based on ranking order and anthropogenic disturbances after comprehensively considering the impacts of roads and settlements the core areas in the eastern region of the study area were generally found to be more seriously disturbed by both roads and villages however these core areas have high ranking orders indicating that they are more important for maintaining ecological corridors than core areas in other regions are therefore these core areas and corridors are preferable by both humans and ungulate species humans occupy some habitats and migratory corridors of wild species causing reductions in available living space and food of ungulate species liu et al 2017 therefore some human disturbances on species activities and migration will occur occasionally buij et al 2007 lin and li 2016 the negative effects of human activities in these core areas are more severe than the effects are in other core areas therefore the core areas in the eastern region should be the key conservation core areas and related scientific management measures should be implemented to mitigate pressures in these core areas there are also some core areas in the central and western regions that are disturbed by humans such as core area no 9 but these areas have low ranking orders therefore these areas are of low priority for conservation resource allocation however even though the removal of core area no 9 had the least impact on corridor loss compared with the removal of other core areas the area of ecological corridors in the resulting current map was still one third less than that the corridor area found when all core areas were considered ecological sources therefore although there is an order of conservation priority every core area of these nature reserves is extremely important for maintaining ecological corridors for ungulate species 4 2 the applicability of the circuit theory based approach to determine the importance degree of core areas in this study we proposed a new approach to determine the importance degree of core areas this approach is based on circuit theory which can explicitlyand quantitatively determine landscape connectivity and the area of ecological corridors pelletier et al 2014 in past studies the least cost path model was commonly used to construct ecological corridors but this method can only provide one optimal least cost path avon and bergès 2016 larue and nielsen 2008 however wild species cannot always choose the best path by themselves due to complex factors such as topography or vegetation types in a given landscape y an et al 2020 conversely circuit theory is based on the random walk theory so the cumulative current density map can show all the migration possibilities for wild animals this is more in line with the behavioural characteristics of animals andthuscanbe more scientific and realistic mcrae et al 2008 there have been many studies on the effectiveness of nature reserves these studies have mainly focused on management effectiveness including management teams management procedures and management techniques almeida et al 2016 geldmann et al 2015 however this research ignores that the premise of management effectiveness is whether a nature reserve can effectively protect wildlife therefore it is of great importance to evaluate the effectiveness of nature reserves for wildlife protection zhao et al 2014 for example if a nature reserve is of low importance in protecting wild animals but many management resources are allocated to it it will cause unreasonable allocation and the waste of resources wu et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of wildlife protection of existing nature reserves first then the effectiveness of management methods can be evaluated finally according to the comprehensive analyses of protection effectiveness and management effectiveness different targeted protection strategies can be adopted for different nature reserves the method for evaluating the protection effectiveness of nature reserves in this study was to construct an ecological network of the study area and then compare the effects of nature reserves on improving the ecological corridors this method was goal oriented and helped to provide a scientific basis for maximizing the protection effect this research also faced some challenges in fact the ranking order of the core areas was different between the evaluation standards of landscape connectivity and corridor area theoretically the determination of conservation priority usually uses only one standard among landscape connectivity corridor number and corridor area machado et al 2020 however this approach can only show the situation of ecological networks one sidedly ng et al 2013 therefore we recommend sorting the importance degree of core areas based on the new core id index which uses the indicators of corridor area and average current value to comprehensively calculate the corridor quality this new index considers the impacts on both the landscape connectivity and migration corridors of wild species nevertheless this new index has some limitations due to the need to manually remove each core area and repeatedly generate ecological networks this approach is more suitable for cases in which there are a small number of nature reserves in a study area this approach will be more troublesome when incorporating a large number of reserves because of the large number of necessary computations relative software programmes could be developed based on this proposed principal to solve this issue this approach might contribute to the creation of a new standard for the evaluation of the importance degrees of core areas in addition the construction of resistance surfaces was also challenging to make the ecological networks more accurate the construction of resistance surfaces in this study was based on multiple resistance factors rather than on only one factor such as land use type undoubtedly a resistance surface based on multiple resistance elements can more accurately and realistically reflect the degree of resistance to the movement or migration of wild animals in the study area spear et al 2010 however this approach also causes a new issue the proper weighting of these resistance factors most studies use the equal weight overlapping method or determine the weights based on expert opinions to date there is no fixed or accurate standard zeller et al 2012 studies by rayfield et al and beier et al have shown that different resistance weights can indeed lead to changes in corridor positions beier et al 2009 rayfield et al 2009 however the locations of the corridors did not change considerably and are still similar beier et al 2009 therefore in this study we used the equal weight superposition method to construct the multivariate resistance surfaces attempting to obtain the approximate area of the corridors the reasonable weight assignment of the resistance factors still needs further study 4 3 implications for future conservation management after evaluation of the protection effectiveness of nature reserves we found that more than two thirds of ecological corridors in nature reserves are distributed in experimental areas the protection status of these corridors is still insufficiently strict therefore we suggest that the core area and buffer zone be expanded scientifically to protect the ecological corridors more effectively wan et al 2015 we also found that four fifths of the large area nature reserves contain no corridors which indicates that most of the land in these nature reserves contributes little to corridor protection in these areas such as the nature reserve in the western part of the study area there are few ecological corridors that need to be protected therefore we suggest that the determination of the positions and boundaries of future national parks should consider the ecological corridors and core areas with high priorities xue and zheng 1994 based on the high ranking orders and high disturbance degrees of human activities we recommend reinforcing protections and strengthening the control of human activities in core areas in the eastern region of the study area in addition these core areas have small geographical areas so we suggest expanding their areas based on the condition of neighbouring regions some management suggestions can also be made for instance local governments can formulate and further improve relative regulations about wildlife protection some substantial behaviours can be popularized such as the establishment of food source bases for wild species okello and d amour 2008 5 conclusion we took an alpine shrub meadow vegetation zone in the qinghai tibet plateau as the study area and proposed a new index based on circuit theory to compare the importance degree of core areas we also analysed the protection effectiveness of nature reserves based on the above results the following points were obtained first regions with good landscape connectivity are mainly distributed in the middle and eastern regions of the study area which is consistent with the spatial distribution of resistant values some core areas cannot be well connected even if there is a short distance between them second by comparing the importance degree indexes of the core areas based on the landscape connectivity and ecological corridor area under scenarios in which a different core area is removed each time we obtained the important order of the core areas from the most important core area no 14 to the least important core area no 9 the results of the spatial ranking order showed that the importance degrees of the core areas in the study area were characterized by a gradual weakening in the direction from east to west third we found that the protection effectiveness of nature reserves was very low and

24693,the interaction of shortwave radiation with vegetation drives basic processes of the biosphere such as primary productivity species interactions through light competition and energy fluxes between the atmosphere vegetation and soil here we aim to understand the effects of leaf functional trait diversity on canopy light absorption we focus on the diversity of three key functional traits

leaf optical properties lop leaf angle distribution lad and leaf area index lai asner 1998 xiao et al 2014 while lai is connected to variation in biomass the other two describe canopy structure with lop representing biochemical leaf composition and structure jacquemoud et al 2019 and lad representing architectural plant characteristics here we aim to demonstrate how functional diversity affects vegetation light interactions in forest communities we focus on lai lad and lop diversity effects on 1 the albedo of canopies as an indicator of shortwave energy fluxes and 2 the canopy integrated measure and vertical distribution of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar as an indicator of light available for photosynthesis to investigate these relationships we combined a classical experimental design following biodiversity ecosystem functioning studies with a 3d radiative transfer model dart gastellu etchegorry et al 1996 to conduct an in silico biodiversity experiment 2 methods 2 1 functional diversity terminology in this study we chose two diversity metrics that capture the ecological similarity of plant characteristics in relation to the function of plant light interactions plant functional type richness and trait diversity we refer to plant functional type pft as a group of individuals with similar in our case identical traits tsakalos et al 2019 we define different pfts along lop or and lad gradients we use the term pft richness in analogy to species richness to represent the number of pfts in the canopy this metric allowed us to utilize the classical biodiversity experimental design that is most often based on species richness gradients ranging from monocultures to mixed communities see 2 2 modelling design experiments 1 and 2 for the details we refer to trait diversity as the distance between the lai lop or lad values of two pfts lai diversity was represented by distance in lai values lop diversity by the distance between leaf transmittance or leaf absorptance values and lad diversity as the distance between foliage gap fractions of two pfts these metrics allowed us to study the mechanisms behind the observed pft richness absorptance relationships see 2 2 modelling design experiment 3 for the details 2 2 modelling design we performed three in silico experiments to investigate the effect of pft richness on the light environment we first simulated 6 pfts along the lai lad and lop gradients and studied their effects on albedo and fapar we then retrieved vertical profiles of fapar of different pfts in the canopy to analyse light redistribution to study the effect of pft richness along both lop and lad axes simultaneously we performed a second experiment where we used a 4 lad 4 lop factorial design and retrieved albedo in the third experiment we investigated the effect of the functional trait diversities on the change in absorbed energy we chose a representation at regular intervals of lai lad and lop levels as lai values gap fraction and leaf reflectance and transmittance respectively experiment 1 we designed an in silico biodiversity experiment based on 6 pfts along lai lad or lop gradients arranged on a rectangular regular spaced grid fig 1 we simulated 60 trees along these gradients and repeated this subset in all horizontal directions see section 2 3 and fig 2 for the details on parametrization we chose values of 1 6 for lai 1 representing an analogy of the one leaf model and 6 as maximum realistic lai for forests asner et al 2003 lai was parameterized in dart through the foliage density variable see supplementary table 4 for the details selected lad values include both realistic and extreme angular distributions while the set of lop was chosen from the northern temperate and boreal species with intention to have the most different lop see supplementary table 2 for the representation of the pft parametrization see fig 2 to account for the effects of specific spatial configurations we used a canopy composed of 60 trees and averaged our results across ten different spatial randomizations for the mixture combinations experiment 2 to simulate communities composed of trees that varied in two traits simultaneously we used a 4 lai 4 lad factorial design with 16 trait compositions see supplementary fig 1 for the modelling design we simulated a scene of 72 trees as this size allowed us to test 15 out of 16 combinations of the trait richness levels and for the 16th we took the average across the spatial configuration the scene was repeated in all horizontal directions experiment 3 to investigate the relationship between differences in traits and the net biodiversity effect we simulated all possible mixtures of two pfts bicultures along lai lad and lop gradients to quantify the differences in trait values we aimed at a representation at regular intervals along a gradient the lai gradient was already represented by the lai values so we took bicultures simulated in experiment 1 for the lad trait we choose gap fraction the probability of a vertical ray of light passing through the canopy without encountering any plant elements as a quantitative measure of lad we varied the foliage gap fraction from 0 to 1 with the interval 0 1 by choosing the corresponding leaf angle distributions see supplementary table 3 for details we then calculated the difference in absorptance between mixtures and monocultures for each difference in gap fraction between monocultures for the lop trait we varied pft s leaf reflectance and transmittance from 0 to 1 with interval 0 1 under the restriction of their sum being less or equal to 1 we then calculated the mean values of the net biodiversity effect among all bicultures with a certain difference in transmittance and absorptance values we simulated the bicultures on the scenes of 4 trees repeated in all horizontal directions 2 3 model parametrization we utilized the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model dart version 5 7 4 gastellu etchegorry et al 1996 to perform the in silico biodiversity experiments see github repository https github com plekhanovaelena dart article for the simulations and the code for visualisation the dart 3d radiative transfer model has been shown to accurately represent light scattering and redistribution in the canopy gastellu etchegorry et al 2012 and specifically forest canopy radiation malenovský et al 2008 schneider et al 2014 the dart model implements a landscape as a 3d matrix of cells with turbid medium and or triangles and allows for the tracking of radiation fluxes within the 3d canopy including multiple reflections and mutual shading schneider et al 2014 and calculates radiative budget components 2 3 1 plant and canopy representation vegetation was represented with 3d models of trees fig 1a each consisting of a cylindrical trunk and a crown represented by a cloud of triangles leaves uniformly distributed within an ellipsoid shape this representation of the crown allowed us to account for multiple reflections within canopies we chose an ellipsoid crown shape as it has been shown to closely approximate natural characteristics rautiainen et al 2008 parameters of individual trees such as height trunk diameter etc but not lai lad and lop were fixed at the values representing average betula pendula characteristics from hovi et al 2016 see supplementary table 1 for details to test different diversity scenarios we simulated a 3d forest scene 30 m 50 m with 1 m voxel size with a group of 60 regularly distributed trees fig 1b with different lai lad and lop values fig 1c e 2 3 2 background understory representation the total amount of radiation absorbed by a tree canopy is the sum of trunk and foliage absorptance before the radiation reaches the background understory vegetation and the radiation captured after reflection from the forest floor to investigate these contributions we performed our simulations with different optical properties of backgrounds as a natural background we took litter optical properties as a representative of forest floor optical properties we explored the canopy contribution by simulating a black total absorption background and understory contribution by subtracting the canopy contribution from the observed fapar when assuming a natural vegetated understory terminology adopted from hovi et al 2016 additionally we performed simulations on a white background to amplify the effect of the understory and better understand the trend of the understory contribution to the overall canopy effect 2 3 3 illumination and radiation the simulations were carried out assuming direct illumination only black sky and completely isotropic diffuse illumination white sky black sky albedo is not dependent on assumptions of atmospheric scattering properties and is commonly used as an input in climate modelling lewis and barnsley 1994 black sky albedo and fapar were simulated for two sun zenith angles 0 and 30 the white sky case was included to represent a diffuse illumination scenario approximating cloudy days 2 4 albedo and fapar to approximate canopy reflected shortwave radiation we calculated the canopy directional hemispherical and hemispherical hemispherical albedo schaepman strub et al 2006 in the visible and shortwave infrared ranges λ 400 nm to 2500 nm with equal spectral intervals δλ 50 nm at the top of the canopy 1 1 a l b e d o λ 400 nm 2500 nm e x i t a n c e λ λ 400 nm 2500 nm i r r a d i a n c e x λ where e x i t a n c e λ is the total hemispherical exitance w m 2 µm 1 for the wavelength λ and i r r a d i a n c e x λ is the spectral irradiance for the wavelength λ with x indicating the directional distribution of the incident radiation i e x d for incident mono directional radiation and x h for hemispheric incident radiation to quantify the trait diversity effect we calculated albedo change as the difference between the albedo of the mixture and the average of the albedo values of the corresponding monocultures 2 albe do chan ge albed o mix 1 pfts pfts in mixt ure albed o mon we refer to albedo change in as the albedo change divided by the average albedo value of the corresponding monoculture second term in eq 2 we refer to shortwave absoptance change as minus albedo change as an approximation of the photosynthetic activity of the plants we utilized the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar where par is 400 700 nm in our study we were interested in the fapar profile of the tree canopy so we calculated f a p a r h as the average fapar at height h see 3 3 f a p a r h 1 c e l l s h c e l l s h λ 400 nm 700 nm e n e r g y i n t e r c e p t e d p e r c e l l λ λ 400 nm 700 nm i r r a d i a n c e o f u p p e r c e l l t o p f a c e x λ where c e l l s h is the set of cells within the layer at height h in a single tree space supplementary fig 2 analogous to the albedo change we calculated fapar change 4 fapar chan ge fapa r mix 1 pfts pfts fapa r mon we refer to fapar change in as the fapar change divided by the average fapar values of corresponding monocultures second term in eq 4 3 results here we first discuss the pft richness effects on albedo and fapar then focus on the vertical fapar redistribution between pfts and finally address the underlying mechanisms of the biodiversity effect 3 1 diverse canopies have a lower albedo and higher fapar than expected from averaging monocultures we simulated all combinations of pfts realizing all possible pft richness levels from 2 to 6 see methods for details on experiment design the typical value of albedo for the monoculture stands was 0 17 and of fapar 0 96 we found the highest albedo change for the lai trait mixtures had 0 5 6 lower albedo than monocultures then for the lad trait 0 4 and the lowest for the lop trait 0 2 1 2 on the natural background fig 3 a the gain in fapar was correspondingly highest for lai 0 02 0 5 then for lad 0 0 18 and lowest for lop 0 0 01 fig 3b we tested different illumination conditions and backgrounds we found that the biodiversity effect of lop mixtures was not sensitive to them whereas lad mixtures had a smaller positive diversity effect with a 30 sun angle compared with 0 and under overcast conditions compared with direct illumination only where the sign of the effect depended on the background supplementary fig 3 lai mixtures showed very similar results under different illumination conditions on the natural or white background we then looked at the canopy vs understory contributions of the observed effect see section 2 3 2 for details the diversity effect on albedo and fapar was about twice larger with trees standing on the white background and smaller on black background lai and lad mixture results were much more sensitive to the background compared with lop mixtures we then tested how this difference behaved in the 2 trait mixtures we found decreased albedo with increasing pft richness supplementary fig 4 3 2 fapar redistribution between pfts within functionally rich canopies does the overall gain in fapar imply that each pft in the mixture will receive more light we looked at individual profiles of an average tree of each lai and lad pft in different mixtures and found that some pfts gained light in mixtures while others lost compared with the same pfts in monocultures the lai experiment shows that a pft with lai 1 on average absorbed 6 less in 6 pfts mixtures than in monocultures while a pft with lai 6 absorbed 4 more fig 4 similar results were found in the lad experiment the pft with vertical leaves absorbed less light in 6 pft mixtures while the pft with horizontal leaves absorbed more see supplementary fig 5 we hypothesized that the observed effect is related to the canopy understory interactions for example the most transparent pft is transmitting the highest amount of radiation which is then absorbed either by the same pft in monocultures or by different pfts in mixtures resulting in the observed light partitioning alternatively the effect could have arisen solely due to multiple reflections between the foliage of different pfts without understory contribution to test this hypothesis we constructed fapar profiles of the same pfts without accounting for the understory reflectance implementing a black background and with exaggerated understory reflectance implementing a white background fig 4 on the black background the fapar profiles were very similar and there was almost no difference between the fapar of monocultures and mixtures on the white background each pft absorbed more light especially in the lower part of the foliage and the same pft lost or gained light but at higher magnitudes 3 3 why do mixtures absorb more radiation than monocultures in section 3 1 we showed that combining pfts with different trait values leads to increased absorptance of shortwave radiation so we hypothesized that the more distinct pfts we combine the bigger this absorptance would be to test this hypothesis we first represented the lai lad and lop pfts in regular intervals along a gradient to quantify the difference in trait values see methods section 2 2 we then compared the shortwave absorptance of all possible mixtures of two pfts bicultures with corresponding monocultures we found that the biodiversity effect increases with the trait distance for all three traits studied fig 5 4 discussion many experiments have shown that mixed tree stands are more productive than monocultures huang et al 2018 this effect arises from multiple interdependent components including water nutrient and light availability and their use efficiencies and results in growth related secondary responses which in turn can alter resource acquisition or stand structural diversity forrester and bauhus 2016 the effects of individual resources are difficult to distinguish especially for light related variables that depend on the overall canopy architecture and individual scattering components leaves branches trunk understory properties as well as multiple reflections between these components using a 3d radiative transfer model we were able to isolate the light interception from the growth related secondary responses 4 1 lad and lop pft richness decrease albedo and increase fapar in mixtures we found a negative pft richness shortwave albedo relationship which implies that less shortwave radiation is reflected from the canopy back to the atmosphere in more diverse canopies for the photosynthetically active domain our results support previous findings that vegetation complexity increases the amount of absorbed radiation in visible and near infrared wavelength ranges for tropical forests crown openness was shown to contribute a gain of 0 3 0 8 in yearly par captured by a mixture compared to the null expectation based on monoculture performance sapijanskas et al 2014 based on our parametrization we found a slightly smaller contribution of lad and lai pft richness occurring at one point in time 0 0 18 gain in instant fapar of mixtures for lad and 0 02 0 5 for lai fig 3b this instant increase in fapar through time continuously contributes to the increase of light available for photosynthesis sapijanskas et al 2014 this may in turn facilitate plant growth and contribute to overyielding as well as result in multiple growth related secondary responses associated with increasing biodiversity 4 2 sensitivity of the biodiversity effect to different backgrounds and illumination conditions for lop trait pft richness effects on albedo and fapar remained robust on different backgrounds and under different illumination conditions supplementary fig 3 which suggests that they arise mainly from the multiple scattering of radiation within and between trees and do not depend on the time of day cloudiness or understory characteristics in contrast lad pft richness effects strongly depend on understory characteristics and illumination supplementary fig 3 these results are expected e g assuming a vertical lad and 0 sun zenith angle most light first hits the understory and is then scattered back up to the canopy whereas under overcast conditions or on the black background this effect would not take place lai mixtures show similar positive biodiversity effects under different illumination conditions but a very small effect on the black background suggesting the effect arises mainly from the canopy understory interplay interestingly on the black background with the overcast scenario we see that albedo increases with lad pft richness our explanation of this exception refers to the decrease of the canopy transmittance due to the trapping of radiation by multiple scattering in more diverse hence structurally more complex canopies overall while the lop pft richness effect occurs mainly due to the trapping of radiation into the diverse foliage the lai and lad pft richness effects are determined by the amount of radiation scattered from the forest floor 4 3 light partitioning in mixtures despite the overall gain in fapar of mixtures our findings suggest unequal light partitioning between pfts in mixtures meaning some pfts absorb more light in mixtures while others absorb less fig 4 supplementary fig 5 we observed that the most transparent pft that absorbed less in monocultures e g lai 1 or with vertical lad lost light in mixtures while the least transparent gained light in mixtures lai 6 or with horizontal lad and this gain occurred mostly in the lower crown level we propose the following explanation for this effect the light is transmitted through the most transparent pft is then reflected by the understory and finally reaches either the same pft in monocultures or mostly other pfts in mixtures note that in the par region around 95 of the light that reaches the leaves is absorbed so we expect the most transparent pft to absorb more light in monocultures than in mixtures this explanation implies that the effect mainly arises from the portion of light that is reflected by the understory so we tested this by simulating different backgrounds we concluded that this pft richness effect on light partitioning indeed occurs mainly due to the canopy understory interactions this inequality can contribute to differences in the growth related secondary responses of different species in mixtures dahlin et al 2019 forrester et al 2018 it can also create a positive feedback loop for diversification of some traits e g in the light constrained canopies the species with the highest lai would gain light and potentially develop even higher lai and the opposite would happen with the species with lowest lai as we discuss in the next section this diversification would also have an effect on the overall change in albedo and hence the shortwave radiation budget 4 4 absorption of mixtures in relation to functional diversity how does increasing absorptance of mixtures depend on functional diversity we found that combining monocultures with more distinct traits led to a greater gain in the radiation of mixtures fig 5 for lai and lad the highest diversity effect occurs when one of the pfts has a much higher lai or gap fraction than the other which is in accordance with our previous conclusion for the lop the biodiversity effect is strongly dependent on the lop diversities which explains why the fapar change is much smaller than albedo change see fig 1 as the difference between lop in the visible range is much smaller than in the rest of the spectrum these findings can help predict light related biodiversity effects based on the traits of monocultures and hence contribute to understanding the overyielding effect as well as changes in the shortwave radiative balance of the mixed canopies 4 5 robustness of the results there are several assumptions of the described implementation of the model which may influence the outcomes including spatial configuration a tree parametrization and extreme pft values to ensure the spatial robustness of our results we averaged the results across ten different spatial configurations we also performed an additional simulation with white spruce tree parametrization see supplementary table 5 and obtained very similar results see supplementary figs 6 7 finally we investigated the effect along the lad gradient excluding the vertical lad which had a strong effect because of extreme transmittance for the vertical radiation we found similar trends though of a much smaller magnitude supplementary figs 8 9 4 6 assumptions and parametrization the goal of our analysis was to isolate plant light interactions and investigate lad and lop pft richness and trait diversity effects in a specifically designed in silico experiment to do so we made several simplifying assumptions the most important of which we address here we choose a 3d radiative transfer model dart which allows for a detailed representation of vegetation and calculates multiple interactions between light and individual scattering components gastellu etchegorry et al 2012 as the dart is not a growth model it does not allow for the simulation of canopy development we tracked albedo at the top of the canopy and excluded atmospheric effects the black and white background parametrization represent extreme scenarios close to the bare soil and full ground snow cover we employed it to assess the floor and canopy contributions and complemented it with more realistic forest litter ground optical properties to assess the trend in absorptance on different backgrounds we modelled the sun angles of 0 and 30 and ideal diffuse radiation that represent the sun at noon in central latitudes and idealistic overcast conditions we used these to assess trends in light absorptance under different illumination conditions to isolate lai lad and lop pft richness and diversity effects from the growth related secondary responses we parameterized all pfts in monocultures identically to the ones in the mixture for each pft all leaves had the same lop and simplistic lad without variability within one tree e g vertical variability of lad within canopy we also assumed identical crown architecture and single layer canopy to simplify the interpretation of the biodiversity experiment the effect of crown architecture and spatial complementarity in tree crowns on light overyielding in mixtures was already addressed in multiple studies barillot et al 2014 forrester et al 2018 williams et al 2017 although the pfts do not correspond to different species they nevertheless allowed us to study trait diversity and richness which can be generalized to inter and intraspecific variability as well as variation in growing processes fahey et al 2019 thomas et al 2020 4 7 conclusion our study shows that functionally diverse communities have higher light interception fapar and reduced albedo through the radiative transfer effects alone excluding all other effects like variation in architecture or growth this suggests that such effects could also be at play in real communities where it is not so straightforward to separate cause and effects credit

tsakalos et al 2019 we define different pfts along lop or and lad gradients we use the term pft richness in analogy to species richness to represent the number of pfts in the canopy this metric allowed us to utilize the classical biodiversity experimental design that is most often based on species richness gradients ranging from monocultures to mixed communities see 2 2 modelling design experiments 1 and 2 for the details we refer to trait diversity as the distance between the lai lop or lad values of two pfts lai diversity was represented by distance in lai values lop diversity by the distance between leaf transmittance or leaf absorptance values and lad diversity as the distance between foliage gap fractions of two pfts these metrics allowed us to study the mechanisms behind the observed pft richness absorptance relationships see 2 2 modelling design experiment 3 for the details 2 2 modelling design we performed three in silico experiments to investigate the effect of pft richness on the light environment we first simulated 6 pfts along the lai lad and lop gradients and studied their effects on albedo and fapar we then retrieved vertical profiles of fapar of different pfts in the canopy to analyse light redistribution to study the effect of pft richness along both lop and lad axes simultaneously we performed a second experiment where we used a 4 lad 4 lop factorial design and retrieved albedo in the third experiment we investigated the effect of the functional trait diversities on the change in absorbed energy we chose a representation at regular intervals of lai lad and lop levels as lai values gap fraction and leaf reflectance and transmittance respectively experiment 1 we designed an in silico biodiversity experiment based on 6 pfts along lai lad or lop gradients arranged on a rectangular regular spaced grid fig 1 we simulated 60 trees along these gradients and repeated this subset in all horizontal directions see section 2 3 and fig 2 for the details on parametrization we chose values of 1 6 for lai 1 representing an analogy of the one leaf model and 6 as maximum realistic lai for forests asner et al 2003 lai was parameterized in dart through the foliage density variable see supplementary table 4 for the details selected lad values include both realistic and extreme angular distributions while the set of lop was chosen from the northern temperate and boreal species with intention to have the most different lop see supplementary table 2 for the representation of the pft parametrization see fig 2 to account for the effects of specific spatial configurations we used a canopy composed of 60 trees and averaged our results across ten different spatial randomizations for the mixture combinations experiment 2 to simulate communities composed of trees that varied in two traits simultaneously we used a 4 lai 4 lad factorial design with 16 trait compositions see supplementary fig 1 for the modelling design we simulated a scene of 72 trees as this size allowed us to test 15 out of 16 combinations of the trait richness levels and for the 16th we took the average across the spatial configuration the scene was repeated in all horizontal directions experiment 3 to investigate the relationship between differences in traits and the net biodiversity effect we simulated all possible mixtures of two pfts bicultures along lai lad and lop gradients to quantify the differences in trait values we aimed at a representation at regular intervals along a gradient the lai gradient was already represented by the lai values so we took bicultures simulated in experiment 1 for the lad trait we choose gap fraction the probability of a vertical ray of light passing through the canopy without encountering any plant elements as a quantitative measure of lad we varied the foliage gap fraction from 0 to 1 with the interval 0 1 by choosing the corresponding leaf angle distributions see supplementary table 3 for details we then calculated the difference in absorptance between mixtures and monocultures for each difference in gap fraction between monocultures for the lop trait we varied pft s leaf reflectance and transmittance from 0 to 1 with interval 0 1 under the restriction of their sum being less or equal to 1 we then calculated the mean values of the net biodiversity effect among all bicultures with a certain difference in transmittance and absorptance values we simulated the bicultures on the scenes of 4 trees repeated in all horizontal directions 2 3 model parametrization we utilized the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model dart version 5 7 4 gastellu etchegorry et al 1996 to perform the in silico biodiversity experiments see github repository https github com plekhanovaelena dart article for the simulations and the code for visualisation the dart 3d radiative transfer model has been shown to accurately represent light scattering and redistribution in the canopy gastellu etchegorry et al 2012 and specifically forest canopy radiation malenovský et al 2008 schneider et al 2014 the dart model implements a landscape as a 3d matrix of cells with turbid medium and or triangles and allows for the tracking of radiation fluxes within the 3d canopy including multiple reflections and mutual shading schneider et al 2014 and calculates radiative budget components 2 3 1 plant and canopy representation vegetation was represented with 3d models of trees fig 1a each consisting of a cylindrical trunk and a crown represented by a cloud of triangles leaves uniformly distributed within an ellipsoid shape this representation of the crown allowed us to account for multiple reflections within canopies we chose an ellipsoid crown shape as it has been shown to closely approximate natural characteristics rautiainen et al 2008 parameters of individual trees such as height trunk diameter etc but not lai lad and lop were fixed at the values representing average betula pendula characteristics from hovi et al 2016 see supplementary table 1 for details to test different diversity scenarios we simulated a 3d forest scene 30 m 50 m with 1 m voxel size with a group of 60 regularly distributed trees fig 1b with different lai lad and lop values fig 1c e 2 3 2 background understory representation the total amount of radiation absorbed by a tree canopy is the sum of trunk and foliage absorptance before the radiation reaches the background understory vegetation and the radiation captured after reflection from the forest floor to investigate these contributions we performed our simulations with different optical properties of backgrounds as a natural background we took litter optical properties as a representative of forest floor optical properties we explored the canopy contribution by simulating a black total absorption background and understory contribution by subtracting the canopy contribution from the observed fapar when assuming a natural vegetated understory terminology adopted from hovi et al 2016 additionally we performed simulations on a white background to amplify the effect of the understory and better understand the trend of the understory contribution to the overall canopy effect 2 3 3 illumination and radiation the simulations were carried out assuming direct illumination only black sky and completely isotropic diffuse illumination white sky black sky albedo is not dependent on assumptions of atmospheric scattering properties and is commonly used as an input in climate modelling lewis and barnsley 1994 black sky albedo and fapar were simulated for two sun zenith angles 0 and 30 the white sky case was included to represent a diffuse illumination scenario approximating cloudy days 2 4 albedo and fapar to approximate canopy reflected shortwave radiation we calculated the canopy directional hemispherical and hemispherical hemispherical albedo schaepman strub et al 2006 in the visible and shortwave infrared ranges λ 400 nm to 2500 nm with equal spectral intervals δλ 50 nm at the top of the canopy 1 1 a l b e d o λ 400 nm 2500 nm e x i t a n c e λ λ 400 nm 2500 nm i r r a d i a n c e x λ where e x i t a n c e λ is the total hemispherical exitance w m 2 µm 1 for the wavelength λ and i r r a d i a n c e x λ is the spectral irradiance for the wavelength λ with x indicating the directional distribution of the incident radiation i e x d for incident mono directional radiation and x h for hemispheric incident radiation to quantify the trait diversity effect we calculated albedo change as the difference between the albedo of the mixture and the average of the albedo values of the corresponding monocultures 2 albe do chan ge albed o mix 1 pfts pfts in mixt ure albed o mon we refer to albedo change in as the albedo change divided by the average albedo value of the corresponding monoculture second term in eq 2 we refer to shortwave absoptance change as minus albedo change as an approximation of the photosynthetic activity of the plants we utilized the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar where par is 400 700 nm in our study we were interested in the fapar profile of the tree canopy so we calculated f a p a r h as the average fapar at height h see 3 3 f a p a r h 1 c e l l s h c e l l s h λ 400 nm 700 nm e n e r g y i n t e r c e p t e d p e r c e l l λ λ 400 nm 700 nm i r r a d i a n c e o f u p p e r c e l l t o p f a c e x λ where c e l l s h is the set of cells within the layer at height h in a single tree space supplementary fig 2 analogous to the albedo change we calculated fapar change 4 fapar chan ge fapa r mix 1 pfts pfts fapa r mon we refer to fapar change in as the fapar change divided by the average fapar values of corresponding monocultures second term in eq 4 3 results here we first discuss the pft richness effects on albedo and fapar then focus on the vertical fapar redistribution between pfts and finally address the underlying mechanisms of the biodiversity effect 3 1 diverse canopies have a lower albedo and higher fapar than expected from averaging monocultures we simulated all combinations of pfts realizing all possible pft richness levels from 2 to 6 see methods for details on experiment design the typical value of albedo for the monoculture stands was 0 17 and of fapar 0 96 we found the highest albedo change for the lai trait mixtures had 0 5 6 lower albedo than monocultures then for the lad trait 0 4 and the lowest for the lop trait 0 2 1 2 on the natural background fig 3 a the gain in fapar was correspondingly highest for lai 0 02 0 5 then for lad 0 0 18 and lowest for lop 0 0 01 fig 3b we tested different illumination conditions and backgrounds we found that the biodiversity effect of lop mixtures was not sensitive to them whereas lad mixtures had a smaller positive diversity effect with a 30 sun angle compared with 0 and under overcast conditions compared with direct illumination only where the sign of the effect depended on the background supplementary fig 3 lai mixtures showed very similar results under different illumination conditions on the natural or white background we then looked at the canopy vs understory contributions of the observed effect see section 2 3 2 for details the diversity effect on albedo and fapar was about twice larger with trees standing on the white background and smaller on black background lai and lad mixture results were much more sensitive to the background compared with lop mixtures we then tested how this difference behaved in the 2 trait mixtures we found decreased albedo with increasing pft richness supplementary fig 4 3 2 fapar redistribution between pfts within functionally rich canopies does the overall gain in fapar imply that each pft in the mixture will receive more light we looked at individual profiles of an average tree of each lai and lad pft in different mixtures and found that some pfts gained light in mixtures while others lost compared with the same pfts in monocultures the lai experiment shows that a pft with lai 1 on average absorbed 6 less in 6 pfts mixtures than in monocultures while a pft with lai 6 absorbed 4 more fig 4 similar results were found in the lad experiment the pft with vertical leaves absorbed less light in 6 pft mixtures while the pft with horizontal leaves absorbed more see supplementary fig 5 we hypothesized that the observed effect is related to the canopy understory interactions for example the most transparent pft is transmitting the highest amount of radiation which is then absorbed either by the same pft in monocultures or by different pfts in mixtures resulting in the observed light partitioning alternatively the effect could have arisen solely due to multiple reflections between the foliage of different pfts without understory contribution to test this hypothesis we constructed fapar profiles of the same pfts without accounting for the understory reflectance implementing a black background and with exaggerated understory reflectance implementing a white background fig 4 on the black background the fapar profiles were very similar and there was almost no difference between the fapar of monocultures and mixtures on the white background each pft absorbed more light especially in the lower part of the foliage and the same pft lost or gained light but at higher magnitudes 3 3 why do mixtures absorb more radiation than monocultures in section 3 1 we showed that combining pfts with different trait values leads to increased absorptance of shortwave radiation so we hypothesized that the more distinct pfts we combine the bigger this absorptance would be to test this hypothesis we first represented the lai lad and lop pfts in regular intervals along a gradient to quantify the difference in trait values see methods section 2 2 we then compared the shortwave absorptance of all possible mixtures of two pfts bicultures with corresponding monocultures we found that the biodiversity effect increases with the trait distance for all three traits studied fig 5 4 discussion many experiments have shown that mixed tree stands are more productive than monocultures huang et al 2018 this effect arises from multiple interdependent components including water nutrient and light availability and their use efficiencies and results in growth related secondary responses which in turn can alter resource acquisition or stand structural diversity forrester and bauhus 2016 the effects of individual resources are difficult to distinguish especially for light related variables that depend on the overall canopy architecture and individual scattering components leaves branches trunk understory properties as well as multiple reflections between these components using a 3d radiative transfer model we were able to isolate the light interception from the growth related secondary responses 4 1 lad and lop pft richness decrease albedo and increase fapar in mixtures we found a negative pft richness shortwave albedo relationship which implies that less shortwave radiation is reflected from the canopy back to the atmosphere in more diverse canopies for the photosynthetically active domain our results support previous findings that vegetation complexity increases the amount of absorbed radiation in visible and near infrared wavelength ranges for tropical forests crown openness was shown to contribute a gain of 0 3 0 8 in yearly par captured by a mixture compared to the null expectation based on monoculture performance sapijanskas et al 2014 based on our parametrization we found a slightly smaller contribution of lad and lai pft richness occurring at one point in time 0 0 18 gain in instant fapar of mixtures for lad and 0 02 0 5 for lai fig 3b this instant increase in fapar through time continuously contributes to the increase of light available for photosynthesis sapijanskas et al 2014 this may in turn facilitate plant growth and contribute to overyielding as well as result in multiple growth related secondary responses associated with increasing biodiversity 4 2 sensitivity of the biodiversity effect to different backgrounds and illumination conditions for lop trait pft richness effects on albedo and fapar remained robust on different backgrounds and under different illumination conditions supplementary fig 3 which suggests that they arise mainly from the multiple scattering of radiation within and between trees and do not depend on the time of day cloudiness or understory characteristics in contrast lad pft richness effects strongly depend on understory characteristics and illumination supplementary fig 3 these results are expected e g assuming a vertical lad and 0 sun zenith angle most light first hits the understory and is then scattered back up to the canopy whereas under overcast conditions or on the black background this effect would not take place lai mixtures show similar positive biodiversity effects under different illumination conditions but a very small effect on the black background suggesting the effect arises mainly from the canopy understory interplay interestingly on the black background with the overcast scenario we see that albedo increases with lad pft richness our explanation of this exception refers to the decrease of the canopy transmittance due to the trapping of radiation by multiple scattering in more diverse hence structurally more complex canopies overall while the lop pft richness effect occurs mainly due to the trapping of radiation into the diverse foliage the lai and lad pft richness effects are determined by the amount of radiation scattered from the forest floor 4 3 light partitioning in mixtures despite the overall gain in fapar of mixtures our findings suggest unequal light partitioning between pfts in mixtures meaning some pfts absorb more light in mixtures while others absorb less fig 4 supplementary fig 5 we observed that the most transparent pft that absorbed less in monocultures e g lai 1 or with vertical lad lost light in mixtures while the least transparent gained light in mixtures lai 6 or with horizontal lad and this gain occurred mostly in the lower crown level we propose the following explanation for this effect the light is transmitted through the most transparent pft is then reflected by the understory and finally reaches either the same pft in monocultures or mostly other pfts in mixtures note that in the par region around 95 of the light that reaches the leaves is absorbed so we expect the most transparent pft to absorb more light in monocultures than in mixtures this explanation implies that the effect mainly arises from the portion of light that is reflected by the understory so we tested this by simulating different backgrounds we concluded that this pft richness effect on light partitioning indeed occurs mainly due to the canopy understory interactions this inequality can contribute to differences in the growth related secondary responses of different species in mixtures dahlin et al 2019 forrester et al 2018 it can also create a positive feedback loop for diversification of some traits e g in the light constrained canopies the species with the highest lai would gain light and potentially develop even higher lai and the opposite would happen with the species with lowest lai as we discuss in the next section this diversification would also have an effect on the overall change in albedo and hence the shortwave radiation budget 4 4 absorption of mixtures in relation to functional diversity how does increasing absorptance of mixtures depend on functional diversity we found that combining monocultures with more distinct traits led to a greater gain in the radiation of mixtures fig 5 for lai and lad the highest diversity effect occurs when one of the pfts has a much higher lai or gap fraction than the other which is in accordance with our previous conclusion for the lop the biodiversity effect is strongly dependent on the lop diversities which explains why the fapar change is much smaller than albedo change see fig 1 as the difference between lop in the visible range is much smaller than in the rest of the spectrum these findings can help predict light related biodiversity effects based on the traits of monocultures and hence contribute to understanding the overyielding effect as well as changes in the shortwave radiative balance of the mixed canopies 4 5 robustness of the results there are several assumptions of the described implementation of the model which may influence the outcomes including spatial configuration a tree parametrization and extreme pft values to ensure the spatial robustness of our results we averaged the results across ten different spatial configurations we also performed an additional simulation with white spruce tree parametrization see supplementary table 5 and obtained very similar results see supplementary figs 6 7 finally we investigated the effect along the lad gradient excluding the vertical lad which had a strong effect because of extreme transmittance for the vertical radiation we found similar trends though of a much smaller magnitude supplementary figs 8 9 4 6 assumptions and parametrization the goal of our analysis was to isolate plant light interactions and investigate lad and lop pft richness and trait diversity effects in a specifically designed in silico experiment to do so we made several simplifying assumptions the most important of which we address here we choose a 3d radiative transfer model dart which allows for a detailed representation of vegetation and calculates multiple interactions between light and individual scattering components gastellu etchegorry et al 2012 as the dart is not a growth model it does not allow for the simulation of canopy development we tracked albedo at the top of the canopy and excluded atmospheric effects the black and white background parametrization represent extreme scenarios close to the bare soil and full ground snow cover we employed it to assess the floor and canopy contributions and complemented it with more realistic forest litter ground optical properties to assess the trend in absorptance on different backgrounds we modelled the sun angles of 0 and 30 and ideal diffuse radiation that represent the sun at noon in central latitudes and idealistic overcast conditions we used these to assess trends in light absorptance under different illumination conditions to isolate lai lad and lop pft richness and diversity effects from the growth related secondary responses we parameterized all pfts in monocultures identically to the ones in the mixture for each pft all leaves had the same lop and simplistic lad without variability within one tree e g vertical variability of lad within canopy we also assumed identical crown architecture and single layer canopy to simplify the interpretation of the biodiversity experiment the effect of crown architecture and spatial complementarity in tree crowns on light overyielding in mixtures was already addressed in multiple studies barillot et al 2014 forrester et al 2018 williams et al 2017 although the pfts do not correspond to different species they nevertheless allowed us to study trait diversity and richness which can be generalized to inter and intraspecific variability as well as variation in growing processes fahey et al 2019 thomas et al 2020 4 7 conclusion our study shows that functionally diverse communities have higher light interception fapar and reduced albedo through the radiative transfer effects alone excluding all other effects like variation in architecture or growth this suggests that such effects could also be at play in real communities where it is not so straightforward to separate cause and effects credit

24694,understanding why animals move as they do when searching for resources is a central question in ecology and a prerequisite for the development of predictive process based models for conservation and management many species are central place foragers cpf while several models for cpfs have been proposed they often assume well defined return rules to the focal point like breeding for some cpfs however the decisions to return to central sites are governed by multiple interactions between environmental and physiological factors we present agentseal a behaviour and physiology based spatially explicit agent based model we use harbour seals a marine cpf as a case study and focus on individuals outside their breeding and moulting seasons to capture general fine and large scale movements and drivers behind cpf we model movement decisions based on optimal foraging strategy cognitive and physiological processes in a realistic landscape coupled with realistic prey distribution and tuned to a range of behavioural and physiological patterns observed at different scales and levels of organisation pattern orientated modelling pom the model can reproduce energetic movement and other behavioural patterns such as net energy balance at sea and on land site fidelity daily activity budgets and trip extents the model reveals the crucial elements needed to model return trips of cpfs including movement characteristics that vary as a function of local environmental conditions cognitive mapping of foraging areas as points of attraction in subsequent foraging trips and physiological requirements defining switches between resting and foraging we discuss potential applications and extensions of the model including investigations of fundamental questions in foraging ecology how spatial distribution and aggregation of resources affect movement of marine cpfs what are the main drivers behind their at sea site fidelity to foraging patches we also discuss applied objectives such as improving our understanding of population level consequences of anthropogenic disturbances and ultimately evolving agentseal into a practical management tool keywords optimal foraging marine central place foragers process based modelling harbour seals 1 introduction understanding why animals move as they do when searching for resources is a central question in ecology and a prerequisite for the development of predictive process based movement models for conservation and management for example boult et al 2018 such models can increase our understanding of complex decision making by mobile animals a predictive process driven movement model should be able to establish a direct link between individual movement decisions and future distributional energetic and fitness consequences and vice versa if additionally such models are spatially explicit animal movement can be modelled based on a realistic landscape and realistic management scenarios which also allows for modelling of specific areas and populations of interest agent based models abms are particularly suitable for this purpose as they allow us to explicitly represent individual animals and their behavioural decisions individual movement can be simulated in a spatially explicit setting and based on fundamental ecological principles such as optimal foraging and learning nabe nielsen et al 2018a railsback and grimm 2012 abms can be especially useful whenever variability amongst individuals local interactions with the environment or adaptive behaviour are considered essential deangelis and grimm 2014 railsback and grimm 2012 arriving at the appropriate level of complexity for such models is challenging under the framework of abm and pattern orientated modelling pom the mechanisms underlying movement decisions of individuals can be identified by contrasting movement patterns observed in nature with the emergent patterns of models railsback and grimm 2012 pom is a strategy for fitting models to multiple patterns observed at different scales and levels of organisation and thereby finding the right level of complexity and increasing the chance of capturing the internal organisation of the real system the goal is to produce structurally realistic models that capture in a simple yet useful way the system s generative mechanisms grimm and railsback 2012 models from which multiple empirically observed patterns emerge are likely to include the key processes responsible for animal movement decisions examples of such patterns are the spatial distribution of animals foraging trip extents and duration changes in time energy budgets and movement characteristics in relation to food availability in a variety of scenarios grimm et al 2005 one type of animal movement behaviour is central place foraging where animals repeatedly return to their resting sites or nests after each foraging trip modelling movement of central place foragers with the use of abms when the urge to return to the central point is clearly defined such as feeding offspring massardier galatà et al 2017 or going back to a safe resting place at night chudzińska et al 2016 has been conducted for several species movement of central place foragers when the urge to return to the central point is less understood has not been modelled extensively liukkonen et al 2018 used hypothetical energy thresholds above which animals returned to resting sites to model central place foraging of saimaa ringed seals phoca hispida saimensis however such hypothetical energy thresholds may be insufficient when multiple interacting factors such as the distance to the resting site predator risk or physiological state influence when central place foragers should return and where to here we present agentseal a behaviour and physiology based spatially explicit agent based movement model we use harbour seals phoca vitulina a marine central place forager as a case study and focus on adult individuals outside their breeding and moulting seasons to capture general foraging movements for these two seasons the urges to return to on land resting sites are clearly defined however outside these seasons the reasons why seals regularly haul out remain heavily debated schneider et al 1980 sparling et al 2007 terhune 1985 thompson et al 1998a we use the extensive telemetry data and literature on physiology and behaviour for this species gathered outside the breeding and moulting seasons for pom and calibration of the model we model movement decisions of this species based on physiological and behavioural urges in a heterogenous landscape coupled with realistic prey density and compare the resulting simulations to a range of observed behavioural and physiological patterns observed at different scales and levels of organisation harbour seals like several other pinniped species require haul out sites on land box 1 for resting moulting and breeding they show highly individualistic behaviour and inter individual variation in terms of movement at sea cunningham et al 2009 thompson et al 1998b foraging behaviour bowen et al 2002 diet sharples et al 2009 wilson and hammond 2016 and daily activity budget mikkelsen et al 2019 ramasco et al 2014 russell et al 2015 they spend the majority of their time within 50 km of haul out sites cunningham et al 2009 thompson et al 1998b and are therefore frequently exposed to anthropogenic activities such as offshore renewables shipping fishing and oil and gas activity thompson et al 2013 further they are known to be exposed to predation from other marine mammals and respond to changes in prey availability and quality de la vega et al 2016 wilson and hammond 2019 the aims of the model presented here are to i build a relatively simple movement model of adult harbour seals outside their breeding and moulting season ii capture general fine and large scale harbour seal movements that are consistent with telemetry observations energy balance and drivers behind central place foraging hauling out and at sea movement iii capture the high inter but low intra individual variability in observed movement and foraging behaviour iv identify which aspects of movement and general behaviour of this marine predator are having the strongest effects on the emergent patterns we discuss potential applications and extensions of the model including fundamental questions in foraging ecology and applied objectives such as improving our understanding of population level consequences of anthropogenic disturbances 2 materials and methods in this section we provide details on the life history and behaviour of the study species and present the general description of the agentseal model based on the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2020 2010 finally we describe the model use in a case study harbour seals from the east coast of scotland 2 1 study species harbour seals move between haul out sites and at sea foraging areas box 1 showing high site fidelity towards both of these sites they usually haul out in large groups but appear to forage alone 2 1 1 at sea foraging movement harbour seals spend most of their time close to shore and their foraging trips rarely extend more than 50 km from the haul out sites lasting usually 2 days cunningham et al 2009 thompson et al 1998b 1996 individual seals show high site fidelity to their foraging sites but seals from the same haul out sites can forage in different places cunningham et al 2009 sharples et al 2012 experience and memory have been suggested as the main drivers of at sea site fidelity austin et al 2006 2004 carter et al 2017 while at sea harbour seals mostly dive to the bottom irrespective of whether they are travelling or feeding mikkelsen et al 2019 ramasco et al 2014 their 2d at sea behaviour cannot therefore be easily divided into discrete modes such as travelling moving between foraging patches without consuming prey and feeding searching and obtaining food as observed for some other pinnipeds 2 1 2 resting and hauling out behaviour seals need to go back to land during the moulting and breeding seasons but the reasons for hauling out outside these periods is less known seals may have to haul out to sleep schneider et al 1980 to digest sparling et al 2007 for skin maintenance feltz and fay 1966 thompson et al 1998a and for predator avoidance terhune 1985 but harbour seals are also known to spend long periods resting at the sea surface or at the sea bottom to sleep or digest mikkelsen et al 2019 ramasco et al 2014 digestion is a costly physiological process that is incompatible with the physiological adjustments to diving and may therefore be delayed until after periods of active foraging sparling et al 2007 digestive constraints include stomach capacity and the rate at which food passes through the alimentary tract analysis of tracking and diving data from harbour seals reveals that harbour seals frequently rest at two temporal scales short resting 1 h and long resting 1 h ramasco et al 2014 short resting may be used by seals to pass food from the stomach further down the digestive tract where food is further digested during longer resting breaks resting at sea may be favourable if air temperature is high as it prevents overheating liwanag et al 2012 watts 1992 and it can enable seals to conserve energy by not travelling to a distant haul out site hauling out time on the other hand can be used for longer digestion it can also be used for sleeping predator avoidance and additionally skin cell and general maintenance such as avoidance of ecto parasites and algal growth thompson et al 1998a the peripheral tissues of harbour seals cannot metabolise properly at temperatures below 17 c feltz and fay 1966 so periodic hauling out can assist routine skin growth and maintenance all these reasons are referred to as non digestive reasons in the following sections 2 1 3 diet energy budget and habitat preferences harbour seals are generalist predators although individuals may specialise on different prey types they are bottom and pelagic feeders showing considerable inter individual variation in prey species and size foraging sites and seasonal variability araújo et al 2011 based on examining scat and stomach samples sandeels flat fish and gadoids have been found to be the dominant groups of fish prey in the north sea but the relative proportion of these groups vary seasonally and regionally sharples et al 2009 wilson and hammond 2016 adult harbour seals consume on average 3 8 4 8 kg of fish per day härkönen and heide jørgensen 1991 kastelein et al 2005 sharples et al 2009 wilson and hammond 2016 which has to support a daily energy expenditure of 14 3 21 43 mj day härkönen and heide jørgensen 1991 kastelein et al 2005 markussen et al 1990 renouf and noseworthy 1991 rosen and renouf 1998 sparling 2003 harbour seals tend to forage in inshore waters 50 m deep on a variety of sediment types the key driver of harbour seals distribution at larger spatial scales is however distance to haul out site as they need to return to land between foraging trips aarts et al 2008 grecian et al 2018 2 2 description of agentseal the odd overview design concepts details protocol we present a model termed agentseal to simulate movements and energetics of harbour seals termed mseals box 1 in a realistic landscape processes in the model such as mseals decisions take place in discrete 15 min time intervals in the following

the supplementary information si in the trace transparent and comprehensive model evaluation document which also includes the full odd grimm et al 2014 throughout the text we use phrases as defined in box 1 2 2 1 purpose and patterns we aim to build a relatively simple movement model of adult harbour seals which captures general fine and large scale harbour seal movements and reproduces their central place foraging and general behaviour outside the breeding and moulting seasons the model is based on optimal foraging theory assuming that seals adjust their behaviour like movement based on their physiological state and knowledge of prey availability in order to evaluate whether our model results in realistic behaviour of mseals we adopted the pattern orientated modelling approach pom grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2005 wiegand et al 2003 the chosen patterns can be grouped into four categories energetics energy intake and expenditure body reserves movement and other behavioural patterns spatial distribution of mseals visual comparison of tracks overlap of kernel densities characteristics of foraging trips box 1 duration and extent and fine scale movement step length and turning angle and proportion of different activities performed by mseal resting foraging and at sea foraging site fidelity we also evaluate one environmental pattern food depletion although there is no observed data on this pattern we still use it to understand whether food depletion may be an important driver of seal movement and behaviour we include a broad range of patterns to evaluate the performance of agentseal we use pom in two phases of the modelling cycle during model development it is used for parameterisation to check which combinations of parameter values resulted in realistic mseal behaviour and in model evaluation to establish whether the model outputs are sufficiently realistic for its intended application rykiel 1996 table 1 summarises which patterns are used within the modelling cycle and gives a brief description of the data sources used for the case study described below all patterns used in the parameterisation phase of the modelling can be compared quantitively see si for details 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model includes the following entities mseals landscape patches box 1 and on land resting sites haul out sites the entities can be characterised by static fixed over the entire model duration or dynamic updated at each time step state variables or a combination of these as listed in table 2 the spatial extent of the landscape can be based on any area defined by the user see case study for an example one time step in the model represents 15 min and each landscape patch in the model represents 1 1 km the model is programmed in netlogo 6 02 wilensky 1999 and the code is provided in the si section 9 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling processes the processes are structured into six procedures as described below they describe the central place foraging and haul out movements of adult harbour seals outside the breeding and moulting seasons the graphical description of the model flow is shown in fig 2 scheduling the order of the procedures is the same for each time step but as the model assumes no hierarchies amongst mseals the order in which individuals execute a given procedure is randomised at each time step for each mseal each state variable is immediately assigned a new value as soon as that value is calculated by a procedure table 2 1 t a v c r w b t a t 1 n 0 σ a forage this procedure represents mseals search for and capture of food fine scale movements of mseals are simulated using a mixture of correlated random walk crw and spatial memory behaviour resulting in biased movements correction of mseals heading pulling them back on track towards the target towards profitable memorised target places biased correlated random walk or bcrw the movement vector of each mseal v r e s is the sum of the vectors v c r w and v b i a s and has two components turning angle ta degrees 180 180 and length speed m s fig 1 t a v c r w is related to the turning angle at the previous time step multiplied by b 1 1 defining wiggliness of the movement eq 1 b is calibrated see section 2 2 of si and kept constant throughout the model run in the absence of noise n 0 σ b 1 would result in zigzagging and b 1 going in circles nabe nielsen et al 2013 noise n 0 σ is a change in turning angle drawn from a normal distribution with σ related to habitat suitability index hsi see case study for an example a measure of food availability bartumeus et al 2005 see section 1 7 1 2 in si as a result mseals have more tortuous movement in areas of higher food availability high hsi and transit through areas of low food availability low hsi ta v b i a s is the difference between mseal s current heading and heading towards the target see go to haul out and haul out procedures to see how the target is chosen the importance of the bias component of ta v r e s is proportional to i hsi the better the habitat quality the weaker the bias towards the target and ii distance to the target the closer to the target the stronger the bias see section 1 7 1 in the si for details of how these values are calculated the length of the resulting vector v r e s speed of mseals is drawn from a gamma distribution as observed based on the gps tracking of seals see eq 4 in the si and is independent of the speed of the previous time step mseals remember visited patches mpatch eq 2 and the amount of food captured in these patches eipatch eq 2 they also update their memory of haul out sites passed within a certain calibrated distance during foraging 2 km in the case study haul out memory does not decay with time memory of patches mpatch on the other hand decays with time during foraging mseals consume fish the amount of which is related to fish availability in the visited patches n fish m2 and a search rate sr m2 time step the actual number of fish consumed is then drawn from a poisson distribution poisson λ n sr and parameterised to resemble reality number of caught fish is then corrected for the level of mseals fat reserves based on the assumption that overweight seals have reduced diving capacity due to their increased buoyancy this amount is then translated into consumed energy kj based on observed diet composition of harbour seals the consumed fish are then subtracted from fish available in the patch food depletion there is currently no food replenishment in the model if mseals are too close to land they turn to avoid it except when they are about to haul out if the daily amount of consumed fish is not enough to cover daily energy expenditure for a certain number of days in a row 7 days in the case study mseals switch to exploratory large scale foraging movement there are two types of such movement and there is equal probability of a mseal choosing either after the hungry period i the crw is not biased towards any defined patch and ii the crw is biased towards one of the patches from the initial memory list see initialisation in the case study for details in either of these cases the previous memory of mseals is cleared except the initial knowledge of the area a time to rest mseals evaluate if it is time to rest based on the amount of food consumed need to digest if it is they further decide whether to rest at sea or go to a haul out site to digest this food based on the distance to various haul out sites close to the next haul out site b time to haul out even if mseals do not have to rest due to digestive constraints they evaluate if it is time to haul out if they haven t done so for a given time period need to haul out for non digestive reasons mseals are however less likely to haul out if in bad condition low blubber reserves general condition good this is based on the assumption that the need to continue foraging in order to regain condition has a priority over other drivers to haul out c rest at sea mseals rest at sea to digest food and the duration of this rest is influenced by mseals digestion capability stomach capacity or amount of consumed fish in relation to total body weight d go to haul out site this procedure is very similar to forage the difference is the target towards which the movement is biased in forage it is a patch in go to haul out site it is a haul out site the target haul out site is chosen based on current distances to the different haul out sites and the memory values of these sites related to the frequency of previous visits previously visited sites have highest memory value followed by sites which mseals previously passed by but were not visited and then remaining sites if mseals are not close to shore they move according to correlated random walk biased towards the target haul out site if mseals are close to shore they follow the shortest path along the shore to get to the haul out site e haul out mseals haul out for a duration depending on haul out reason digestive or non digestive this haul out site where this event actually takes place is assigned a higher memory value which does not decay with time at the end of the haul out event mseals evaluate which food patch to head to next each food patch stored in the memory has an attractiveness value calculated eq 2 based on mseals previous energy intake obtained in the patch eipatch kj memory value since last visit of this patch mpatch is unitless and can be assigned values from 0 to 0 99 with 0 99 meaning that the patch has just been visited we used the same approach as mitchell and powell 2004 van moorter et al 2009 and implemented by nabe nielsen et al 2013 and let this attractiveness decrease linearly with euclidean distance to it dtarget m 2 a t t r a c t p a t c h m p a t c h e i p a t c h d t a r g e t patches which were visited recently which resulted in high prey capture and which are close to the haul out site are assigned the highest attraction value at the end of each time step mseals calculate their net energy intake nei as the difference between energy obtained from fish and expenditure if nei 0 mseals convert the excess energy into storage blubber otherwise they lose weight see section 1 7 6 in the si if the mass of blubber of mseals drops beneath 5 of their total body weight they die beltran et al 2017 mseals may only change their body mass growth change in body length is not included in the model 2 2 4 design concepts here we present a reduced version of this section of the odd a full version of this section containing all required subsections is presented in section 1 4 of the si 2 2 4 1 basic principles mseals optimise their foraging movements by increasing the time spent in good quality habitat and minimising distance travelled by relating their movements towards good patches they memorise visited habitat patches and are more likely to return to profitable ones this memory decays with time digestive constraints and non digestive reasons are the primary drivers behind resting and haul out behaviour 2 2 4 2 emergence the movement patterns emerge from mseals different movement characteristics turning angle and speed in relation to habitat quality from their ability to memorise and return to good quality patches their need to haul out and their choice of haul out sites energetic patterns emerge from a balance between energy needed for body maintenance energy expenditure and fish consumption energy intake and define changes in body mass and mass of reserves blubber behavioural patterns proportion of time spent resting at sea foraging and hauling out emerge from mseals physiological constraints for example digestive constraints distance to the next haul out site and energy intake defining whether to take a digestive break or not site fidelity emerges from the fact that seals are more likely to revisit a patch which resulted in efficient energy intake when visited previously and is close to a frequently visited haul out site finally environmental patterns food depletion result from the consumption of fish within the study site 2 2 4 3 objectives and learning the objective of mseals is to maximise their net energy intake while taking their digestive constraints and need to periodically haul out into account mseals increase their chance of finding fish by spending more time in good quality areas and returning to these if previous visits resulted in high food intake while they will transit through areas of low quality as marine environments are dynamic and heterogenous it is unlikely that animals can correctly learn and memorise the quality of all visited foraging patches over a long period of time and we therefore let memory decay logistically with time van moorter et al 2009 on the other hand seals can remember and return to haul out sites even after several years cordes and thompson 2015 mackey et al 2008 and mseals therefore remember all the visited haul out sites this knowledge does not decay with time 2 2 4 4 observation at the end of each time step all dynamic state variables are saved for each seal table 2 at the end of each simulation the final hsi of the patches are saved as well as the cumulative number of mseals visiting each water patch 2 3 simulation case study and model analysis 2 3 1 case study description and initialisation we test the model for one case study the east coast of scotland fig 3 using patterns presented in table 1 see sections 1 1 and 2 in the si for more details the model was initialised by creating 350 mseals the harbour seal population status for east scotland scos 2017 for 2010 2016 distributed over 16 haul out sites as per the survey data we ran simulations for three months starting from midnight 1 october representing the post moulting season in 15 min time intervals there is limited migration and exchange between subpopulations of harbour seals around scotland jones et al 2015 olsen et al 2017 sharples et al 2012 the model environment was thus considered a closed system and no new mseals appeared in the model over the model duration values of mseals state variables table 2 sex length and initial total mass and mass of body reserves basic metabolic rate a function of total body mass and stomach capacity a function of total body mass were assigned during initialisation section 1 5 in the si sex influenced initial body length and the relationship between body length and total body mass within the model no other processes differed between sexes as the case study is based on movement of adult seals we assume that mseals are not naïve seals at the beginning of the simulations but instead possess some knowledge about food distribution within the study site mseals initial list of memorised patches contains therefore the location of 90 of patches with highest hsi for each 25 25 km square see fig 2 in the si however the list of memorised haul out sites contained all the haul out sites within the study area all sites received a low value of memory level except the site on which mseal was currently hauling out this site s memory value is set to the maximum possible value mseal s energy expenditure energy intake and mass of consumed fish was set to zero at initialisation a list of all parameters and their values used to calculate state variables of case study entities is given in si table 2 in si the model landscape comprised 174 185 patches 32 190 km2 total and each patch was categorised as either land or water each water patch was assigned hsi value a proxy for habitat quality fig 3 hsi was based on a species distribution model sdm quantifying the relationship between observed locations of harbour seals in scotland and a range of environmental covariates depth sea surface temperature sediment type and distance to haul out sites grecian et al 2018 distance to haul out sites was the most important predictor of seal distribution to construct the suitability map we used all the covariates from the sdm except distance to haul out sites as we wanted the relationship between this distance and mseals distribution to be an emergent property of the model rather than letting it be enforced by the underlying habitat map for simplicity the results from the sdm were normalised to get hsi values between 0 and 1 each hsi value was then assigned an initial density of fish n fish m2 we estimated this density for the best patches patches with hsi 1 based on scientific survey catches and catchability estimates moriarty and greenstreet 2017 walker et al 2017 see as well section 1 5 1 in si for details and then for all the other patches calculated it as scaled value n nhsi 1 hsipatch the value used in agentseal in the case study was nhsi 1 4 fish m2 see section 2 3 in si for details 2 3 2 model analysis in case study parameter estimation and pom there were 36 parameters in the case study for agentseal twenty six of these were assigned values based on literature and data see table 2b in si the remaining ten parameters were obtained through indirect parameter estimation kramer schadt et al 2007 due to the large number of unknown parameters in the model and the possibility of interactions between them model parameter estimation was divided into two stages we first estimated parameters defining fine scale movement bcrw the remaining parameter values were estimated in the second stage using fixed values of the parameters assigned in the first stage these were parameters related to energy intake memory and haul out behaviour see section 2 in the si we used the patterns described in the previous section patterns 1 and 2 table 1 to filter parameter combinations which best represent the observed patterns inverse modelling kramer schadt et al 2007 for detailed description of the filtering as well as methods used to compare modelled and observed patterns see the si sections 2 and 5 the final simulation was repeated a further 49 times resulting in a total of 50 simulations 2 3 3 model analysis in the case study robustness analysis ra and sensitivity analysis sa the aim of the robustness analysis is to assess the extent to which different decisions about the model processes influence model dynamics and how robust the model is to major changes in its structure grimm and berger 2016 levins 1966 railsback and grimm 2012 thiele and grimm 2015 we therefore performed structural and analytical modifications of the model to understand which processes are essential to the model and when and why our model did not work i e when the model mechanisms that explained a certain phenomenon broke down for the ra we chose to focus on processes which are poorly understood and difficult to measure in nature we ran the following model modifications i no food depletion the number of available fish per patch did not change over the model duration the aim of this step was to test whether depletion was an important driver of seal movement and behaviour this modification is run over three months ii no memory at sea movement of mseals was only driven by crw mseals did not memorise the visited patches and did not move towards a specific target patch after leaving haul out sites instead they moved according to crw the movements were still biased toward the haul out sites once mseals switched to this behaviour this modification aimed at understanding whether the pom patterns especially movement patterns of the model emerge as a result of returning to previously visited food patches this modification is run over one month iii modified hsi in order to investigate the influence of the specific hsi map used here on model output we also ran the model using two artificial habitat suitability maps drawing a distribution of hot spots at random and a map with uniformly distributed prey these two modifications are run over three months the aim of the sensitivity analysis sa was to explore the influence of parameter values on the outputs of the model emergent patterns we ran the sa for parameters whose values were uncertain see section 6 1 in the si for details marino et al 2008 3 results 3 1 case study parameter selection the frequency distribution of turning angles ta of mseals was similar to observed fig 4 a pattern 1 1 in table 1 the observed and modelled correlations in turning angles between two consecutive steps are significant and comparable pearson s correlation r2 0 07 p 0 01 t1 276 040 39 2 for turning angles of the observed values and r2 0 09 p 0 01 t1 34 137 2 5 for the modelled values fig 4b pattern 1 2 table 1 the mean daily food consumption of mseals pattern 2 1 table 1 was 4 16 kg 1 3 kg mean sd throughout the result section which is within the observed values ranging 3 8 4 8 kg härkönen and heide jørgensen 1991 kastelein et al 2005 sharples et al 2009 wilson and hammond 2016 mean daily energy expenditure of mseals pattern 2 2 table 1 is 16 2 4 1 mj day sd around 50 means 0 14 mj day based on 50 simulations this fits within the range of observed values which are between 14 3 and 21 43 mj day the model reproduced no changes in blubber proportion pattern 2 3 table 1 over three month simulation as observed fig 5 b the majority of individuals did not exceed a blubber content of 40 of total body mass during 50 simulations none of the mseals reduced its blubber content to 5 of total body mass and consequently none died fig 5c mseals spend a similar mean proportion of time hauled out and resting at sea fig 5a pattern 2 4 table 1 as observed hauling out observed range reported in literature 12 25 cunningham et al 2009 ramasco et al 2014 russell et al 2015 vincent et al 2010 modelled 21 4 0 2 resting at sea observed 6 28 mcclintock et al 2013 mcconnell et al 1999 ramasco et al 2014 vincent et al 2010 modelled 9 2 0 4 fig 51a in the si the majority of haul out events 71 see figure 32 in si are triggered by non digestive reason the remaining 29 by digestion each mseal visits very few haul out sites consistent with the observations fig 6 a pattern 2 5 table 1 mseals perform longer in time foraging trips pattern 2 6 table 1 than observed and the model underestimates the number of very short foraging trips fig 6b and see also parameterisation in section 2 3 in the si the model produces a similar frequency distribution of extent of foraging trips pattern 2 7 table 1 to that observed fig 6c also the frequency distribution of mseals at sea positions with distance from the departure haul out site pattern 2 8 table 1 is similar to observed although the model overestimates the number of positions very close to the haul out sites and underestimates the number of positions 15 25 km from the sites fig 6d the model produces the same core areas of mseals geographical distribution pattern 2 9 table 1 as observed fig 6d the size of the kernels depends not only on number of observed seals but also the tagging place we only have information on harbour seals tagged off st andrews and aberdeen and have very few tracks from the firth of forth for place names see fig 3 mseals did not use the area east of st andrews the wee bankie fig 3 as intensely as the observed seals there were however only two observed seals frequently visiting the bank in the original data set which is also reflected in the absence of any hot spots with high hsi in this area we therefore consider the model to be able to capture the overall spatial distribution of seals there is very little variation between model results of the 50 replicates for all pom patterns fig 5 fig 6 3 2 case study model validation emerging patterns food depletion by mseals pattern 3 1 table 1 was calculated as percentage decreases in hsi of each patch from the beginning to the end of model simulation below we present the mean results of 50 simulations maximum decrease of hsi value due to depletion was 17 4 the highest depletion occurred along the coast close to the most popular haul outs fig 5d and fig 7 outside these areas food depletion was negligible we plotted foraging trips of five randomly chosen harbour seals for which we have telemetry data during the study period see details in section 2 3 of the si pattern 3 2 in table 1 we then visually compared it to five randomly chosen mseals from one simulation which visited the same haul out sites as the tracked seals the observed tracks show high inter individual variation which was reproduced by agentseal some mseals went further offshore some were more stationary and some repeatedly followed the coast as also observed fig 8 two of the observed seals were repeatedly visiting the wee bankie an offshore submarine sand gravel bank to the east of st andrews fig 3 fig 8 none of the mseals from the randomly chosen individuals visited this offshore area to compare at sea site fidelity of mseals and observed seals pattern 3 3 table 1 we quantified the extent to which the consecutive foraging trips of each of the randomly chosen seals as above mseals and observed overlapped to do it we divided the study are into 5 5 and 25 25 km squares see fig 3 in the si and calculated how many of these squares overlapped between the consecutive trips of each seal the model was able to reproduce a general observed site fidelity trend with most mseals having large overlap between consecutive trips fig 9 there was however large variation between individual mseals as well as between observed seals 3 3 sensitivity sa and robustness ra analysis a descriptive summary of these two analyses is presented below details and graphical description figures are provided in the si section 6 the sa indicated that results were robust to realistic variation in parameter values the largest changes were driven by parameters related to digestive physiology of mseals stomach capacity and the length of short digestive breaks figures 54 and 55 in the si removing food depletion from three month simulations had no effect on the model results section 6 2 2 in si removing memory resulted in mseals going further offshore than observed but the daily fish consumption and changes in proportion of blubber remained comparable to the results of the final model section 6 2 2 in the si applying the random habitat suitability map revealed that even if potential patches with high prey abundance may be present further offshore mseals still stayed relatively close to shore these landscape changes caused the mseals to consume more fish than real seals and resulted in an increase in time spent on digestion resting and higher food depletion than in the main model simulations with random hsi resulted in a better match between modelled and observed frequency distribution of trip duration than the final model but still underestimating the number of very short trips section 6 2 2 in si mseals moving over uniformly distributed habitat consumed similar amount of fish as observed and as in the final model simulation 4 discussion the primary purpose of modelling is to improve our understanding in this case of an ecological system grimm and berger 2016 this improved understanding can serve nature management and conservation especially when it can be used to answer what if scenarios agentseal is an abm which captures the main characteristics of movement behaviour and physiology of a marine central place forager it also identifies gaps in our understanding and can be used to set priorities for further research we have demonstrated that agentseal can reproduce a range of patterns observed at population and individual levels such as energetic patterns daily energy expenditure food consumption and change in proportion of stored blubber movement and other behavioural patterns fine scale movement characteristics number of visited haul out sites trip extent and distribution and daily activity budgets the model is able to realistically simulate high inter individual variability such as site fidelity towards haul out and foraging sites thus it generally succeeds in reproducing central place foraging of harbour seals as an emergent property of the model movement of central place foragers when the urge to return to the central point is clearly defined such as feeding the offspring or going back to den nest colony has been relatively well understood what drives animals to return to the central point outside these periods is still under debate agentseal is to our knowledge the first abm which models movement of marine central place foragers outside the breeding and moulting season which incorporates physiological behavioural and cognitive processes to drive this central place movement the model identifies mechanisms that are the main drivers behind this central place foraging movement physiological such as the need to rest due to digestive or non digestive constraints memory based movement and distribution and abundance of prey in our simulation experiment 29 of hauling out events are triggered by the need to digest whereas the remaining events are most likely related to other possibly physiological reasons such as skin maintenance or fatigue digestion may on the other hand be the primary mechanism defining resting at sea as compared with hauling out on land as the model can reproduce the observed proportion of time seals spend resting at sea the mechanism behind resting triggered by digestive constraints has mainly been studied on captive animals for example sparling et al 2007 understanding the mechanisms behind resting of wild seals and where this takes place on land at the sea surface or at the sea bottom mitani et al 2010 ramasco et al 2014 mikkelsen et al 2019 should be an important direction of future study which could be addressed by means of high resolution accelerometery devices coupled with gps while a lot of studies are dedicated to understanding how individuals forage optimally these seemingly important decisions to stay out at sea or return to land are still poorly understood without understanding these mechanisms the assessment of how on land and near shore at sea disturbance affects seals may be biased agentseal can be used as a tool to quantify this bias given our improved understanding of the mechanism behind resting as shown by the robustness analysis removing memory driven patch choice from the model results in mseals travelling further away from the shore and haul out sites than the observed seals and as expected they no longer show at sea site fidelity introducing unbiased correlated random walk results in mseals moving further away from their starting point for example börger et al 2008 compared with observed harbour seals however the addition of memory driven movement results in realistic site fidelity abrahms et al 2019 nabe nielsen et al 2013 estimation of the distribution and abundance of fish at fine spatial scales is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of marine resources and the logistics related to data collection in coastal areas where harbour seals often forage various environmental proxies have been used instead to represent habitat suitability for marine top predators grecian et al 2018 jones et al 2013 in agentseal we couple these proxies with realistic fish abundance other studies have used hypothetical or arbitrary numbers e g liukkonen et al 2018 and or artificially created landscapes massardier galatà et al 2017 measuring the actual caloric value and or fish abundance of different habitats instead of using proxies is the next challenge but see aarts et al 2019 ransijn et al 2019 the results of agentseal indicate that seals can still show similar realistic behaviour in different artificially created habitats see robustness analysis suggesting that the application of agentseal to new regions where hsi maps would be different in detail will be successful but at the same time the comparison of the results of simulations of three different habitat types final randomly generated and uniform show that the structure of habitat influences behaviour of seals exploring alternative optimal foraging strategies based on giving up times see discussion by mcnair 1982 nonacs 2001 as exemplified by nabe nielsen et al s 2018a harbour porpoise model and foraging in relation to prey clustering mitchell and powell 2004 weimerskirch 2007 are two strong foci for the future use of agentseal the results of the main model and their modification in ra indicate that if the food is concentrated in a few places as in the case study there are individuals which benefit from foraging in such areas individuals which do not find such areas are of poorer condition in the uniform habitat all individuals perform similarly agentseal can therefore be used as a tool to study how food distribution may affect seal behaviour plausible scenarios may include intensive localised versus more evenly distributed fishing effort design of marine protected areas in respect to food availability and the exclusion of seals from areas of variable food availability due to anthropogenic disturbances the model underestimates the number of short less than a day foraging trips such trips may be related to resting very close to haul out sites the availability of haul out sites in the study area and all around scotland are strongly related to tides and seals may rest close to the shore whilst the haul out site is submerged the effect of tide height on haul out site availability is not yet included in agentseal another reason why short trips are underestimated may be lack of a standard definition of a foraging trip some studies consider a foraging trip as the time from the moment a seal leaves the haul out site to when it returns to land bjørge et al 1995 some studies including this study add a time buffer around hauling out to include resting close to haul out sites as part of the haul out event however this buffer differs which makes comparisons difficult cunningham et al 2009 sharples et al 2012 thompson et al 1998b plotting trip duration against their extent suggests that there is a large range of trip durations which take place very close to shore see figure 35 in si understanding the role of this near shore movement of seals whether they are mainly resting mikkelsen et al 2019 or foraging bjørge et al 1995 is key to understanding how human disturbance near haul out sites may affect seal behaviour and ultimately fitness the model is currently only able to reproduce higher numbers of very short trips however still lower than observed if the number of fishes caught in the areas close to shore is much higher than observed fish consumption and this results in a large increase in blubber stores see figure 61 in si standardising the definition of hauling out and resting very close to shore will assist the pom process a good tool for estimating cumulative and simultaneous effect of anthropogenic stressors must be built on solid understanding of animals physiology movement and behaviour at various stages of their annual cycles depons an abm for simulating the effect of various stressors on movement and physiology of a small cetacean harbour porpoise is a good example of such a tool nabe nielsen et al 2018a 2018b cetaceans which are not central place foragers have very different drivers defining their movement than animals which have to go back to land in contrast agentseal is the first step in building such a tool for marine central place foragers abms allow us to explicitly represent individual animals and their behavioural decisions the incorporation of the relationship between these decisions and seals physiology and energetics as well as the spatially explicit design and high temporal resolution of agentseal makes it a good candidate to become a reliable management and conservation tool agentseal could be further developed for example to simulate short term effects of offshore disturbance on movement of seals and physiological consequences of this disturbance currently agentseal only includes adult individuals which convert all their surplus energy budget into body reserves the next step of agentseal could be incorporation of an all year round dynamic energy budget deb as presented in sibly et al 2013 in the model which would include growth moulting and reproduction the deb framework can explicitly model how the relative use of energy for these various purposes can differ under different circumstances such as different disturbance scenarios in this way agentseal could be used not only to study short term consequences of human disturbance on movement of seals but also the effect on body condition and reproductive success we already have some insight into how individual stressors such as offshore renewables thompson et al 2013 increased predation reduced prey availability and quality de la vega et al 2016 wilson and hammond 2019 and interactions with vessels jones et al 2017 mikkelsen et al 2019 affect the movement and behaviour of harbour seals this information can be used in pom in the above mentioned extensions of agentseal the model can also be linked to existing tools which can estimate long term population level consequences of disturbance such as interim population consequence of disturbance ipcod harwood et al 2014 harwood and king 2014 presently ipcod is not spatially explicit and the number of individuals affected by a given disturbance is based on impact assessment predictions agentseal could be used as a tool to estimate the number of affected animals and the short term individual energetic and behavioural consequences of these disturbances these estimates can then be passed to ipcod to serve as an input to study long term population level consequences of disturbance to summarise agentseal can already at this stage be used to study several basic aspects of ecology of marine central place foragers and explore further several ecological questions in realistic scenarios this includes questions such as how spatial distribution aggregation and abundance of resources including stressors related to changes in resources like overfishing affects movement behaviour and physiology of these foragers what are the main drivers behind their off and on shore resting behaviour and how important is digestion in this process what are the main drivers behind their at sea site fidelity to foraging patches the model can also be applied to other regions and other populations of harbour seals this way the model can be applied as a tool to prioritise further data collection and analysis 5 supplementary data https github

24694,understanding why animals move as they do when searching for resources is a central question in ecology and a prerequisite for the development of predictive process based models for conservation and management many species are central place foragers cpf while several models for cpfs have been proposed they often assume well defined return rules to the focal point like breeding for some cpfs however the decisions to return to central sites are governed by multiple interactions between environmental and physiological factors we present agentseal a behaviour and physiology based spatially explicit agent based model we use harbour seals a marine cpf as a case study and focus on individuals outside their breeding and moulting seasons to capture general fine and large scale movements and drivers behind cpf we model movement decisions based on optimal foraging strategy cognitive and physiological processes in a realistic landscape coupled with realistic prey distribution and tuned to a range of behavioural and physiological patterns observed at different scales and levels of organisation pattern orientated modelling pom the model can reproduce energetic movement and other behavioural patterns such as net energy balance at sea and on land site fidelity daily activity budgets and trip extents the model reveals the crucial elements needed to model return trips of cpfs including movement characteristics that vary as a function of local environmental conditions cognitive mapping of foraging areas as points of attraction in subsequent foraging trips and physiological requirements defining switches between resting and foraging we discuss potential applications and extensions of the model including investigations of fundamental questions in foraging ecology how spatial distribution and aggregation of resources affect movement of marine cpfs what are the main drivers behind their at sea site fidelity to foraging patches we also discuss applied objectives such as improving our understanding of population level consequences of anthropogenic disturbances and ultimately evolving agentseal into a practical management tool keywords optimal foraging marine central place foragers process based modelling harbour seals 1 introduction understanding why animals move as they do when searching for resources is a central question in ecology and a prerequisite for the development of predictive process based movement models for conservation and management for example boult et al 2018 such models can increase our understanding of complex decision making by mobile animals a predictive process driven movement model should be able to establish a direct link between individual movement decisions and future distributional energetic and fitness consequences and vice versa if additionally such models are spatially explicit animal movement can be modelled based on a realistic landscape and realistic management scenarios which also allows for modelling of specific areas and populations of interest agent based models abms are particularly suitable for this purpose as they allow us to explicitly represent individual animals and their behavioural decisions individual movement can be simulated in a spatially explicit setting and based on fundamental ecological principles such as optimal foraging and learning nabe nielsen et al 2018a railsback and grimm 2012 abms can be especially useful whenever variability amongst individuals local interactions with the environment or adaptive behaviour are considered essential deangelis and grimm 2014 railsback and grimm 2012 arriving at the appropriate level of complexity for such models is challenging under the framework of abm and pattern orientated modelling pom the mechanisms underlying movement decisions of individuals can be identified by contrasting movement patterns observed in nature with the emergent patterns of models railsback and grimm 2012 pom is a strategy for fitting models to multiple patterns observed at different scales and levels of organisation and thereby finding the right level of complexity and increasing the chance of capturing the internal organisation of the real system the goal is to produce structurally realistic models that capture in a simple yet useful way the system s generative mechanisms grimm and railsback 2012 models from which multiple empirically observed patterns emerge are likely to include the key processes responsible for animal movement decisions examples of such patterns are the spatial distribution of animals foraging trip extents and duration changes in time energy budgets and movement characteristics in relation to food availability in a variety of scenarios grimm et al 2005 one type of animal movement behaviour is central place foraging where animals repeatedly return to their resting sites or nests after each foraging trip modelling movement of central place foragers with the use of abms when the urge to return to the central point is clearly defined such as feeding offspring massardier galatà et al 2017 or going back to a safe resting place at night chudzińska et al 2016 has been conducted for several species movement of central place foragers when the urge to return to the central point is less understood has not been modelled extensively liukkonen et al 2018 used hypothetical energy thresholds above which animals returned to resting sites to model central place foraging of saimaa ringed seals phoca hispida saimensis however such hypothetical energy thresholds may be insufficient when multiple interacting factors such as the distance to the resting site predator risk or physiological state influence when central place foragers should return and where to here we present agentseal a behaviour and physiology based spatially explicit agent based movement model we use harbour seals phoca vitulina a marine central place forager as a case study and focus on adult individuals outside their breeding and moulting seasons to capture general foraging movements for these two seasons the urges to return to on land resting sites are clearly defined however outside these seasons the reasons why seals regularly haul out remain heavily debated schneider et al 1980 sparling et al 2007 terhune 1985 thompson et al 1998a we use the extensive telemetry data and literature on physiology and behaviour for this species gathered outside the breeding and moulting seasons for pom and calibration of the model we model movement decisions of this species based on physiological and behavioural urges in a heterogenous landscape coupled with realistic prey density and compare the resulting simulations to a range of observed behavioural and physiological patterns observed at different scales and levels of organisation harbour seals like several other pinniped species require haul out sites on land box 1 for resting moulting and breeding they show highly individualistic behaviour and inter individual variation in terms of movement at sea cunningham et al 2009 thompson et al 1998b foraging behaviour bowen et al 2002 diet sharples et al 2009 wilson and hammond 2016 and daily activity budget mikkelsen et al 2019 ramasco et al 2014 russell et al 2015 they spend the majority of their time within 50 km of haul out sites cunningham et al 2009 thompson et al 1998b and are therefore frequently exposed to anthropogenic activities such as offshore renewables shipping fishing and oil and gas activity thompson et al 2013 further they are known to be exposed to predation from other marine mammals and respond to changes in prey availability and quality de la vega et al 2016 wilson and hammond 2019 the aims of the model presented here are to i build a relatively simple movement model of adult harbour seals outside their breeding and moulting season ii capture general fine and large scale harbour seal movements that are consistent with telemetry observations energy balance and drivers behind central place foraging hauling out and at sea movement iii capture the high inter but low intra individual variability in observed movement and foraging behaviour iv identify which aspects of movement and general behaviour of this marine predator are having the strongest effects on the emergent patterns we discuss potential applications and extensions of the model including fundamental questions in foraging ecology and applied objectives such as improving our understanding of population level consequences of anthropogenic disturbances 2 materials and methods in this section we provide details on the life history and behaviour of the study species and present the general description of the agentseal model based on the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2020 2010 finally we describe the model use in a case study harbour seals from the east coast of scotland 2 1 study species harbour seals move between haul out sites and at sea foraging areas box 1 showing high site fidelity towards both of these sites they usually haul out in large groups but appear to forage alone 2 1 1 at sea foraging movement harbour seals spend most of their time close to shore and their foraging trips rarely extend more than 50 km from the haul out sites lasting usually 2 days cunningham et al 2009 thompson et al 1998b 1996 individual seals show high site fidelity to their foraging sites but seals from the same haul out sites can forage in different places cunningham et al 2009 sharples et al 2012 experience and memory have been suggested as the main drivers of at sea site fidelity austin et al 2006 2004 carter et al 2017 while at sea harbour seals mostly dive to the bottom irrespective of whether they are travelling or feeding mikkelsen et al 2019 ramasco et al 2014 their 2d at sea behaviour cannot therefore be easily divided into discrete modes such as travelling moving between foraging patches without consuming prey and feeding searching and obtaining food as observed for some other pinnipeds 2 1 2 resting and hauling out behaviour seals need to go back to land during the moulting and breeding seasons but the reasons for hauling out outside these periods is less known seals may have to haul out to sleep schneider et al 1980 to digest sparling et al 2007 for skin maintenance feltz and fay 1966 thompson et al 1998a and for predator avoidance terhune 1985 but harbour seals are also known to spend long periods resting at the sea surface or at the sea bottom to sleep or digest mikkelsen et al 2019 ramasco et al 2014 digestion is a costly physiological process that is incompatible with the physiological adjustments to diving and may therefore be delayed until after periods of active foraging sparling et al 2007 digestive constraints include stomach capacity and the rate at which food passes through the alimentary tract analysis of tracking and diving data from harbour seals reveals that harbour seals frequently rest at two temporal scales short resting 1 h and long resting 1 h ramasco et al 2014 short resting may be used by seals to pass food from the stomach further down the digestive tract where food is further digested during longer resting breaks resting at sea may be favourable if air temperature is high as it prevents overheating liwanag et al 2012 watts 1992 and it can enable seals to conserve energy by not travelling to a distant haul out site hauling out time on the other hand can be used for longer digestion it can also be used for sleeping predator avoidance and additionally skin cell and general maintenance such as avoidance of ecto parasites and algal growth thompson et al 1998a the peripheral tissues of harbour seals cannot metabolise properly at temperatures below 17 c feltz and fay 1966 so periodic hauling out can assist routine skin growth and maintenance all these reasons are referred to as non digestive reasons in the following sections 2 1 3 diet energy budget and habitat preferences harbour seals are generalist predators although individuals may specialise on different prey types they are bottom and pelagic feeders showing considerable inter individual variation in prey species and size foraging sites and seasonal variability araújo et al 2011 based on examining scat and stomach samples sandeels flat fish and gadoids have been found to be the dominant groups of fish prey in the north sea but the relative proportion of these groups vary seasonally and regionally sharples et al 2009 wilson and hammond 2016 adult harbour seals consume on average 3 8 4 8 kg of fish per day härkönen and heide jørgensen 1991 kastelein et al 2005 sharples et al 2009 wilson and hammond 2016 which has to support a daily energy expenditure of 14 3 21 43 mj day härkönen and heide jørgensen 1991 kastelein et al 2005 markussen et al 1990 renouf and noseworthy 1991 rosen and renouf 1998 sparling 2003 harbour seals tend to forage in inshore waters 50 m deep on a variety of sediment types the key driver of harbour seals distribution at larger spatial scales is however distance to haul out site as they need to return to land between foraging trips aarts et al 2008 grecian et al 2018 2 2 description of agentseal the odd overview design concepts details protocol we present a model termed agentseal to simulate movements and energetics of harbour seals termed mseals box 1 in a realistic landscape processes in the model such as mseals decisions take place in discrete 15 min time intervals in the following section we present a summary description of the model following the odd protocol the full documentation of the model including justification of the used parameter values and assumptions is provided in the supplementary information si in the trace transparent and comprehensive model evaluation document which also includes the full odd grimm et al 2014 throughout the text we use phrases as defined in box 1 2 2 1 purpose and patterns we aim to build a relatively simple movement model of adult harbour seals which captures general fine and large scale harbour seal movements and reproduces their central place foraging and general behaviour outside the breeding and moulting seasons the model is based on optimal foraging theory assuming that seals adjust their behaviour like movement based on their physiological state and knowledge of prey availability in order to evaluate whether our model results in realistic behaviour of mseals we adopted the pattern orientated modelling approach pom grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2005 wiegand et al 2003 the chosen patterns can be grouped into four categories energetics energy intake and expenditure body reserves movement and other behavioural patterns spatial distribution of mseals visual comparison of tracks overlap of kernel densities characteristics of foraging trips box 1 duration and extent and fine scale movement step length and turning angle and proportion of different activities performed by mseal resting foraging and at sea foraging site fidelity we also evaluate one environmental pattern food depletion although there is no observed data on this pattern we still use it to understand whether food depletion may be an important driver of seal movement and behaviour we include a broad range of patterns to evaluate the performance of agentseal we use pom in two phases of the modelling cycle during model development it is used for parameterisation to check which combinations of parameter values resulted in realistic mseal behaviour and in model evaluation to establish whether the model outputs are sufficiently realistic for its intended application rykiel 1996 table 1 summarises which patterns are used within the modelling cycle and gives a brief description of the data sources used for the case study described below all patterns used in the parameterisation phase of the modelling can be compared quantitively see si for details 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model includes the following entities mseals landscape patches box 1 and on land resting sites haul out sites the entities can be characterised by static fixed over the entire model duration or dynamic updated at each time step state variables or a combination of these as listed in table 2 the spatial extent of the landscape can be based on any area defined by the user see case study for an example one time step in the model represents 15 min and each landscape patch in the model represents 1 1 km the model is programmed in netlogo 6 02 wilensky 1999 and the code is provided in the si section 9 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling processes the processes are structured into six procedures as described below they describe the central place foraging and haul out movements of adult harbour seals outside the breeding and moulting seasons the graphical description of the model flow is shown in fig 2 scheduling the order of the procedures is the same for each time step but as the model assumes no hierarchies amongst mseals the order in which individuals execute a given procedure is randomised at each time step for each mseal each state variable is immediately assigned a new value as soon as that value is calculated by a procedure table 2 1 t a v c r w b t a t 1 n 0 σ a forage this procedure represents mseals search for and capture of food fine scale movements of mseals are simulated using a mixture of correlated random walk crw and spatial memory behaviour resulting in biased movements correction of mseals heading pulling them back on track towards the target towards profitable memorised target places biased correlated random walk or bcrw the movement vector of each mseal v r e s is the sum of the vectors v c r w and v b i a s and has two components turning angle ta degrees 180 180 and length speed m s fig 1 t a v c r w is related to the turning angle at the previous time step multiplied by b 1 1 defining wiggliness of the movement eq 1 b is calibrated see section 2 2 of si and kept constant throughout the model run in the absence of noise n 0 σ b 1 would result in zigzagging and b 1 going in circles nabe nielsen et al 2013 noise n 0 σ is a change in turning angle drawn from a normal distribution with σ related to habitat suitability index hsi see case study for an example a measure of food availability bartumeus et al 2005 see section 1 7 1 2 in si as a result mseals have more tortuous movement in areas of higher food availability high hsi and transit through areas of low food availability low hsi ta v b i a s is the difference between mseal s current heading and heading towards the target see go to haul out and haul out procedures to see how the target is chosen the importance of the bias component of ta v r e s is proportional to i hsi the better the habitat quality the weaker the bias towards the target and ii distance to the target the closer to the target the stronger the bias see section 1 7 1 in the si for details of how these values are calculated the length of the resulting vector v r e s speed of mseals is drawn from a gamma distribution as observed based on the gps tracking of seals see eq 4 in the si and is independent of the speed of the previous time step mseals remember visited patches mpatch eq 2 and the amount of food captured in these patches eipatch eq 2 they also update their memory of haul out sites passed within a certain calibrated distance during foraging 2 km in the case study haul out memory does not decay with time memory of patches mpatch on the other hand decays with time during foraging mseals consume fish the amount of which is related to fish availability in the visited patches n fish m2 and a search rate sr m2 time step the actual number of fish consumed is then drawn from a poisson distribution poisson λ n sr and parameterised to resemble reality number of caught fish is then corrected for the level of mseals fat reserves based on the assumption that overweight seals have reduced diving capacity due to their increased buoyancy this amount is then translated into consumed energy kj based on observed diet composition of harbour seals the consumed fish are then subtracted from fish available in the patch food depletion there is currently no food replenishment in the model if mseals are too close to land they turn to avoid it except when they are about to haul out if the daily amount of consumed fish is not enough to cover daily energy expenditure for a certain number of days in a row 7 days in the case study mseals switch to exploratory large scale foraging movement there are two types of such movement and there is equal probability of a mseal choosing either after the hungry period i the crw is not biased towards any defined patch and ii the crw is biased towards one of the patches from the initial memory list see initialisation in the case study for details in either of these cases the previous memory of mseals is cleared except the initial knowledge of the area a time to rest mseals evaluate if it is time to rest based on the amount of food consumed need to digest if it is they further decide whether to rest at sea or go to a haul out site to digest this food based on the distance to various haul out sites close to the next haul out site b time to haul out even if mseals do not have to rest due to digestive constraints they evaluate if it is time to haul out if they haven t done so for a given time period need to haul out for non digestive reasons mseals are however less likely to haul out if in bad condition low blubber reserves general condition good this is based on the assumption that the need to continue foraging in order to regain condition has a priority over other drivers to haul out c rest at sea mseals rest at sea to digest food and the duration of this rest is influenced by mseals digestion capability stomach capacity or amount of consumed fish in relation to total body weight d go to haul out site this procedure is very similar to forage the difference is the target towards which the movement is biased in forage it is a patch in go to haul out site it is a haul out site the target haul out site is chosen based on current distances to the different haul out sites and the memory values of these sites related to the frequency of previous visits previously visited sites have highest memory value followed by sites which mseals previously passed by but were not visited and then remaining sites if mseals are not close to shore they move according to correlated random walk biased towards the target haul out site if mseals are close to shore they follow the shortest path along the shore to get to the haul out site e haul out mseals haul out for a duration depending on haul out reason digestive or non digestive this haul out site where this event actually takes place is assigned a higher memory value which does not decay with time at the end of the haul out event mseals evaluate which food patch to head to next each food patch stored in the memory has an attractiveness value calculated eq 2 based on mseals previous energy intake obtained in the patch eipatch kj memory value since last visit of this patch mpatch is unitless and can be assigned values from 0 to 0 99 with 0 99 meaning that the patch has just been visited we used the same approach as mitchell and powell 2004 van moorter et al 2009 and implemented by nabe nielsen et al 2013 and let this attractiveness decrease linearly with euclidean distance to it dtarget m 2 a t t r a c t p a t c h m p a t c h e i p a t c h d t a r g e t patches which were visited recently which resulted in high prey capture and which are close to the haul out site are assigned the highest attraction value at the end of each time step mseals calculate their net energy intake nei as the difference between energy obtained from fish and expenditure if nei 0 mseals convert the excess energy into storage blubber otherwise they lose weight see section 1 7 6 in the si if the mass of blubber of mseals drops beneath 5 of their total body weight they die beltran et al 2017 mseals may only change their body mass growth change in body length is not included in the model 2 2 4 design concepts here we present a reduced version of this section of the odd a full version of this section containing all required subsections is presented in section 1 4 of the si 2 2 4 1 basic principles mseals optimise their foraging movements by increasing the time spent in good quality habitat and minimising distance travelled by relating their movements towards good patches they memorise visited habitat patches and are more likely to return to profitable ones this memory decays with time digestive constraints and non digestive reasons are the primary drivers behind resting and haul out behaviour 2 2 4 2 emergence the movement patterns emerge from mseals different movement characteristics turning angle and speed in relation to habitat quality from their ability to memorise and return to good quality patches their need to haul out and their choice of haul out sites energetic patterns emerge from a balance between energy needed for body maintenance energy expenditure and fish consumption energy intake and define changes in body mass and mass of reserves blubber behavioural patterns proportion of time spent resting at sea foraging and hauling out emerge from mseals physiological constraints for example digestive constraints distance to the next haul out site and energy intake defining whether to take a digestive break or not site fidelity emerges from the fact that seals are more likely to revisit a patch which resulted in efficient energy intake when visited previously and is close to a frequently visited haul out site finally environmental patterns food depletion result from the consumption of fish within the study site 2 2 4 3 objectives and learning the objective of mseals is to maximise their net energy intake while taking their digestive constraints and need to periodically haul out into account mseals increase their chance of finding fish by spending more time in good quality areas and returning to these if previous visits resulted in high food intake while they will transit through areas of low quality as marine environments are dynamic and heterogenous it is unlikely that animals can correctly learn and memorise the quality of all visited foraging patches over a long period of time and we therefore let memory decay logistically with time van moorter et al 2009 on the other hand seals can remember and return to haul out sites even after several years cordes and thompson 2015 mackey et al 2008 and mseals therefore remember all the visited haul out sites this knowledge does not decay with time 2 2 4 4 observation at the end of each time step all dynamic state variables are saved for each seal table 2 at the end of each simulation the final hsi of the patches are saved as well as the cumulative number of mseals visiting each water patch 2 3 simulation case study and model analysis 2 3 1 case study description and initialisation we test the model for one case study the east coast of scotland fig 3 using patterns presented in table 1 see sections 1 1 and 2 in the si for more details the model was initialised by creating 350 mseals the harbour seal population status for east scotland scos 2017 for 2010 2016 distributed over 16 haul out sites as per the survey data we ran simulations for three months starting from midnight 1 october representing the post moulting season in 15 min time intervals there is limited migration and exchange between subpopulations of harbour seals around scotland jones et al 2015 olsen et al 2017 sharples et al 2012 the model environment was thus considered a closed system and no new mseals appeared in the model over the model duration values of mseals state variables table 2 sex length and initial total mass and mass of body reserves basic metabolic rate a function of total body mass and stomach capacity a function of total body mass were assigned during initialisation section 1 5 in the si sex influenced initial body length and the relationship between body length and total body mass within the model no other processes differed between sexes as the case study is based on movement of adult seals we assume that mseals are not naïve seals at the beginning of the simulations but instead possess some knowledge about food distribution within the study site mseals initial list of memorised patches contains therefore the location of 90 of patches with highest hsi for each 25 25 km square see fig 2 in the si however the list of memorised haul out sites contained all the haul out sites within the study area all sites received a low value of memory level except the site on which mseal was currently hauling out this site s memory value is set to the maximum possible value mseal s energy expenditure energy intake and mass of consumed fish was set to zero at initialisation a list of all parameters and their values used to calculate state variables of case study entities is given in si table 2 in si the model landscape comprised 174 185 patches 32 190 km2 total and each patch was categorised as either land or water each water patch was assigned hsi value a proxy for habitat quality fig 3 hsi was based on a species distribution model sdm quantifying the relationship between observed locations of harbour seals in scotland and a range of environmental covariates depth sea surface temperature sediment type and distance to haul out sites grecian et al 2018 distance to haul out sites was the most important predictor of seal distribution to construct the suitability map we used all the covariates from the sdm except distance to haul out sites as we wanted the relationship between this distance and mseals distribution to be an emergent property of the model rather than letting it be enforced by the underlying habitat map for simplicity the results from the sdm were normalised to get hsi values between 0 and 1 each hsi value was then assigned an initial density of fish n fish m2 we estimated this density for the best patches patches with hsi 1 based on scientific survey catches and catchability estimates moriarty and greenstreet 2017 walker et al 2017 see as well section 1 5 1 in si for details and then for all the other patches calculated it as scaled value n nhsi 1 hsipatch the value used in agentseal in the case study was nhsi 1 4 fish m2 see section 2 3 in si for details 2 3 2 model analysis in case study parameter estimation and pom there were 36 parameters in the case study for agentseal twenty six of these were assigned values based on literature and data see table 2b in si the remaining ten parameters were obtained through indirect parameter estimation kramer schadt et al 2007 due to the large number of unknown parameters in the model and the possibility of interactions between them model parameter estimation was divided into two stages we first estimated parameters defining fine scale movement bcrw the remaining parameter values were estimated in the second stage using fixed values of the parameters assigned in the first stage these were parameters related to energy intake memory and haul out behaviour see section 2 in the si we used the patterns described in the previous section patterns 1 and 2 table 1 to filter parameter combinations which best represent the observed patterns inverse modelling kramer schadt et al 2007 for detailed description of the filtering as well as methods used to compare modelled and observed patterns see the si sections 2 and 5 the final simulation was repeated a further 49 times resulting in a total of 50 simulations 2 3 3 model analysis in the case study robustness analysis ra and sensitivity analysis sa the aim of the robustness analysis is to assess the extent to which different decisions about the model processes influence model dynamics and how robust the model is to major changes in its structure grimm and berger 2016 levins 1966 railsback and grimm 2012 thiele and grimm 2015 we therefore performed structural and analytical modifications of the model to understand which processes are essential to the model and when and why our model did not work i e when the model mechanisms that explained a certain phenomenon broke down for the ra we chose to focus on processes which are poorly understood and difficult to measure in nature we ran the following model modifications i no food depletion the number of available fish per patch did not change over the model duration the aim of this step was to test whether depletion was an important driver of seal movement and behaviour this modification is run over three months ii no memory at sea movement of mseals was only driven by crw mseals did not memorise the visited patches and did not move towards a specific target patch after leaving haul out sites instead they moved according to crw the movements were still biased toward the haul out sites once mseals switched to this behaviour this modification aimed at understanding whether the pom patterns especially movement patterns of the model emerge as a result of returning to previously visited food patches this modification is run over one month iii modified hsi in order to investigate the influence of the specific hsi map used here on model output we also ran the model using two artificial habitat suitability maps drawing a distribution of hot spots at random and a map with uniformly distributed prey these two modifications are run over three months the aim of the sensitivity analysis sa was to explore the influence of parameter values on the outputs of the model emergent patterns we ran the sa for parameters whose values were uncertain see section 6 1 in the si for details marino et al 2008 3 results 3 1 case study parameter selection the frequency distribution of turning angles ta of mseals was similar to observed fig 4 a

turning angles of the observed values and r2 0 09 p 0 01 t1 34 137 2 5 for the modelled values fig 4b pattern 1 2 table 1 the mean daily food consumption of mseals pattern 2 1 table 1 was 4 16 kg 1 3

daily energy expenditure of mseals pattern 2 2 table 1 is 16 2 4 1 mj day sd around 50 means 0 14 mj day based on 50 simulations this fits within the range of observed values which are between 14 3 and 21 43 mj day the model reproduced no changes in blubber proportion pattern 2 3 table 1 over three month simulation as observed fig 5 b the majority of individuals did not exceed a blubber content of 40 of total body mass during 50 simulations none of the mseals reduced its blubber content to 5 of total body mass and consequently none died fig 5c mseals spend a similar mean proportion of time hauled out and resting at sea fig 5a pattern 2 4 table 1 as observed hauling out observed range reported in literature 12 25 cunningham et al 2009 ramasco et al 2014 russell et al 2015 vincent et al

71 see figure 32 in si are triggered by non digestive reason the remaining 29 by digestion each mseal visits very few haul out sites consistent with the observations fig 6 a pattern 2 5 table 1 mseals perform longer in time foraging trips pattern 2 6 table 1 than observed and the model underestimates the number of very short foraging trips fig 6b and see also parameterisation in section 2 3 in the si the model produces a similar frequency distribution of extent of foraging trips pattern 2 7 table 1 to that observed fig 6c also the frequency distribution of mseals at sea positions with distance from the departure haul out site pattern 2 8 table 1 is similar to observed although the model overestimates the number of positions very close to the haul out sites and underestimates the number of positions 15 25 km from the sites fig 6d the model produces the same core areas of mseals geographical distribution pattern 2 9 table 1 as observed fig 6d the size of the kernels depends not only on number of observed seals but also the tagging place we only have information on harbour seals tagged off st andrews and aberdeen and have very few tracks from the firth of forth for place names see fig 3 mseals did not use the area east of st andrews the wee bankie fig 3 as intensely as the observed seals there were however only two observed seals frequently visiting the bank in the original data set which is also reflected in the absence of any hot spots with high hsi in this area we therefore consider the model to be able to capture the overall spatial distribution of seals there is very little variation between model results of the 50 replicates for all pom patterns fig 5 fig 6 3 2 case study model validation emerging patterns food depletion by mseals pattern 3 1 table 1 was calculated as percentage decreases in hsi of each patch from the beginning to the end of model simulation below we present the mean results of 50 simulations maximum decrease of hsi value due to depletion was 17 4 the highest depletion occurred along the coast close to the most popular haul outs fig 5d and fig 7 outside these areas food depletion was negligible we plotted foraging trips of five randomly chosen harbour seals for which we have telemetry data during the study period see details in section 2 3 of the si pattern 3 2 in table 1 we then visually compared it to five randomly chosen mseals from one simulation which visited the same haul out sites as the tracked seals the observed tracks show high inter individual variation which was reproduced by agentseal some mseals went further offshore some were more stationary and some repeatedly followed the coast as also observed fig 8 two of the observed seals were repeatedly visiting the wee bankie an offshore submarine sand gravel bank to the east of st andrews fig 3 fig 8 none of the mseals from the randomly chosen individuals visited this offshore area to compare at sea site fidelity of mseals and observed seals pattern 3 3 table 1 we quantified the extent to which the consecutive foraging trips of each of the randomly chosen seals as above mseals and observed overlapped to do it we divided the study are into 5 5 and 25 25 km squares see fig 3 in the si and calculated how many of these squares overlapped between the consecutive trips of each seal the model was able to reproduce a general observed site fidelity trend with most mseals having large overlap between consecutive trips fig 9 there was however large variation between individual mseals as well as between observed seals 3 3 sensitivity sa and robustness ra analysis a descriptive summary of these two analyses is presented below details and graphical description figures are provided in the si section 6 the sa indicated that results were robust to realistic variation in parameter values the largest changes were driven by parameters related to digestive physiology of mseals stomach capacity and the length of short digestive breaks figures 54 and 55 in the si removing food depletion from three month simulations had no effect on the model results section 6 2 2 in si removing memory resulted in mseals going further offshore than observed but the daily fish consumption and changes in proportion of blubber remained comparable to the results of the final model section 6 2 2 in the si applying the random habitat suitability map revealed that even if potential patches with high prey abundance may be present further offshore mseals still stayed relatively close to shore these landscape changes caused the mseals to consume more fish than real seals and resulted in an increase in time spent on digestion resting and higher food depletion than in the main model simulations with random hsi resulted in a better match between modelled and observed frequency distribution of trip duration than the final model but still underestimating the number of very short trips section 6 2 2 in si mseals moving over uniformly distributed habitat consumed similar amount of fish as observed and as in the final model simulation 4 discussion the primary purpose of modelling is to improve our understanding in this case of an ecological system grimm and berger 2016 this improved understanding can serve nature management and conservation especially when it can be used to answer what if scenarios agentseal is an abm which captures the main characteristics of movement behaviour and physiology of a marine central place forager it also identifies gaps in our understanding and can be used to set priorities for further research we have demonstrated that agentseal can reproduce a range of patterns observed at population and individual levels such as energetic patterns daily energy expenditure food consumption and change in proportion of stored blubber movement and other behavioural patterns fine scale movement characteristics number of visited haul out sites trip extent and distribution and daily activity budgets the model is able to realistically simulate high inter individual variability such as site fidelity towards haul out and foraging sites thus it generally succeeds in reproducing central place foraging of harbour seals as an emergent property of the model movement of central place foragers when the urge to return to the central point is clearly defined such as feeding the offspring or going back to den nest colony has been relatively well understood what drives animals to return to the central point outside these periods is still under debate agentseal is to our knowledge the first abm which models movement of marine central place foragers outside the breeding and moulting season which incorporates physiological behavioural and cognitive processes to drive this central place movement the model identifies mechanisms that are the main drivers behind this central place foraging movement physiological such as the need to rest due to digestive or non digestive constraints memory based movement and distribution and abundance of prey in our simulation experiment 29 of hauling out events are triggered by the need to digest whereas the remaining events are most likely related to other possibly physiological reasons such as skin maintenance or fatigue digestion may on the other hand be the primary mechanism defining resting at sea as compared with hauling out on land as the model can reproduce the observed proportion of time seals spend resting at sea the mechanism behind resting triggered by digestive constraints has mainly been studied on captive animals for example sparling et al 2007 understanding the mechanisms behind resting of wild seals and where this takes place on land at the sea surface or at the sea bottom mitani et al 2010 ramasco et al 2014 mikkelsen et al 2019 should be an important direction of future study which could be addressed by means of high resolution accelerometery devices coupled with gps while a lot of studies are dedicated to understanding how individuals forage optimally these seemingly important decisions to stay out at sea or return to land are still poorly understood without understanding these mechanisms the assessment of how on land and near shore at sea disturbance affects seals may be biased agentseal can be used as a tool to quantify this bias given our improved understanding of the mechanism behind resting as shown by the robustness analysis removing memory driven patch choice from the model results in mseals travelling further away from the shore and haul out sites than the observed seals and as expected they no longer show at sea site fidelity introducing unbiased correlated random walk results in mseals moving further away from their starting point for example börger et al 2008 compared with observed harbour seals however the addition of memory driven movement results in realistic site fidelity abrahms et al 2019 nabe nielsen et al 2013 estimation of the distribution and abundance of fish at fine spatial scales is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of marine resources and the logistics related to data collection in coastal areas where harbour seals often forage various environmental proxies have been used instead to represent habitat suitability for marine top predators grecian et al 2018 jones et al 2013 in agentseal we couple these proxies with realistic fish abundance other studies have used hypothetical or arbitrary numbers e g liukkonen et al 2018 and or artificially created landscapes massardier galatà et al 2017 measuring the actual caloric value and or fish abundance of different habitats instead of using proxies is the next challenge but see aarts et al 2019 ransijn et al 2019 the results of agentseal indicate that seals can still show similar realistic behaviour in different artificially created habitats see robustness analysis suggesting that the application of agentseal to new regions where hsi maps would be different in detail will be successful but at the same time the comparison of the results of simulations of three different habitat types final randomly generated and uniform show that the structure of habitat influences behaviour of seals exploring alternative optimal foraging strategies based on giving up times see discussion by mcnair 1982 nonacs 2001 as exemplified by nabe nielsen et al s 2018a harbour porpoise model and foraging in relation to prey clustering mitchell and powell 2004 weimerskirch 2007 are two strong foci for the future use of agentseal the results of the main model and their modification in ra indicate that if the food is concentrated in a few places as in the case study there are individuals which benefit from foraging in such areas individuals which do not find such areas are of poorer condition in the uniform habitat all individuals perform similarly agentseal can therefore be used as a tool to study how food distribution may affect seal behaviour plausible scenarios may include intensive localised versus more evenly distributed fishing effort design of marine protected areas in respect to food availability and the exclusion of seals from areas of variable food availability due to anthropogenic disturbances the model underestimates the number of short less than a day foraging trips such trips may be related to resting very close to haul out sites the availability of haul out sites in the study area and all around scotland are strongly related to tides and seals may rest close to the shore whilst the haul out site is submerged the effect of tide height on haul out site availability is not yet included in agentseal another reason why short trips are underestimated may be lack of a standard definition of a foraging trip some studies consider a foraging trip as the time from the moment a seal leaves the haul out site to when it returns to land bjørge et al 1995 some studies including this study add a time buffer around hauling out to include resting close to haul out sites as part of the haul out event however this buffer differs which makes comparisons difficult cunningham et al 2009 sharples et al 2012 thompson et al 1998b plotting trip duration against their extent suggests that there is a large range of trip durations which take place very close to shore see figure 35 in si understanding the role of this near shore movement of seals whether they are mainly resting mikkelsen et al 2019 or foraging bjørge et al 1995 is key to understanding how human disturbance near haul out sites may affect seal behaviour and ultimately fitness the model is currently only able to reproduce higher numbers of very short trips however still lower than observed if the number of fishes caught in the areas close to shore is much higher than observed fish consumption and this results in a large increase in blubber stores see figure 61 in si standardising the definition of hauling out and resting very close to shore will assist the pom process a good tool for estimating cumulative and simultaneous effect of anthropogenic stressors must be built on solid understanding of animals physiology movement and behaviour at various stages of their annual cycles depons an abm for simulating the effect of various stressors on movement and physiology of a small cetacean harbour porpoise is a good example of such a tool nabe nielsen et al 2018a 2018b cetaceans which are not central place foragers have very different drivers defining their movement than animals which have to go back to land in contrast agentseal is the first step in building such a tool for marine central place foragers abms allow us to explicitly represent individual animals and their behavioural decisions the incorporation of the relationship between these decisions and seals physiology and energetics as well as the spatially explicit design and high temporal resolution of agentseal makes it a good candidate to become a reliable management and conservation tool agentseal could be further developed for example to simulate short term effects of offshore disturbance on movement of seals and physiological consequences of this disturbance currently agentseal only includes adult individuals which convert all their surplus energy budget into body reserves the next step of agentseal could be incorporation of an all year round dynamic energy budget deb as presented in sibly et al 2013 in the model which would include growth moulting and reproduction the deb framework can explicitly model how the relative use of energy for these various purposes can differ under different circumstances such as different disturbance scenarios in this way agentseal could be used not only to study short term consequences of human disturbance on movement of seals but also the effect on body condition and reproductive success we already have some insight into how individual stressors such as offshore renewables thompson et al 2013 increased predation reduced prey availability and quality de la vega et al 2016 wilson and hammond 2019 and interactions with vessels jones et al 2017 mikkelsen et al 2019 affect the movement and behaviour of harbour seals this information can be used in pom in the above mentioned extensions of agentseal the model can also be linked to existing tools which can estimate long term population level consequences of disturbance such as interim population consequence of disturbance ipcod harwood et al 2014 harwood and king 2014 presently ipcod is not spatially explicit and the number of individuals affected by a given disturbance is based on impact assessment predictions agentseal could be used as a tool to estimate the number of affected animals and the short term individual energetic and behavioural consequences of these disturbances these estimates can then be passed to ipcod to serve as an input to study long term population level consequences of disturbance to summarise agentseal can already at this stage be used to study several basic aspects of ecology of marine central place foragers and explore further several ecological questions in realistic scenarios this includes questions such as how spatial distribution aggregation and abundance of resources including stressors related to changes in resources like overfishing affects movement behaviour and physiology of these foragers what are the main drivers behind their off and on shore resting behaviour and how important is digestion in this process what are the main drivers behind their at sea site fidelity to foraging patches the model can also be applied to other regions and other populations of harbour seals this way the model can be applied as a tool to prioritise further data collection and analysis 5 supplementary data https github
