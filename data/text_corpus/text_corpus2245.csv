11225,this paper studies the changes of groundwater climate and land use in the pampas of argentina these changes offer opportunities and threats lowering groundwater without irrigation causes drought and successive crop and yield damage rising groundwater may alleviate drought as capillary rise supports root water uptake and crop growth thus narrowing the difference between potential and actual yields however rising groundwater may also limit soil water storage cause flooding in metropolitan areas and have a negative impact on crop yields changing land use from continuous soy bean into crop rotations or natural vegetation may decrease groundwater recharge and thus decrease groundwater levels in case of crop rotation however leaching of nutrients like nitrate may increase we quantified these impacts using integrated dynamic crop growth and soil hydrology modelling the models were tested at field scale using a local dataset from argentina we applied distributed modelling at regional scale to evaluate the impacts on groundwater recharge and crop yields using long term weather data the experiments showed that threats arise from continuous monotone land use opportunities are created when a proper balance is found between supply and demand of soil water using a larger differentiation of land use increasing the areas of land use types with higher evapotranspiration like permanent grassland and trees will contribute to a more stable hydrologic system with more water storage capacities in the soil system and lower groundwater levels modelling tools clearly support the evaluation of the impact of land use and climate change on groundwater levels and crop yields keywords groundwater recharge capillary rise land use soybean pampas argentina swap wofost 1 introduction groundwater recharge results from the dynamic interaction between climate land use and soil hydrology as it occurs in the critical zone a thin portion of the biosphere connecting the lithosphere atmosphere and hydrosphere amundson et al 2007 within this critical zone a dynamic interaction occurs between soil atmosphere and water the variation of this interaction in space and time can be very large and is influenced by human and natural activities especially in flat poorly drained sub humid plains such as the argentine pampas the brazilian pantanal the canadian plains of manitoba and saskatchewan and the great plains of hungary and western siberia groundwater rise may cause large episodic floods aragón et al 2010 this interaction has a large uncertainty which one wishes to minimize especially to predict the effects of climate change and land use on groundwater recharge conditions smerdon 2017 to improve the accuracy of model outputs proper evapotranspiration data as upper boundary condition and the use of remote sensing information is recommended doble and crosbie 2017 mercau et al 2016 analysed the impact of climate topography and crop choice on the dynamics of groundwater table levels for five years on a typical farm in the western pampas of argentina they concluded that maintaining crops that increase evapotranspiration and reduce groundwater recharge for long time periods this should magnify the effects of land use on the dynamics of groundwater tables vazquez amabile et al 2013 applied the field scale hydrological model drainmod skaggs et al 2012 at 12 farms fields within a radius of 100 km in the western buenos aires province they observed groundwater table depths generally within 3 m below the soil surface and concluded that leaching of nitrate should be considered since 52 of the observations exceeded the threshold of 10 mg l no3 n a significant proportion of the leached nitrate originates from mineralization of organic matter vázquez amabile et al 2017 viglizzo et al 2009 found correlations between groundwater level and flooding in 12 4 million hectare of the pampas in argentina with highly significant relations in the highlands they also stated that land use could be steered to minimize the impact of floods a better understanding of the underlying processes by which crops influence groundwater is essential for the evaluation of different measures to influence groundwater recharge garcía et al 2017 applied the regional mike she model to a sub basin in argentina and concluded that land use has strong effects on groundwater levels they remarked that land use decisions to control groundwater and minimize negative effects on agricultural production should have a broad consensus regarding social and physical aspects the water contribution from groundwater located approximately 1 5 to 2 m deep can represent up to 30 of the water requirements of soybeans in the flooding sandy pampas thus stabilizing the inter annual variability of soybean yields videla mensegue et al 2015 sainato et al 2003 reported increasing salinity values in groundwater for the region around pergamino where the aquifer shows an increase in water salinity to the west aragón et al 2010 used satellite data and groundwater monitoring wells to analyse the changes of groundwater depths and surface water amounts of the western pampas of argentina during the flooding cycle of 1996 2006 they showed that mean regional groundwater levels rose by 2 5 m in 5 years which decreased the average vadose zone from 3 7 m to 1 2 m in the same period the regional surface water coverage ponds rivers lakes increased from 3 to 28 primarily by the development of new water bodies this had a huge impact on hydrological connectivity throughout the landscape transport and flooding risks kuppel et al 2015 extended the hydrologic analysis of the pampas to the period 2000 2013 and included the eastern lower part of the pampas they investigated three responses to periods with increased rainfall i increased water storage leading to rising groundwater tables and floods ii higher evapotranspiration losses favoured by higher soil moisture contents and capillary rise and at very high levels of water storage iii enhanced surface water outflows favoured by the surface water connectivity they concluded that the first two responses are dominant rising groundwater tables and higher evapotranspiration losses a better understanding of the complex interactions between crops and shallow groundwater is therefore recommended and will help to stabilize yields and balance opportunities and risks caused by the labile hydrology of the pampas nosetto et al 2009 with this paper we intend to contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions between soil hydrology and crop growth within the critical zone we analysed the impact of different groundwater tables and different land use types on groundwater recharge and agricultural production an analysis of the water distribution over crops vadose zone and groundwater is necessary to consider processes like soil moisture redistribution root water uptake and capillary rise of groundwater we developed a toolbox consisting of a state of the art dynamic simulation model for agricultural crop growth and a richards equation based model for soil water flow we used local observations of crop and soil parameters with special attention to a detailed determination of soil hydraulic properties furthermore we analysed the sensitivity of soil hydraulic parameters with respect to vertical water flow and yields this is essential to support model and calibration improvement de jong van lier et al 2015 after calibration and evaluation we analysed the impact of changes of land use and rising groundwater level on regional agricultural production using long term climate data this study resulted from a case study that was carried out within an eu project and reported by de wit et al 2017 and kroes et al 2017b 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the pampas of argentina cover a wide plain of about 54 million ha of fertile lands viglizzo et al 2003 based on soil and rainfall patterns the region can be divided into different agro ecological areas viglizzo et al 2003 i rolling pampas in the centre of the area ii sub humid eastern pampas iii semiarid western pampas iv southern pampas v north eastern flooding pampas and vi mesopotamian eastern pampas dominating crops are soybean and rotations of the crops maize wheat and soybean we analysed the relation between groundwater and land use in a study area of about 40 million ha or 75 of the pampas of argentina fig 1 using a combination of a hydrological and a crop simulation model see following sections the grid lines indicate the boundaries of the grid cells applied in the simulation at regional scale within the study area we selected 6 sites for the calibration of soybean parameters the location of these sites was based on data availability and spread over the area 2 2 modelling tools we merged different modules for crop soil water and atmosphere and integrated the two dynamic models swap acronym for soil water atmosphere plant and wofost world food studies swap is a dynamic soil hydrological model to obtain soil water pressure head values using the richards equation van dam et al 2008 kroes et al 2017a that has been applied in many studies http swap wur nl htm wofost is a generic crop growth simulation model of which the principles are explained by van keulen and wolf 1986 and boogaard et al 2014 wofost has been applied in many studies e g supit et al 2012 de wit et al 2012 asseng et al 2013 at different spatial scales in many regions across the world in order to simulate the soil carbon and soil nitrogen influence we added also the module soil n groenendijk et al 2016 the integrated model fig 2 is distributed on internet as version 4 of the open source model swap http swap wur nl the integrated model describes a one dimensional system that ranges from the top of the soil or vegetation to the bottom of the unsaturated or saturated part of the relevant soil system in this study we simulated a soil column of 5 5 m swap numerically solves the one dimensional richards equation for the unsaturated saturated zone 1 θ t z k h h z 1 s a h where θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 t is time d z is the vertical coordinate cm taken positively upward k is the hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 sa is soil water extraction rate by plant roots cm3 cm 3 d 1 and h is the soil water pressure head cm to solve this equation specified boundary conditions and soil hydraulic relations between θ h and k are required the upper boundary is defined by meteorological conditions which are input to the model and by a cultivation which can be a static or a dynamic type of crop kroes et al 2017a in this study we used the static sub model for grassland and the dynamic sub model wofost for both the growth of soybeans and for a crop rotation of soy wheat maize we used the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 to determine the potential evapotranspiration which is partitioned over potential transpiration of a crop and potential soil evaporation using the leaf area index extensive descriptions are given in chapter 3 and appendix 1 of kroes et al 2017a rainfall is input to the model as daily amounts runoff is calculated when the rainfall intensities supersede the soil infiltration capacity or when the soil profile becomes saturated the lower boundary defines the interaction with a regional groundwater flow system the model has 5 different boundary conditions which are explained in detail by kroes et al 2017a in this study we applied two types of bottom boundary conditions a free drainage and b cauchy bottom boundary condition for the cauchy condition the flux through the bottom boundary qbot is defined by the difference of the hydraulic head h z at the column bottom and the hydraulic head ϕ cm of the regional groundwater below the flow domain described by the model divided by a hydraulic resistance c d 2 q b o t h z z b o t ϕ c we used a constant hydraulic resistance of 500 days and varied the head of the regional groundwater ϕ to achieve the desired average depth of the fluctuating groundwater level as an alternative for the commonly used soil hydraulic functions of mualem van genuchten mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the possibility to supply ɵ h and k h relationships as tabulated input is implemented in that way any shape of the relationships can be considered in this study the tabular option is used the reduction of root water uptake due to too dry or too wet conditions is described according to feddes et al 1978 sometimes only some parts of the root zone are stressed and show reduction of root water uptake while other parts have favourable conditions for root water uptake in these conditions the reduction in the stressed parts might be compensated by extra root water uptake in the parts with favourable conditions therefore we extended the feddes concept with the compensation concept of jarvis 2011 to simulate soybean growth the sequential phenological development pattern in wofost had to be adapted this sequential pattern is typical for cereals and is appropriate for tuber crops potato sugar beet which are crops with a relative simple development pattern for soybean a hybrid phenological development model was developed taking elements from established models for soybean phenology setiyono et al 2007 but still applying the sequential development stage logic that is needed for wofost adjustments have been described in detail by de wit et al 2017 and were implemented in swap 4 we also implemented a soil nitrogen module and used the rothc 26 3 model coleman et al 1997 for an organic matter module both nitrogen supplied to the soil by fertilizer applications and nitrogen obtained from mineralization of organic bounded nitrogen are stored in the soil mineralization rates of nh4 and no3 control the nitrogen mineralization and immobilization in relation to the processes in the organic matter cycle ammonium and nitrate balances were calculated on a daily basis the leaching of nitrate and ammonium was simulated to be controlled by the stock of mineral n present and the water fluxes leaching through the root zone the nitrogen distribution within a crop is predicted in swap 4 based on the method described by shibu et al 2010 the n contents of crop residues are calculated in the dynamic crop module and then passed to the soil n module for soybean we assumed that a large portion of the n2 requirement is supplied by n2 fixation from the air furthermore we assume that other factors especially phosphorus supply are not limiting this approach is plausible and seems in agreement with giller 2001 who states that the main environmental factors that constrain n2 fixation in the tropics include limitations of water nutrients particularly phosphorus and toxicities we assumed that 80 of the required nitrogen comes from n fixation a value close to the default input value of 75 mentioned by boons prins et al 1993 the remaining demand was assumed to originate from mineralisation of the organic soil matter for soybean it implies that nutrient stress can be neglected the adaptions for soybean and soil nitrogen in swap 4 have been described in detail by groenendijk et al 2016 using this integrated model we intended to account for different feedbacks between atmosphere plants soil characteristics soil water and nitrogen limited crop growth this allowed us to analyse in detail the impact of different land uses on groundwater recharge 2 3 field scale 2 3 1 soil physical properties a large number of soil layers in argentina was analysed by damiano 2018 he developed a pedotransfer function to obtain the soil moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity function based on soil texture data from the argentina pampas the results of this analysis are the parameters of the uni parametric hutson cass uni hc equations which was processed by damiano 2018 to determine the soil data for 8 locations in argentina table 1 the equations of the applied soil moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity functions are given by damiano 2018 we created input tables for the swap model with these data and it appeared that some parameter combinations caused a discontinuity in the soil moisture retention curve near the inflection point which we adjusted by smoothing this required an additional parameter f table 1 which we used to multiply the pressure head in the wet part of the soil moisture retention curve parameters for the argentinian soils after damiano 2018 used to create the input tables see damiano 2018 for units and explanation to verify the procedure we used a data set obtained from damiano damiano 2018 with measured values of the retention curves n 78 of the pergamino soils typical argiudoll silty loam soil survey staff 2010 through these data we calculated the optimal parameters of the equations presented by damiano 2018 results are presented in fig 3 the left hand part of fig 3 shows the fitted line and the measured soil moisture retention points in the right hand part of fig 3 the measured and computed values are plotted against each other showing a rather good agreement 2 3 2 parameter calibration for soybean data for soybean field tests originated from different sites and were supplied by recso red nacional de evaluación de cultivares de soja and unr national university of rosario experiments de wit et al 2017 the observations consisted of field data from 1259 experiments over the period 2011 2013 sowing year for five different sites zavalla venado tuerto rafaela manfredi and la carlotta table 2 and fig 1 calibration procedures resulted in a set of parameter for wofost under optimal conditions procedure and results are extensively described by de wit et al 2017 this set was applied in the integrated swap wofost model to allow more detailed analyses of groundwater impact since the purpose of the simulations with the integrated model had a focus on the water balance it was necessary to simulate actual yields this required an additional calibration where we used a so called management factor to minimize the yield gap the difference between simulated and observed actual yields such a management factor accounts for pests diseases and farm management all of them not explicitly accounted for our aim was to achieve a single representative value for the management factor which could then also be applied at a regional scale 2 3 3 verification of predicted soybean yields at county level to verify the calibration results we simulated a longer time series using the boundary conditions from the regional simulations results of the 6 sites were compared with official statistics at county level for 6 cases that are located in the same region as the sites with experiments table 2 for the 6 cases we varied sowing dates table 2 and we assumed a harvest date of 05 april or at maturity whichever was earlier official soybean yield statistics at county level min agpa 2016 were converted to dry matter weight assuming an average 13 moisture content 2 3 4 parameter calibration of maize and wheat to be able to analyse a crop rotation scheme that consisted of soybean maize and wheat we tested maize and wheat for a long time series using official statistics at county level and meteorological data for the site san antonio de areco table 2 and fig 1 we calibrated the maize and wheat input files for both crops we started with default data sets for the model wofost7 1 7 wofostcontrolcentre 2018 we then applied artificial fertilizer 50 nh4 n and 50 no3 n at a level of 200 kg ha n using a fertilization scheme based on data obtained from field visits in argentina table 3 we calibrated the crop parameters using official yield statistics at county level min agpa 2016 2 3 5 sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the interaction of input parameter on various output values impact response surfaces irs are commonly used in crop modelling fronzek et al 2018 we investigated the influence of the soil physical properties of the top soil layer 20 cm on the flux through the bottom of the root zone which may have positive upward or negative downward values we focused on the crop soybean because it is the predominant crop in the region and in our analysis we used the results of the calibrated soybean simulation in zavalla including meteorological data for four years 2011 2014 because it was expected that groundwater depth had a large influence on the results we performed this exercise for eight different groundwater table regimes varying from 500 to 150 cm the influence of the soil physics of the top layer was investigated by changing saturated moisture content and saturated conductivity input values with a specified percentage these percentages varied between 50 and 50 with 2 steps 2 4 regional scale an analysis of time and space variations of actual yields and groundwater recharge was carried out using a distributed modelling approach we introduced five different groundwater conditions and three different land use types which we analysed for their impact on crop yield and groundwater recharge 2 4 1 spatial schematization using soil climate and land use spatial schematization was similar to the work by de wit et al 2017 overlays of maps from different gridded data sets for soil climate and gyga ed zonation were made de wit et al 2017 we used the detailed isric wise30 s soil map batjes 2015 gridded datasets with meteorological information and a resolution of 0 25 fig 1 the overlays resulted in 2842 unique calculation units which were used for distributed simulations we used the same local weather data for the 6 selected sites table 2 and for the distributed modelling to evaluate the accuracy an independent evaluation set was constructed and made available by inta instituto nacional de tecnología agropecuaria using daily data of 178 stations for each station the most nearby grid cell was selected for each different data source minimum and maximum temperature radiation and precipitation were included in the vegetation and drought monitoring domain data are usually available at decadal time steps finally it was decided to use different sources of meteorological data for precipitation and global radiation de wit et al 2017 the rainfall amounts show large temporal differences fig 4 with dry years like 1989 and 2008 that have a low median rainfall of 700 mm yr 1 and wet years like 2003 and 2012 that have a median rainfall of about 1200 mm yr 1 the wettest years are 2002 and 2012 with values of more than 1600 mm yr 1 the spatial differences of rainfall are large fig 5 especially in wet years 2002 and 2012 rainfall increases from northwest to southeast for the evaluation of land use changes it was assumed that all grids have a dominant land use of either soybean a crop rotation of soybean wheat maize or permanent grassland 2 4 2 soil physical parameters hydrologic analyses usually involve the evaluation of soil water infiltration redistribution percolation capillary rise and plant water relationships to define the hydrologic soil water effects knowledge of soil water characteristics for water potential and hydraulic conductivity is required although measuring these relationships in the field or laboratory is advised to obtain the best results these measurements are time consuming and expensive especially if they have to be done for a large area statistical correlations can be found between these soil properties and other more easily measurable soil variables such as texture organic matter om and structure these pedotransfer functions ptf can provide estimates sufficiently accurate for many regional analyses and decisions saxton and rawls 2006 for european soils the hypres hydraulic properties of european soils database of pedotransfer functions ptf s has been developed wösten et al 1999 for ptf s of soils from all over the world another database has been created batjes 2015 the main advantage of these databases is that they enable a direct link between the soil map and the soil physical characteristics recently a review of the present state of ptf s has been published van looy et al 2017 for argentina damiano 2018 developed and calibrated ptf s using local data section 2 3 1 we applied these ptf s to generate soil physical input parameters which we used in our regional analyses soil texture parameters for the ptf s were taken from batjes 2015 2 4 3 increasing groundwater levels we simulated five different groundwater levels ranging from a depth of more than 5 5 m to 1 m below the soil surface table 4 the deepest groundwater level was simulated using free drainage as bottom boundary conditions and the other four groundwater levels were simulated using a cauchy bottom boundary condition this condition was preferred instead of using a fixed groundwater level because it generates more realistic fluctuations of groundwater levels and especially more realistic fluxes across the bottom boundary this becomes especially relevant when simulating transport of several solutes simultaneously like we did for salinity and nitrate we analysed the five different bottom boundary conditions bbc using a vertical hydraulic resistance of 500 days and five different regional hydraulic heads table 4 in the groundwater aquifer below the simulated soil column of 5 5 m 2 4 4 land use evaluation with a crop rotation scheme and permanent grassland we analysed the impact of land use changes by changing the land use soybean into i crop rotations and ii permanent grassland these land use changes may well be introduced in practice and occurred in past and present as was described by several authors viglizzo et al 2009 nosetto et al 2013 garcía et al 2017 for 3 crops soybean wheat and maize used in a rotation a preliminary test was executed to obtain realistic yields and phenology paragraph 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 subsequently a 25 year period was simulated using a 5 year crop rotation block consisting of the crop rotation sequence listed in table 5 and fertilizer levels the same as at field scale table 3 we introduced a 5 year rotation to allow an introduction of 2 types of early soybean that are characterised by different dates for sowing and harvest table 5 for permanent grassland we used the static modelling option with a fixed leaf area index and rooting depth development independent of climatic conditions and no simulation of crop yields the leaf area index was fixed at a low value of 1 0 and the rooting depth at a value of 30 cm with these values a low productive permanent grassland with limited transpiration is simulated we applied free drainage as bottom boundary condition for the evaluation of land use table 4 bbc nr 1 3 results 3 1 field scale 3 1 1 soybean calibration observed and simulated actual yields for the site in zavalla fig 6 showed a good fit for the harvest years 2012 2014 calibration of the crop parameters resulted in an average potential yield of 5 9 ton ha 1 there is a relatively large difference between the simulated potential and simulated actual yields the difference between potential and attainable yield was reduced by a management factor which was manually calibrated to a value of 0 88 and resulted in an average yield reduction of 0 7 ton ha 1 the management factor of 0 88 accounts for crop yield reduction processes such as weeds pests and diseases which cannot be explained described by our model this value was regarded acceptable to explain the difference between potential and attainable yield as discussed by van ittersum et al 2013 who mentioned values ranging from 0 75 to 0 85 the remaining difference between potential and actual yield was largely caused by drought during the three years finally a mean actual yield of 3 2 ton ha 1 was simulated and regarded as a good result given the small difference of about 0 2 ton ha 1 between simulated and observed actual yields 3 1 2 actual soybean at six sites compared with official statistics at county level we extended the simulations in space and time using 6 locations for a comparison with official statistics at county level a result for zavalla is given in fig 7 showing simulated and observed yields for the period 1990 2010 a period for which statistics and model results were available simulated yields are higher than observed ones indicating that we are not able to simulate all stress accurately our simulations for the zavalla field neglect differences caused by variation in soil type drainage condition and management the statistics we used for comparison do have this variation in space and time given these differences in variation we think a long term yield difference of 856 kg ha 1 crop season 1 is acceptable fig 7 the average of simulated and observed official statistics at county level values show that simulated results show differences similar to the statistics the largest statistical differences mean error me and root mean square error rmse occur for manfredi rafaela table 6 3 1 3 maize and wheat a result of the comparison for san antonio de areco for grain maize fig 8 a and b and wheat fig 8c and d showed simulated and observed yields for the period 1990 2010 a period for which statistics and model results were available resulting mean yields are within acceptable ranges the differences within the statistical observations are larger than the differences within simulation results because the official statistics at county level include all spatial differences while the simulations results are based on one soil type drainage condition and management factor furthermore the simulated yields of both maize and wheat show much less variation than the observed yields which may also be caused by the use of one cultivar and less variation in soil types and drainage conditions than occurs within the region 3 1 4 sensitivity analysis the impact of changes of hydraulic conductivity and moisture content on yield groundwater recharge vertical water flow to from the root zone and runoff was analysed and results are given as irs charts of the yearly average values in fig 9 results show that both changing conductivity and moisture content influence the resulting yield and groundwater recharge crop yields are especially affected by a low hydraulic conductivity and moisture content fig 9a and b the analyses of the effect of soil physical parameters on groundwater recharge fig 9c and d show a larger sensitivity for hydraulic conductivity than for saturated moisture content a more detailed analysis will be given by wesseling et al 2018 3 2 regional scale 3 2 1 historical situation from 1990 2015 for the historical situation a soil hydrological situation with deep groundwater 5 5 m below the soil surface was assumed this situation was simulated with the model swap using a hydrological bottom boundary condition of free drainage table 4 bbc nr 1 the average results of the spatially distributed simulations for the period 1990 2015 show an actual soybean yield yact of 2 8 ton ha 1 dm dry matter and an upward and downward flux across the bottom of the root zone of respectively 99 and 72 mm crop season 1 table 7 the average downward flux across the bottom of the soil profile groundwater recharge is 209 mm yr 1 the actual yields and the groundwater recharge in dry 2008 and wet 2012 are presented in figs 10 and 11 soil types can be recognised in the spatial patterns of yield and groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge has relatively low median values but shows a large spatial and temporal variation in the wet year 2012 groundwater recharge is highest with values of more than 150 mm yr 1 in the soils in the ne part of the area 3 2 2 changes of groundwater levels five different drainage conditions were assumed in the simulations table 4 which resulted in fluctuating groundwater levels at depths of more than 5 m to 1 m below soil surface we analysed the impact of drainage conditions on yields and groundwater recharge actual yields of soybean generally benefit when non saline groundwater gets closer to the root zone actual soybean yields generally benefit when non saline groundwater gets closer to the root zone this was similarly predicted by our calculations showing a yield increase from 2 8 to 4 4 ton ha 1 with increasing groundwater levels table 7 the upward flux to the root zone is 99 mm even in the case of free drainage and increases to 249 mm when the groundwater level becomes shallow this upward flux can be partitioned over a recirculation flux and capillary rise kroes et al 2018 in free drainage scenarios the upward flux is due to recirculation of percolation water and in the other scenarios with groundwater this upward flux is the sum of recirculation and capillary rise simulated crop transpiration increases from 421 to 530 mm during the cultivation period due to upward water fluxes caused by capillary rise and recirculation table 7 the average rainfall is 928 mm yr 1 runoff increases and is highest in years with shallow groundwater as groundwater levels increase the downward flux across the bottom of the soil profile decreases from 209 mm yr 1 to an upward flux of 110 mm yr 1 under conditions with shallow groundwater the simulated flux across the root zone shows positive upward values capillary rise which increases as groundwater rises and a downward flux which is low and constant fig 12 the increase is caused by the demand of the crop which is reflected in an increasing yield as function of the upward flux across the bottom of the root zone fig 13 the net flux across the bottom of the root zone increases with a rising groundwater level fig 14 but the net flux across the bottom of the soil profile changes from a downward recharge to an upward extraction which will result in a lowering of the shallow groundwater fig 14 3 2 3 changes of land use three types of land use were simulated with free drainage conditions i no tillage soybean ii rotation of maize soybean wheat iii permanent grassland the long term difference in average values of simulated groundwater recharge between crop rotation and soybean is about 1 table 8 which is small but has a large spatial and temporal variation with median changes of groundwater recharge that vary between 90 reduction and 55 increase permanent grassland reduces long term average groundwater recharge with 72 from 209 to 59 mm yr 1 table 8 and has a similar large spatial and temporal variation with median changes of groundwater recharge that vary between 94 reduction and 6 increase both the upward and downward vertical flux across the root zone are largest under permanent grassland due to the longer growing season the downward flux across the bottom of the root zone is highest below grassland but the bottom flux that contributes to groundwater recharge is lowest under permanent grassland due to its large recirculation flux table 8 3 2 4 changes of land use and nitrate leaching a comparison was made for the nitrogen leaching under free drainage conditions with soybean and the crop rotation results show that the nitrate leaching below a crop rotation is about 17 higher than the nitrate leaching below soybean fig 15 a mean values of nitrate leaching for soybean and crop rotation are respectively 2 3 and 2 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 n mean values for ammonium are 0 2 and 0 3 kg ha 1 yr 1 n for respectively soybean and crop rotation leaching of ammonium hardly occurs because if ammonium is produced by mineralisation of organic matter it is rapidly transformed into nitrate by nitrification the leaching of nitrate shows a large temporal and spatial variation with a larger variation for the crop rotation fig 16 b than for soybean fig 16a when one divides the leaching of nitrate n 2 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 n over the groundwater recharge qbot in table 8 this results in an estimated yearly average level of nitrate leaching of about 1 mg l 1 no3 n however if one regards the downward leaching of water from the rootzone 66 mm crop season 1 the leaching of nitrate has a concentration of 4 1 mg l 1 no3 n which is below the drinking water standard of 10 mg l 1 for no3 n in some regions higher values are found martínez et al 2014 with large differences in space and time aparicio et al 2008 4 discussion results for actual yields show a large variation for field sites within a region aramburu merlos et al 2015 estimated actual yields for a larger part of argentina to be 2 65 ton ha 1 based on statistics we simulated actual yields of 2 79 ton ha 1 dm table 7 the relatively small difference can be caused by many reasons such as other groundwater level fluctuations a different soybean variety or a poor estimate of the management impact the calculated soybean evapotranspiration shows a good agreement with results from nosetto et al 2012 who determined 670 mm yr 1 which is close to the 692 mm yr 1 we calculated table 8 as long term average for a larger area and a long time series in order to lower groundwater levels and reduce the risk of flooding groundwater recharge should be reduced a minor reduction will be achieved by changing from monoculture soybean to crop rotations and a larger change will be achieved by changing to other types of land use like permanent grassland or trees these land use systems will decrease groundwater recharge and contribute to lowering of groundwater levels the recommendation for grassland and trees is in agreement with a study by nosetto et al 2012 who determined for a region just north of our study region high evapotranspiration of 1100 mm yr 1 for native forest and eucalyptus plantations compared to 670 800 mm yr 1 for herbaceous canopies mercau et al 2016 explored the impact of different crops on groundwater levels and concluded that crops do not have a substantial effect on the longer term dynamics of the water table high groundwater levels offer an opportunity which should be carefully considered it increases capillary rise allows a more intensive use of irrigation and a higher variety of crops frequent on farm and regional monitoring of groundwater levels should support cultivation strategies the simulations showed the sensitivity of yields evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge for soil physical parameters soil physical properties play an important role in the distribution of the precipitation excess we applied the isric wise30 s soil map batjes 2015 with world soil property estimates and used it to transform soil texture into model parameters using so called pedo transfer ptf functions several datasets are available for different scales montzka et al 2017 describe a global dataset based on rosetta schaap et al 2001 applied to the soilgrids1km data set of hengl et al 2014 van looy et al 2017 give an overview of ptf s and recommend not to use ptf s beyond the region or soil type from which it was developed the soils of the pampas are very a typical therefore we refined the parameterisation using local and regional datasets we used the isric soil map in combination with local soil physical data from damiano 2018 further improvements can be achieved using more local soil information long term nt no tillage of soybean cultivation may cause a platy structure of soils in the argentina pampas sasal et al 2017a b which will have impact on the partitioning of the precipitation excess over surface and subsurface runoff and groundwater recharge this impact is mainly caused by a rooting depth reduction due to the poor permeability of the platy structured soils we used a model experiment for the zavalla site where we varied the maximum rooting depth to quantify the impact of platy soil structure on yield and groundwater recharge results show that the actual yields may be reduced from about 2 7 to 1 7 ton ha 1 dm and the groundwater recharge may increase from 246 to 331 mm fig 17 lowering groundwater without irrigation causes drought and successive crop and yield damage in the pampas of argentina irrigation is marginal however rising groundwater may offers more opportunities for irrigation which may increase contribute to increased evapotranspiration and as a consequence lower the groundwater again salinity is an important issue when saline groundwater rises above critical levels nosetto et al 2013 salinity control measures were evaluated for the mendoza area by kupper et al 2002 who applied the regional hydrological model simgro and concluded that using more groundwater is an effective measure to control salinity in the root zone we carried out a regional scale analyses with a salinity level of 3 g l 1 in the upward seepage water flux across the bottom boundary for situations with average groundwater levels at 2 and 1 m below the soil surface results showed a very low impact on soybean yields however this is not representative for the relation between land use and salinization which should be analysed in a broader perspective nosetto et al 2013 because for more salt sensitive types of land use an increase of salinity may have a large impact the use of remote sensing was limited in this study but future developments will facilitate the increase of its use land use maps at field scale level like crop type needed for rotations are not easy to obtain for argentina new procedures are being developed at inta to generate new land use maps and facilitate the choice of meteorological data this study does not account for all features that influence groundwater recharge the impact of geological controls in subsoils impact of steep slopes and processes like ponding are only partially covered and can definitely be improved a regional analysis with real time observations of groundwater levels was beyond the scope of this study however several monitoring sites exist aragón et al 2010 kuppel et al 2015 and intensification is under way this may support early warning systems viglizzo et al 2009 and enable a regional study using realistic groundwater levels as bottom boundary or as calibration in future studies opportunities are created when a proper balance is found between supply and demand of soil water using a larger differentiation of land use increasing the areas of land use types with higher evapotranspiration like permanent grassland and trees will contribute to a more stable hydrologic system with more water storage capacities in the soil system and lower groundwater levels 5 conclusions and recommendations based on several modelling exercises the findings can be summarized as groundwater recharge from the unsaturated zone and from the root zone shows large differences and should be analysed separately rising groundwater has an impact on agricultural production with large spatial and temporal differences rising groundwater may reduce groundwater recharge negative feedback crop rotations may increase the risk of nitrogen leaching when compared to monoculture no tillage soybean multi crop rotations may decrease groundwater recharge when compared to monoculture no tillage soybean platy soil structure under no tillage soybean reduces yields and increases groundwater recharge increasing the areas of land use types with higher evapotranspiration like permanent grassland and trees will contribute to a more stable hydrologic system with more water storage capacities in the soil system and lower groundwater levels monitoring of groundwater levels at field and regional scale should be intensified to support early warnings systems and future studies model analyses support the search

11225,this paper studies the changes of groundwater climate and land use in the pampas of argentina these changes offer opportunities and threats lowering groundwater without irrigation causes drought and successive crop and yield damage rising groundwater may alleviate drought as capillary rise supports root water uptake and crop growth thus narrowing the difference between potential and actual yields however rising groundwater may also limit soil water storage cause flooding in metropolitan areas and have a negative impact on crop yields changing land use from continuous soy bean into crop rotations or natural vegetation may decrease groundwater recharge and thus decrease groundwater levels in case of crop rotation however leaching of nutrients like nitrate may increase we quantified these impacts using integrated dynamic crop growth and soil hydrology modelling the models were tested at field scale using a local dataset from argentina we applied distributed modelling at regional scale to evaluate the impacts on groundwater recharge and crop yields using long term weather data the experiments showed that threats arise from continuous monotone land use opportunities are created when a proper balance is found between supply and demand of soil water using a larger differentiation of land use increasing the areas of land use types with higher evapotranspiration like permanent grassland and trees will contribute to a more stable hydrologic system with more water storage capacities in the soil system and lower groundwater levels modelling tools clearly support the evaluation of the impact of land use and climate change on groundwater levels and crop yields keywords groundwater recharge capillary rise land use soybean pampas argentina swap wofost 1 introduction groundwater recharge results from the dynamic interaction between climate land use and soil hydrology as it occurs in the critical zone a thin portion of the biosphere connecting the lithosphere atmosphere and hydrosphere amundson et al 2007 within this critical zone a dynamic interaction occurs between soil atmosphere and water the variation of this interaction in space and time can be very large and is influenced by human and natural activities especially in flat poorly drained sub humid plains such as the argentine pampas the brazilian pantanal the canadian plains of manitoba and saskatchewan and the great plains of hungary and western siberia groundwater rise may cause large episodic floods aragón et al 2010 this interaction has a large uncertainty which one wishes to minimize especially to predict the effects of climate change and land use on groundwater recharge conditions smerdon 2017 to improve the accuracy of model outputs proper evapotranspiration data as upper boundary condition and the use of remote sensing information is recommended doble and crosbie 2017 mercau et al 2016 analysed the impact of climate topography and crop choice on the dynamics of groundwater table levels for five years on a typical farm in the western pampas of argentina they concluded that maintaining crops that increase evapotranspiration and reduce groundwater recharge for long time periods this should magnify the effects of land use on the dynamics of groundwater tables vazquez amabile et al 2013 applied the field scale hydrological model drainmod skaggs et al 2012 at 12 farms fields within a radius of 100 km in the western buenos aires province they observed groundwater table depths generally within 3 m below the soil surface and concluded that leaching of nitrate should be considered since 52 of the observations exceeded the threshold of 10 mg l no3 n a significant proportion of the leached nitrate originates from mineralization of organic matter vázquez amabile et al 2017 viglizzo et al 2009 found correlations between groundwater level and flooding in 12 4 million hectare of the pampas in argentina with highly significant relations in the highlands they also stated that land use could be steered to minimize the impact of floods a better understanding of the underlying processes by which crops influence groundwater is essential for the evaluation of different measures to influence groundwater recharge garcía et al 2017 applied the regional mike she model to a sub basin in argentina and concluded that land use has strong effects on groundwater levels they remarked that land use decisions to control groundwater and minimize negative effects on agricultural production should have a broad consensus regarding social and physical aspects the water contribution from groundwater located approximately 1 5 to 2 m deep can represent up to 30 of the water requirements of soybeans in the flooding sandy pampas thus stabilizing the inter annual variability of soybean yields videla mensegue et al 2015 sainato et al 2003 reported increasing salinity values in groundwater for the region around pergamino where the aquifer shows an increase in water salinity to the west aragón et al 2010 used satellite data and groundwater monitoring wells to analyse the changes of groundwater depths and surface water amounts of the western pampas of argentina during the flooding cycle of 1996 2006 they showed that mean regional groundwater levels rose by 2 5 m in 5 years which decreased the average vadose zone from 3 7 m to 1 2 m in the same period the regional surface water coverage ponds rivers lakes increased from 3 to 28 primarily by the development of new water bodies this had a huge impact on hydrological connectivity throughout the landscape transport and flooding risks kuppel et al 2015 extended the hydrologic analysis of the pampas to the period 2000 2013 and included the eastern lower part of the pampas they investigated three responses to periods with increased rainfall i increased water storage leading to rising groundwater tables and floods ii higher evapotranspiration losses favoured by higher soil moisture contents and capillary rise and at very high levels of water storage iii enhanced surface water outflows favoured by the surface water connectivity they concluded that the first two responses are dominant rising groundwater tables and higher evapotranspiration losses a better understanding of the complex interactions between crops and shallow groundwater is therefore recommended and will help to stabilize yields and balance opportunities and risks caused by the labile hydrology of the pampas nosetto et al 2009 with this paper we intend to contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions between soil hydrology and crop growth within the critical zone we analysed the impact of different groundwater tables and different land use types on groundwater recharge and agricultural production an analysis of the water distribution over crops vadose zone and groundwater is necessary to consider processes like soil moisture redistribution root water uptake and capillary rise of groundwater we developed a toolbox consisting of a state of the art dynamic simulation model for agricultural crop growth and a richards equation based model for soil water flow we used local observations of crop and soil parameters with special attention to a detailed determination of soil hydraulic properties furthermore we analysed the sensitivity of soil hydraulic parameters with respect to vertical water flow and yields this is essential to support model and calibration improvement de jong van lier et al 2015 after calibration and evaluation we analysed the impact of changes of land use and rising groundwater level on regional agricultural production using long term climate data this study resulted from a case study that was carried out within an eu project and reported by de wit et al 2017 and kroes et al 2017b 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the pampas of argentina cover a wide plain of about 54 million ha of fertile lands viglizzo et al 2003 based on soil and rainfall patterns the region can be divided into different agro ecological areas viglizzo et al 2003 i rolling pampas in the centre of the area ii sub humid eastern pampas iii semiarid western pampas iv southern pampas v north eastern flooding pampas and vi mesopotamian eastern pampas dominating crops are soybean and rotations of the crops maize wheat and soybean we analysed the relation between groundwater and land use in a study area of about 40 million ha or 75 of the pampas of argentina fig 1 using a combination of a hydrological and a crop simulation model see following sections the grid lines indicate the boundaries of the grid cells applied in the simulation at regional scale within the study area we selected 6 sites for the calibration of soybean parameters the location of these sites was based on data availability and spread over the area 2 2 modelling tools we merged different modules for crop soil water and atmosphere and integrated the two dynamic models swap acronym for soil water atmosphere plant and wofost world food studies swap is a dynamic soil hydrological model to obtain soil water pressure head values using the richards equation van dam et al 2008 kroes et al 2017a that has been applied in many studies http swap wur nl htm wofost is a generic crop growth simulation model of which the principles are explained by van keulen and wolf 1986 and boogaard et al 2014 wofost has been applied in many studies e g supit et al 2012 de wit et al 2012 asseng et al 2013 at different spatial scales in many regions across the world in order to simulate the soil carbon and soil nitrogen influence we added also the module soil n groenendijk et al 2016 the integrated model fig 2 is distributed on internet as version 4 of the open source model swap http swap wur nl the integrated model describes a one dimensional system that ranges from the top of the soil or vegetation to the bottom of the unsaturated or saturated part of the relevant soil system in this study we simulated a soil column of 5 5 m swap numerically solves the one dimensional richards equation for the unsaturated saturated zone 1 θ t z k h h z 1 s a h where θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 t is time d z is the vertical coordinate cm taken positively upward k is the hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 sa is soil water extraction rate by plant roots cm3 cm 3 d 1 and h is the soil water pressure head cm to solve this equation specified boundary conditions and soil hydraulic relations between θ h and k are required the upper boundary is defined by meteorological conditions which are input to the model and by a cultivation which can be a static or a dynamic type of crop kroes et al 2017a in this study we used the static sub model for grassland and the dynamic sub model wofost for both the growth of soybeans and for a crop rotation of soy wheat maize we used the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 to determine the potential evapotranspiration which is partitioned over potential transpiration of a crop and potential soil evaporation using the leaf area index extensive descriptions are given in chapter 3 and appendix 1 of kroes et al 2017a rainfall is input to the model as daily amounts runoff is calculated when the rainfall intensities supersede the soil infiltration capacity or when the soil profile becomes saturated the lower boundary defines the interaction with a regional groundwater flow system the model has 5 different boundary conditions which are explained in detail by kroes et al 2017a in this study we applied two types of bottom boundary conditions a free drainage and b cauchy bottom boundary condition for the cauchy condition the flux through the bottom boundary qbot is defined by the difference of the hydraulic head h z at the column bottom and the hydraulic head ϕ cm of the regional groundwater below the flow domain described by the model divided by a hydraulic resistance c d 2 q b o t h z z b o t ϕ c we used a constant hydraulic resistance of 500 days and varied the head of the regional groundwater ϕ to achieve the desired average depth of the fluctuating groundwater level as an alternative for the commonly used soil hydraulic functions of mualem van genuchten mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the possibility to supply ɵ h and k h relationships as tabulated input is implemented in that way any shape of the relationships can be considered in this study the tabular option is used the reduction of root water uptake due to too dry or too wet conditions is described according to feddes et al 1978 sometimes only some parts of the root zone are stressed and show reduction of root water uptake while other parts have favourable conditions for root water uptake in these conditions the reduction in the stressed parts might be compensated by extra root water uptake in the parts with favourable conditions therefore we extended the feddes concept with the compensation concept of jarvis 2011 to simulate soybean growth the sequential phenological development pattern in wofost had to be adapted this sequential pattern is typical for cereals and is appropriate for tuber crops potato sugar beet which are crops with a relative simple development pattern for soybean a hybrid phenological development model was developed taking elements from established models for soybean phenology setiyono et al 2007 but still applying the sequential development stage logic that is needed for wofost adjustments have been described in detail by de wit et al 2017 and were implemented in swap 4 we also implemented a soil nitrogen module and used the rothc 26 3 model coleman et al 1997 for an organic matter module both nitrogen supplied to the soil by fertilizer applications and nitrogen obtained from mineralization of organic bounded nitrogen are stored in the soil mineralization rates of nh4 and no3 control the nitrogen mineralization and immobilization in relation to the processes in the organic matter cycle ammonium and nitrate balances were calculated on a daily basis the leaching of nitrate and ammonium was simulated to be controlled by the stock of mineral n present and the water fluxes leaching through the root zone the nitrogen distribution within a crop is predicted in swap 4 based on the method described by shibu et al 2010 the n contents of crop residues are calculated in the dynamic crop module and then passed to the soil n module for soybean we assumed that a large portion of the n2 requirement is supplied by n2 fixation from the air furthermore we assume that other factors especially phosphorus supply are not limiting this approach is plausible and seems in agreement with giller 2001 who states that the main environmental factors that constrain n2 fixation in the tropics include limitations of water nutrients particularly phosphorus and toxicities we assumed that 80 of the required nitrogen comes from n fixation a value close to the default input value of 75 mentioned by boons prins et al 1993 the remaining demand was assumed to originate from mineralisation of the organic soil matter for soybean it implies that nutrient stress can be neglected the adaptions for soybean and soil nitrogen in swap 4 have been described in detail by groenendijk et al 2016 using this integrated model we intended to account for different feedbacks between atmosphere plants soil characteristics soil water and nitrogen limited crop growth this allowed us to analyse in detail the impact of different land uses on groundwater recharge 2 3 field scale 2 3 1 soil physical properties a large number of soil layers in argentina was analysed by damiano 2018 he developed a pedotransfer function to obtain the soil moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity function based on soil texture data from the argentina pampas the results of this analysis are the parameters of the uni parametric hutson cass uni hc equations which was processed by damiano 2018 to determine the soil data for 8 locations in argentina table 1 the equations of the applied soil moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity functions are given by damiano 2018 we created input tables for the swap model with these data and it appeared that some parameter combinations caused a discontinuity in the soil moisture retention curve near the inflection point which we adjusted by smoothing this required an additional parameter f table 1 which we used to multiply the pressure head in the wet part of the soil moisture retention curve parameters for the argentinian soils after damiano 2018 used to create the input tables see damiano 2018 for units and explanation to verify the procedure we used a data set obtained from damiano damiano 2018 with measured values of the retention curves n 78 of the pergamino soils typical argiudoll silty loam soil survey staff 2010 through these data we calculated the optimal parameters of the equations presented by damiano 2018 results are presented in fig 3 the left hand part of fig 3 shows the fitted line and the measured soil moisture retention points in the right hand part of fig 3 the measured and computed values are plotted against each other showing a rather good agreement 2 3 2 parameter calibration for soybean data for soybean field tests originated from different sites and were supplied by recso red nacional de evaluación de cultivares de soja and unr national university of rosario experiments de wit et al 2017 the observations consisted of field data from 1259 experiments over the period 2011 2013 sowing year for five different sites zavalla venado tuerto rafaela manfredi and la carlotta table 2 and fig 1 calibration procedures resulted in a set of parameter for wofost under optimal conditions procedure and results are extensively described by de wit et al 2017 this set was applied in the integrated swap wofost model to allow more detailed analyses of groundwater impact since the purpose of the simulations with the integrated model had a focus on the water balance it was necessary to simulate actual yields this required an additional calibration where we used a so called management factor to minimize the yield gap the difference between simulated and observed actual yields such a management factor accounts for pests diseases and farm management all of them not explicitly accounted for our aim was to achieve a single representative value for the management factor which could then also be applied at a regional scale 2 3 3 verification of predicted soybean yields at county level to verify the calibration results we simulated a longer time series using the boundary conditions from the regional simulations results of the 6 sites were compared with official statistics at county level for 6 cases that are located in the same region as the sites with experiments table 2 for the 6 cases we varied sowing dates table 2 and we assumed a harvest date of 05 april or at maturity whichever was earlier official soybean yield statistics at county level min agpa 2016 were converted to dry matter weight assuming an average 13 moisture content 2 3 4 parameter calibration of maize and wheat to be able to analyse a crop rotation scheme that consisted of soybean maize and wheat we tested maize and wheat for a long time series using official statistics at county level and meteorological data for the site san antonio de areco table 2 and fig 1 we calibrated the maize and wheat input files for both crops we started with default data sets for the model wofost7 1 7 wofostcontrolcentre 2018 we then applied artificial fertilizer 50 nh4 n and 50 no3 n at a level of 200 kg ha n using a fertilization scheme based on data obtained from field visits in argentina table 3 we calibrated the crop parameters using official yield statistics at county level min agpa 2016 2 3 5 sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the interaction of input parameter on various output values impact response surfaces irs are commonly used in crop modelling fronzek et al 2018 we investigated the influence of the soil physical properties of the top soil layer 20 cm on the flux through the bottom of the root zone which may have positive upward or negative downward values we focused on the crop soybean because it is the predominant crop in the region and in our analysis we used the results of the calibrated soybean simulation in zavalla including meteorological data for four years 2011 2014 because it was expected that groundwater depth had a large influence on the results we performed this exercise for eight different groundwater table regimes varying from 500 to 150 cm the influence of the soil physics of the top layer was investigated by changing saturated moisture content and saturated conductivity input values with a specified percentage these percentages varied between 50 and 50 with 2 steps 2 4 regional scale an analysis of time and space variations of actual yields and groundwater recharge was carried out using a distributed modelling approach we introduced five different groundwater conditions and three different land use types which we analysed for their impact on crop yield and groundwater recharge 2 4 1 spatial schematization using soil climate and land use spatial schematization was similar to the work by de wit et al 2017 overlays of maps from different gridded data sets for soil climate and gyga ed zonation were made de wit et al 2017 we used the detailed isric wise30 s soil map batjes 2015 gridded datasets with meteorological information and a resolution of 0 25 fig 1 the overlays resulted in 2842 unique calculation units which were used for distributed simulations we used the same local weather data for the 6 selected sites table 2 and for the distributed modelling to evaluate the accuracy an independent evaluation set was constructed and made available by inta instituto nacional de tecnología agropecuaria using daily data of 178 stations for each station the most nearby grid cell was selected for each different data source minimum and maximum temperature radiation and precipitation were included in the vegetation and drought monitoring domain data are usually available at decadal time steps finally it was decided to use different sources of meteorological data for precipitation and global radiation de wit et al 2017 the rainfall amounts show large temporal differences fig 4 with dry years like 1989 and 2008 that have a low median rainfall of 700 mm yr 1 and wet years like 2003 and 2012 that have a median rainfall of about 1200 mm yr 1 the wettest years are 2002 and 2012 with values of more than 1600 mm yr 1 the spatial differences of rainfall are large fig 5 especially in wet years 2002 and 2012 rainfall increases from northwest to southeast for the evaluation of land use changes it was assumed that all grids have a dominant land use of either soybean a crop rotation of soybean wheat maize or permanent grassland 2 4 2 soil physical parameters hydrologic analyses usually involve the evaluation of soil water infiltration redistribution percolation capillary rise and plant water relationships to define the hydrologic soil water effects knowledge of soil water characteristics for water potential and hydraulic conductivity is required although measuring these relationships in the field or laboratory is advised to obtain the best results these measurements are time consuming and expensive especially if they have to be done for a large area statistical correlations can be found between these soil properties and other more easily measurable soil variables such as texture organic matter om and structure these pedotransfer functions ptf can provide estimates sufficiently accurate for many regional analyses and decisions saxton and rawls 2006 for european soils the hypres hydraulic properties of european soils database of pedotransfer functions ptf s has been developed wösten et al 1999 for ptf s of soils from all over the world another database has been created batjes 2015 the main advantage of these databases is that they enable a direct link between the soil map and the soil physical characteristics recently a review of the present state of ptf s has been published van looy et al 2017 for argentina damiano 2018 developed and calibrated ptf s using local data section 2 3 1 we applied these ptf s to generate soil physical input parameters which we used in our regional analyses soil texture parameters for the ptf s were taken from batjes 2015 2 4 3 increasing groundwater levels we simulated five different groundwater levels ranging from a depth of more than 5 5 m to 1 m below the soil surface table 4 the deepest groundwater level was simulated using free drainage as bottom boundary conditions and the other four groundwater levels were simulated using a cauchy bottom boundary condition this condition was preferred instead of using a fixed groundwater level because it generates more realistic fluctuations of groundwater levels and especially more realistic fluxes across the bottom boundary this becomes especially relevant when simulating transport of several solutes simultaneously like we did for salinity and nitrate we analysed the five different bottom boundary conditions bbc using a vertical hydraulic resistance of 500 days and five different regional hydraulic heads table 4 in the groundwater aquifer below the simulated soil column of 5 5 m 2 4 4 land use evaluation with a crop rotation scheme and permanent grassland we analysed the impact of land use changes by changing the land use soybean into i crop rotations and ii permanent grassland these land use changes may well be introduced in practice and occurred in past and present as was described by several authors viglizzo et al 2009 nosetto et al 2013 garcía et al 2017 for 3 crops soybean wheat and maize used in a rotation a preliminary test was executed to obtain realistic yields and phenology paragraph 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 subsequently a 25 year period was simulated using a 5 year crop rotation block consisting of the crop rotation sequence listed in table 5 and fertilizer levels the same as at field scale table 3 we introduced a 5 year rotation to allow an introduction of 2 types of early soybean that are characterised by different dates for sowing and harvest table 5 for permanent grassland we used the static modelling option with a fixed leaf area index and rooting depth development independent of climatic conditions and no simulation of crop yields the leaf area index was fixed at a low value of 1 0 and the rooting depth at a value of 30 cm with these values a low productive permanent grassland with limited transpiration is simulated we applied free drainage as bottom boundary condition for the evaluation of land use table 4 bbc nr 1 3 results 3 1 field scale 3 1 1 soybean calibration observed and simulated actual yields for the site in zavalla fig 6 showed a good fit for the harvest years 2012 2014 calibration of the crop parameters resulted in an average potential yield of 5 9 ton ha 1 there is a relatively large difference between the simulated potential and simulated actual yields the difference between potential and attainable yield was reduced by a management factor which was manually calibrated to a value of 0 88 and resulted in an average yield reduction of 0 7 ton ha 1 the management factor of 0 88 accounts for crop yield reduction processes such as weeds pests and diseases which cannot be explained described by our model this value was regarded acceptable to explain the difference between potential and attainable yield as discussed by van ittersum et al 2013 who mentioned values ranging from 0 75 to 0 85 the remaining difference between potential and actual yield was largely caused by drought during the three years finally a mean actual yield of 3 2 ton ha 1 was simulated and regarded as a good result given the small difference of about 0 2 ton ha 1 between simulated and observed actual yields 3 1 2 actual soybean at six sites compared with official statistics at county level we extended the simulations in space and time using 6 locations for a comparison with official statistics at county level a result for zavalla is given in fig 7 showing simulated and observed yields for the period 1990 2010 a period for which statistics and model results were available simulated yields are higher than observed ones indicating that we are not able to simulate all stress accurately our simulations for the zavalla field neglect differences caused by variation in soil type drainage condition and management the statistics we used for comparison do have this variation in space and time given these differences in variation we think a long term yield difference of 856 kg ha 1 crop season 1 is acceptable fig 7 the average of simulated and observed official statistics at county level values show that simulated results show differences similar to the statistics the largest statistical differences mean error me and root mean square error rmse occur for manfredi rafaela table 6 3 1 3 maize and wheat a result of the comparison for san antonio de areco for grain maize fig 8 a and b and wheat fig 8c and d showed simulated and observed yields for the period 1990 2010 a period for which statistics and model results were available resulting mean yields are within acceptable ranges the differences within the statistical observations are larger than the differences within simulation results because the official statistics at county level include all spatial differences while the simulations results are based on one soil type drainage condition and management factor furthermore the simulated yields of both maize and wheat show much less variation than the observed yields which may also be caused by the use of one cultivar and less variation in soil types and drainage conditions than occurs within the region 3 1 4 sensitivity analysis the impact of changes of hydraulic conductivity and moisture content on yield groundwater recharge vertical water flow to from the root zone and runoff was analysed and results are given as irs charts of the yearly average values in fig 9 results show that both changing conductivity and moisture content influence the resulting yield and groundwater recharge crop yields are especially affected by a low hydraulic conductivity and moisture content fig 9a and b the analyses of the effect of soil physical parameters on groundwater recharge fig 9c and d show a larger sensitivity for hydraulic conductivity than for saturated moisture content a more detailed analysis will be given by wesseling et al 2018 3 2 regional scale 3 2 1 historical situation from 1990 2015 for the historical situation a soil hydrological situation with deep groundwater 5 5 m below the soil surface was assumed this situation was simulated with the model swap using a hydrological bottom boundary condition of free drainage table 4 bbc nr 1 the average results of the spatially distributed simulations for the period 1990 2015 show an actual soybean yield yact of 2 8 ton ha 1 dm dry matter and an upward and downward flux across the bottom of the root zone of respectively 99 and 72 mm crop season 1 table 7 the average downward flux across the bottom of the soil profile groundwater recharge is 209 mm yr 1 the actual yields and the groundwater recharge in dry 2008 and wet 2012 are presented in figs 10 and 11 soil types can be recognised in the spatial patterns of yield and groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge has relatively low median values but shows a large spatial and temporal variation in the wet year 2012 groundwater recharge is highest with values of more than 150 mm yr 1 in the soils in the ne part of the area 3 2 2 changes of groundwater levels five different drainage conditions were assumed in the simulations table 4 which resulted in fluctuating groundwater levels at depths of more than 5 m to 1 m below soil surface we analysed the impact of drainage conditions on yields and groundwater recharge actual yields of soybean generally benefit when non saline groundwater gets closer to the root zone actual soybean yields generally benefit when non saline groundwater gets closer to the root zone this was similarly predicted by our calculations showing a yield increase from 2 8 to 4 4 ton ha 1 with increasing groundwater levels table 7 the upward flux to the root zone is 99 mm even in the case of free drainage and increases to 249 mm when the groundwater level becomes shallow this upward flux can be partitioned over a recirculation flux and capillary rise kroes et al 2018 in free drainage scenarios the upward flux is due to recirculation of percolation water and in the other scenarios with groundwater this upward flux is the sum of recirculation and capillary rise simulated crop transpiration increases from 421 to 530 mm during the cultivation period due to upward water fluxes caused by capillary rise and recirculation table 7 the average rainfall is 928 mm yr 1 runoff increases and is highest in years with shallow groundwater as groundwater levels increase the downward flux across the bottom of the soil profile decreases from 209 mm yr 1 to an upward flux of 110 mm yr 1 under conditions with shallow groundwater the simulated flux across the root zone shows positive upward values capillary rise which increases as groundwater rises and a downward flux which is low and constant fig 12 the increase is caused by the demand of the crop which is reflected in an increasing yield as function of the upward flux across the bottom of the root zone fig 13 the net flux across the bottom of the root zone increases with a rising groundwater level fig 14 but the net flux across the bottom of the soil profile changes from a downward recharge to an upward extraction which will result in a lowering of the shallow groundwater fig 14 3 2 3 changes of land use three types of land use were simulated with free drainage conditions i no tillage soybean ii rotation of maize soybean wheat iii permanent grassland the long term difference in average values of simulated groundwater recharge between crop rotation and soybean is about 1 table 8 which is small but has a large spatial and temporal variation with median changes of groundwater recharge that vary between 90 reduction and 55 increase permanent grassland reduces long term average groundwater recharge with 72 from 209 to 59 mm yr 1 table 8 and has a similar large spatial and temporal variation with median changes of groundwater recharge that vary between 94 reduction and 6 increase both the upward and downward vertical flux across the root zone are largest under permanent grassland due to the longer growing season the downward flux across the bottom of the root zone is highest below grassland but the bottom flux that contributes to groundwater recharge is lowest under permanent grassland due to its large recirculation flux table 8 3 2 4 changes of land use and nitrate leaching a comparison was made for the nitrogen leaching under free drainage conditions with soybean and the crop rotation results show that the nitrate leaching below a crop rotation is about 17 higher than the nitrate leaching below soybean fig 15 a mean values of nitrate leaching for soybean and crop rotation are respectively 2 3 and 2 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 n mean values for ammonium are 0 2 and 0 3 kg ha 1 yr 1 n for respectively soybean and crop rotation leaching of ammonium hardly occurs because if ammonium is produced by mineralisation of organic matter it is rapidly transformed into nitrate by nitrification the leaching of nitrate shows a large temporal and spatial variation with a larger variation for the crop rotation fig 16 b than for soybean fig 16a when one divides the leaching of nitrate n 2 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 n over the groundwater recharge qbot in table 8 this results in an estimated yearly average level of nitrate leaching of about 1 mg l 1 no3 n however if one regards the downward leaching of water from the rootzone 66 mm crop season 1 the leaching of nitrate has a concentration of 4 1 mg l 1 no3 n which is below the drinking water standard of 10 mg l 1 for no3 n in some regions higher values are found martínez et al 2014 with large differences in space and time aparicio et al 2008 4 discussion results for actual yields show a large variation for field sites within a region aramburu merlos et al 2015 estimated actual yields for a larger part of argentina to be 2 65 ton ha 1 based on statistics we simulated actual yields of 2 79 ton ha 1 dm table 7 the relatively small difference can be caused by many reasons such as other groundwater level fluctuations a different soybean variety or a poor estimate of the management impact the calculated soybean evapotranspiration shows a good agreement with results from nosetto et al 2012 who determined 670 mm yr 1 which is close to the 692 mm yr 1 we calculated table 8 as long term average for a larger area and a long time series in order to lower groundwater levels and reduce the risk of flooding groundwater recharge should be reduced a minor reduction will be achieved by changing from monoculture soybean to crop rotations and a larger change will be achieved by changing to other types of land use like permanent grassland or trees these land use systems will decrease groundwater recharge and contribute to lowering of groundwater levels the recommendation for grassland and trees is in agreement with a study by nosetto et al 2012 who determined for a region just north of our study region high evapotranspiration of 1100 mm yr 1 for native forest and eucalyptus plantations compared to 670 800 mm yr 1 for herbaceous canopies mercau et al 2016 explored the impact of different crops on groundwater levels and concluded that crops do not have a substantial effect on the longer term dynamics of the water table high groundwater levels offer an opportunity which should be carefully considered it increases capillary rise allows a more intensive use of irrigation and a higher variety of crops frequent on farm and regional monitoring of groundwater levels should support cultivation strategies the simulations showed the sensitivity of yields evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge for soil physical parameters soil physical properties play an important role in the distribution of the precipitation excess we applied the isric wise30 s soil map batjes 2015 with world soil property estimates and used it to transform soil texture into model parameters using so called pedo transfer ptf functions several datasets are available for different scales montzka et al 2017 describe a global dataset based on rosetta schaap et al 2001 applied to the soilgrids1km data set of hengl et al 2014 van looy et al 2017 give an overview of ptf s and recommend not to use ptf s beyond the region or soil type from which it was developed the soils of the pampas are very a typical therefore we refined the parameterisation using local and regional datasets we used the isric soil map in combination with local soil physical data from damiano 2018 further improvements can be achieved using more local soil information long term nt no tillage of soybean cultivation may cause a platy structure of soils in the argentina pampas sasal et al 2017a b which will have impact on the partitioning of the precipitation excess over surface and subsurface runoff and groundwater recharge this impact is mainly caused by a rooting depth reduction due to the poor permeability of the platy structured soils we used a model experiment for the zavalla site where we varied the maximum rooting depth to quantify the impact of platy soil structure on yield and groundwater recharge results show that the actual yields may be reduced from about 2 7 to 1 7 ton ha 1 dm and the groundwater recharge may increase from 246 to 331 mm fig 17 lowering groundwater without irrigation causes drought and successive crop and yield damage in the pampas of argentina irrigation is marginal however rising groundwater may offers more opportunities for irrigation which may increase contribute to increased evapotranspiration and as a consequence lower the groundwater again salinity is an important issue when saline groundwater rises above critical levels nosetto et al 2013 salinity control measures were evaluated for the mendoza area by kupper et al 2002 who applied the regional hydrological model simgro and concluded that using more groundwater is an effective measure to control salinity in the root zone we carried out a regional scale analyses with a salinity level of 3 g l 1 in the upward seepage water flux across the bottom boundary for situations with average groundwater levels at 2 and 1 m below the soil surface results showed a very low impact on soybean yields however this is not representative for the relation between land use and salinization which should be analysed in a broader perspective nosetto et al 2013 because for more salt sensitive types of land use an increase of salinity may have a large impact the use of remote sensing was limited in this study but future developments will facilitate the increase of its use land use maps at field scale level like crop type needed for rotations are not easy to obtain for argentina new procedures are being developed at inta to generate new land use maps and facilitate the choice of meteorological data this study does not account for all features that influence groundwater recharge the impact of geological controls in subsoils impact of steep slopes and processes like ponding are only partially covered and can definitely be improved a regional analysis with real time observations of groundwater levels was beyond the scope of this study however several monitoring sites exist aragón et al 2010 kuppel et al 2015 and intensification is under way this may support early warning systems viglizzo et al 2009 and enable a regional study using realistic groundwater levels as bottom boundary or as calibration in future studies opportunities are created when a proper balance is found between supply and demand of soil water using a larger differentiation of land use increasing the areas of land use types with higher evapotranspiration like permanent grassland and trees will contribute to a more stable hydrologic system with more water storage capacities in the soil system and lower groundwater levels 5 conclusions and recommendations based on several modelling exercises the findings can be summarized as groundwater recharge from the unsaturated zone and from the root zone shows large differences and should be analysed separately rising groundwater has an impact on agricultural production with large spatial and temporal differences rising groundwater may reduce groundwater recharge negative feedback crop rotations may increase the risk of nitrogen leaching when compared to monoculture no tillage soybean multi crop rotations may decrease groundwater recharge when compared to monoculture no tillage soybean platy soil structure under no tillage soybean reduces yields and increases groundwater recharge increasing the areas of land use types with higher evapotranspiration like permanent grassland and trees will contribute to a more stable hydrologic system with more water storage capacities in the soil system and lower groundwater levels monitoring of groundwater levels at field and regional scale should be intensified to support early warnings systems and future studies model analyses support the search

11226,groundwater is an important water resource for agricultural irrigation and industrial and domestic uses around the world especially in arid regions china s yellow river basin yrb is a typical arid and semiarid area where agricultural irrigation depends greatly on groundwater storage in the yrb a few ecological restoration projects such as the gain for green project reduced crop land over 6 around the year 2000 consequently leading to a decline in the groundwater withdraw for irrigation a few studies emphasized the impact of land use and land cover change on evapotranspiration soil moisture and surface runoff processes however little is known about the groundwater recovery at the basin scale in this study we utilized multiple data sets including satellite remote sensing i e the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace ground observation and simulation data from land surface modeling to identify the trend in groundwater storage gws and the roles of climate change and human activities during the period of 2005 2013 the results indicate that there was a consistent estimate for the gws changes using grace and ground observations at the basin scale indicating a substantial decrease at a rate of about 3 mm yr agricultural irrigation accounted for 61 69 6 15 mm yr of the total groundwater consumption decreasing by 12 6 from 2005 to 2012 however the groundwater consumption for industrial domestic and public sectors increased and total groundwater consumption was maintained a stable level of about 10 mm yr therefore groundwater storage did not recover despite the increased groundwater recharge and the decreased groundwater irrigation to ease groundwater depletion groundwater management should be concerned with water allocation for agricultural irrigation and also with industrial and domestic uses emphasizing water saving and recycling techniques keywords groundwater depletion grace agricultural irrigation multi data sets yellow river basin 1 introduction with increasing challenges regarding the availability and reliability of water resources in recent years it is important to understand issues related to hydrological processes water supplies water use sectors and management strategies at regional scales oki and kanae 2006 schlosser et al 2014 groundwater is a vital source of fresh water for its ubiquity ease of development with minimal costs and good quality hu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 it will become the ultimate source of water when surface water sources have been depleted especially for areas with less available surface water areas such as south africa the central usa pakistan and north china hanasaki et al 2008 groundwater depletion will not only threaten water supply schwartz and ibaraki 2011 and food security but also have devastating effects on ecosystems by reducing base flow to streams and wetlands stromberg et al 1996 in addition groundwater released from storage will lead to land subsidence and sea level rise konikow and kendy 2005 groundwater dynamics for most river basins are primarily driven by climate change and human activities vorosmarty et al 2000 global warming likely accelerates the water cycle of the earth system and consequently leads to changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration rate that will lead to a corresponding variation in groundwater recharge yu et al 2017 besides the diffuse rain fed recharge natural groundwater recharge also occurs because of surface water leakage therefore recharge is highly dependent on the prevailing climate as well as on land cover and underlying geology however compared with climate change population growth and economic activities may be stronger drivers in altering groundwater systems in some regions dai et al 2016 schlosser et al 2014 groundwater is an important source for domestic needs industrial production and agricultural irrigation about 600 1100 km3 20 33 of terrestrial available water groundwater is abstracted every year it is estimated that about 2 5 billion people rely on groundwater as drinking water in the world shah et al 2007 groundwater contributes to 40 of total industrial water withdrawals and to 50 of total municipal water withdrawals zektser and everett 2004 moreover 38 of the agricultural area 301 million ha is irrigated by groundwater accounting for 43 of the total consumption of irrigation water siebert et al 2010 however demands for non agricultural uses are also increasing which have put irrigation water under greater scrutiny hanjra and qureshi 2010 china is facing a serious water resource shortage groundwater has become a major water source due to the lack of surface water with more than 40 of farmland irrigated by groundwater and 70 of the drinking water coming from groundwater for the northern and northwestern regions hu et al 2016 an additional 2 5 km3 groundwater per year has been used to meet these demands qiu 2010 therefore groundwater in north china including the yellow river basin yrb has been over exploited liu and xia 2004 xia et al 2007 yu 2006 the yellow river is the second largest river in china about 130 million people rely on the yellow river water supply in northwest and north china campos et al 2003 agricultural water is the primary usage in the yellow river basin yrb accounting for over 60 of the total water usage xu et al 2011 annual water withdrawal and consumption is increasing significantly correlated with the expansion of industrial and domestic demands liu and xia 2004 in order to alleviate water scarcity and groundwater depletion in the yrb water conservation and water saving practices have been applied in the irrigation districts measures include upgraded irrigation scheduling land levelling of irrigated fields and improved furrowed and flat basin irrigation systems deng et al 2006 a few ecological restoration projects have been carried out across the yrb including the three north shelterbelt program the gain for green project and the shelterbelt program for the middle reaches of the yellow river lu et al 2018 these projects may have substantial impact on hydrological cycle including surface runoff generation and groundwater recharge and discharge wang and hejazi 2011 xie and cui 2011 moreover the expansion of these projects shrank the area of arable land and consequently reduced the demand for groundwater irrigation studies have been published primarily concerned with the surface water hydrology regarding surface runoff generation the patterns of streamflow and estimation of evapotranspiration chen and liu 2007 li et al 2014 xie et al 2015 zhao et al 2009 however the response of groundwater storage to climate change and the human activities is still unclear partly due to the limitation of data associated with the groundwater system at a basin scale in this study we employed multi source data sets from remote sensing ground observations and land surface modeling to identify the groundwater dynamics in the yrb two questions are expected to be answered 1 has the groundwater storage recovered with the reduction of arable land 2 what were the roles of climate change and groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater dynamics we focused on the period of 2005 2013 due to data availability and because most ecological restoration projects were been implemented before this period in section 2 we describe the data sets for the yrb and the methods used to compute groundwater anomalies and groundwater recharge section 3 includes the results regarding changes in groundwater storage and the contribution from climate change and human groundwater withdrawals the trends for groundwater storage and contributions are evaluated based on different sources of data section 4 discusses the findings and provides potential strategies for water resource management finally the conclusions from this study are summarized in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river originates in the bayangela mountain wanders through the northern semi arid region across the loess plateau passes through the eastern plain and finally discharges into the bohai gulf shao et al 2009 it flows across nine provinces and supplies water to about 9 of china s population mostly farmers and people living in rural areas pereira et al 2007 this study focused on the upper and middle regions fig 1 accounting for 97 730 000 km2 of the total yrb the temperature and precipitation decreases gradually from the southeast to northwest the long term average temperature ranges from above 14 c to below 4 c the average annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm to 700 mm the majority of the annual precipitation occurring from june to september liu and xia 2004 the area of arable land is 12 6 million hectares mainly distributed in the central and southern regions of the yrb and 5 06 million hectares is irrigated wang et al 2004 irrigation water comes mainly from the river system and groundwater reservoirs due to the climatic condition agricultural irrigation is essential during the entire growing season however the arable land was reduced 1984 km2 around the year 2000 partly due to the ecological restoration projects xie et al 2015 and this was expected to decrease the groundwater withdrawal to some degree however the yrb is facing the dilemma of increasing municipal and industrial water demand while at the same time maintaining enough in stream flow for scouring sediment and environmental requirements the considerable hydrological and climatic uncertainties further increased the vulnerability of the water supply in the yrb yu 2006 water authorities struggled to balance the demands of various water use sectors and the supplies from the surface and groundwater storage 2 2 data we used multiple data sets including satellite remote sensing data simulation data from a land surface model and ground based measurements as shown in table 1 the satellite remote sensing data were from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the grace satellites monitor temporal variations in the earth s gravitational potential which can be interpreted as variations of terrestrial water storage at monthly to inter annual timescales landerer and swenson 2012 reigber et al 2005 tapley et al 2004 combined with hydrological modeling or other observations groundwater storage gws can be calculated by isolating other components from the terrestrial water storage tws feng et al 2013 grace data can be freely accessed from three different processing centers geoforschungs zentrum potsdam gfz center for space research at university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl the grace data that we used was the level 3 release 05 rl05 from january 2005 to december 2013 to reduce data uncertainties we averaged the data from the three centers to make a consistent grace tws anomaly to evaluate the grace estimates of regional gws changes the ground measured data for the monthly average groundwater depth for the same period were acquired from china groundwater level yearbook for geo environment monitoring institute of china geological environment monitoring icgem 2013 as shown in fig 1 there were a total of 75 observational wells including 54 unconfined 19 confined and 2 mixed wells the observation records from the 75 wells were used to represent the variations of the groundwater depths for the yrb to identify the contributions of climate change human activities and their combined influence on gws we also used simulation data produced by xie et al 2015 based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 liang and xie 2001 the simulation data refer to the soil moisture precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff and base flow and these data have been extensively evaluated by xie et al 2015 the surface water storage in major reservoirs and net groundwater withdrawal data were accessed from the water resources bulletin for the yrb wrb yrb 2 3 groundwater storage anomalies the grace data used provided the terrestrial water storage t w s anomalies in order to obtain the groundwater storage g w s anomalies other parts of the water storage including soil moisture storage s m s surface water storage r e s s and snow water equivalent s w e s must be subtracted from the t w s anomalies groundwater storage changes were be computed as 1 δ g w s δ t w s δ s m s δ s w e s δ r e s s the g w s s m s and r e s s changes accounted for the majority of the t w s changes in the yrb at monthly or longer time scales so the s w e s was negligible in this study huang et al 2015 to evaluate the groundwater storage from eq 1 the g w s anomalies were calculated based on the ground observations by multiplying ground measured gw level anomalies deviation from the multi year mean by a constant specific yield μ the values of μ were prescribed based on li 1999 representing the area weighted specific yield changes in g w s were calculated as 2 δ g w s δ h μ in this study the water storage anomalies estimated from both grace and in situ ground measurements were represented as the anomalies of equivalent water height despite the uncertainties in estimating the changes in g w s eq 2 gave a good approximation of the g w s dynamics and was used successfully in a few studies e g feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 a brief discussion on the uncertainties is provided in section 4 3 2 4 groundwater budget groundwater recharge is defined as the addition of water to an aquifer or the addition of water from the overlying unsaturated zone or surface water body scanlon et al 2006 diffuse recharge refers to areally distributed recharge such as from precipitation or irrigation over large areas whereas focused or localized recharge refers to a concentrated recharge from surface topographic depressions such as streams lakes and playas haile 2011 recharge to aquifers is complex and dependent upon the climatic conditions land use irrigation and hydrogeological heterogeneity arnold et al 2000 the direct estimation of groundwater recharge at a basin scale is difficult because of the spatial heterogeneity of the soil profile here we used a water balance equation to approximate the groundwater recharge r e mm yr 3 r e p r e e t r δ s m s where p r e denoted monthly precipitation mm yr e t was evapotranspiration mm yr r was surface runoff mm yr and δ s m s was the change in soil moisture storage mm yr these variables could be estimated from the vic modeling xie et al 2015 note that δsms was the soil moisture from the top two soil layers in the natural groundwater budget the groundwater connection in this region with others was not considered in this study because the study area can be assumed as a close and independent basin but the groundwater withdraw from this to other regions was included in the groundwater balance at a yearly scale the groundwater balance could be expressed as 4 δ g w s r e b a s e f l o w n g w where δ g w s was the change of groundwater storage b a s e f l o w was the baseflow runoff which can be estimated from the vic modeling and n g w was the net groundwater withdrawal calculated by subtracting the infiltration to the groundwater storage and the return flow to river systems from the total groundwater abstraction doll et al 2012 the term net groundwater withdrawal n g w is used interchangeably with groundwater consumption in this study the data for n g w from the wrb yrb have been well evaluated and widely used in basin scale water resource assessments in china 3 results 3 1 change in terrestrial water storage we first detected the change in tws in this study a 13 point moving average was used to smooth the seasonal variations and remove the high frequency signals contained in the monthly time series to detect the long term changes scanlon et al 2012 the tws obtained from grace have been intensively evaluated using the data from the global land data assimilation system ni et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 a the tws had a general depletion at a rate of 2 33 mm yr and included distinct seasonal and annual fluctuations during the period from 2005 to 2013 there were three declining periods 2005 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 with a significant reduction of about 25 mm occurring in the first period the t w s reached a minimum and maximum in the spring and autumn respectively this was mainly due to limited precipitation and agricultural irrigation withdrawal in the spring and the rainy season from july to november actually the variation of t w s was closely related to climatic conditions since it agreed well with the phases of precipitation zou et al 2013 the spatial distributions of t w s were not uniform over the yrb the t w s appeared to be slowly increasing in the source region of the yrb and decreasing over the lower section of the yrb fig 2 b presented the spatial distribution of the tws trend for its upper region from 2003 to 2010 the t w s increased with a rate of about 8 0 mm yr but for the middle and lower regions it substantially decreased at a rate of 7 0 mm yr these results were roughly consistent with the estimates in zhao et al 2015 this significant decrease was attributable to agricultural irrigation chang et al 2014 3 2 trend in groundwater storage with the decline of the terrestrial water storage the groundwater system gave a relevant response characterized by the pattern of the groundwater table and the groundwater storage fig 3 shows average groundwater table variations calculated from the in situ observations the groundwater table decreased about 1 28 m from 2005 to 2013 as shown in fig 4 the groundwater storage from the in situ observations had a continuous decline at a rate of 2 85 mm yr p 0 05 a similar pattern was also exhibited by the grace g w s anomaly the g w s depletion rate derived from grace was 3 11 mm yr p 0 05 therefore the grace derived g w s agreed approximately with the in situ observations however the former had a larger fluctuation with respect to frequency and amplitude this difference could be attributed to the sparse in situ observations of groundwater table and the specific yields that were used to estimate the gws gws also had obvious spatial variability as a consequence of climatic condition and human activities fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of yearly g w s for the period of 2005 2013 roughly g w s showed an even spatial distribution in the year of 2005 but its spatial variability enlarged over time in 2009 g w s reached negative departures of about 6 mm in the southeastern part of the region and after that the spatial pattern varied to some degree in the eastern part of the region a negative anomaly with a maximum of 10 mm was found after the year of 2009 indicating that this region experienced substantial groundwater storage depletion 3 3 groundwater budget analysis a groundwater budget is driven generally by groundwater recharge baseflow and groundwater abstraction groundwater recharge is dominated by precipitation input et and surface runoff output as expressed in eq 3 here we analyze each groundwater budget component and further discuss groundwater depletion as shown in fig 6 annual precipitation increased in the central area of the yrb at a rate of about 20 30 mm yr from 2005 2013 this increased water input was mostly balanced by the water output of et and surface runoff and the groundwater recharge showed an obvious increase in the northeastern area however a large decrease of annual precipitation about 30 mm yr occurred in the southeastern area consequently the annual groundwater recharge of the entire yrb was about 56 mm with an upward trend of 0 135 mm yr fig 7 but it exhibited a slight downward trend in the southeastern area along with the variation of the annual groundwater recharge annual groundwater discharge baseflow was about 52 mm showing a similar temporal trend from 2005 2013 the net yearly groundwater abstraction by human activities was maintained at a stable level of about 10 mm this abstraction exerted considerable pressure on groundwater consumption the groundwater withdrawal exhibits obvious spatial variability in yrb fig 8 presents the spatial distribution of the groundwater abstraction at province scale for three typical years 2005 2010 and 2013 the eastern part of the yrb has quite larger abstraction than the western part particularly the province in the southeast of yrb i e the henan province reaches the largest groundwater abstraction 62 38 mm yr for the year of 2013 in contrast the qinghai province in the west of yrb shows very small groundwater abstraction 0 74 mm yr for the year of 2013 the spatial distribution of groundwater abstraction and the groundwater recharge as analyzed above contribute to the groundwater storage decline in the eastern part of yrb we calculated the annual groundwater change by two methods the grace derived groundwater anomaly i e eq 1 and the water balance equation i e eq 4 as presented in fig 9 the two methods gave approximately equal estimates for the groundwater change 3 57 mm yr and 4 12 mm yr respectively although the grace derived groundwater change showed larger fluctuations than did that from the water balance therefore the natural recharge discharge processes and groundwater abstraction continuously caused groundwater depletion please note that these yearly estimates of the g w s trend are slightly different from the monthly based estimates as described in subsection 3 2 because of data uncertainties and the time scale difference 3 4 groundwater consumption of different sectors although the total groundwater consumption by human activities was stable during 2005 2013 each groundwater consumption sector in the yrb had different contributions to the groundwater storage decline in the yrb there are four primary groundwater consumption sectors including agricultural irrigation industrial and domestic abstractions and groundwater use for public services here we further identify the contribution from each of the four sectors based on the data from the wrb yrb fig 10 presents the groundwater use by each sector agricultural irrigation accounting for 61 69 of the total groundwater abstraction consumed the largest amount of groundwater among the four followed by the industrial sector 19 76 the domestic sector 13 04 and public 5 52 consumption the groundwater consumption by each sector has an obvious temporal variation as shown in fig 11 specifically the groundwater consumption for agricultural irrigation decreased significantly from 6 55 mm 50 78 km3 in 2005 to 5 78 mm 44 89 km3 in 2012 the other three sectors increased groundwater abstraction and their total groundwater consumption increased 45 from 3 45 mm 26 79 km3 in 2005 to 4 86 mm 37 77 km3 in 2012 the withdrawal by the industrial sector contributed the most to the increase increasing from 1 80 mm 13 99 km3 to 2 6 mm 20 15 km3 therefore the amount of the groundwater consumption from the four sectors had a slight positive trend during the period 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of human nature impact in this study the grace data and in situ observations were used to detect the changes in terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage in the yrb the two sources of data provided consistent estimates for the trend for groundwater storage of about 3 mm yr for the yrb as a whole with a significant decrease in g w s in the eastern part of the yrb similar estimates were also reported by other studies for example zhao et al 2015 indicated that the tws in the eastern part in shanxi province had a downward trend of about 7 76 mm yr with a notable g w s decline in the southeastern part of the region the gws had the largest depletion feng et al 2013 our study presented a large scale estimate for the groundwater storage change human activities and climate had different contribution to the groundwater storage change varying both temporally and spatially the climate change impacted groundwater storage positively due to slight increased precipitation and groundwater recharge xie et al 2015 also demonstrated the spatial and temporal variations of groundwater recharge in the yrb using a land surface modeling however this increased recharge was mostly offset by the trend of baseflow the spatial variability of the groundwater withdrawal is consistent with the distribution of the groundwater storage decline the eastern yrb especially the south eastern yrb experienced the largest groundwater withdrawal which significantly contributed to the groundwater storage decline in this area therefore the change rate of gws was dominated by the groundwater withdrawal for various uses groundwater withdrawal was primarily used for agricultural irrigation in the yrb as in many other regions in china yu et al 2003 taylor et al 2013 however the amount and the fraction of groundwater withdrawal for irrigation have been substantially reduced due to the shrinkage of crop land since a few forestry ecological projects have been implemented in this region e g the grain for green project that led to an increase in forest area 1845 km2 and a reduction in crop plantation 1984 km2 6 59 of the total crop land wang et al 2009 xie et al 2015 unfortunately this reduction of irrigation failed to reverse the groundwater storage decline because the total groundwater withdrawal was relatively stable in contrast to agricultural irrigation the industrial domestic and public withdrawals notably increased because of economic development in the yrb wang et al 2017 yin et al 2017 therefore groundwater storage continued to decline with stable groundwater withdrawals according to the groundwater budget analysis moreover the grace and the water balance equation provided evidence of the long time groundwater over exploitation 4 2 implications for water resource management the trend in groundwater storage and the contributions discussed above have implications for water resource management in yrb along with an emphasis on ecological restoration groundwater protection and recovery are of great concern in china to relieve groundwater storage depletion it is important to consider interactions among climate change land surface and groundwater hydrology water conservancy engineering and human social systems including societal adaptations to water scarcity to realize the sustainable development of water resources a few effective measures can be adopted to ease the groundwater loss including artificial recharge of water into aquifers crop structure adjustment and water saving irrigation konikow and kendy 2005 since agricultural irrigation is still the largest groundwater user among the four sectors limiting water allocation for agricultural irrigation should be encouraged to ensure a sustainable level of water sue perry et al 2017 introducing effective irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation and micro sprinkle irrigation can increase water use efficiency by more than 90 at field scale in this sense improving the irrigation mode in the yrb is able to reduce the dependence on groundwater on the other hand these hi tech irrigation may encourage more crop planting and consequently cause more water allocation perry et al 2017 therefore introducing hi tech irrigation in absence of controls on water allocations will likely make the situation worse to address such a paradox of irrigation efficiency physical water accounts the farm scale to the basin scale are needed for areas where the hi tech irrigation is implemented grafton et al 2018 moreover industrial water demands from the groundwater system could be relaxed to a certain degree by allowing for efficient water recycling ecological projects that were implemented in yrb such as the grain for green should be comprehensively evaluated for their effectiveness in groundwater recharge or discharge water resource assessments could pay more attention to comprehensive strategies for surface water and groundwater allocation considering the impact of climate change across the yrb luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 moreover economic measures should be used to encourage efficient use of water and reallocation of water among different sectors the community should understand the fragility of the groundwater and more specific goals and a comprehensive management scheme should be developed for groundwater use 4 3 uncertainties and limitations despite consistent estimations for groundwater decline our study was subject to uncertainties and limitations regarding the data and methods first only data from a nine year period were used to analyze the groundwater pattern groundwater storage generally requires a long time period 20 years to reach equilibrium under climate forcing and human disturbances döll et al 2015 therefore the data length was deficient for reflecting the groundwater pattern second the groundwater storage estimation from the ground observations had substantial uncertainty due to the spatial distribution of the wells the regional groundwater storage was retrieved based on 54 wells most of which are distributed near residences and the observations may have been influenced by human impact groundwater withdrawals initially led to a decrease of stored groundwater volume within the cone of depression of hydraulic heads around the pumping well observation sites could detect this but may have exaggerated the pattern of gws at a regional scale therefore these data were only used to evaluate the grace derived groundwater storage though the two approaches gave similar estimates for the trend in the groundwater storage third the groundwater recharge estimates may have substantial uncertainties because they were computed from the vic model simulation in which the groundwater component was not well formulated liang and xie 2001 xie et al 2015 and finally our study focused on the quantity of the groundwater storage rather than the groundwater quality which is also a serious concern in the yrb and the other basins in china jiang et al 2008 li et al 2010 su et al 2009 despite the above mentioned uncertainties and limitations our study provided a regional scale evaluation of groundwater depletion and quantified the contribution of natural groundwater recharge and human withdrawals various sources of data including grace land surface hydrological modeling and in situ observations were used and they provided consistent estimations 5 conclusions this study employed multi source data sets to quantify the spatial and temporal pattern of groundwater storage in the yrb related to climate change and human activities the results demonstrated that the terrestrial water storage has substantially decreased at a rate of 2 33 mm yr during 2005 2013 the pattern of groundwater storage was investigated based on grace and ground observations and the two approaches gave consistent estimates for the trend at about 3 mm yr a slight increase or stable state was observed in groundwater storage after 2011 moreover groundwater storage exhibited spatial variability with a significant depletion in the southeastern part of the yrb where human activities regarding groundwater withdrawal were intensive the roles of climate change and human activities in the groundwater depletion varied during the period natural groundwater recharge was observed as a positive trend because of increased precipitation especially in the northeastern area however the increased recharge was mostly offset by the baseflow therefore groundwater storage decreased with human groundwater withdrawal the total net groundwater withdrawal was nearly stable about 10 mm yr although agricultural irrigation from groundwater decreased substantially partly due to the implementation of ecological projects in the yrb the total withdrawals from other sectors including industrial public and domestic consumption increased 41 during 2005 2012 particularly industrial groundwater consumption which accounted for 19 76 of total groundwater consumption increased about 44 therefore groundwater withdrawal still played a significant role in groundwater depletion there were a few uncertainties and limitations with respect to the length of the study period data quality and spatial representativeness of the ground observations however this study concluded that the sectors that account for groundwater depletion in the yrb have changed and that it can support scientific decisions on water resource allocation and use in the yrb despite the decrease in the use of groundwater for irrigation agricultural irrigation accounted for over 60 of groundwater use therefore when emphasizing new techniques for agricultural irrigation e g drip irrigation and micro sprinkle irrigation we should pay more attention on water allocations on the basis of basin and regional scale water accounting to avoid the paradox of irrigation efficiency perry et al 2017 grafton et al 2018 a comprehensive management strategy for surface water and groundwater is important for the lower reaches the southeastern area of the yrb acknowledgements this study was

11226,groundwater is an important water resource for agricultural irrigation and industrial and domestic uses around the world especially in arid regions china s yellow river basin yrb is a typical arid and semiarid area where agricultural irrigation depends greatly on groundwater storage in the yrb a few ecological restoration projects such as the gain for green project reduced crop land over 6 around the year 2000 consequently leading to a decline in the groundwater withdraw for irrigation a few studies emphasized the impact of land use and land cover change on evapotranspiration soil moisture and surface runoff processes however little is known about the groundwater recovery at the basin scale in this study we utilized multiple data sets including satellite remote sensing i e the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace ground observation and simulation data from land surface modeling to identify the trend in groundwater storage gws and the roles of climate change and human activities during the period of 2005 2013 the results indicate that there was a consistent estimate for the gws changes using grace and ground observations at the basin scale indicating a substantial decrease at a rate of about 3 mm yr agricultural irrigation accounted for 61 69 6 15 mm yr of the total groundwater consumption decreasing by 12 6 from 2005 to 2012 however the groundwater consumption for industrial domestic and public sectors increased and total groundwater consumption was maintained a stable level of about 10 mm yr therefore groundwater storage did not recover despite the increased groundwater recharge and the decreased groundwater irrigation to ease groundwater depletion groundwater management should be concerned with water allocation for agricultural irrigation and also with industrial and domestic uses emphasizing water saving and recycling techniques keywords groundwater depletion grace agricultural irrigation multi data sets yellow river basin 1 introduction with increasing challenges regarding the availability and reliability of water resources in recent years it is important to understand issues related to hydrological processes water supplies water use sectors and management strategies at regional scales oki and kanae 2006 schlosser et al 2014 groundwater is a vital source of fresh water for its ubiquity ease of development with minimal costs and good quality hu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 it will become the ultimate source of water when surface water sources have been depleted especially for areas with less available surface water areas such as south africa the central usa pakistan and north china hanasaki et al 2008 groundwater depletion will not only threaten water supply schwartz and ibaraki 2011 and food security but also have devastating effects on ecosystems by reducing base flow to streams and wetlands stromberg et al 1996 in addition groundwater released from storage will lead to land subsidence and sea level rise konikow and kendy 2005 groundwater dynamics for most river basins are primarily driven by climate change and human activities vorosmarty et al 2000 global warming likely accelerates the water cycle of the earth system and consequently leads to changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration rate that will lead to a corresponding variation in groundwater recharge yu et al 2017 besides the diffuse rain fed recharge natural groundwater recharge also occurs because of surface water leakage therefore recharge is highly dependent on the prevailing climate as well as on land cover and underlying geology however compared with climate change population growth and economic activities may be stronger drivers in altering groundwater systems in some regions dai et al 2016 schlosser et al 2014 groundwater is an important source for domestic needs industrial production and agricultural irrigation about 600 1100 km3 20 33 of terrestrial available water groundwater is abstracted every year it is estimated that about 2 5 billion people rely on groundwater as drinking water in the world shah et al 2007 groundwater contributes to 40 of total industrial water withdrawals and to 50 of total municipal water withdrawals zektser and everett 2004 moreover 38 of the agricultural area 301 million ha is irrigated by groundwater accounting for 43 of the total consumption of irrigation water siebert et al 2010 however demands for non agricultural uses are also increasing which have put irrigation water under greater scrutiny hanjra and qureshi 2010 china is facing a serious water resource shortage groundwater has become a major water source due to the lack of surface water with more than 40 of farmland irrigated by groundwater and 70 of the drinking water coming from groundwater for the northern and northwestern regions hu et al 2016 an additional 2 5 km3 groundwater per year has been used to meet these demands qiu 2010 therefore groundwater in north china including the yellow river basin yrb has been over exploited liu and xia 2004 xia et al 2007 yu 2006 the yellow river is the second largest river in china about 130 million people rely on the yellow river water supply in northwest and north china campos et al 2003 agricultural water is the primary usage in the yellow river basin yrb accounting for over 60 of the total water usage xu et al 2011 annual water withdrawal and consumption is increasing significantly correlated with the expansion of industrial and domestic demands liu and xia 2004 in order to alleviate water scarcity and groundwater depletion in the yrb water conservation and water saving practices have been applied in the irrigation districts measures include upgraded irrigation scheduling land levelling of irrigated fields and improved furrowed and flat basin irrigation systems deng et al 2006 a few ecological restoration projects have been carried out across the yrb including the three north shelterbelt program the gain for green project and the shelterbelt program for the middle reaches of the yellow river lu et al 2018 these projects may have substantial impact on hydrological cycle including surface runoff generation and groundwater recharge and discharge wang and hejazi 2011 xie and cui 2011 moreover the expansion of these projects shrank the area of arable land and consequently reduced the demand for groundwater irrigation studies have been published primarily concerned with the surface water hydrology regarding surface runoff generation the patterns of streamflow and estimation of evapotranspiration chen and liu 2007 li et al 2014 xie et al 2015 zhao et al 2009 however the response of groundwater storage to climate change and the human activities is still unclear partly due to the limitation of data associated with the groundwater system at a basin scale in this study we employed multi source data sets from remote sensing ground observations and land surface modeling to identify the groundwater dynamics in the yrb two questions are expected to be answered 1 has the groundwater storage recovered with the reduction of arable land 2 what were the roles of climate change and groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater dynamics we focused on the period of 2005 2013 due to data availability and because most ecological restoration projects were been implemented before this period in section 2 we describe the data sets for the yrb and the methods used to compute groundwater anomalies and groundwater recharge section 3 includes the results regarding changes in groundwater storage and the contribution from climate change and human groundwater withdrawals the trends for groundwater storage and contributions are evaluated based on different sources of data section 4 discusses the findings and provides potential strategies for water resource management finally the conclusions from this study are summarized in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river originates in the bayangela mountain wanders through the northern semi arid region across the loess plateau passes through the eastern plain and finally discharges into the bohai gulf shao et al 2009 it flows across nine provinces and supplies water to about 9 of china s population mostly farmers and people living in rural areas pereira et al 2007 this study focused on the upper and middle regions fig 1 accounting for 97 730 000 km2 of the total yrb the temperature and precipitation decreases gradually from the southeast to northwest the long term average temperature ranges from above 14 c to below 4 c the average annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm to 700 mm the majority of the annual precipitation occurring from june to september liu and xia 2004 the area of arable land is 12 6 million hectares mainly distributed in the central and southern regions of the yrb and 5 06 million hectares is irrigated wang et al 2004 irrigation water comes mainly from the river system and groundwater reservoirs due to the climatic condition agricultural irrigation is essential during the entire growing season however the arable land was reduced 1984 km2 around the year 2000 partly due to the ecological restoration projects xie et al 2015 and this was expected to decrease the groundwater withdrawal to some degree however the yrb is facing the dilemma of increasing municipal and industrial water demand while at the same time maintaining enough in stream flow for scouring sediment and environmental requirements the considerable hydrological and climatic uncertainties further increased the vulnerability of the water supply in the yrb yu 2006 water authorities struggled to balance the demands of various water use sectors and the supplies from the surface and groundwater storage 2 2 data we used multiple data sets including satellite remote sensing data simulation data from a land surface model and ground based measurements as shown in table 1 the satellite remote sensing data were from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the grace satellites monitor temporal variations in the earth s gravitational potential which can be interpreted as variations of terrestrial water storage at monthly to inter annual timescales landerer and swenson 2012 reigber et al 2005 tapley et al 2004 combined with hydrological modeling or other observations groundwater storage gws can be calculated by isolating other components from the terrestrial water storage tws feng et al 2013 grace data can be freely accessed from three different processing centers geoforschungs zentrum potsdam gfz center for space research at university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl the grace data that we used was the level 3 release 05 rl05 from january 2005 to december 2013 to reduce data uncertainties we averaged the data from the three centers to make a consistent grace tws anomaly to evaluate the grace estimates of regional gws changes the ground measured data for the monthly average groundwater depth for the same period were acquired from china groundwater level yearbook for geo environment monitoring institute of china geological environment monitoring icgem 2013 as shown in fig 1 there were a total of 75 observational wells including 54 unconfined 19 confined and 2 mixed wells the observation records from the 75 wells were used to represent the variations of the groundwater depths for the yrb to identify the contributions of climate change human activities and their combined influence on gws we also used simulation data produced by xie et al 2015 based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 liang and xie 2001 the simulation data refer to the soil moisture precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff and base flow and these data have been extensively evaluated by xie et al 2015 the surface water storage in major reservoirs and net groundwater withdrawal data were accessed from the water resources bulletin for the yrb wrb yrb 2 3 groundwater storage anomalies the grace data used provided the terrestrial water storage t w s anomalies in order to obtain the groundwater storage g w s anomalies other parts of the water storage including soil moisture storage s m s surface water storage r e s s and snow water equivalent s w e s must be subtracted from the t w s anomalies groundwater storage changes were be computed as 1 δ g w s δ t w s δ s m s δ s w e s δ r e s s the g w s s m s and r e s s changes accounted for the majority of the t w s changes in the yrb at monthly or longer time scales so the s w e s was negligible in this study huang et al 2015 to evaluate the groundwater storage from eq 1 the g w s anomalies were calculated based on the ground observations by multiplying ground measured gw level anomalies deviation from the multi year mean by a constant specific yield μ the values of μ were prescribed based on li 1999 representing the area weighted specific yield changes in g w s were calculated as 2 δ g w s δ h μ in this study the water storage anomalies estimated from both grace and in situ ground measurements were represented as the anomalies of equivalent water height despite the uncertainties in estimating the changes in g w s eq 2 gave a good approximation of the g w s dynamics and was used successfully in a few studies e g feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 a brief discussion on the uncertainties is provided in section 4 3 2 4 groundwater budget groundwater recharge is defined as the addition of water to an aquifer or the addition of water from the overlying unsaturated zone or surface water body scanlon et al 2006 diffuse recharge refers to areally distributed recharge such as from precipitation or irrigation over large areas whereas focused or localized recharge refers to a concentrated recharge from surface topographic depressions such as streams lakes and playas haile 2011 recharge to aquifers is complex and dependent upon the climatic conditions land use irrigation and hydrogeological heterogeneity arnold et al 2000 the direct estimation of groundwater recharge at a basin scale is difficult because of the spatial heterogeneity of the soil profile here we used a water balance equation to approximate the groundwater recharge r e mm yr 3 r e p r e e t r δ s m s where p r e denoted monthly precipitation mm yr e t was evapotranspiration mm yr r was surface runoff mm yr and δ s m s was the change in soil moisture storage mm yr these variables could be estimated from the vic modeling xie et al 2015 note that δsms was the soil moisture from the top two soil layers in the natural groundwater budget the groundwater connection in this region with others was not considered in this study because the study area can be assumed as a close and independent basin but the groundwater withdraw from this to other regions was included in the groundwater balance at a yearly scale the groundwater balance could be expressed as 4 δ g w s r e b a s e f l o w n g w where δ g w s was the change of groundwater storage b a s e f l o w was the baseflow runoff which can be estimated from the vic modeling and n g w was the net groundwater withdrawal calculated by subtracting the infiltration to the groundwater storage and the return flow to river systems from the total groundwater abstraction doll et al 2012 the term net groundwater withdrawal n g w is used interchangeably with groundwater consumption in this study the data for n g w from the wrb yrb have been well evaluated and widely used in basin scale water resource assessments in china 3 results 3 1 change in terrestrial water storage we first detected the change in tws in this study a 13 point moving average was used to smooth the seasonal variations and remove the high frequency signals contained in the monthly time series to detect the long term changes scanlon et al 2012 the tws obtained from grace have been intensively evaluated using the data from the global land data assimilation system ni et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 a the tws had a general depletion at a rate of 2 33 mm yr and included distinct seasonal and annual fluctuations during the period from 2005 to 2013 there were three declining periods 2005 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 with a significant reduction of about 25 mm occurring in the first period the t w s reached a minimum and maximum in the spring and autumn respectively this was mainly due to limited precipitation and agricultural irrigation withdrawal in the spring and the rainy season from july to november actually the variation of t w s was closely related to climatic conditions since it agreed well with the phases of precipitation zou et al 2013 the spatial distributions of t w s were not uniform over the yrb the t w s appeared to be slowly increasing in the source region of the yrb and decreasing over the lower section of the yrb fig 2 b presented the spatial distribution of the tws trend for its upper region from 2003 to 2010 the t w s increased with a rate of about 8 0 mm yr but for the middle and lower regions it substantially decreased at a rate of 7 0 mm yr these results were roughly consistent with the estimates in zhao et al 2015 this significant decrease was attributable to agricultural irrigation chang et al 2014 3 2 trend in groundwater storage with the decline of the terrestrial water storage the groundwater system gave a relevant response characterized by the pattern of the groundwater table and the groundwater storage fig 3 shows average groundwater table variations calculated from the in situ observations the groundwater table decreased about 1 28 m from 2005 to 2013 as shown in fig 4 the groundwater storage from the in situ observations had a continuous decline at a rate of 2 85 mm yr p 0 05 a similar pattern was also exhibited by the grace g w s anomaly the g w s depletion rate derived from grace was 3 11 mm yr p 0 05 therefore the grace derived g w s agreed approximately with the in situ observations however the former had a larger fluctuation with respect to frequency and amplitude this difference could be attributed to the sparse in situ observations of groundwater table and the specific yields that were used to estimate the gws gws also had obvious spatial variability as a consequence of climatic condition and human activities fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of yearly g w s for the period of 2005 2013 roughly g w s showed an even spatial distribution in the year of 2005 but its spatial variability enlarged over time in 2009 g w s reached negative departures of about 6 mm in the southeastern part of the region and after that the spatial pattern varied to some degree in the eastern part of the region a negative anomaly with a maximum of 10 mm was found after the year of 2009 indicating that this region experienced substantial groundwater storage depletion 3 3 groundwater budget analysis a groundwater budget is driven generally by groundwater recharge baseflow and groundwater abstraction groundwater recharge is dominated by precipitation input et and surface runoff output as expressed in eq 3 here we analyze each groundwater budget component and further discuss groundwater depletion as shown in fig 6 annual precipitation increased in the central area of the yrb at a rate of about 20 30 mm yr from 2005 2013 this increased water input was mostly balanced by the water output of et and surface runoff and the groundwater recharge showed an obvious increase in the northeastern area however a large decrease of annual precipitation about 30 mm yr occurred in the southeastern area consequently the annual groundwater recharge of the entire yrb was about 56 mm with an upward trend of 0 135 mm yr fig 7 but it exhibited a slight downward trend in the southeastern area along with the variation of the annual groundwater recharge annual groundwater discharge baseflow was about 52 mm showing a similar temporal trend from 2005 2013 the net yearly groundwater abstraction by human activities was maintained at a stable level of about 10 mm this abstraction exerted considerable pressure on groundwater consumption the groundwater withdrawal exhibits obvious spatial variability in yrb fig 8 presents the spatial distribution of the groundwater abstraction at province scale for three typical years 2005 2010 and 2013 the eastern part of the yrb has quite larger abstraction than the western part particularly the province in the southeast of yrb i e the henan province reaches the largest groundwater abstraction 62 38 mm yr for the year of 2013 in contrast the qinghai province in the west of yrb shows very small groundwater abstraction 0 74 mm yr for the year of 2013 the spatial distribution of groundwater abstraction and the groundwater recharge as analyzed above contribute to the groundwater storage decline in the eastern part of yrb we calculated the annual groundwater change by two methods the grace derived groundwater anomaly i e eq 1 and the water balance equation i e eq 4 as presented in fig 9 the two methods gave approximately equal estimates for the groundwater change 3 57 mm yr and 4 12 mm yr respectively although the grace derived groundwater change showed larger fluctuations than did that from the water balance therefore the natural recharge discharge processes and groundwater abstraction continuously caused groundwater depletion please note that these yearly estimates of the g w s trend are slightly different from the monthly based estimates as described in subsection 3 2 because of data uncertainties and the time scale difference 3 4 groundwater consumption of different sectors although the total groundwater consumption by human activities was stable during 2005 2013 each groundwater consumption sector in the yrb had different contributions to the groundwater storage decline in the yrb there are four primary groundwater consumption sectors including agricultural irrigation industrial and domestic abstractions and groundwater use for public services here we further identify the contribution from each of the four sectors based on the data from the wrb yrb fig 10 presents the groundwater use by each sector agricultural irrigation accounting for 61 69 of the total groundwater abstraction consumed the largest amount of groundwater among the four followed by the industrial sector 19 76 the domestic sector 13 04 and public 5 52 consumption the groundwater consumption by each sector has an obvious temporal variation as shown in fig 11 specifically the groundwater consumption for agricultural irrigation decreased significantly from 6 55 mm 50 78 km3 in 2005 to 5 78 mm 44 89 km3 in 2012 the other three sectors increased groundwater abstraction and their total groundwater consumption increased 45 from 3 45 mm 26 79 km3 in 2005 to 4 86 mm 37 77 km3 in 2012 the withdrawal by the industrial sector contributed the most to the increase increasing from 1 80 mm 13 99 km3 to 2 6 mm 20 15 km3 therefore the amount of the groundwater consumption from the four sectors had a slight positive trend during the period 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of human nature impact in this study the grace data and in situ observations were used to detect the changes in terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage in the yrb the two sources of data provided consistent estimates for the trend for groundwater storage of about 3 mm yr for the yrb as a whole with a significant decrease in g w s in the eastern part of the yrb similar estimates were also reported by other studies for example zhao et al 2015 indicated that the tws in the eastern part in shanxi province had a downward trend of about 7 76 mm yr with a notable g w s decline in the southeastern part of the region the gws had the largest depletion feng et al 2013 our study presented a large scale estimate for the groundwater storage change human activities and climate had different contribution to the groundwater storage change varying both temporally and spatially the climate change impacted groundwater storage positively due to slight increased precipitation and groundwater recharge xie et al 2015 also demonstrated the spatial and temporal variations of groundwater recharge in the yrb using a land surface modeling however this increased recharge was mostly offset by the trend of baseflow the spatial variability of the groundwater withdrawal is consistent with the distribution of the groundwater storage decline the eastern yrb especially the south eastern yrb experienced the largest groundwater withdrawal which significantly contributed to the groundwater storage decline in this area therefore the change rate of gws was dominated by the groundwater withdrawal for various uses groundwater withdrawal was primarily used for agricultural irrigation in the yrb as in many other regions in china yu et al 2003 taylor et al 2013 however the amount and the fraction of groundwater withdrawal for irrigation have been substantially reduced due to the shrinkage of crop land since a few forestry ecological projects have been implemented in this region e g the grain for green project that led to an increase in forest area 1845 km2 and a reduction in crop plantation 1984 km2 6 59 of the total crop land wang et al 2009 xie et al 2015 unfortunately this reduction of irrigation failed to reverse the groundwater storage decline because the total groundwater withdrawal was relatively stable in contrast to agricultural irrigation the industrial domestic and public withdrawals notably increased because of economic development in the yrb wang et al 2017 yin et al 2017 therefore groundwater storage continued to decline with stable groundwater withdrawals according to the groundwater budget analysis moreover the grace and the water balance equation provided evidence of the long time groundwater over exploitation 4 2 implications for water resource management the trend in groundwater storage and the contributions discussed above have implications for water resource management in yrb along with an emphasis on ecological restoration groundwater protection and recovery are of great concern in china to relieve groundwater storage depletion it is important to consider interactions among climate change land surface and groundwater hydrology water conservancy engineering and human social systems including societal adaptations to water scarcity to realize the sustainable development of water resources a few effective measures can be adopted to ease the groundwater loss including artificial recharge of water into aquifers crop structure adjustment and water saving irrigation konikow and kendy 2005 since agricultural irrigation is still the largest groundwater user among the four sectors limiting water allocation for agricultural irrigation should be encouraged to ensure a sustainable level of water sue perry et al 2017 introducing effective irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation and micro sprinkle irrigation can increase water use efficiency by more than 90 at field scale in this sense improving the irrigation mode in the yrb is able to reduce the dependence on groundwater on the other hand these hi tech irrigation may encourage more crop planting and consequently cause more water allocation perry et al 2017 therefore introducing hi tech irrigation in absence of controls on water allocations will likely make the situation worse to address such a paradox of irrigation efficiency physical water accounts the farm scale to the basin scale are needed for areas where the hi tech irrigation is implemented grafton et al 2018 moreover industrial water demands from the groundwater system could be relaxed to a certain degree by allowing for efficient water recycling ecological projects that were implemented in yrb such as the grain for green should be comprehensively evaluated for their effectiveness in groundwater recharge or discharge water resource assessments could pay more attention to comprehensive strategies for surface water and groundwater allocation considering the impact of climate change across the yrb luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 moreover economic measures should be used to encourage efficient use of water and reallocation of water among different sectors the community should understand the fragility of the groundwater and more specific goals and a comprehensive management scheme should be developed for groundwater use 4 3 uncertainties and limitations despite consistent estimations for groundwater decline our study was subject to uncertainties and limitations regarding the data and methods first only data from a nine year period were used to analyze the groundwater pattern groundwater storage generally requires a long time period 20 years to reach equilibrium under climate forcing and human disturbances döll et al 2015 therefore the data length was deficient for reflecting the groundwater pattern second the groundwater storage estimation from the ground observations had substantial uncertainty due to the spatial distribution of the wells the regional groundwater storage was retrieved based on 54 wells most of which are distributed near residences and the observations may have been influenced by human impact groundwater withdrawals initially led to a decrease of stored groundwater volume within the cone of depression of hydraulic heads around the pumping well observation sites could detect this but may have exaggerated the pattern of gws at a regional scale therefore these data were only used to evaluate the grace derived groundwater storage though the two approaches gave similar estimates for the trend in the groundwater storage third the groundwater recharge estimates may have substantial uncertainties because they were computed from the vic model simulation in which the groundwater component was not well formulated liang and xie 2001 xie et al 2015 and finally our study focused on the quantity of the groundwater storage rather than the groundwater quality which is also a serious concern in the yrb and the other basins in china jiang et al 2008 li et al 2010 su et al 2009 despite the above mentioned uncertainties and limitations our study provided a regional scale evaluation of groundwater depletion and quantified the contribution of natural groundwater recharge and human withdrawals various sources of data including grace land surface hydrological modeling and in situ observations were used and they provided consistent estimations 5 conclusions this study employed multi source data sets to quantify the spatial and temporal pattern of groundwater storage in the yrb related to climate change and human activities the results demonstrated that the terrestrial water storage has substantially decreased at a rate of 2 33 mm yr during 2005 2013 the pattern of groundwater storage was investigated based on grace and ground observations and the two approaches gave consistent estimates for the trend at about 3 mm yr a slight increase or stable state was observed in groundwater storage after 2011 moreover groundwater storage exhibited spatial variability with a significant depletion in the southeastern part of the yrb where human activities regarding groundwater withdrawal were intensive the roles of climate change and human activities in the groundwater depletion varied during the period natural groundwater recharge was observed as a positive trend because of increased precipitation especially in the northeastern area however the increased recharge was mostly offset by the baseflow therefore groundwater storage decreased with human groundwater withdrawal the total net groundwater withdrawal was nearly stable about 10 mm yr although agricultural irrigation from groundwater decreased substantially partly due to the implementation of ecological projects in the yrb the total withdrawals from other sectors including industrial public and domestic consumption increased 41 during 2005 2012 particularly industrial groundwater consumption which accounted for 19 76 of total groundwater consumption increased about 44 therefore groundwater withdrawal still played a significant role in groundwater depletion there were a few uncertainties and limitations with respect to the length of the study period data quality and spatial representativeness of the ground observations however this study concluded that the sectors that account for groundwater depletion in the yrb have changed and that it can support scientific decisions on water resource allocation and use in the yrb despite the decrease in the use of groundwater for irrigation agricultural irrigation accounted for over 60 of groundwater use therefore when emphasizing new techniques for agricultural irrigation e g drip irrigation and micro sprinkle irrigation we should pay more attention on water allocations on the basis of basin and regional scale water accounting to avoid the paradox of irrigation efficiency perry et al 2017 grafton et al 2018 a comprehensive management strategy for surface water and groundwater is important for the lower reaches the southeastern area of the yrb acknowledgements this study was

11227,hydrological effects caused by fragmented land cover types in human dominated agro ecosystems are poorly understood in this study based on visual interpreted high resolution land cover map an agro hydrological model hydrus dualkc was used in a distributed manner to investigate the hydrological complexities caused by fragmented land cover types and shallow groundwater an irrigation system located in the upper yellow river basin was chosen as a case study area where field observations were conducted in 2012 and 2013 combined effects of vegetation soil irrigation and groundwater were considered simulations of soil moisture and soil salinity fitted well with field observations evapotranspiration eta was also comparable with remote sensing data results showed that the growing season eta varied from 162 to 567 mm among the different vegetation covers with the values for crop fields usually higher than those for natural lands the soil evaporation was obviously larger in natural land and the natural vegetation growth was seriously stressed through lateral groundwater exchange the cropland functioned as a stable groundwater recharge zone while the natural land functioned as a discharge zone during the growing season as a result 21 of the total water diverted to jiyuan migrated to natural lands through groundwater due to field percolation and canal seepage along with 50 75 of the total salt introduced the fragmented land covers and complex hydrological processes bring many challenges to remote sensing and model simulation future land planning and water resources management should consider the hydrological effects caused by the fragmented land cover types and the associated management strategies keywords land fragmentation distributed simulation lateral exchange water balance salt accumulation hydrological processes 1 introduction fragmented landscapes are becoming one of the most ubiquitous features of the world laurance and bierregaard 1997 especially in agricultural areas the growing demand for food requires intensive use of land for agricultural production with consequent depletion of a large amount of water resources at the same time unused or degraded agricultural land is often converted to natural vegetation patches for forage production or biodiversity protection mclaughlin 2011 ren et al 2017 in addition cropland is often further divided into small farms and planted with various kinds of crops as a result the landscape in agricultural systems is highly heterogeneous with multiple land cover types and it may change annually fragmented land cover types with shallow groundwater are common seen in irrigated agricultural systems especially in the developing regions with smallholder agriculture such as the irrigation districts along the yellow river in china luo and sophocleous 2010 the inland valleys in west africa schmitter et al 2015 the fergana valley in central asia karimov et al 2014 and the indo gangetic

effects have yet to receive much attention due to this information is important for land use planning and water resources management it is necessary to quantify the extent to which land fragmentation and the associated management practices influence hydrological conditions in agricultural areas as the agro hydrological cycle involves complex and interactive processes related to the atmosphere soil water and groundwater dynamics solute transport and vegetation growth kahlown et al 2005 askri et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 distinguishing effects of fragmented land covers on hydrological processes poses a particular challenge field observation coupling with model simulation has become a popular method to study detailed hydrological processes the observation data were usually obtained by conducting either field experiments or interpreting remote sensing data hydrological models such as swap kroes and van dam 2003 van dam et al 2008 hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 2009 2016 aquacrop raes et al 2009 simdualkc rosa et al 2012 and ahc xu et al 2018 are traditionally considered field scale models while agnps young et al 1989 apex williams and izaurralde 2006 and swat arnold et al 1998 are watershed scale models in arid irrigated agro ecosystems with fragmented land cover types and shallow groundwater hydrological processes are rather complicated relating to the highly heterogeneous evapotranspiration demand management strategies and soil conditions the field scale models can provide a detailed description of the aquifer soil vegetation atmosphere system but are of limited use at regional scales due to regionally varying conditions the watershed scale models are usually focused on surface flow systems subsurface flows especially soil water salt dynamics are usually handled in a simplistic way in order to address the limitations of the application of above field watershed scale models in irrigated agro ecosystems gis assisted field scale models were developed and successfully applied in regional scale simulations in agricultural lands droogers et al 2000 singh et al 2006 minacapilli et al 2008 jiang et al 2015 this kind of distributed simulation has many advantages in clarifying the agro hydrological processes under fragmented fields in which soil water and salt dynamics were concerned for crop growth in irrigated agro ecosystems with shallow groundwater depth the movement of soil water and groundwater nutrients salts and vegetation growth are also highly affected by lateral groundwater exchange among different fields ren et al 2016 konukcu et al 2006 previous studies using distributed simulation were mainly focused on evapotranspiration percolation or lateral drainage singh et al 2006 noory et al 2011 hao et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 the hydrological connections of different land cover types through lateral groundwater exchange have not been studied in detail ren et al 2016 2018a have assessed the hydrological processes in the field scale in hetao irrigation district hetao located in the upper yellow river basin in northern china fig 1 using the hydrus dualkc model the hydrus dualkc model is a mechanistic agro hydrological model by coupling the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 and the dualkc approach allen et al 1998 which has greater flexibility to address problems such as surface mulches partly wetted and vegetation with relatively poor conditions of density height leaf area or vitality e g natural vegetation since these studies set the bottom boundary as a time variable pressure head below the groundwater level the lateral groundwater exchange can also be calculated based on the water budgets to have a more comprehensive view of the hydrological processes there is the need for further exploration to present the water and salt dynamics and their lateral exchange under various land cover types at the regional scale for these reasons a sub irrigation district in hetao called jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan ren et al 2018b fig 1 was taken as a case study area to explore the hydrological effects caused by land fragmentation the objectives of this study were to 1 establish a distributed hydrological modelling method based on the hydrus dualkc model gis rs techniques and multiple data sources and 2 reveal complexities of the hydrological processes in agro ecosystems resulted from the fragmented land covers and associated management strategies it is hoped that this will illuminate the challenges of water and salt management as well as land planning in arid irrigated agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the jiyuan 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e is located in the western region of hetao fig 1 covering an area of 8490 ha in which 60 7 is cropland 30 3 is natural land 5 7 is residential land 2 5 is sand dunes and 0 8 is water body the topography is very flat with plain elevation varying from 1036 to 1043 m above mean sea level msl and exhibits a small slope in the direction of south to north besides the regional terrain trend small elevation differences 0 50 cm exist among different land covers e g natural land always located at lower elevations compared with nearby cropland because topographic gradients are low and in many places both the landscape and the channel network have been heavily modified by humans surface hydrologic connections e g rainfall runoff are usually very weak and blocked by field ridges the area has an arid to semi arid continental climate where light and heat resources are abundant with a mean annual temperature of 7 c mean annual duration of sunshine being 3100 3300 h and mean frost free days numbering 135 150 d water resources are relatively scarce with average annual precipitation of 140 mm and free surface water evaporation 20 cm pan of approximately 2000 mm the heterogeneous land use and land cover types fig 2 a are mainly caused by cropland and natural land which together occupy more than 90 of jiyuan the farmland policy the so called household responsibility system and the high labor land ratio result in very small operational scales tan et al 2006 lian et al 2014 in addition a household s land parcels are further divided into separate smaller farms to take into account the differences in land quality such as soil conditions and irrigation and the distance of farm plots wu et al 2005 hence the fragmentation of the crop fields is aggravated with the random distribution of crops in recent years sunflower and maize are the main crops grown in jiyuan which occupy nearly 90 of the cropland the other crops are mainly vegetables e g watermelon tomato and pepper and wheat the natural lands are mainly sparse grassland with scattered shrubs or abandoned cultivated land caused by high soil salinization the natural lands are important to biodiversity and to keep the natural succession of the agro ecosystem they exhibit a patchy distribution within and surrounding the croplands and the species composition of the vegetation is simple with most of them being salt tolerant vegetation such as tamarix chinensis phragmites australis elymus dahuricus and suaeda salsa as a result the landscape is highly fragmented and composited by a mosaic pattern of small mixed crop fields and natural vegetation patches fig 2a the irrigation network in jiyuan is controlled by two branch canals i e the west branch and the east branch which originate from the same trunk canal and flow from south to north fig 1 numerous lateral canals field canals and terminal canals further distribute water to the entire region two main drainage ditches one in the middle part and the other near the east boundary as well as many field drainage ditches collect and discharge drainage water the west boundary of jiyuan is also a series of shallow drainage ditches but they are not fully connected thus jiyuan is a relatively closed basin with minimal connectivity to adjacent areas generally jiyuan has 4 6 water diversions during the growing season from early may to late september based on the climate and river water conditions table 1 the natural patches are almost never irrigated while crop fields are irrigated several times the total water diversion during the growing season in jiyuan averaged 28 million m3 in the period 2001 2013 hetao irrigation district administration 2001 2013 hetao irrigation district administration 2001 because the drainage ditches are shallow and flat the drainage system also mainly works during the water diversion periods for draining the groundwater and the excessive surface water based on the statistical data the drainage amount averaged 3 6 million m3 during the growing season in which about 1 3 was through groundwater discharge and the rest was through surface runoff i e the excessive irrigation water directly released into the drainage ditches the flat topography and poor drainage systems combined with excess irrigation determines the presence of shallow water tables and the long term accumulation of solutes derived from irrigation water the salt accumulation amounts derived from irrigation water are about 0 48 kg m 2 per year in jiyuan assuming a uniform distribution in irrigated cropland the groundwater depth cyclically varies from 0 to 3 m during the year it has a very small hydraulic gradient of about 0 05 at the regional scale mainly dictated by the topographic gradients however in the landscape scale 30 500 m groundwater hydraulic gradients can reach 0 1 3 among different land covers during the irrigation period due to the diverse irrigation schedules thus the landscape scale groundwater hydraulic gradients caused by irrigation are the dominant driver of the groundwater processes the total dissolved salt tds g l 1 of groundwater 3 m below soil surface in jiyuan is relatively stable and averaged 2 1 g l 1 2 2 monitoring network and data collection field observations were conducted during the growing season from late april to late september in 2012 and 2013 a total of 28 observation points were set at jiyuan for soil groundwater and crop growth the observation points were arranged based on land use crops and canal network fig 1 they are mainly distributed in cropland and natural land and almost covered all kinds of crops produced in the study area soil sampling was performed monthly using a soil auger to determine soil water content and soil salinity concentration leaf area index lai crop height ch cm and the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc and plastic films fr mulch were also observed monthly the development stages of main crops and natural vegetation were recorded crop yields were measured after harvest besides these observation points another 39 observation wells were set up the groundwater depth and groundwater electrical conductivity ec w were observed every 5 15 days in the observation wells groundwater levels in some typical areas were also continuously recorded manually or by water level loggers hobo u20 usa the soil textural properties were surveyed at 38 point locations well distributed and down to 100 cm depth for a comprehensive understanding of soils in jiyuan the particle size distribution saturated water content θs cm3 cm 3 field capacity θfc cm3 cm 3 dry bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d 1 were measured in the different horizons of each observation site except for the sampling frequency the above sampling and measuring methods were the same as the experiment conducted in yangchang canal command area yca ren et al 2016 which is a typical area within jiyuan fig 1 to characterize the spatial distribution of salinity an extra sampling campaign was carried out in late april just before the growing season core sampling and electrical conductivity ec measurements were done systematically in a 500 500 m regular grid covering the whole jiyuan a total of 336 points were identified and soil samples were collected every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and at 20 cm increments below the top layer to 100 cm depth the soil salt content ssc g 100 g 1 was empirically related to the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 the salt distribution map fig 2b was eventually obtained using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map with a resolution of 30 m pixel size was derived from the chinese huanjing 1 hj 1 satellite then the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc fig 2c was calculated from ndvi using the linear relationship of gutman and ignatov 1998 1 f c ndvi ndv i min ndv i max ndv i min ndvimin refers to the minimum observed ndvi for the entire area of study over the entire time period in this case ndvimin was calculated by averaging the five smallest observed values ndvimax refers to the maximum observed ndvi and was calculated as the average of the five largest observed values ndvi is the specific ndvi for a given pixel at a given time the fc map was derived monthly from may to september to cover the initial mid and end growth stages of the various vegetation the information of water conveyance in the two branch canals was collected from the hetao irrigation district administration some lateral and field canals were also measured using a velocity instrument in 2012 and 2013 irrigation depths table 1 applied to different kinds of crops were either measured using a trapezoidal thin wall weir in typical observation fields or surveyed from the local farmers land cover maize sunflower natural vegetation tamarisk melon wheat and others i e sand dunes or water was recorded during the regional survey topographic map soil map satellite images of landsat and high resolution google earth images were also collected for further analysis daily meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were collected from the nearby linhe weather station precipitation was registered by a tipping bucket unit using a rain gauge located in yca as jiyuan is not so large consistent meteorological data were applied to the whole study area 2 3 agroecosystem modeling 2 3 1 distributed hydrus dualkc modeling the hydrus dualkc model is a mechanistic agro hydrological model resulting from coupling the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 and the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dualkc approach allen et al 1998 2011 both models have been widely used and validated in irrigated agriculture jiménez martínez et al 2009 karimov et al 2014 allen 2000 zhao et al 2013 the coupled model uses the dualkc approach to separately determine the potential crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates for the implementation of the upper boundary conditions of hydrus 1d correspondingly a mechanistic approach i e a two stage calculation method which is a more practical method recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 was introduced in hydrus to calculate soil evaporation the governing equation for soil water flow and solute transport are respectively the one dimensional 1 d richards equation and convective dispersive equation the soil hydraulic properties are described using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 functions the effects of water stress and osmotic stress on root water uptake are calculated by the feddes equation feddes et al 1978 and the modified s shape equation dirksen and augustijn 1988 the model has been successfully applied to several crops maize sunflower and watermelon and the natural vegetation tamarisk grown in yca ren et al 2016 a detailed model description for hydrus dualkc can be found in ren et al 2016 in order to implement distributed modeling at a regional scale using the 1 d agro hydrological model hydrus dualkc the study area was divided into sub areas denoted as simulation units each simulation unit was considered homogenous with a specific combination of soil crop weather irrigation amount and groundwater level independent runs of hydrus dualkc were conducted for each of the simulation units subsequently the outputs of independent model runs were aggregated to evaluate the hydrological processes under various land covers and management strategies the hydrological processes of residential land water bodies and sand dunes were not simulated due to their special land cover types what is more as they totally occupied no more than 10 of jiyuan and their water balance budgets were relatively small they may not have significant effects on the quantity of water exchange between croplands and natural lands however in order to close the water salt balance for the whole region evaporation from these areas was also estimated using local empirical formulas and then their lateral groundwater exchanges were also calculated ren et al 2018b 2 3 2 spatial data processing and aggregation the proper delineation of simulation units is fundamental to accurately conduct the distributed simulation and further analysis of the hydrological processes in this study the simulation units were obtained by overlaying thematic map layers of vegetation irrigation soil and groundwater depth spatial information for these variables was collected and aggregated by field experiments satellite images and existing geographical data on jiyuan during the years 2012 and 2013 to generate thematic maps due to the high land fragmentation of jiyuan crop and land use pattern maps from the years 2012 and 2013 were generated by large area field survey as well as manual visual interpretation of high resolution google earth images about 0 5 m resolution a total of 5 vegetation types were classified maize sunflower wheat vegetable and natural land for model simulation as shown in fig 2a in the classification the identified intercropped fields wheat corn or wheat sunflower were few and scattered thus they were randomly assigned to one of the two crops watermelon tomato and pepper which had similar crop calendars and irrigation scheduling were assembled as the vegetable type natural vegetation patches of shrubs grass woods and marshes containing various kinds of vegetation were classified as natural land as a result cropland and natural land were the main model simulation areas the other land use types residential land sand dune and water body unsuitable for model simulation were treated specially with water balance methods as described before the irrigation scheduling is diverse among different vegetation types moreover for a certain crop different fields may also have different irrigation depths during an irrigation period generally the upstream areas have larger irrigation depths as they have more access to the canal water based on the water supply information of the two branch canals and field observations the irrigation depths in jiyuan can be divided into 4 grades thus 4 sub regions located from the upstream to the downstream and separated by control sluices in the branch canals were generated for a certain crop in a certain region the irrigation depths among fields were averaged as a result the spatial distribution of irrigation depth during the growing season was obtained fig 3 a soils in jiyuan were preliminarily divided into two series based on the 1 1 000 000 scale soil map soil genetic classification of china in the middle part along the drainage ditch was yan soil and in the west and east sides was chaoguanyu soil fig 3b field soil surveys also showed that the soil distribution in jiyuan is similar and more than 90 can be classified as silt loam thus the two series soil map was adopted for the generation of simulation units the soil types in each simulation unit can be further refined based on the data from field survey points in or near it the average groundwater levels during crop growing season relative to the height datum with their accompanying geographical coordinates were converted to a point shapefile then to a groundwater surface using the ordinary kriging interpolation method a high resolution dem was generated from the local topographic map at a scale of 1 10 000 with numerous ground survey points a groundwater depth depth from ground surface to water table gwd map was obtained by subtracting groundwater surface from the dem using the raster calculator tool then the gwd was classified into five categories as shown in fig 3c finally the jiyuan was divided into 157 and 159 simulation units in the years 2012 and 2013 respectively by overlaying the above four thematic maps vegetation irrigation soil and groundwater the areas of each simulation unit ranged from 0 002 to 3 8 km2 with larger ones being mainly contiguous natural land thus the simulation units were mainly at the scale of field level one simulation unit may contain a group of isolated fields under similar hydrology conditions due to land fragmentation fig 3d 2 3 3 model set up calibration and validation for each of the simulation units an independent run of hydrus dualkc was conducted to simulate water salt dynamics and vegetation root water uptake during the growing season all five land cover types maize sunflower wheat vegetable and natural land were considered in the simulation because various types of vegetables and natural vegetation were present watermelon was selected to represent vegetable fields and tamarix chinensis tamarisk was selected to represent the natural land cover the simulated soil profile was 300 cm in depth and simplified to two layers a top soil 0 40 cm and a sub soil 40 300 cm the vertical one dimensional soil domain was discretized into 301 nodes with a uniform spacing of 1 cm simulation domain setup was the same for the whole study area the simulation period was from early may to late september covering the whole growth period of all the vegetation except the initial period of wheat crop calendars ren et al 2018b and irrigation calendars table 1 were different between fields due to differences in farmers decisions on the time of sowing and irrigation but not too much thus this study defined an average crop calendar and irrigation calendar for a certain crop for water flow daily precipitation and irrigation fluxes and the potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp rates were specified to implement the upper boundary condition while a variable pressure head deduced from groundwater depth gwd was selected as the bottom boundary condition ep and tp were determined using the dualkc approach as the application of the dualkc approach needs the fraction cover fc of each simulation unit they were calculated from the fc map fig 2c by the average of all the pixel values in it the daily variable gwd in the simulation unit without continuous observations can be obtained by three steps first the average gwd during the growing season was obtained from the gwd map fig 3c then the fluctuation characteristics of the water table level can be indicated by the continuous water level data obtained near the simulation unit finally the daily gwd were interpolated based on the average value and the amplitudes and the periods of continuous groundwater level graph for solute transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined by a concentration flux considering the observed tds of irrigation water 0 52 g l 1 and groundwater 2 1 g l 1 respectively initial soil moisture for the simulated units were specified by hydrostatic equilibrium with initial groundwater level as recorded in the jiyuan observation wells in early may of 2012 and 2013 initial soil salinity concentration in the soil profile was specified according to field observations and the salt distribution map fig 2b the initial soil hydraulic parameters of each simulation unit were represented by the observation point in it or near it they can be estimated by bulk density and percentages of sand silt and clay values using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 initial solute transport parameters were obtained referring to xu et al 2013 the soil evaporation parameters were specified referring to fao 56 for the cropland and ren et al 2017 for the natural land parameters of root growth root distribution and root water uptake for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk were set the same as those of ren et al 2016 and for wheat were set the same as those of xu et al 2013 for the simulation unit with monitoring points the observed soil water content and salinity concentrations in different soil layers i e 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 cm relative to 2013 and 2012 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively for the unit without monitoring points the parameters in an adjacent calibrated unit were adopted in this study the daily remote sensing eta data in 2012 with 250 m resolution was available for the whole jiyuan it was derived from modis data by yang et al 2012 thus it also can be adopted to evaluate the accuracy and reasonableness of distributed modeling the main water budgets calculated by the water balance method as did in ren et al 2018a b were also used for model validation several goodness of fit indicators including the regression coefficient b the determination coefficient r2 the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were used as the criteria to evaluate the model performance more detailed descriptions can be found in ren et al 2016 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation a total of 22 observation points including 7 sunflower points 7 maize points 3 watermelon points 2 wheat points and 3 tamarisk points distributed in 22 simulation units in 2013 were used for model calibration the simulated soil water content and salinity concentrations in different soil layers of the various vegetation fields were compared with the monthly measured values as shown in fig 4 the arrangement between measured and simulated soil water content of all five vegetation types is good the mre values ranged from 1 21 to 1 55 the rmse values were about 0 02 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and the r2 values were in a range of 0 78 0 89 b values were 0 98 1 01 and the nse values were between 0 76 0 89 for salt simulation the goodness of fit indicators were also satisfactory with 4 45 mre 10 34 0 97 rmse 4 89 g l 1 r2 0 82 0 93 b 1 03 and nse 0 81 the discrepancies in the salt simulation were larger than those for the water simulation however the modeling efficiency nse in salt was higher this may be because soil water contents were relatively stable and mainly concentrated at high levels due to the shallow groundwater depth while salinity concentrations had a relatively larger amplitude of fluctuation and significant tendency of variation the detailed time variation of soil water contents and soil salinity concentrations in some typical land cover types maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk has been presented and discussed in ren et al 2016 the model was validated using the same 22 observation points in 2012 they were still distributed in 22 simulation units however the vegetation cover in some fields may not be the same as in 2013 all calibrated soil parameters were directly used as model inputs during validation simulation results showed that the goodness of fit indicators for soil water content 1 32 mre 0 40 0 02 rmse 0 04 cm3 cm 3 0 73 r2 0 85 0 98 b 1 00 and 0 72 nse 0 85 and salinity concentrations 1 15 mre 3 78 0 66 rmse 3 69 g l 1 0 78 r2 0 92 0 96 b 0 99 and 0 78 nse 0 92 were also satisfactory a uniform point sampling of 237 paired eta values from the remote sensing eta map fig 5 a and simulated eta map fig 5b of jiyuan were conducted for model validation in 2012 results showed their consistency was not perfect but still acceptable fig 5c mre and rmse were 2 0 and 43 5 mm r2 and b were 0 47 and 1 01 and the nse was 0 31 due to high land fragmentation the width of crop fields was usually less than 50 m while the remote sensing eta had a resolution of 250 m pixel size it was too large to distinguish land cover types especially in the cropland as shown in fig 5d the simulated eta values 44 m pixel size under each remote sensing eta pixel 250 m may vary greatly thus the 250 m pixel should always be a mixed pixel containing more than one land cover type and the eta in each pixel was an averaged value however the simulated eta map constituted by individual simulation units was based on precise land cover classification thus there may be some discrepancies in the point to point comparison of the two maps which explained why the goodness of fit indicators were not perfect the model efficiency nse was also not as high as the eta values were concentrated in higher levels fig 5 the spatially averaged eta by model simulation and remote sensing in jiyuan were very close respectively with values of 511 and 500 mm the simulated eta of cropland and natural land in 2012 and 2013 were also comparable with that calculated by water balance method during the growing season ren et al 2018b in summary results indicated that the model performance was generally good and it could be considered a valuable tool to analyze the hydrological processes under various land cover types 3 2 spatial characteristics of evapotranspiration model simulations provided a detailed description of the spatial variation of actual evapotranspiration eta fig 6 during the growing season the spatial pattern of seasonal eta of the year 2013 is shown in fig 6a eta was highly heterogeneous among the different land cover types ranging between 162 567 mm table 2 overall eta was higher in the croplands and lower in the natural lands in 2013 for example eta ranged from 315 to 567 mm and spatially averaged 517 mm in cropland while in natural land eta ranged from 162 to 503 mm and averaged 418 mm eta in natural land had greater variability than that in cropland due to the highly different environmental conditions for those natural areas with suitable groundwater depth and large vegetation coverage such as the south jiyuan eta was almost comparable with that of croplands however in the areas with serious salinity problems and very low vegetation coverage like the natural lands in the northern part eta was very small and even less than 200 mm the highest eta that occurred in cropland was the sunflower field whereas the lowest one was the vegetable fields this was mainly caused by different irrigation scheduling and crop calendars contrary to the spatial distribution of eta the actual soil evaporation ea in natural areas is usually larger than that of croplands during the growing season in 2013 ea of cropland ranged from 45 to 259 mm and spatially averaged 169 mm whereas ea of natural land ranged from 62 to 347 mm and averaged 243 mm table 2 the higher ea in natural land was caused by the lower vegetation coverage and shallower groundwater depth ren et al 2017 as shown in fig 2c during the mid stage of the growing season in early august when the maximum fc occurs almost all the natural lands had an fc smaller than 0 5 while most of the croplands were larger than 0 8 moreover the natural lands were mainly distributed in the low lying areas with shallower groundwater depths fig 3c as a result the evaporation ratio ea eta fig 6b in natural land averaged about 0 58 during the growing season indicating a very low water use efficiency the highest and lowest ea in croplands were respectively for vegetable and maize fields their distinctions were mainly caused by the differences in irrigation scheduling and the duration of their growth period ren et al 2018a the ea eta varied from 0 11 to 0 79 in jiyuan and the spatial average value was about 0 4 which was higher than those in the other similar places around the world kool et al 2014 therefore control of non beneficial bare soil evaporation especially in natural land should be an effective way to save water in hetao the spatial pattern of actual vegetation transpiration ta was similar to that of eta with ta in cropland larger than in the natural land in the year 2013 ta in cropland and natural land respectively ranged from 187 mm to 388 mm and from 74 mm to 265 mm table 2 for all crops maize had the highest ta whereas vegetables had the lowest ta it was because maize had a longer growth period and higher potential transpiration tp than vegetables in the dry year of 2013 ta in cropland had an obvious decreasing trend from south to north along with decreasing irrigation depths from the upstream to the downstream areas in the wet year of 2012 there was no such spatial trend the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration ta tp which reflects soil water salt stress to vegetation growth is presented in fig 6d results showed that the vegetation in jiyuan suffered from varying degrees of water salt stress with ta tp ranging from 0 42 to 0 99 the natural land had a relatively lower ta tp indicating natural vegetation suffered from more serious stress especially during the middle and late stages as shown in fig 4 for all observation points distributed in the various land cover types soil moisture in the root zone was maintained in a suitable range for vegetation growth however soil salinity concentrations always exceed the threshold values for vegetation thus the vegetation growth stress in the study area should be primarily caused by soil salinity instead of water deficit the most salt tolerant crop sunflower had the highest ta tp in cropland while maize and vegetables which are relatively sensitive to salt had lower values the lower ta in natural land was not only caused by obviously lower vegetation coverage but also more serious stress as compared with that in cropland generally natural vegetation has characteristics of much higher resistance to drought salinity and waterlogging as compared with crops in the same area this implies that the root zone environment of natural vegetation was under a rather serious condition 3 3 bottom flux of different land cover types due to the shallow gwd and different management strategies the spatiotemporal distribution of bottom water and salt flux varied greatly among different land cover types fig 7 in this study the bottom upward flux and downward flux were calculated and analyzed separately during the growing season results showed that the spatial distribution of downward water flux percolation was similar to the spatial trend of irrigation fig 3a for example in 2013 the sunflower field which had the largest irrigation depths also had the largest percolation ranging from 169 to 389 mm and averaged 237 mm table 3 the non irrigated natural lands had the smallest percolation with values between 40 and 291 mm averaging 87 mm over all the percolation depths declined from the relatively heavy irrigated south areas to the slightly irrigated north areas in contrast the upward flux in natural land was the largest from 219 to 456 mm averaged 365 mm whereas the upward flux in the sunflower field was the smallest from 35 to 236 mm averaged 118 mm the larger upward flux in natural land was attributed to no irrigation occurring in it and shallow groundwater was a major source to supplement the depletion of soil water by evapotranspiration especially during the irrigation period the sharp groundwater level increase due to cropland irrigation caused significant upward water flux in the natural land the upward flux can contribute to more than 80 of eta in natural land whereas in cropland it was less than 30 tables 3 and 4 as shown in fig 7a the cumulative net bottom water flux in 2013 ranged from 354 to 206 mm in the cropland was dominated by downward flux negative whereas in the natural land it ranged from 73 to 408 mm was dominated by upward flux positive the spatial distribution of downward salt flux leaching was similar to that of water percolation in the areas with larger irrigation amounts and deeper groundwater depth the salt leaching was more significant therefore the cumulative downward salt flux in the sunflower field was the largest from 351 to 875 g m 2 averaged 512 g m 2 and that in the cropland from 234 to 875 g m 2 averaged 464 g m 2 was significantly higher than that in the non irrigated natural land from 91 to 999 g m 2 averaged 230 g m 2 table 3 as it should be the upward salt flux accumulation showed an opposite spatial pattern with the downward flux the spatial variation of upward flux in natural areas was larger than that of croplands the largest salt accumulation occurred in the natural areas from 352 to 850 g m 2 averaged 674 g m 2 whereas the smallest salt accumulation was found in sunflower fields from 69 to 429 g m 2 averaged 202 g m 2 the larger salt accumulation in natural land was consistent with its larger upward water flux as solute transport was dominated by water flow the spatial distribution of cumulative net bottom salt flux in the study area fig 7b was consistent with that of water during the growing season the cropland especially the sunflower and maize field had an obvious downward salt flux indicating salt was discharged from the root zone during crop growth season whereas the natural land had a significant net salt accumulation table 3 with shallow groundwater depth and well hydraulic connections the vertical bottom flux upward or downward in local areas is the main driver of the lateral groundwater flow thus the interlaced distribution of upward flux and downward flux triggers dramatically lateral groundwater exchange among the different land cover types as the bottom of the simulation domain 300 cm below the ground surface is kept under the groundwater level and the salinity concentration was relatively stable the lateral exchange amount was exactly the cumulative net bottom flux 4 discussion 4 1 water salt balance and redistribution among different land covers during the growing season water and salt balance of each land cover type are spatially averaged and summarized in table 4 the water and salt budgets of the root zone 0 90 cm and the whole simulation profile 0 300 cm were separately calculated and analyzed results showed that the salt accumulation δs in the root zone 0 90 cm was larger than that in the 0 300 cm soil profile for most of the land cover types for example in the year 2013 the δs in natural land reached about 2300 g m 2 in the root zone while in the 0 300 cm profile it was only about 450 g m 2 this indicated that salt in the vertical soil profile was dramatically redistributed during the growing season with salt accumulated to the upper layers from deeper layers through the upward flux the water salt balance of maize sunflower watermelon and wheat was further spatially averaged to obtain the cropland balance table 5 results showed that the cropland had a net groundwater and solute outflow being 9 mm and 121 g m 2 in 2012 and 64 mm and 173 g m 2 in 2013 respectively the water salt balance in the natural land table 4 showed that it had a net groundwater and solute inflow reaching to 230 mm and 300 g m 2 in 2012 and 278 mm and 444 g m 2 in 2013 respectively when considering the area of the cropland 2012 54 5 km2 2013 51 3 km2 and the natural land 2012 22 6 km2 2013 25 7 km2 the total salt outflow 7700 t from the cropland was a little larger than the salt inflow 6800 t to the natural land this may be because a small part of salt in cropland was transported to the other land use types e g residential land sand dunes and water body which were not simulated in this study in the meantime the water outflow from cropland 1 9 million m3 was obviously smaller than the water inflow to natural land 6 2 million m3 this implied that there were some other water sources recharging the groundwater in natural land in addition the recharge should be from the irrigation canal seepage because the jiyuan is a relatively closed area when all the land use types were considered for the groundwater balance in jiyuan the canal seepage to the groundwater was the only pending item and it can be calculated as shown in table 6 the canal seepage ratio the ratio of groundwater recharge from canal seepage to the total water diversion eventually calculated were respectively 0 22 and 0 17 in 2012 and 2013 which was consistent with former studies xu et al 2010 yu et al 2016 thus the validity of the calculation results was further verified the water discharged through interior drainage groundwater flow into the natural land and discharged by evaporation was about 5 times as large as the groundwater discharged through the drainage ditches accounting for 22 of the total water diverted to jiyuan the salt accumulation in cropland was very little only accounting for 8 16 of the salt introduced by water diversion however the salt accumulation in the natural land was very large accounting for 57 79 of the total salt introduced the residual salts moved to other land use types or were drained out through drainage ditches 4 2 hydrological complexities and challenges a key part of understanding the hydrological effects caused by land fragmentation and shallow groundwater system is the connectivity among different land covers hydrological connections occur below ground through the lateral flow of groundwater and aboveground through overland flow jackson et al 2009 in agro ecosystems with flat topography and fairly low precipitation overland flow is negligible the water and salt in each land cover type first moves in a vertical direction affected by infiltration evaporation and water extraction when they affect the groundwater through percolation recharge or capillaries discharge the local water level will rise or decline and further affect the surrounding areas thus the hydrological connectivity is mainly through lateral groundwater flow due to the fragmented distribution of various land cover types and the associated diverse management strategies in this case the hydrological processes were rather complicated the diverse irrigation schedules as well as the evapotranspiration differences resulted in a complex distribution of groundwater recharge and discharge zones triggering intense lateral groundwater exchange among the various land cover types according to the calculation the recharge zones were mainly sunflower and maize fields the discharge zones were mainly natural areas and vegetable fields to some extent the lateral groundwater exchange reallocated the water with a certain degree of salinity applied to the system thus the non irrigated vegetation in discharge zones could indirectly use the irrigation water during a water diversion which may improve the water use efficiency unfortunately when water is evapotranspirated it leaves behind the salts the water contained if this continues the recharge zones can effectively get rid of excess salt and water while the discharge zones may suffer salinity problems in natural basins recharge and discharge zones are typically viewed as topographically fixed across landscapes jackson et al 2009 however in this human dominated agro ecosystem shifts in vegetation and irrigation can overcome topographic controls and alter recharge and discharge zones in this study due to the annual variation of crop distribution the lateral flow in cropland was not consistent thus the recharge and discharge zones would be changed from one place to another between years this is good for agricultural production as there will not be a place with continuous salt accumulation in the cropland however the one way flow of water and solutes from the cropland to natural land caused continuous salt input to the natural land as a result the vegetation in natural areas suffered serious salinity stress which has been recognized as the main threat against the sustainability of natural ecosystems in addition our results indicated that the highly fragmented land covers are a challenge to the application of the satellite remote sensing techniques fig 7 for considering the spatial and temporal variation of highly heterogeneous land covers the remote sensing images are required to be produced with frequent updating high spatial resolution and enough spectral bands however the spatial and temporal remote sensing data from the existing set of earth observing satellite platforms are not sufficient enough to be used in the estimation of spatially distributed et for on farm irrigation management purposes especially at a field scale level 0 1 to 1 0 ha gowda et al 2008 moreover the results imply that most of traditional regional modeling may oversimplify the effects of fragmented land covers and smallholder agriculture on hydrological processes in similar agricultural regions xu et al 2011 luo and sophocleous 2011 wesseling and feddes 2006 which may cause a varying degree of simulation distortions or even errors in particular it will bring challenge to the practical use of the regional 2d 3d variably saturated flow model due to the high computational load and model stability 5 conclusions in this study the hydrus dualkc model was used in a distributed manner with the assistance of gis remote sensing data and a field observation network in the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan the model application was successful as shown by the goodness of fit indicators relative to the simulation of soil water content soil salinity concentration and evapotranspiration eta the hydrological complexities in agro ecosystems with fragmented land cover types and various management strategies were assessed based on the model simulation and water balance calculation results showed high spatial variability of actual surface evaporation ea and transpiration ta and bottom water and salt flux during the growing season the ea ranged from 45 to 347 mm in jiyuan and was usually higher in natural land than cropland the ta ranged from 74 to 457 mm and was usually higher in cropland the spatially averaged evaporation ratio ea eta in croplands was about 0 32 while in natural land it reached to 0 58 the non beneficial bare soil evaporation during the growing season in jiyuan was large especially in the natural land the ratio of actual to potential transpiration ta tp showed that the natural land suffered more serious salt stress compared with cropland these consequences can be explained by the bottom water and salt exchange among the different land cover types the cropland had a net bottom water and salt outflow while the natural land had a net bottom inflow the natural land operated as water and solute sinks from the local surroundings through focalized evaporative discharge interior drainage water discharged by interior drainage occupied more than 80 of the total groundwater drainage at the same time 50 75 of the salt introduced by water diversion was discharged to the natural land in this way the excess water and salt in cropland can be effectively discharged and some water can even be reused by natural vegetation however the salt accumulation in natural land seriously affected natural vegetation growth moreover the complex hydrological processes as well as the fragmented land cover types bring challenges for common used technologies in regional water resource management typically as satellite remote sensing and hydrological models hyper resolution model simulations based on the comprehensive field observation network high resolution remote sensing data and appropriate simulation model are needed to confront the challenges acknowledgements this research was jointly supported by the national science foundation of china grant numbers 51639009 51679235 and

11227,hydrological effects caused by fragmented land cover types in human dominated agro ecosystems are poorly understood in this study based on visual interpreted high resolution land cover map an agro hydrological model hydrus dualkc was used in a distributed manner to investigate the hydrological complexities caused by fragmented land cover types and shallow groundwater an irrigation system located in the upper yellow river basin was chosen as a case study area where field observations were conducted in 2012 and 2013 combined effects of vegetation soil irrigation and groundwater were considered simulations of soil moisture and soil salinity fitted well with field observations evapotranspiration eta was also comparable with remote sensing data results showed that the growing season eta varied from 162 to 567 mm among the different vegetation covers with the values for crop fields usually higher than those for natural lands the soil evaporation was obviously larger in natural land and the natural vegetation growth was seriously stressed through lateral groundwater exchange the cropland functioned as a stable groundwater recharge zone while the natural land functioned as a discharge zone during the growing season as a result 21 of the total water diverted to jiyuan migrated to natural lands through groundwater due to field percolation and canal seepage along with 50 75 of the total salt introduced the fragmented land covers and complex hydrological processes bring many challenges to remote sensing and model simulation future land planning and water resources management should consider the hydrological effects caused by the fragmented land cover types and the associated management strategies keywords land fragmentation distributed simulation lateral exchange water balance salt accumulation hydrological processes 1 introduction fragmented landscapes are becoming one of the most ubiquitous features of the world laurance and bierregaard 1997 especially in agricultural areas the growing demand for food requires intensive use of land for agricultural production with consequent depletion of a large amount of water resources at the same time unused or degraded agricultural land is often converted to natural vegetation patches for forage production or biodiversity protection mclaughlin 2011 ren et al 2017 in addition cropland is often further divided into small farms and planted with various kinds of crops as a result the landscape in agricultural systems is highly heterogeneous with multiple land cover types and it may change annually fragmented land cover types with shallow groundwater are common seen in irrigated agricultural systems especially in the developing regions with smallholder agriculture such as the irrigation districts along the yellow river in china luo and sophocleous 2010 the inland valleys in west africa schmitter et al 2015 the fergana valley in central asia karimov et al 2014 and the indo gangetic plain in india and pakistan singh et al 2010 considerable interest has focused on the ecological effects of land cover fragmentation laurance et al 1998 latus and kujawa 2005 whereas hydrological effects have yet to receive much attention due to this information is important for land use planning and water resources management it is necessary to quantify the extent to which land fragmentation and the associated management practices influence hydrological conditions in agricultural areas as the agro hydrological cycle involves complex and interactive processes related to the atmosphere soil water and groundwater dynamics solute transport and vegetation growth kahlown et al 2005 askri et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 distinguishing effects of fragmented land covers on hydrological processes poses a particular challenge field observation coupling with model simulation has become a popular method to study detailed hydrological processes the observation data were usually obtained by conducting either field experiments or interpreting remote sensing data hydrological models such as swap kroes and van dam 2003 van dam et al 2008 hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 2009 2016 aquacrop raes et al 2009 simdualkc rosa et al 2012 and ahc xu et al 2018 are traditionally considered field scale models while agnps young et al 1989 apex williams and izaurralde 2006 and swat arnold et al 1998 are watershed scale models in arid irrigated agro ecosystems with fragmented land cover types and shallow groundwater hydrological processes are rather complicated relating to the highly heterogeneous evapotranspiration demand management strategies and soil conditions the field scale models can provide a detailed description of the aquifer soil vegetation atmosphere system but are of limited use at regional scales due to regionally varying conditions the watershed scale models are usually focused on surface flow systems subsurface flows especially soil water salt dynamics are usually handled in a simplistic way in order to address the limitations of the application of above field watershed scale models in irrigated agro ecosystems gis assisted field scale models were developed and successfully applied in regional scale simulations in agricultural lands droogers et al 2000 singh et al 2006 minacapilli et al 2008 jiang et al 2015 this kind of distributed simulation has many advantages in clarifying the agro hydrological processes under fragmented fields in which soil water and salt dynamics were concerned for crop growth in irrigated agro ecosystems with shallow groundwater depth the movement of soil water and groundwater nutrients salts and vegetation growth are also highly affected by lateral groundwater exchange among different fields ren et al 2016 konukcu et al 2006 previous studies using distributed simulation were mainly focused on evapotranspiration percolation or lateral drainage singh et al 2006 noory et al 2011 hao et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 the hydrological connections of different land cover types through lateral groundwater exchange have not been studied in detail ren et al 2016 2018a have assessed the hydrological processes in the field scale in hetao irrigation district hetao located in the upper yellow river basin in northern china fig 1 using the hydrus dualkc model the hydrus dualkc model is a mechanistic agro hydrological model by coupling the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 and the dualkc approach allen et al 1998 which has greater flexibility to address problems such as surface mulches partly wetted and vegetation with relatively poor conditions of density height leaf area or vitality e g natural vegetation since these studies set the bottom boundary as a time variable pressure head below the groundwater level the lateral groundwater exchange can also be calculated based on the water budgets to have a more comprehensive view of the hydrological processes there is the need for further exploration to present the water and salt dynamics and their lateral exchange under various land cover types at the regional scale for these reasons a sub irrigation district in hetao called jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan ren et al 2018b fig 1 was taken as a case study area to explore the hydrological effects caused by land fragmentation the objectives of this study were to 1 establish a distributed hydrological modelling method based on the hydrus dualkc model gis rs techniques and multiple data sources and 2 reveal complexities of the hydrological processes in agro ecosystems resulted from the fragmented land covers and associated management strategies it is hoped that this will illuminate the challenges of water and salt management as well as land planning in arid irrigated agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the jiyuan 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e is located in the western region of hetao fig 1 covering an area of 8490 ha in which 60 7 is cropland 30 3 is natural land 5 7 is residential land 2 5 is sand dunes and 0 8 is water body the topography is very flat with plain elevation varying from 1036 to 1043 m above mean sea level msl and exhibits a small slope in the direction of south to north besides the regional terrain trend small elevation differences 0 50 cm exist among different land covers e g natural land always located at lower elevations compared with nearby cropland because topographic gradients are low and in many places both the landscape and the channel network have been heavily modified by humans surface hydrologic connections e g rainfall runoff are usually very weak and blocked by field ridges the area has an arid to semi arid continental climate where light and heat resources are abundant with a mean annual temperature of 7 c mean annual duration of sunshine being 3100 3300 h and mean frost free days numbering 135 150 d water resources are relatively scarce with average annual precipitation of 140 mm and free surface water evaporation 20 cm pan of approximately 2000 mm the heterogeneous land use and land cover types fig 2 a are mainly caused by cropland and natural land which together occupy more than 90 of jiyuan the farmland policy the so called household responsibility system and the high labor land ratio result in very small operational scales tan et al 2006 lian et al 2014 in addition a household s land parcels are further divided into separate smaller farms to take into account the differences in land quality such as soil conditions and irrigation and the distance of farm plots wu et al 2005 hence the fragmentation of the crop fields is aggravated with the random distribution of crops in recent years sunflower and maize are the main crops grown in jiyuan which occupy nearly 90 of the cropland the other crops are mainly vegetables e g watermelon tomato and pepper and wheat the natural lands are mainly sparse grassland with scattered shrubs or abandoned cultivated land caused by high soil salinization the natural lands are important to biodiversity and to keep the natural succession of the agro ecosystem they exhibit a patchy distribution within and surrounding the croplands and the species composition of the vegetation is simple with most of them being salt tolerant vegetation such as tamarix chinensis phragmites australis elymus dahuricus and suaeda salsa as a result the landscape is highly fragmented and composited by a mosaic pattern of small mixed crop fields and natural vegetation patches fig 2a the irrigation network in jiyuan is controlled by two branch canals i e the west branch and the east branch which originate from the same trunk canal and flow from south to north fig 1 numerous lateral canals field canals and terminal canals further distribute water to the entire region two main drainage ditches one in the middle part and the other near the east boundary as well as many field drainage ditches collect and discharge drainage water the west boundary of jiyuan is also a series of shallow drainage ditches but they are not fully connected thus jiyuan is a relatively closed basin with minimal connectivity to adjacent areas generally jiyuan has 4 6 water diversions during the growing season from early may to late september based on the climate and river water conditions table 1 the natural patches are almost never irrigated while crop fields are irrigated several times the total water diversion during the growing season in jiyuan averaged 28 million m3 in the period 2001 2013 hetao irrigation district administration 2001 2013 hetao irrigation district administration 2001 because the drainage ditches are shallow and flat the drainage system also mainly works during the water diversion periods for draining the groundwater and the excessive surface water based on the statistical data the drainage amount averaged 3 6 million m3 during the growing season in which about 1 3 was through groundwater discharge and the rest was through surface runoff i e the excessive irrigation water directly released into the drainage ditches the flat topography and poor drainage systems combined with excess irrigation determines the presence of shallow water tables and the long term accumulation of solutes derived from irrigation water the salt accumulation amounts derived from irrigation water are about 0 48 kg m 2 per year in jiyuan assuming a uniform distribution in irrigated cropland the groundwater depth cyclically varies from 0 to 3 m during the year it has a very small hydraulic gradient of about 0 05 at the regional scale mainly dictated by the topographic gradients however in the landscape scale 30 500 m groundwater hydraulic gradients can reach 0 1 3 among different land covers during the irrigation period due to the diverse irrigation schedules thus the landscape scale groundwater hydraulic gradients caused by irrigation are the dominant driver of the groundwater processes the total dissolved salt tds g l 1 of groundwater 3 m below soil surface in jiyuan is relatively stable and averaged 2 1 g l 1 2 2 monitoring network and data collection field observations were conducted during the growing season from late april to late september in 2012 and 2013 a total of 28 observation points were set at jiyuan for soil groundwater and crop growth the observation points were arranged based on land use crops and canal network fig 1 they are mainly distributed in cropland and natural land and almost covered all kinds of crops produced in the study area soil sampling was performed monthly using a soil auger to determine soil water content and soil salinity concentration leaf area index lai crop height ch cm and the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc and plastic films fr mulch were also observed monthly the development stages of main crops and natural vegetation were recorded crop yields were measured after harvest besides these observation points another 39 observation wells were set up the groundwater depth and groundwater electrical conductivity ec w were observed every 5 15 days in the observation wells groundwater levels in some typical areas were also continuously recorded manually or by water level loggers hobo u20 usa the soil textural properties were surveyed at 38 point locations well distributed and down to 100 cm depth for a comprehensive understanding of soils in jiyuan the particle size distribution saturated water content θs cm3 cm 3 field capacity θfc cm3 cm 3 dry bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d 1 were measured in the different horizons of each observation site except for the sampling frequency the above sampling and measuring methods were the same as the experiment conducted in yangchang canal command area yca ren et al 2016 which is a typical area within jiyuan fig 1 to characterize the spatial distribution of salinity an extra sampling campaign was carried out in late april just before the growing season core sampling and electrical conductivity ec measurements were done systematically in a 500 500 m regular grid covering the whole jiyuan a total of 336 points were identified and soil samples were collected every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and at 20 cm increments below the top layer to 100 cm depth the soil salt content ssc g 100 g 1 was empirically related to the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 the salt distribution map fig 2b was eventually obtained using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map with a resolution of 30 m pixel size was derived from the chinese huanjing 1 hj 1 satellite then the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc fig 2c was calculated from ndvi using the linear relationship of gutman and ignatov 1998 1 f c ndvi ndv i min ndv i max ndv i min ndvimin refers to the minimum observed ndvi for the entire area of study over the entire time period in this case ndvimin was calculated by averaging the five smallest observed values ndvimax refers to the maximum observed ndvi and was calculated as the average of the five largest observed values ndvi is the specific ndvi for a given pixel at a given time the fc map was derived monthly from may to september to cover the initial mid and end growth stages of the various vegetation the information of water conveyance in the two branch canals was collected from the hetao irrigation district administration some lateral and field canals were also measured using a velocity instrument in 2012 and 2013 irrigation depths table 1 applied to different kinds of crops were either measured using a trapezoidal thin wall weir in typical observation fields or surveyed from the local farmers land cover maize sunflower natural vegetation tamarisk melon wheat and others i e sand dunes or water was recorded during the regional survey topographic map soil map satellite images of landsat and high resolution google earth images were also collected for further analysis daily meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were collected from the nearby linhe weather station precipitation was registered by a tipping bucket unit using a rain gauge located in yca as jiyuan is not so large consistent meteorological data were applied to the whole study area 2 3 agroecosystem modeling 2 3 1 distributed hydrus dualkc modeling the hydrus dualkc model is a mechanistic agro hydrological model resulting from coupling the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 and the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dualkc approach allen et al 1998 2011 both models have been widely used and validated in irrigated agriculture jiménez martínez et al 2009 karimov et al 2014 allen 2000 zhao et al 2013 the coupled model uses the dualkc approach to separately determine the potential crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates for the implementation of the upper boundary conditions of hydrus 1d correspondingly a mechanistic approach i e a two stage calculation method which is a more practical method recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 was introduced in hydrus to calculate soil evaporation the governing equation for soil water flow and solute transport are respectively the one dimensional 1 d richards equation and convective dispersive equation the soil hydraulic properties are described using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 functions the effects of water stress and osmotic stress on root water uptake are calculated by the feddes equation feddes et al 1978 and the modified s shape equation dirksen and augustijn 1988 the model has been successfully applied to several crops maize sunflower and watermelon and the natural vegetation tamarisk grown in yca ren et al 2016 a detailed model description for hydrus dualkc can be found in ren et al 2016 in order to implement distributed modeling at a regional scale using the 1 d agro hydrological model hydrus dualkc the study area was divided into sub areas denoted as simulation units each simulation unit was considered homogenous with a specific combination of soil crop weather irrigation amount and groundwater level independent runs of hydrus dualkc were conducted for each of the simulation units subsequently the outputs of independent model runs were aggregated to evaluate the hydrological processes under various land covers and management strategies the hydrological processes of residential land water bodies and sand dunes were not simulated due to their special land cover types what is more as they totally occupied no more than 10 of jiyuan and their water balance budgets were relatively small they may not have significant effects on the quantity of water exchange between croplands and natural lands however in order to close the water salt balance for the whole region evaporation from these areas was also estimated using local empirical formulas and then their lateral groundwater exchanges were also calculated ren et al 2018b 2 3 2 spatial data processing and aggregation the proper delineation of simulation units is fundamental to accurately conduct the distributed simulation and further analysis of the hydrological processes in this study the simulation units were obtained by overlaying thematic map layers of vegetation irrigation soil and groundwater depth spatial information for these variables was collected and aggregated by field experiments satellite images and existing geographical data on jiyuan during the years 2012 and 2013 to generate thematic maps due to the high land fragmentation of jiyuan crop and land use pattern maps from the years 2012 and 2013 were generated by large area field survey as well as manual visual interpretation of high resolution google earth images about 0 5 m resolution a total of 5 vegetation types were classified maize sunflower wheat vegetable and natural land for model simulation as shown in fig 2a in the classification the identified intercropped fields wheat corn or wheat sunflower were few and scattered thus they were randomly assigned to one of the two crops watermelon tomato and pepper which had similar crop calendars and irrigation scheduling were assembled as the vegetable type natural vegetation patches of shrubs grass woods and marshes containing various kinds of vegetation were classified as natural land as a result cropland and natural land were the main model simulation areas the other land use types residential land sand dune and water body unsuitable for model simulation were treated specially with water balance methods as described before the irrigation scheduling is diverse among different vegetation types moreover for a certain crop different fields may also have different irrigation depths during an irrigation period generally the upstream areas have larger irrigation depths as they have more access to the canal water based on the water supply information of the two branch canals and field observations the irrigation depths in jiyuan can be divided into 4 grades thus 4 sub regions located from the upstream to the downstream and separated by control sluices in the branch canals were generated for a certain crop in a certain region the irrigation depths among fields were averaged as a result the spatial distribution of irrigation depth during the growing season was obtained fig 3 a soils in jiyuan were preliminarily divided into two series based on the 1 1 000 000 scale soil map soil genetic classification of china in the middle part along the drainage ditch was yan soil and in the west and east sides was chaoguanyu soil fig 3b field soil surveys also showed that the soil distribution in jiyuan is similar and more than 90 can be classified as silt loam thus the two series soil map was adopted for the generation of simulation units the soil types in each simulation unit can be further refined based on the data from field survey points in or near it the average groundwater levels during crop growing season relative to the height datum with their accompanying geographical coordinates were converted to a point shapefile then to a groundwater surface using the ordinary kriging interpolation method a high resolution dem was generated from the local topographic map at a scale of 1 10 000 with numerous ground survey points a groundwater depth depth from ground surface to water table gwd map was obtained by subtracting groundwater surface from the dem using the raster calculator tool then the gwd was classified into five categories as shown in fig 3c finally the jiyuan was divided into 157 and 159 simulation units in the years 2012 and 2013 respectively by overlaying the above four thematic maps vegetation irrigation soil and groundwater the areas of each simulation unit ranged from 0 002 to 3 8 km2 with larger ones being mainly contiguous natural land thus the simulation units were mainly at the scale of field level one simulation unit may contain a group of isolated fields under similar hydrology conditions due to land fragmentation fig 3d 2 3 3 model set up calibration and validation for each of the simulation units an independent run of hydrus dualkc was conducted to simulate water salt dynamics and vegetation root water uptake during the growing season all five land cover types maize sunflower wheat vegetable and natural land were considered in the simulation because various types of vegetables and natural vegetation were present watermelon was selected to represent vegetable fields and tamarix chinensis tamarisk was selected to represent the natural land cover the simulated soil profile was 300 cm in depth and simplified to two layers a top soil 0 40 cm and a sub soil 40 300 cm the vertical one dimensional soil domain was discretized into 301 nodes with a uniform spacing of 1 cm simulation domain setup was the same for the whole study area the simulation period was from early may to late september covering the whole growth period of all the vegetation except the initial period of wheat crop calendars ren et al 2018b and irrigation calendars table 1 were different between fields due to differences in farmers decisions on the time of sowing and irrigation but not too much thus this study defined an average crop calendar and irrigation calendar for a certain crop for water flow daily precipitation and irrigation fluxes and the potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp rates were specified to implement the upper boundary condition while a variable pressure head deduced from groundwater depth gwd was selected as the bottom boundary condition ep and tp were determined using the dualkc approach as the application of the dualkc approach needs the fraction cover fc of each simulation unit they were calculated from the fc map fig 2c by the average of all the pixel values in it the daily variable gwd in the simulation unit without continuous observations can be obtained by three steps first the average gwd during the growing season was obtained from the gwd map fig 3c then the fluctuation characteristics of the water table level can be indicated by the continuous water level data obtained near the simulation unit finally the daily gwd were interpolated based on the average value and the amplitudes and the periods of continuous groundwater level graph for solute transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined by a concentration flux considering the observed tds of irrigation water 0 52 g l 1 and groundwater 2 1 g l 1 respectively initial soil moisture for the simulated units were specified by hydrostatic equilibrium with initial groundwater level as recorded in the jiyuan observation wells in early may of 2012 and 2013 initial soil salinity concentration in the soil profile was specified according to field observations and the salt distribution map fig 2b the initial soil hydraulic parameters of each simulation unit were represented by the observation point in it or near it they can be estimated by bulk density and percentages of sand silt and clay values using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 initial solute transport parameters were obtained referring to xu et al 2013 the soil evaporation parameters were specified referring to fao 56 for the cropland and ren et al 2017 for the natural land parameters of root growth root distribution and root water uptake for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk were set the same as those of ren et al 2016 and for wheat were set the same as those of xu et al 2013 for the simulation unit with monitoring points the observed soil water content and salinity concentrations in different soil layers i e 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 cm relative to 2013 and 2012 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively for the unit without monitoring points the parameters in an adjacent calibrated unit were adopted in this study the daily remote sensing eta data in 2012 with 250 m resolution was available for the whole jiyuan it was derived from modis data by yang et al 2012 thus it also can be adopted to evaluate the accuracy and reasonableness of distributed modeling the main water budgets calculated by the water balance method as did in ren et al 2018a b were also used for model validation several goodness of fit indicators including the regression coefficient b the determination coefficient r2 the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were used as the criteria to evaluate the model performance more detailed descriptions can be found in ren et al 2016 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation a total of 22 observation points including 7 sunflower points 7 maize points 3 watermelon points 2 wheat points and 3 tamarisk points distributed in 22 simulation units in 2013 were used for model calibration the simulated soil water content and salinity concentrations in different soil layers of the various vegetation fields were compared with the monthly measured values as shown in fig 4 the arrangement between measured and simulated soil water content of all five vegetation types is good the mre values ranged from 1 21 to 1 55 the rmse values were about 0 02 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and the r2 values were in a range of 0 78 0 89 b values were 0 98 1 01 and the nse values were between 0 76 0 89 for salt simulation the goodness of fit indicators were also satisfactory with 4 45 mre 10 34 0 97 rmse 4 89 g l 1 r2 0 82 0 93 b 1 03 and nse 0 81 the discrepancies in the salt simulation were larger than those for the water simulation however the modeling efficiency nse in salt was higher this may be because soil water contents were relatively stable and mainly concentrated at high levels due to the shallow groundwater depth while salinity concentrations had a relatively larger amplitude of fluctuation and significant tendency of variation the detailed time variation of soil water contents and soil salinity concentrations in some typical land cover types maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk has been presented and discussed in ren et al 2016 the model was validated using the same 22 observation points in 2012 they were still distributed in 22 simulation units however the vegetation cover in some fields may not be the same as in 2013 all calibrated soil parameters were directly used as model inputs during validation simulation results showed that the goodness of fit indicators for soil water content 1 32 mre 0 40 0 02 rmse 0 04 cm3 cm 3 0 73 r2 0 85 0 98 b 1 00 and 0 72 nse 0 85 and salinity concentrations 1 15 mre 3 78 0 66 rmse 3 69 g l 1 0 78 r2 0 92 0 96 b 0 99 and 0 78 nse 0 92 were also satisfactory a uniform point sampling of 237 paired eta values from the remote sensing eta map fig 5 a and simulated eta map fig 5b of jiyuan were conducted for model validation in 2012 results showed their consistency was not perfect but still acceptable fig 5c mre and rmse were 2 0 and 43 5 mm r2 and b were 0 47 and 1 01 and the nse was 0 31 due to high land fragmentation the width of crop fields was usually less than 50 m while the remote sensing eta had a resolution of 250 m pixel size it was too large to distinguish land cover types especially in the cropland as shown in fig 5d the simulated eta values 44 m pixel size under each remote sensing eta pixel 250 m may vary greatly thus the 250 m pixel should always be a mixed pixel containing more than one land cover type and the eta in each pixel was an averaged value however the simulated eta map constituted by individual simulation units was based on precise land cover classification thus there may be some discrepancies in the point to point comparison of the two maps which explained why the goodness of fit indicators were not perfect the model efficiency nse was also not as high as the eta values were concentrated in higher levels fig 5 the spatially averaged eta by model simulation and remote sensing in jiyuan were very close respectively with values of 511 and 500 mm the simulated eta of cropland and natural land in 2012 and 2013 were also comparable with that calculated by water balance method during the growing season ren et al 2018b in summary results indicated that the model performance was generally good and it could be considered a valuable tool to analyze the hydrological processes under various land cover types 3 2 spatial characteristics of evapotranspiration model simulations provided a detailed description of the spatial variation of actual evapotranspiration eta fig 6 during the growing season the spatial pattern of seasonal eta of the year 2013 is shown in fig 6a eta was highly heterogeneous among the different land cover types ranging between 162 567 mm table 2 overall eta was higher in the croplands and lower in the natural lands in 2013 for example eta ranged from 315 to 567 mm and spatially averaged 517 mm in cropland while in natural land eta ranged from 162 to 503 mm and averaged 418 mm eta in natural land had greater variability than that in cropland due to the highly different environmental conditions for those natural areas with suitable groundwater depth and large vegetation coverage such as the south jiyuan eta was almost comparable with that of croplands however in the areas with serious salinity problems and very low vegetation coverage like the natural lands in the northern part eta was very small and even less than 200 mm the highest eta that occurred in cropland was the sunflower field whereas the lowest one was the vegetable fields this was mainly caused by different irrigation scheduling and crop calendars contrary to the spatial distribution of eta the actual soil evaporation ea in natural areas is usually larger than that of croplands during the growing season in 2013 ea of cropland ranged from 45 to 259 mm and spatially averaged 169 mm whereas ea of natural land ranged from 62 to 347 mm and averaged 243 mm table 2 the higher ea in natural land was caused by the lower vegetation coverage and shallower groundwater depth ren et al 2017 as shown in fig 2c during the mid stage of the growing season in early august when the maximum fc occurs almost all the natural lands had an fc smaller than 0 5 while most of the croplands were larger than 0 8 moreover the natural lands were mainly distributed in the low lying areas with shallower groundwater depths fig 3c as a result the evaporation ratio ea eta fig 6b in natural land averaged about 0 58 during the growing season indicating a very low water use efficiency the highest and lowest ea in croplands were respectively for vegetable and maize fields their distinctions were mainly caused by the differences in irrigation scheduling and the duration of their growth period ren et al 2018a the ea eta varied from 0 11 to 0 79 in jiyuan and the spatial average value was about 0 4 which was higher than those in the other similar places around the world kool et al 2014 therefore control of non beneficial bare soil evaporation especially in natural land should be an effective way to save water in hetao the spatial pattern of actual vegetation transpiration ta was similar to that of eta with ta in cropland larger than in the natural land in the year 2013 ta in cropland and natural land respectively ranged from 187 mm to 388 mm and from 74 mm to 265 mm table 2 for all crops maize had the highest ta whereas vegetables had the lowest ta it was because maize had a longer growth period and higher potential transpiration tp than vegetables in the dry year of 2013 ta in cropland had an obvious decreasing trend from south to north along with decreasing irrigation depths from the upstream to the downstream areas in the wet year of 2012 there was no such spatial trend the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration ta tp which reflects soil water salt stress to vegetation growth is presented in fig 6d results showed that the vegetation in jiyuan suffered from varying degrees of water salt stress with ta tp ranging from 0 42 to 0 99 the natural land had a relatively lower ta tp indicating natural vegetation suffered from more serious stress especially during the middle and late stages as shown in fig 4 for all observation points distributed in the various land cover types soil moisture in the root zone was maintained in a suitable range for vegetation growth however soil salinity concentrations always exceed the threshold values for vegetation thus the vegetation growth stress in the study area should be primarily caused by soil salinity instead of water deficit the most salt tolerant crop sunflower had the highest ta tp in cropland while maize and vegetables which are relatively sensitive to salt had lower values the lower ta in natural land was not only caused by obviously lower vegetation coverage but also more serious stress as compared with that in cropland generally natural vegetation has characteristics of much higher resistance to drought salinity and waterlogging as compared with crops in the same area this implies that the root zone environment of natural vegetation was under a rather serious condition 3 3 bottom flux of different land cover types due to the shallow gwd and different management strategies the spatiotemporal distribution of bottom water and salt flux varied greatly among different land cover types fig 7 in this study the bottom upward flux and downward flux were calculated and analyzed separately during the growing season results showed that the spatial distribution of downward water flux percolation was similar to the spatial trend of irrigation fig 3a for example in 2013 the sunflower field which had the largest irrigation depths also had the largest percolation ranging from 169 to 389 mm and averaged 237 mm table 3 the non irrigated natural lands had the smallest percolation with values between 40 and 291 mm averaging 87 mm over all the percolation depths declined from the relatively heavy irrigated south areas to the slightly irrigated north areas in contrast the upward flux in natural land was the largest from 219 to 456 mm averaged 365 mm whereas the upward flux in the sunflower field was the smallest from 35 to 236 mm averaged 118 mm the larger upward flux in natural land was attributed to no irrigation occurring in it and shallow groundwater was a major source to supplement the depletion of soil water by evapotranspiration especially during the irrigation period the sharp groundwater level increase due to cropland irrigation caused significant upward water flux in the natural land the upward flux can contribute to more than 80 of eta in natural land whereas in cropland it was less than 30 tables 3 and 4 as shown in fig 7a the cumulative net bottom water flux in 2013 ranged from 354 to 206 mm in the cropland was dominated by downward flux negative whereas in the natural land it ranged from 73 to 408 mm was dominated by upward flux positive the spatial distribution of downward salt flux leaching was similar to that of water percolation in the areas with larger irrigation amounts and deeper groundwater depth the salt leaching was more significant therefore the cumulative downward salt flux in the sunflower field was the largest from 351 to 875 g m 2 averaged 512 g m 2 and that in the cropland from 234 to 875 g m 2 averaged 464 g m 2 was significantly higher than that in the non irrigated natural land from 91 to 999 g m 2 averaged 230 g m 2 table 3 as it should be the upward salt flux accumulation showed an opposite spatial pattern with the downward flux the spatial variation of upward flux in natural areas was larger than that of croplands the largest salt accumulation occurred in the natural areas from 352 to 850 g m 2 averaged 674 g m 2 whereas the smallest salt accumulation was found in sunflower fields from 69 to 429 g m 2 averaged 202 g m 2 the larger salt accumulation in natural land was consistent with its larger upward water flux as solute transport was dominated by water flow the spatial distribution of cumulative net bottom salt flux in the study area fig 7b was consistent with that of water during the growing season the cropland especially the sunflower and maize field had an obvious downward salt flux indicating salt was discharged from the root zone during crop growth season whereas the natural land had a significant net salt accumulation table 3 with shallow groundwater depth and well hydraulic connections the vertical bottom flux upward or downward in local areas is the main driver of the lateral groundwater flow thus the interlaced distribution of upward flux and downward flux triggers dramatically lateral groundwater exchange among the different land cover types as the bottom of the simulation domain 300 cm below the ground surface is kept under the groundwater level and the salinity concentration was relatively stable the lateral exchange amount was exactly the cumulative net bottom flux 4 discussion 4 1 water salt balance and redistribution among different land covers during the growing season water and salt balance of each land cover type are spatially averaged and summarized in table 4 the water and salt budgets of the root zone 0 90 cm and the whole simulation profile 0 300 cm were separately calculated and analyzed results showed that the salt accumulation δs in the root zone 0 90 cm was larger than that in the 0 300 cm soil profile for most of the land cover types for example in the year 2013 the δs in natural land reached about 2300 g m 2 in the root zone while in the 0 300 cm profile it was only about 450 g m 2 this indicated that salt in the vertical soil profile was dramatically redistributed during the growing season with salt accumulated to the upper layers from deeper layers through the upward flux the water salt balance of maize sunflower watermelon and wheat was further spatially averaged to obtain the cropland balance table 5 results showed that the cropland had a net groundwater and solute outflow being 9 mm and 121 g m 2 in 2012 and 64 mm and 173 g m 2 in 2013 respectively the water salt balance in the natural land table 4 showed that it had a net groundwater and solute inflow reaching to 230 mm and 300 g m 2 in 2012 and 278 mm and 444 g m 2 in 2013 respectively when considering the area of the cropland 2012 54 5 km2 2013 51 3 km2 and the natural land 2012 22 6 km2 2013 25 7 km2 the total salt outflow 7700 t from the cropland was a little larger than the salt inflow 6800 t to the natural land this may be because a small part of salt in cropland was transported to the other land use types e g residential land sand dunes and water body which were not simulated in this study in the meantime the water outflow from cropland 1 9 million m3 was obviously smaller than the water inflow to natural land 6 2 million m3 this implied that there were some other water sources recharging the groundwater in natural land in addition the recharge should be from the irrigation canal seepage because the jiyuan is a relatively closed area when all the land use types were considered for the groundwater balance in jiyuan the canal seepage to the groundwater was the only pending item and it can be calculated as shown in table 6 the canal seepage ratio the ratio of groundwater recharge from canal seepage to the total water diversion eventually calculated were respectively 0 22 and 0 17 in 2012 and 2013 which was consistent with former studies xu et al 2010 yu et al 2016 thus the validity of the calculation results was further verified the water discharged through interior drainage groundwater flow into the natural land and discharged by evaporation was about 5 times as large as the groundwater discharged through the drainage ditches accounting for 22 of the total water diverted to jiyuan the salt accumulation in cropland was very little only accounting for 8 16 of the salt introduced by water diversion however the salt accumulation in the natural land was very large accounting for 57 79 of the total salt introduced the residual salts moved to other land use types or were drained out through drainage ditches 4 2 hydrological complexities and challenges a key part of understanding the hydrological effects caused by land fragmentation and shallow groundwater system is the connectivity among different land covers hydrological connections occur below ground through the lateral flow of groundwater and aboveground through overland flow jackson et al 2009 in agro ecosystems with flat topography and fairly low precipitation overland flow is negligible the water and salt in each land cover type first moves in a vertical direction affected by infiltration evaporation and water extraction when they affect the groundwater through percolation recharge or capillaries discharge the local water level will rise or decline and further affect the surrounding areas thus the hydrological connectivity is mainly through lateral groundwater flow due to the fragmented distribution of various land cover types and the associated diverse management strategies in this case the hydrological processes were rather complicated the diverse irrigation schedules as well as the evapotranspiration differences resulted in a complex distribution of groundwater recharge and discharge zones triggering intense lateral groundwater exchange among the various land cover types according to the calculation the recharge zones were mainly sunflower and maize fields the discharge zones were mainly natural areas and vegetable fields to some extent the lateral groundwater exchange reallocated the water with a certain degree of salinity applied to the system thus the non irrigated vegetation in discharge zones could indirectly use the irrigation water during a water diversion which may improve the water use efficiency unfortunately when water is evapotranspirated it leaves behind the salts the water contained if this continues the recharge zones can effectively get rid of excess salt and water while the discharge zones may suffer salinity problems in natural basins recharge and discharge zones are typically viewed as topographically fixed across landscapes jackson et al 2009 however in this human dominated agro ecosystem shifts in vegetation and irrigation can overcome topographic controls and alter recharge and discharge zones in this study due to the annual variation of crop distribution the lateral flow in cropland was not consistent thus the recharge and discharge zones would be changed from one place to another between years this is good for agricultural production as there will not be a place with continuous salt accumulation in the cropland however the one way flow of water and solutes from the cropland to natural land caused continuous salt input to the natural land as a result the vegetation in natural areas suffered serious salinity stress which has been recognized as the main threat against the sustainability of natural ecosystems in addition our results indicated that the highly fragmented land covers are a challenge to the application of the satellite remote sensing techniques fig 7 for considering the spatial and temporal variation of highly heterogeneous land covers the remote sensing images are required to be produced with frequent updating high spatial resolution and enough spectral bands however the spatial and temporal remote sensing data from the existing set of earth observing satellite platforms are not sufficient enough to be used in the estimation of spatially distributed et for on farm irrigation management purposes especially at a field scale level 0 1 to 1 0 ha gowda et al 2008 moreover the results imply that most of traditional regional modeling may oversimplify the effects of fragmented land covers and smallholder agriculture on hydrological processes in similar agricultural regions xu et al 2011 luo and sophocleous 2011 wesseling and feddes 2006 which may cause a varying degree of simulation distortions or even errors in particular it will bring challenge to the practical use of the regional 2d 3d variably saturated flow model due to the high computational load and model stability 5 conclusions in this study the hydrus dualkc model was used in a distributed manner with the assistance of gis remote sensing data and a field observation network in the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan the model application was successful as shown by the goodness of fit indicators relative to the simulation of soil water content soil salinity concentration and evapotranspiration eta the hydrological complexities in agro ecosystems with fragmented land cover types and various management strategies were assessed based on the model simulation and water balance calculation results showed high spatial variability of actual surface evaporation ea and transpiration ta and bottom water and salt flux during the growing season the ea ranged from 45 to 347 mm in jiyuan and was usually higher in natural land than cropland the ta ranged from 74 to 457 mm and was usually higher in cropland the spatially averaged evaporation ratio ea eta in croplands was about 0 32 while in natural land it reached to 0 58 the non beneficial bare soil evaporation during the growing season in jiyuan was large especially in the natural land the ratio of actual to potential transpiration ta tp showed that the natural land suffered more serious salt stress compared with cropland these consequences can be explained by the bottom water and salt exchange among the different land cover types the cropland had a net bottom water and salt outflow while the natural land had a net bottom inflow the natural land operated as water and solute sinks from the local surroundings through focalized evaporative discharge interior drainage water discharged by interior drainage occupied more than 80 of the total groundwater drainage at the same time 50 75 of the salt introduced by water diversion was discharged to the natural land in this way the excess water and salt in cropland can be effectively discharged and some water can even be reused by natural vegetation however the salt accumulation in natural land seriously affected natural vegetation growth moreover the complex hydrological processes as well as the fragmented land cover types bring challenges for common used technologies in regional water resource management typically as satellite remote sensing and hydrological models hyper resolution model simulations based on the comprehensive field observation network high resolution remote sensing data and appropriate simulation model are needed to confront the challenges acknowledgements this research was jointly supported by the national science foundation of china grant numbers 51639009 51679235 and

11228,nitrate leaching is an important pathway for nitrogen loss in soil and is becoming a public issue worldwide the increasing application of both synthetic chemical fertilizers and digested biogas slurry dbgs as sources of nitrogen to farm fields in rural china has created new challenges regarding nitrate leaching this study evaluated the effects of conventional fertilizers replaced by different nitrogen concentrations of dairy sourced dbgs on nitrate leaching a three year field experiment from october 2013 to october 2016 on wheat maize crop rotation was conducted using five levels of nitrogen application a control no nitrogen added three concentrations of dbgs and conventional chemical fertilizers dbgs was applied through mixed with different percentage of fresh water to irrigate grain yield soil nitrate accumulation nitrate leaching loss and the overall nitrogen budgetwere monitored yields of wheat and maize were generally increased with the increase in dbgs concentration amount up to the medium level after that no significant increase in yield was found with further increase in dbgs application annual nitrate leaching reached 46 53 kg ha 1 from chemical fertilizer but declined by 20 32 using the medium dbgs concentration nitrate leaching mainly occurred after irrigation and heavy rainfall the nitrate concentration in leachate and the nitrate leaching flux both increased with the increase in dbgs concentration generally peaking 7 10 days after application the results showed that the overuse of nitrogen resulting in the high net mineralization and nitrification and together with irrigation management seasonal rainfall and soil texture influenced the nitrate leaching losses in this double cropping system using medium concentration of dbgs to replace chemical fertilizers is an reasonable approach to ensure high crop yields high nitrogen use efficiency and reduced nitrate leaching losses keywords digested biogas slurry dbgs grain yield nitrate leaching soil nitrate nitrogen residual nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction in recent years with people s living standards imporving chinese livestock industries especially intensive farming are developed rapidly wu et al 2014 these industries generate large quantities of manure which can be used to produce biogas and approximately 26 600 biogas plants of livestock and poultry had been built in china by the end of 2007 duan et al 2015 annually more than one billion tons of digested biogas slurry dbgs the main byproduct during biogas production was produced in 3800 large scale biogas plants from 2010 jin and chang 2011 although dbgs can be used as agricultural fertilizer it would pollute water bodies through discharging via surface runoff or groundwater infiltration then threaten our environment and ecosytems robert et al 2000 this is especially worse in the north china plain where serious overexploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation has led to particularly enormous water shortages hu et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2014 moreover the quality of available water is deteriorating creating a need to find alternatives to satisfy the growing demand for water the application of dbgs could help to satisfy plant nutrient demands while providing a proportion of necessary water thus it is feasible to apply dbgs in agricultural crop production while minimizing environmental degradation intensive animal farming biogas production and irrigation may be practiced simultaneously dbgs is a high quality liquid organic fertilizer produced by anaerobic fermentation martínez suller et al 2010 möller and müller 2012 zhang 2008 it is relatively stable in water content and contains valuable nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium saunders et al 2012 valencia gica et al 2012 thus dbgs can be a sustainable replacement for chemical fertilizers land application is the oldest and the most common method for dbgs management and control of environmental pollution daudén et al 2004 tzanakakis et al 2007 the use of dbgs on crops as both fertilizer and water significantly improves soil moisture and nutritions and then reduce the cost of irrigation and fertilizers for farmers minogue et al 2011 müller et al 2011 chen et al 2012 bachmann et al 2014 pu et al 2014 studies have shown that repeated applications of dbgs enhance crop yields garg et al 2005 valencia gica et al 2012 in addition dbgs can influence microbial decomposition of organic matter and enzyme activity abubaker et al 2013 farnet et al 2008 wheat maize double cropping is an important rotation system in the north china plain accounting for 48 and 39 of the total wheat and maize production in china respectively huang et al 2017 in this rotation system farmers usually irrigate with large amounts of water and apply large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer to obtain relatively high yields the resulting over fertilization has disturbed regional biogeochemical nitrogen cycling and led to nitrate leaching huang et al 2011 have shown that following nitrogen application rates of 0 360 kg n ha 1 the total amount of nitrate leaching in the north china plain over three years 2004 2007 ranged from 15 to 178 kg ha 1 wang et al 2010 used the br tracer method and hydrus 1d model to show that rainfall and irrigation play key roles in nitrate leaching because dbgs contains a large amount of water along with high concentrations of nitrogen möller and müller 2012 nkoa 2014 inappropriate application rates can increase the risk of nitrate leaching however few studies have analyzed the characteristics of nitrate leaching resulting from dbgs application in the north china plain therefore it is necessary to precisely determine the nitrogen contribution of dbgs to the crop yield and soil in order to ensure that the impacts of contamination are minimal the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the impacts of dbgs application on both crops and soil in the north china plain 2 to ascertain how and to what extent dbgs application affects nitrate leaching and crop yields and to clarify the characteristics of nitrate leaching in wheat maize rotation cropping system and 4 to develop dbgs practices that can maintain crop production and simultaneously reduce nitrate leaching losses 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description field experiment was conducted at the agriculture experimental station 38 56 n 115 32 e in xushui hebei province china from october 2012 to september 2016 while nitrate leaching was sampled from october 2013 to september 2016 experimental site is located in the north china plain with a typical sub humid temperate continental monsoon climate with warm wet summers and cold winters the mean annual temperature and total precipitation are 12 3 c and 575 mm respectively approximately 80 of the total precipitation occurs from july to september fig 1 and the groundwater

the beginning of october and harvested in the middle of june and maize is planted immediately after wheat harvest and harvested at the end of september the typical soil type is sandy loam in september 2012 before the establishment of the experiment soil physical and chemical properties down to 200 cm depth were measured and shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design a local common wheat cultivar

applied during the maize season precipitation during the wheat growing season totaled71 164 and 116 mm in 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively as compared to precipitation during the maize growing season totaling 266 199 and 391 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively there were two heavy precipitation events of 190 and 77 mm in july 2016 overall the amount of precipitation during the wheat season was less than that during the maize season the water sum of precipitation and irrigation in the wheat season was higher than that in the maize season for the first two rotations but less

nitrogen nn soil nn accumulation nnr and soil available p as dependent variable and took treatment crop wheat and maize year 2014 2015 and 2016 and soil depth as independent variables before analyses we log transformed all the dependent variables since they have only positive values when the recorded value was 0 a very small value 0 0001 was added before transformation all these analyses were performed with the r package stats r core team 2018 we also carried out multiple comparisons using the r package multcomp hothorn et al 2008 all data were collected and analyzed using microsoft excel 2010 figures were plotted in origin 8 6 professional version the significance of difference were tested by analysis of variance anova using sas 8 0 in which multiple comparisons of means were proformed using the least significant difference at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 grain yields of wheat and maize over the three year study period the grain yields of wheat and maize were significantly affected by the concentrations of dbgs table 4 compared with the ck treatment wheat and maize grain yields in dbgs treatments increased by 87 144 and 50 116 respectively compared with the cf treatment the average grain yields in bsl treatment were significantly reduced by 23 for wheat and 30 for maize however there was no significant difference in grain yields among bsm bsh and cf treatments throughout the study except the wheat yield in 2014 3 2 nitrate nitrogen residual in soil at harvest the nitrate nitrogen residual six season in the 0 200 cm soil profile were measured after crop harvest it increased significantly with nitrogen input rates increasing fig 2 in all the dbgs treatments with the average nitrate nitrogen residual after three wheat growing seasons ranged from 46 to 256 kg ha 1 and those after three maize growing seasons ranged from 28 to 182 kg ha 1 compared to ck treatment the nitrate nitrogen residual in all the dbgs treatments increased significantlyafter either maize or wheat growing furthermore the nitrate nitrogen residual after wheat harvestin bsh treatment was lower in 2014 compared to that in cf treatment while it was similar in 2015 and 2016 the nitrate nitrogen residual after maize harvest in bsh treatment was higher than that in cf in 2015 while was similar in 2014 and 2016 the annual nitrogen input rate during both wheat and maize growing seasons in bsm treatment was 25 lower than that in cf while the mean nitrate accumulated in crops per rotation cycle in bsm treatment was lower by 49 than in cf 3 3 apparent nitrogen budget the apparent total budget of nitrogen inputs and outputs in the soil plant system was calculated and shown in table 5 in cf and bsh treatments the amount of applied nitrogen greatly exceeded the crop uptake and resulted in a larger amount of nitrate accumulation in the soil in addition in bsm treatment the nitrogen from dbgs fully replaced the nitrogen input of chemical fertilizer but caused no significant reduction in crop nitrogen uptake over the study period as noted in3 2 the amounts of nitrate accumulation in the soil for both bsh and cf treatments were significantly higher than that for the bsm treatment more importantly the cumulative nitorgen use efficiency was significantly higher in bsm treatment than in bsh and cf treatments p 0 05 during the monitoring period the cumulative nitrate leaching losses in bsm treatment were significantly lower than those in bsh and cf treatments but significantly higher than that in bsl and ck treatments similarly nitrate leaching factor in bsm treatment was significantly lower than that in bsh treatment but significantly higher than that in bsl treatment 3 4 nitrate concentration and leaching losses the nitrate concentration and flux in the leachate varied widely in the experiment fig 3 peaking at seven days after the dbgs applications before decreasing gradually fig 3a while that in ck treatment remained at a relatively low level as the concentrations in all the dbgs treatments were significantly higher than those in ck indicating that higher nitrogen from dbgs inputs can increase the nitrate concentrations in the leachate in comparison with cf treatment the nitrate concentrations in bsl and bsm treatments were significantly lower while that in bsh treatment was significantly higher there was obviously variation in nitrate leaching flux during the entire monitoring period fig 3b with peaks appearing at 7 10 days after dbgs applications at the wintering and jointing stages of wheat another peak of nitrate leaching flux appeared at seven days after the dbgs application at the sowing time of maize the nitrate leaching flux in bsm bsh and cf treatments were significantly higher than that in ck while that in bsl and ck was similar besides nitrate leaching flux in bsh and cf treatments was similar but higher than that in bsl and bsm fig 4 3 5 seasonal nitrate leaching losses during each rotational period irrigation with dbgs was conducted three times at the wheat overwintering and jointing stages and maize sowing time and twice through fresh groundwater at the wheat heading and filling stages there was noticeable variation in seasonal nitrate leaching losses in the three rotations from 2014 to 2016 fig 5 during the wheat growing season nitrate leaching losses increased significantly p 0 05 as the nitrogen application rate increased the losses in all dbgs treatments were significantly higher than those in ck p 0 05 and those in bsh treatment were significantly higher than those in cf especially during the 2016 growing season similarly during the maize growing seasons nitrate leaching losses in the bsh treatment were higher than those in cf treatment especially during the 2016 growing season in both cases nitrate leaching losses in cf treatment were significantly higher than those in bsm treatment which in turn were significantly higher than those in the bsl and ck treatments the six season cumulative nitrate leaching losses for ck bsl bsm bsh and cf treatments were 50 75 113 181 and 149 kg n ha 1 respectively that is the cumulative nitrate leaching losses for each wheat maize rotation cycle averaged 17 25 38 60 and 50 kg n ha 1 respectively in 2014 and 2015 the nitrate leaching losses during wheat growing season was higher than that of maize growing season for all treatments which could be explained by higher nitrogen inputs and irrigation during wheat growing season while in 2016 the nitrate leaching loss during wheat growing season was lower than that during maize growing season most likely because of especially heavy rainfall during the 2016 maize season these patterns can also be understood by using nitrate leaching factor in each growing season in the wheat growing season the average nitrate leaching factor were 3 5 7 and 6 for the bsl bsm bsh and cf treatments respectively note that the bsh ratio was especially high while the bsm and cf ratios were similar and the bsl ratio was the lowest in the maize growing season the average nitrate leaching factor were 3 6 9 and 9 for the bsl bsm bsh and cf treatments respectively note that the bsh and cf ratios were similarly higher while the bsm and bsl ratios were progressively lower season s nitrate leaching losses showed a significant correlation with its total water input but was not significantly correlated to individual precipitation or irrigation events table 6 3 6 the relationships between soil water content and soil nitrate nitrogen nn soil nn residual nnr or soil available p treatments crop wheat or maize year and soil depth all had significant effects on soil water content p 0 001 fig 6 soil water content in treatment bsl was significantly lower than in the other treatments p 0 001 among the three years for experiment soil water content in 2015 was the highest p 0 01 soil water content in maize growing land was significantly higher than that in wheat growing field p 0 001 as for soil nn concentration and soil nnr the two indexes showed similar trends in this study they were both significantly influenced by treatments crop wheat or maize year and soil depth p 0 001 figs 7 and 8 cf and bsh treatments had the highest soil nn concentrations and soil nnr among all the treatments followed by bsm bsl and ck but there was no significant differences between cf and bsh treatments both soil nn concentrations and soil nnr in 2015 and 2016 were higher than those in 2014 p 0 01 soil nn concentrations were higher in maize growing fields than in wheat fields p 0 01 while soil nnr were lower in maize growing field than in wheat field p 0 01 in addition soil nn concentration and soil nnr reached their bottom at about 120 and 125 cm soil depth respectively for soil available p except trail year p 0 36 other three factors including treatment crop wheat or maize and soil depth all influenced it significantly p 0 05 fig 9 soil available p content showed nearly the same trend among treatments as soil nn concentration and soil nnr it got the highest value in cf then followed by bsh bsm bsl and ck and soil available p contents in bsl and ck were similar soil available p content had not significantly different among the three years p 0 3 soil available p content in maize field was significantly higher than that in wheat field p 0 05 which was the same as soil water content and soil nn concentration also it reached the bottom at about 120 cm deep 4 discussion 4 1 effects of nitrogen application rate on nitrate leaching loss nitrate is leached from soil and this process is affected by nitrogen application rate nitrate accumulation within soil associated with excessive nitrogen application is a prerequisite for nitrate leaching ju and christie 2011 li et al 2007 many studies have suggested that nitrate leaching in drainage water increases with higher rates of nitrogen application mack et al 2005 gheysari et al 2009 jia et al 2014 in northern italy where the annual rainfall was 822 mm nitrate leaching from a 150 cm soil profile ranged from 14 to 321 kg n ha 1 yr 1 at nitrogen application rates of 209 801 kg n ha 1 yr 1 perego et al 2012 when the nitrogen application rate was increased from 200 to 800 kg n ha 1 nitrate leaching increased from 6 to 149 kg no3 n ha 1 in the north china plain li et al 2007 in northwest china a five year drainage lysimeter experiment showed that nitrate leaching from a 90 cm soil profile was 3 10 and 16 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for three different soil treatments yang et al 2015 for comparison in our study the nitrate leaching losses in kg n ha 1 for the full wheat maize rotation cycle averaged 17 ck 25 bsl 38 bsm 61 bsh and 50 cf the nitrogen application rate for our bsl treatment was similar to the treatment with 200 kg n ha 1 yr 1 of urea used by li et al 2007 but the nitrate leaching amount from our bsl treatment was higher than that reported by li et al 2007 in this region namely 6 kg n ha 1 yr 1 the higher losses in our study could be explained by the improved movement of nitrate in a sandy layer that exists at a depth of 100 200 cm in this area overall nitrate leaching loss increased with higher nitrogen application rates higher than necessary nitrogen fertilizer application rates therefore increase nitrate leaching loss and reduce nitrogen use efficiency without increasing crop yield 4 2 effects of precipitation and irrigation on nitrate leaching nitrate leaching in soil is a water driven process and excessive input of water causes movement downward of nitrate trolove et al 2019 padilla et al 2018 therefore heavy rainfall and excessive irrigation are the immediate causes for nitrate leaching in croplands gholamhoseini et al 2013 sharma et al 2012 previous studies have noted that nitrate leaching losses increase dramatically with higher irrigation rates cameira et al 2003 gheysari et al 2009 wang et al 2010 and there can be significant differences in nitrate leaching losses between years with varying precipitation in semi arid districts li and li 2000 in our study wheat was irrigated more than maize but received less precipitation the total precipitation and irrigation for wheat was greater than that for maize in the first two rotations but lower in the third correspondingly the nitrate leaching loss for wheat was higher than for maize in the first two rotations but lower in the third each season s nitrate leaching losses showed a significant correlation with its total water input but was not significantly correlated to individual precipitation or irrigation events table 6 the unusual results from 2015 to 2016 in which nitrate leaching losses for wheat were less than those for maize were most likely caused by excessive precipitation during the 2016 maize growing season 4 3 soil nitrate nitrogen residual and nitrate leaching losses nitrogen is an important nutrient for crop development and growth however large amounts of accumulated nitrate in soil caused by excessive nitrogen application will not be totally absorbed by the next season s crop especially when it exceeds crop requirements this increases the risks of nitrate leaching ju and christie 2011 lu et al 2019 have noted that fertilization and water management represented the major optionals to reduce nitrate nitrogen accumulation in soil previous research has shown that one key to controlling nitrate leaching is to control nitrate nitrogen residual in the soil profile as this increases with the amount of applied nitrogen deng et al 2014 huang et al 2013 sieling et al 2014 we observed a similar pattern as seasonal measurements of nitrate nitrogen residual in the 0 200 cm soil profile after crop harvests showed that higher concentrations of dbgs resulted in higher nitrate nitrogen residual in the soil for example the average soil nitrate nitrogen residual for wheat increased from 74 to 196 kg n ha 1 when the nitrogen application rate increased from 128 to 318 kg n ha 1 whereas the average soil nitrate nitrogen residual for maize increased from 45 to 165 kg n ha 1 when the nitrogen application rate increased from 64 to 159 kg n ha 1 in comparison huang et al 2017 reported that a nitrogen application rate of 300 kg n ha 1 resulted in a nitrate nitrogen residual of 735 kg n ha 1 in the 0 100 cm layer of a calcareous fluvo aquic soil a higher residual than that found in our study one reason for this difference may be that the soil texture of our experimental site is sandy loam whereas that of huang et al s experimental site was silty clay loam such that irrigation water could move more freely through the sandy loam and leach more nitrates to layers below a depth of 200 cm similarly over application of dairy effluent has also been shown to increase nitrate concentrations in the 0 100 cm soil profile leading to a higher risk of nitrate leaching du et al 2015 nitrate nitrogen residual in deep soil layers and its subsequent downward movement could increase the risk level for groundwater quality dai et al 2016 since the nitrate nitrogen residual for each season and treatment in the present study showed a significant linear relationship with the nitrate leaching losses for each season r 0 925 p 0 01 fig 10 it is clear that controlling the concentration and amount of dbgs application to crop is necessary to prevent excessive nitrate leaching and protect water quality 4 4 effects of biogas slurry and fertilizer on nitrate leaching losses nitrate leaching was positively affected by nitrogen amount supplied via fertilizer and biogas slurry applications in bsm treatment of this study a small losses in nitrate leaching occurred which is lower that in cf treatment the six season cumulative nitrate leaching losses for bsm and cf treatments were 113 and 149 kg n ha 1 respectively in the wheat growing season the average ratios of nitrate leaching loss were 5 and 6 for the bsm and cf treatments respectively in the maize season the average ratios were 8 and 10 in bsm and cf treatments the main difference between fertilizer and biogas slurry treatments is the supply of orgnic material contained müller et al 2011 in our study the main form of nitrogen in digested biogas slurry was ammonium nitrogen comprising 64 of total nitrogen and complex organic nitrogen compounds accounted for 36 which would be mineralized to ammonium nitrogen slowly in the soil thus the ratio of nitrate leaching loss in bsm treatment was less than that in cf treatment however highly concentrated biogas slurry may lead to higher nutrient leaching when the nutrient provided is beyond the crop requirements guo et al 2014 matsunaka et al 2006 also reported that nitrogen leaching loss from heavy application anaerobically digested cattle slurry rate was significantly higher than that from standard application rate as we have observed from this study that a medium concentration of dbgs with a mix of 33 slurry and 67 groundwater contributs to relatively high nitrogen use efficiency and reduced nitrate leaching losses at overwintering and jointing stages for wheat and sowing time for maize the nitrate leaching in bsh treatment with higher dbgs application was higher than in cf treatment this highlights the inefficiency of nitrogen use at high biogas slurry application rates schroder et al 2007 analyzing the effect of long term application of conventional versus digested cattle slurry in grassland concluded that organic fertilizer with a higher nitrogen content such as digested cattle slurry would have a lower residual mitrogen effect in the first year of application particular attention therefore must be paid to the long term effects taking climate soil and crop into account in order to reliably estimate organic nitrogen fertilizer value and to propose proper recommendations berntsen et al 2007 5 conclusions excessive nitrogen input from the application of dbgs in combination with flood irrigation and intensive rainfall facilitated nitrate leaching in the intensive wheat maize rotation system in the north china plain seasonal nitrate leaching losses were variable but correlated with water amounts of irrigation and rainfall soil nitrogen accumulation and crop nitrogen removal the rates of nitrogen application used in conventional farm practices cf and in the highest concentration of dbgs application in this study bsh exceeded the crops nitrogen needs while contributing to nitrate accumulation in the soil profile as this excess nitrogen cannot be stored in the topsoil it is prone to loss through nitrate leaching which in this study averaged 60 kg ha 1 and 50 kg ha 1 for the bsh and cf treatments respectively in conclusion the medium concentration of dbgs as a field application following the methods described in this study was recommended that is 210 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 105 kg n ha 1 for maize a level that contributes to relatively high nitrogen use efficiency and good crop yield while reducing nitrate leaching losses funding this work was financially supported by the special scientific research fund of

11228,nitrate leaching is an important pathway for nitrogen loss in soil and is becoming a public issue worldwide the increasing application of both synthetic chemical fertilizers and digested biogas slurry dbgs as sources of nitrogen to farm fields in rural china has created new challenges regarding nitrate leaching this study evaluated the effects of conventional fertilizers replaced by different nitrogen concentrations of dairy sourced dbgs on nitrate leaching a three year field experiment from october 2013 to october 2016 on wheat maize crop rotation was conducted using five levels of nitrogen application a control no nitrogen added three concentrations of dbgs and conventional chemical fertilizers dbgs was applied through mixed with different percentage of fresh water to irrigate grain yield soil nitrate accumulation nitrate leaching loss and the overall nitrogen budgetwere monitored yields of wheat and maize were generally increased with the increase in dbgs concentration amount up to the medium level after that no significant increase in yield was found with further increase in dbgs application annual nitrate leaching reached 46 53 kg ha 1 from chemical fertilizer but declined by 20 32 using the medium dbgs concentration nitrate leaching mainly occurred after irrigation and heavy rainfall the nitrate concentration in leachate and the nitrate leaching flux both increased with the increase in dbgs concentration generally peaking 7 10 days after application the results showed that the overuse of nitrogen resulting in the high net mineralization and nitrification and together with irrigation management seasonal rainfall and soil texture influenced the nitrate leaching losses in this double cropping system using medium concentration of dbgs to replace chemical fertilizers is an reasonable approach to ensure high crop yields high nitrogen use efficiency and reduced nitrate leaching losses keywords digested biogas slurry dbgs grain yield nitrate leaching soil nitrate nitrogen residual nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction in recent years with people s living standards imporving chinese livestock industries especially intensive farming are developed rapidly wu et al 2014 these industries generate large quantities of manure which can be used to produce biogas and approximately 26 600 biogas plants of livestock and poultry had been built in china by the end of 2007 duan et al 2015 annually more than one billion tons of digested biogas slurry dbgs the main byproduct during biogas production was produced in 3800 large scale biogas plants from 2010 jin and chang 2011 although dbgs can be used as agricultural fertilizer it would pollute water bodies through discharging via surface runoff or groundwater infiltration then threaten our environment and ecosytems robert et al 2000 this is especially worse in the north china plain where serious overexploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation has led to particularly enormous water shortages hu et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2014 moreover the quality of available water is deteriorating creating a need to find alternatives to satisfy the growing demand for water the application of dbgs could help to satisfy plant nutrient demands while providing a proportion of necessary water thus it is feasible to apply dbgs in agricultural crop production while minimizing environmental degradation intensive animal farming biogas production and irrigation may be practiced simultaneously dbgs is a high quality liquid organic fertilizer produced by anaerobic fermentation martínez suller et al 2010 möller and müller 2012 zhang 2008 it is relatively stable in water content and contains valuable nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium saunders et al 2012 valencia gica et al 2012 thus dbgs can be a sustainable replacement for chemical fertilizers land application is the oldest and the most common method for dbgs management and control of environmental pollution daudén et al 2004 tzanakakis et al 2007 the use of dbgs on crops as both fertilizer and water significantly improves soil moisture and nutritions and then reduce the cost of irrigation and fertilizers for farmers minogue et al 2011 müller et al 2011 chen et al 2012 bachmann et al 2014 pu et al 2014 studies have shown that repeated applications of dbgs enhance crop yields garg et al 2005 valencia gica et al 2012 in addition dbgs can influence microbial decomposition of organic matter and enzyme activity abubaker et al 2013 farnet et al 2008 wheat maize double cropping is an important rotation system in the north china plain accounting for 48 and 39 of the total wheat and maize production in china respectively huang et al 2017 in this rotation system farmers usually irrigate with large amounts of water and apply large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer to obtain relatively high yields the resulting over fertilization has disturbed regional biogeochemical nitrogen cycling and led to nitrate leaching huang et al 2011 have shown that following nitrogen application rates of 0 360 kg n ha 1 the total amount of nitrate leaching in the north china plain over three years 2004 2007 ranged from 15 to 178 kg ha 1 wang et al 2010 used the br tracer method and hydrus 1d model to show that rainfall and irrigation play key roles in nitrate leaching because dbgs contains a large amount of water along with high concentrations of nitrogen möller and müller 2012 nkoa 2014 inappropriate application rates can increase the risk of nitrate leaching however few studies have analyzed the characteristics of nitrate leaching resulting from dbgs application in the north china plain therefore it is necessary to precisely determine the nitrogen contribution of dbgs to the crop yield and soil in order to ensure that the impacts of contamination are minimal the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the impacts of dbgs application on both crops and soil in the north china plain 2 to ascertain how and to what extent dbgs application affects nitrate leaching and crop yields and to clarify the characteristics of nitrate leaching in wheat maize rotation cropping system and 4 to develop dbgs practices that can maintain crop production and simultaneously reduce nitrate leaching losses 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description field experiment was conducted at the agriculture experimental station 38 56 n 115 32 e in xushui hebei province china from october 2012 to september 2016 while nitrate

applied during the maize season precipitation during the wheat growing season totaled71 164 and 116 mm in 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively as compared to precipitation during the maize growing season totaling 266 199 and 391 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively there were two heavy precipitation events of 190 and 77 mm in july 2016 overall the amount of precipitation during the wheat season was less than that during the maize season the water sum of precipitation and irrigation in the wheat season was higher than that in the maize season for the first two rotations but less for the later rotations 2 5 data calculations and analysis the cumulative nitrate leaching losses from 2013 to 2016 cnlt kg ha 1 was obtained from the following equation 1 c n l t t 2013 2016 n i

intervals bd g cm 3 is soil bulk density and sd 20 cm is soil depths cm we analyzed the experimental data using linear regression modelling we took each of the seven variables water soil nitrate nitrogen nn soil nn accumulation nnr and soil available p as dependent variable and took treatment crop wheat and maize year 2014 2015 and 2016 and soil depth as independent variables before analyses we log transformed all the dependent variables since they have only positive values when the recorded value was 0 a very small value 0 0001 was added before transformation all these analyses were performed with the r package stats r core team 2018 we also carried out multiple comparisons using the r package multcomp hothorn et al 2008 all data were collected and analyzed using microsoft excel 2010 figures were plotted in origin 8 6 professional version the significance of difference were tested by analysis of variance anova using sas 8 0 in which multiple comparisons of means were proformed using the least significant difference at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 grain yields of wheat and maize over the three year study period the grain yields of wheat and maize were significantly affected by the concentrations of dbgs table 4 compared with the ck treatment wheat and maize grain yields in dbgs treatments increased by 87 144 and 50 116 respectively compared with the cf treatment the average grain yields in bsl treatment were significantly reduced by 23 for wheat and 30 for maize however there was no significant difference in grain yields among bsm bsh and cf treatments throughout the study except the wheat yield in 2014 3 2 nitrate nitrogen residual in soil at harvest the nitrate nitrogen residual six season in the 0 200 cm soil profile were measured after crop harvest it increased significantly with nitrogen input rates increasing fig 2 in all the dbgs treatments with the average nitrate nitrogen residual after three wheat growing seasons ranged from 46 to 256 kg ha 1 and those after three maize growing seasons ranged from 28 to 182 kg ha 1 compared to ck treatment the nitrate nitrogen residual in all the dbgs treatments increased significantlyafter either maize or wheat growing furthermore the nitrate nitrogen residual after wheat harvestin bsh treatment was lower in 2014 compared to that in cf treatment while it was similar in 2015 and 2016 the nitrate nitrogen residual after maize harvest in bsh treatment was higher than that in cf in 2015 while was similar in 2014 and 2016 the annual nitrogen input rate during both wheat and maize growing seasons in bsm treatment was 25 lower than that in cf while the mean nitrate accumulated in crops per rotation cycle in bsm treatment was lower by 49 than in cf 3 3 apparent nitrogen budget the apparent total budget of nitrogen inputs and outputs in the soil plant system was calculated and shown in table 5 in cf and bsh treatments the amount of applied nitrogen greatly exceeded the crop uptake and resulted in a larger amount of nitrate accumulation in the soil in addition in bsm treatment the nitrogen from dbgs fully replaced the nitrogen input of chemical fertilizer but caused no significant reduction in crop nitrogen uptake over the study period as noted in3 2 the amounts of nitrate accumulation in the soil for both bsh and cf treatments were significantly higher than that for the bsm treatment more importantly the cumulative nitorgen use efficiency was significantly higher in bsm treatment than in bsh and cf treatments p 0 05 during the monitoring period the cumulative nitrate leaching losses in bsm treatment were significantly lower than those in bsh and cf treatments but significantly higher than that in bsl and ck treatments similarly nitrate leaching factor in bsm treatment was significantly lower than that in bsh treatment but significantly higher than that in bsl treatment 3 4 nitrate concentration and leaching losses the nitrate concentration and flux in the leachate varied widely in the experiment fig 3 peaking at seven days after the dbgs applications before decreasing gradually fig 3a while that in ck treatment remained at a relatively low level as the concentrations in all the dbgs treatments were significantly higher than those in ck indicating that higher nitrogen from dbgs inputs can increase the nitrate concentrations in the leachate in comparison with cf treatment the nitrate concentrations in bsl and bsm treatments were significantly lower while that in bsh treatment was significantly higher there was obviously variation in nitrate leaching flux during the entire monitoring period fig 3b with peaks appearing at 7 10 days after dbgs applications at the wintering and jointing stages of wheat another peak of nitrate leaching flux appeared at seven days after the dbgs application at the sowing time of maize the nitrate leaching flux in bsm bsh and cf treatments were significantly higher than that in ck while that in bsl and ck was similar besides nitrate leaching flux in bsh and cf treatments was similar but higher than that in bsl and bsm fig 4 3 5 seasonal nitrate leaching losses during each rotational period irrigation with dbgs was conducted three times at the wheat overwintering and jointing stages and maize sowing time and twice through fresh groundwater at the wheat heading and filling stages there was noticeable variation in seasonal nitrate leaching losses in the three rotations from 2014 to 2016 fig 5 during the wheat growing season nitrate leaching losses increased significantly p 0 05 as the nitrogen application rate increased the losses in all dbgs treatments were significantly higher than those in ck p 0 05 and those in bsh treatment were significantly higher than those in cf especially during the 2016 growing season similarly during the maize growing seasons nitrate leaching losses in the bsh treatment were higher than those in cf treatment especially during the 2016 growing season in both cases nitrate leaching losses in cf treatment were significantly higher than those in bsm treatment which in turn were significantly higher than those in the bsl and ck treatments the six season cumulative nitrate leaching losses for ck bsl bsm bsh and cf treatments were 50 75 113 181 and 149 kg n ha 1 respectively that is the cumulative nitrate leaching losses for each wheat maize rotation cycle averaged 17 25 38 60 and 50 kg n ha 1 respectively in 2014 and 2015 the nitrate leaching losses during wheat growing season was higher than that of maize growing season for all treatments which could be explained by higher nitrogen inputs and irrigation during wheat growing season while in 2016 the nitrate leaching loss during wheat growing season was lower than that during maize growing season most likely because of especially heavy rainfall during the 2016 maize season these patterns can also be understood by using nitrate leaching factor in each growing season in the wheat growing season the average nitrate leaching factor were 3 5 7 and 6 for the bsl bsm bsh and cf treatments respectively note that the bsh ratio was especially high while the bsm and cf ratios were similar and the bsl ratio was the lowest in the maize growing season the average nitrate leaching factor were 3 6 9 and 9 for the bsl bsm bsh and cf treatments respectively note that the bsh and cf ratios were similarly higher while the bsm and bsl ratios were progressively lower season s nitrate leaching losses showed a significant correlation with its total water input but was not significantly correlated to individual precipitation or irrigation events table 6 3 6 the relationships between soil water content and soil nitrate nitrogen nn soil nn residual nnr or soil available p treatments crop wheat or maize year and soil depth all had significant effects on soil water content p 0 001 fig 6 soil water content in treatment bsl was significantly lower than in the other treatments p 0 001 among the three years for experiment soil water content in 2015 was the highest p 0 01 soil water content in maize growing land was significantly higher than that in wheat growing field p 0 001 as for soil nn concentration and soil nnr the two indexes showed similar trends in this study they were both significantly influenced by treatments crop wheat or maize year and soil depth p 0 001 figs 7 and 8 cf and bsh treatments had the highest soil nn concentrations and soil nnr among all the treatments followed by bsm bsl and ck but there was no significant differences between cf and bsh treatments both soil nn concentrations and soil nnr in 2015 and 2016 were higher than those in 2014 p 0 01 soil nn concentrations were higher in maize growing fields than in wheat fields p 0 01 while soil nnr were lower in maize growing field than in wheat field p 0 01 in addition soil nn concentration and soil nnr reached their bottom at about 120 and 125 cm soil depth respectively for soil available p except trail year p 0 36 other three factors including treatment crop wheat or maize and soil depth all influenced it significantly p 0 05 fig 9 soil available p content showed nearly the same trend among treatments as soil nn concentration and soil nnr it got the highest value in cf then followed by bsh bsm bsl and ck and soil available p contents in bsl and ck were similar soil available p content had not significantly different among the three years p 0 3 soil available p content in maize field was significantly higher than that in wheat field p 0 05 which was the same as soil water content and soil nn concentration also it reached the bottom at about 120 cm deep 4 discussion 4 1 effects of nitrogen application rate on nitrate leaching loss nitrate is leached from soil and this process is affected by nitrogen application rate nitrate accumulation within soil associated with excessive nitrogen application is a prerequisite for nitrate leaching ju and christie 2011 li et al 2007 many studies have suggested that nitrate leaching in drainage water increases with higher rates of nitrogen application mack et al 2005 gheysari et al 2009 jia et al 2014 in northern italy where the annual rainfall was 822 mm nitrate leaching from a 150 cm soil profile ranged from 14 to 321 kg n ha 1 yr 1 at nitrogen application rates of 209 801 kg n ha 1 yr 1 perego et al 2012 when the nitrogen application rate was increased from 200 to 800 kg n ha 1 nitrate leaching increased from 6 to 149 kg no3 n ha 1 in the north china plain li et al 2007 in northwest china a five year drainage lysimeter experiment showed that nitrate leaching from a 90 cm soil profile was 3 10 and 16 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for three different soil treatments yang et al 2015 for comparison in our study the nitrate leaching losses in kg n ha 1 for the full wheat maize rotation cycle averaged 17 ck 25 bsl 38 bsm 61 bsh and 50 cf the nitrogen application rate for our bsl treatment was similar to the treatment with 200 kg n ha 1 yr 1 of urea used by li et al 2007 but the nitrate leaching amount from our bsl treatment was higher than that reported by li et al 2007 in this region namely 6 kg n ha 1 yr 1 the higher losses in our study could be explained by the improved movement of nitrate in a sandy layer that exists at a depth of 100 200 cm in this area overall nitrate leaching loss increased with higher nitrogen application rates higher than necessary nitrogen fertilizer application rates therefore increase nitrate leaching loss and reduce nitrogen use efficiency without increasing crop yield 4 2 effects of precipitation and irrigation on nitrate leaching nitrate leaching in soil is a water driven process and excessive input of water causes movement downward of nitrate trolove et al 2019 padilla et al 2018 therefore heavy rainfall and excessive irrigation are the immediate causes for nitrate leaching in croplands gholamhoseini et al 2013 sharma et al 2012 previous studies have noted that nitrate leaching losses increase dramatically with higher irrigation rates cameira et al 2003 gheysari et al 2009 wang et al 2010 and there can be significant differences in nitrate leaching losses between years with varying precipitation in semi arid districts li and li 2000 in our study wheat was irrigated more than maize but received less precipitation the total precipitation and irrigation for wheat was greater than that for maize in the first two rotations but lower in the third correspondingly the nitrate leaching loss for wheat was higher than for maize in the first two rotations but lower in the third each season s nitrate leaching losses showed a significant correlation with its total water input but was not significantly correlated to individual precipitation or irrigation events table 6 the unusual results from 2015 to 2016 in which nitrate leaching losses for wheat were less than those for maize were most likely caused by excessive precipitation during the 2016 maize growing season 4 3 soil nitrate nitrogen residual and nitrate leaching losses nitrogen is an important nutrient for crop development and growth however large amounts of accumulated nitrate in soil caused by excessive nitrogen application will not be totally absorbed by the next season s crop especially when it exceeds crop requirements this increases the risks of nitrate leaching ju and christie 2011 lu et al 2019 have noted that fertilization and water management represented the major optionals to reduce nitrate nitrogen accumulation in soil previous research has shown that one key to controlling nitrate leaching is to control nitrate nitrogen residual in the soil profile as this increases with the amount of applied nitrogen deng et al 2014 huang et al 2013 sieling et al 2014 we observed a similar pattern as seasonal measurements of nitrate nitrogen residual in the 0 200 cm soil profile after crop harvests showed that higher concentrations of dbgs resulted in higher nitrate nitrogen residual in the soil for example the average soil nitrate nitrogen residual for wheat increased from 74 to 196 kg n ha 1 when the nitrogen application rate increased from 128 to 318 kg n ha 1 whereas the average soil nitrate nitrogen residual for maize increased from 45 to 165 kg n ha 1 when the nitrogen application rate increased from 64 to 159 kg n ha 1 in comparison huang et al 2017 reported that a nitrogen application rate of 300 kg n ha 1 resulted in a nitrate nitrogen residual of 735 kg n ha 1 in the 0 100 cm layer of a calcareous fluvo aquic soil a higher residual than that found in our study one reason for this difference may be that the soil texture of our experimental site is sandy loam whereas that of huang et al s experimental site was silty clay loam such that irrigation water could move more freely through the sandy loam and leach more nitrates to layers below a depth of 200 cm similarly over application of dairy effluent has also been shown to increase nitrate concentrations in the 0 100 cm soil profile leading to a higher risk of nitrate leaching du et al 2015 nitrate nitrogen residual in deep soil layers and its subsequent downward movement could increase the risk level for groundwater quality dai et al 2016 since the nitrate nitrogen residual for each season and treatment in the present study showed a significant linear relationship with the nitrate leaching losses for each season r 0 925 p 0 01 fig 10 it is clear that controlling the concentration and amount of dbgs application to crop is necessary to prevent excessive nitrate leaching and protect water quality 4 4 effects of biogas slurry and fertilizer on nitrate leaching losses nitrate leaching was positively affected by nitrogen amount supplied via fertilizer and biogas slurry applications in bsm treatment of this study a small losses in nitrate leaching occurred which is lower that in cf treatment the six season cumulative nitrate leaching losses for bsm and cf treatments were 113 and 149 kg n ha 1 respectively in the wheat growing season the average ratios of nitrate leaching loss were 5 and 6 for the bsm and cf treatments respectively in the maize season the average ratios were 8 and 10 in bsm and cf treatments the main difference between fertilizer and biogas slurry treatments is the supply of orgnic material contained müller et al 2011 in our study the main form of nitrogen in digested biogas slurry was ammonium nitrogen comprising 64 of total nitrogen and complex organic nitrogen compounds accounted for 36 which would be mineralized to ammonium nitrogen slowly in the soil thus the ratio of nitrate leaching loss in bsm treatment was less than that in cf treatment however highly concentrated biogas slurry may lead to higher nutrient leaching when the nutrient provided is beyond the crop requirements guo et al 2014 matsunaka et al 2006 also reported that nitrogen leaching loss from heavy application anaerobically digested cattle slurry rate was significantly higher than that from standard application rate as we have observed from this study that a medium concentration of dbgs with a mix of 33 slurry and 67 groundwater contributs to relatively high nitrogen use efficiency and reduced nitrate leaching losses at overwintering and jointing stages for wheat and sowing time for maize the nitrate leaching in bsh treatment with higher dbgs application was higher than in cf treatment this highlights the inefficiency of nitrogen use at high biogas slurry application rates schroder et al 2007 analyzing the effect of long term application of conventional versus digested cattle slurry in grassland concluded that organic fertilizer with a higher nitrogen content such as digested cattle slurry would have a lower residual mitrogen effect in the first year of application particular attention therefore must be paid to the long term effects taking climate soil and crop into account in order to reliably estimate organic nitrogen fertilizer value and to propose proper recommendations berntsen et al 2007 5 conclusions excessive nitrogen input from the application of dbgs in combination with flood irrigation and intensive rainfall facilitated nitrate leaching in the intensive wheat maize rotation system in the north china plain seasonal nitrate leaching losses were variable but correlated with water amounts of irrigation and rainfall soil nitrogen accumulation and crop nitrogen removal the rates of nitrogen application used in conventional farm practices cf and in the highest concentration of dbgs application in this study bsh exceeded the crops nitrogen needs while contributing to nitrate accumulation in the soil profile as this excess nitrogen cannot be stored in the topsoil it is prone to loss through nitrate leaching which in this study averaged 60 kg ha 1 and 50 kg ha 1 for the bsh and cf treatments respectively in conclusion the medium concentration of dbgs as a field application following the methods described in this study was recommended that is 210 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 105 kg n ha 1 for maize a level that contributes to relatively high nitrogen use efficiency and good crop yield while reducing nitrate leaching losses funding this work was financially supported by the special scientific research fund of

11229,in recent decades the quantity and quality of irrigation water have been reduced due to a significant increase in pistachio cultivation and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources as well as reduction in rainfall precipitation therefore agricultural producers researchers and policy makers need to pay more attention to appropriate land management as an important strategy to achieve greater yield per unit area and to use soil and water resources in an optimal way so the present study was conducted to model the relationships between pistachio yield and soil water and management variables in rafsanjan region the southeast of iran one hundred and ninety nine mature orchards were selected and sampled in such a way that an acceptable range of soil and water quality and management were included the data set consisted of a dependent variable pistachio yield and 67 independent variables including soil water and management characteristics the results of hybrid genetic algorithm artificial neural network ga ann showed that the lowest error was related to the case in which the 23 features were used in modeling then stepwise multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural network ann techniques were applied to estimate pistachio yield the results indicated that mlr could explain only 28 of the pistachio yield variation whereas its accuracy increased when the data became more homogeneous via geographically dividing the study area into four parts with the highest densities of pistachio orchards ann based model had a 90 accuracy to predict pistachio yield in the study area thus an accurate estimation of pistachio yield could be achieved by reducing the data dimensionality using feature selection techniques and modeling with ann as the models were highly sensitive to irrigation water features special attention should be paid to new irrigation methods and management practices as an effective strategy to minimize water losses and increase water use efficiency keywords soil quality pistachio orchard management feature selection hybrid models multiple linear regression artificial neural network 1 introduction pistachio pistacia vera l is one of the most important exportable products in arid and semi arid areas of iran although pistachio trees are tolerant to drought and salinity optimum pistachio yield is not necessarily achieved in drought conditions hasheminasab and assad 2015 in recent decades due to considerable increase of the areas under pistachio cultivation and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources as well as reduction in atmospheric precipitation groundwater resources have been depleted and reduction in the quantity and quality of water has become a major concern of farmers bagheri et al 2012 therefore optimum management as an important strategy to achieve acceptable pistachio yield and the efficient use of soil and water resources have been of interest to researchers and orchard owners to develop management plans e g planting harvesting productivity transportation etc the mathematical modeling has been used as a process for crops yield prediction soares et al 2013 some researchers have used a simple linear correlation between the crop yield and soil characteristics the results of such researches were different from farm to farm and from one year to another in some studies crop yield was predicted by multiple linear regression mlr techniques e g hosseinifard et al 2008 khakural et al 1999 kravchenko and bullock 2000 satir and berberoglu 2016 zhou et al 2017 non linear statistical

computational intelligence techniques many researchers are interested in identifying the most important factors influencing a certain outcome of interest in addition original datasets often contain features of which some are either redundant or irrelevant to the target concept fayyad et al 1996 as one of the existing methods that deals with these problems feature selection is a process of selecting an optimal subset of features according to some reasonable criteria feature selection gives a deeper insight into the driving forces of a prediction and also reduces the feature space

reported that the optimal feature set obtained from the parallel ga resulted in increasing the coefficient of determination r2 values between the measured and the predicted geometric mean diameter of

r2 0 51 a few studies have examined the factors affecting pistachio yield hosseinifard et al 2008 after studying groundwater in anar region the southeast of iran pointed to significant negative correlation between the electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio sar of irrigation water and pistachio yield salehi et al 2010 indicated that sodium and boron concentrations in pistachio leaves and soil are the most important factors limiting pistachio yield in rafsanjan region the southeast of iran salehi and hosseinifard 2012 studied six pistachio orchards with the same management properties in rafsanjan region and noted that salinity and soil clay content are the most important properties affecting pistachio yield roosta and mohammadi 2013 concluded that manure ammonium and iron application to pistachio trees can improve some nut quality factors in alkaline soils of iranian pistachio orchards ghorbani and musavi 2015 studied pistachio orchards of damghan the north of iran and stated that 70 of the changes of pistachio yield can be explained by animal manure tree age soil texture financial management and executive skills hasheminasab and assad 2015 evaluated a statistical model for predicting pistachio yield stability based on physiological traits related to plant water status under drought stress condition the findings of the model suggested relative water protection relative water content and water retention capacity as reliable indicators for monitoring drought tolerance and predicting pistachio yield stability a limited number of studies have been carried out regarding pistachio yield modeling using different features on the other hand some of features may be redundant or irrelevant to pistachio yield the current study was conducted to i find a set of features that enable an accurate prediction to be achieved by a ga ann ii model the relationships between pistachio yield and soil water and management variables in study area and iii verify when the mlr and ann models are appropriate for the prediction of pistachio yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the irrigated pistachio orchards in rafsanjan region 56 41 to 54 56 e and 29 54 to 31 13 n kerman province the southeast of iran fig 1 the mean annual precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration in the region are 90 mm 19 c and 3000 mm respectively the mean altitude of the area is 1500 m above sea level and irrigated pistachio orchards are the major land uses in this region 2 2 field studies and sampling one hundred and ninety nine sampling points were selected in such a way that an acceptable range of soil and water quality and management were included fig 1 for this purpose the orchards which were irrigated from the same well were marked then management units orchards with the same management were identified soil samples were performed near the edge of the tree canopy and at three depths of 0 to 40 40 to 80 and 80 to 120 cm the irrigation water of all the orchards was also sampled moreover a face to face questionnaire was prepared for every orchard to collect yield and management data including the amount of consumed water irrigation interval orchard area tree age male to female tree ratio row width row length in row tree spacing amount of consumed manure cultivars number of winter leaching tree age in grafting and days per worker and per year as pistachio is a strongly alternate bearing tree crop species ferguson et al 1980 in the present study pistachio yield was reported as four year

particles were measured by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 soil ph was determined in saturated paste using a digital ph meter model 220 corning thomas 1996 and electrical conductivity ec was determined in the saturated paste extract using an ec meter model 4520 jenway rhoades 1996 soil organic carbon soc was measured by colorimetric method nelson and sommers 1996 calcium carbonate equivalent cce was determined by the back titration method nelson 1982 and gypsum was determined by precipitation in acetone nelson 1982 soluble calcium and soluble magnesium were determined

1982 and available potassium was measured using ammonium acetate knudsen et al 1982 water quality parameters were determined based on pansu and gautheyrou 2007 while the ph and ec values were measured by a ph meter model 220 corning and an ec meter model 4520 jenway respectively calcium and magnesium concentrations were determined titrimetrically using standard edta chloride was determined by the standard agno3 titration method carbonate and bicarbonate were determined by titration with hcl sodium was measured by flame photometry 2 4 feature selection using hybrid ga ann model in the proposed hybrid ga ann model different permutations were first randomly produced by ga according to the number of input features genes where each permutation was a chromosome the first feature was selected from each permutation next ann model was constructed using such candidate feature and error decrease in estimating the pistachio yield was monitored therefore the fitness value of each chromosome was determined by calculating a coast function a three layered feed forward ann was employed to fitness computation table 1 shows the summary of the parameters used in hybrid ga nn model in the next step a selection mechanism was employed for selecting the two fittest chromosomes for reproduction a crossover operator was employed for introducing new chromosomes to the next generation and a mutation operator was employed for creating new information in the offspring table 1 subsequently the previous population was replaced by the new one and the steps above were repeated until the generation number reached its maximum in this way the best feature subset with one member was identified this procedure was continued until the combination including 67 features was investigated finally the combinations with 1 67 features were compared and the feature subset which had the lowest error and the minimum number of inputs was considered as the most effective one 2 5 pistachio yield modeling spss 22 0 software was used to develop the stepwise mlr model and to determine the descriptive statistics of the studied features then the study area was divided geographically into 4 parts including noogh anar eastern suburbs and western suburbs with the highest densities of pistachio orchards and the regression models were run for each part separately ann models were then performed using matlab software package matlab r2013b the data were randomly partitioned into three subsets a training data set 70 of the total a validation data set 15 of the total and a test data set 15 of the total then modeling was carried out using feed forward multilayer perceptron network back propagation of error method with levenberg marquardt function was used for network training sensitivity analysis was used to compare the importance of different parameters to the estimation of pistachio yield hill and tiedeman 2007 the ability of the models to yield prediction was evaluated using the relative root mean square error rmse adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 and durbin watson statistic d w eqs 1 3 d w statistic was used to determine the independence of the observations and its values always lie between 0 and 4 if there is no autocorrelation in the residuals d w s value is close to 2 if d w statistic tends to 0 there is a positive serial correlation and if it tends to 4 successive error terms are negatively correlated durbin 1969 1 rmse 100 σ i 1 n y i x i 2 n 2 adjusted r 2 r 2 1 r 2 p n p 3 d w i 2 n e i e i 1 2 i 1 n e i 2 where xi is the measured value of sample i yi is the predicted value of sample i n is the total number of samples σ is the standard deviation of measured values r2 is the coefficient of determination p is the number of inputs and ei is the difference between the measured and predicted values 2 6 sensitivity analysis the relative importance of selected features was calculated using an ann sensitivity analysis based on changing r2 shirani et al 2015 the steps for this sensitivity analysis method can be briefly described as follows 1 initially the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated using all inputs 2 one of the variables was eliminated from the inputs set then modeling was carried out with the rest of the variables and the new model coefficient of determination r2 was calculated 3 the difference between the calculated coefficients of determination in steps 1 and 2 δ r 2 was determined 4 δ r 2 r 2 r 2 the importance of the eliminated variable vi was calculated as follows 5 vi δ r 2 r 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistics and data analysis table 2 represents the details of the measured features used for modeling the average yield in the study area was close to 1800 kg ha 1 according to fao 2014 the average pistachio yield in the cultivated areas of iran is 1312 kg ha 1 and its world average is near 1218 kg ha 1 pistachio yield data have a high diversity with the coefficient of variation cv equal to 76 62 cv values show that phosphorus concentration is more diverse than that of potassium which is probably due to low mobility of phosphorus brye et al 2003 also the soil sodicity index sodium adsorption ratio i e sar showed more variability in comparison to soil salinity index electrical conductivity i e ec table 2 generally the higher cv can be attributed to more impact of management factors dahiya et al 1984 wilding and drees 1983 3 2 feature selection using hybrid ga ann model fig 2 shows hybrid ga ann accuracy in yield estimation with different combinations of the input variables accordingly a permutation of 58 features with the lowest rmse was introduced as the most important combination of the variables affecting pistachio yield however a component containing 23 predictor variables had a relatively close rmse to the mentioned permutation therefore by considering investments of time laboratory works and budget considerations the permutation including 23 features was selected to estimate pistachio yield the selected subset included ec 80 120 cm ec of irrigation water sar 40 80 cm ph 80 120 cm soluble mg 80 120 cm soluble ca 0 40 cm soluble ca 80 120 cm silt 0 40 cm silt 40 80 cm available p 40 80 cm available k 40 80 cm soluble na 0 40 cm clay 0 40 cm sand 80 120 cm soc 0 40 cm cce 80 120 cm ph of irrigation water amount of consumed manure sar of irrigation water in row tree spacing male to female tree ratio amount of consumed water and irrigation interval 3 3 pistachio yield modeling using mlr linear regression accuracy in pistachio yield estimation for the whole study area was equal to 28 table 3 factors affecting the yield could be identified using standardized regression coefficients table 4 according to this model the amount of water used and sar 40 80 cm had the greatest impact on pistachio yield in the study area rising sar destroys soil structure decreases water infiltration and increases the chance of sodium accumulation to toxic levels in plant tissue sanden et al 2005a to increase mlr efficiency data variability and heterogeneity could be reduced through data portioning seybold et al 2005 the performance parameters showed that the data categorization increased the estimation accuracy so that the model adj r2 for noogh anar eastern suburbs and western suburbs orchards rose to about 81 9 86 4 74 6 and 51 3 respectively table 3 the modeling using samples collected from anar area showed that the phosphorus concentration at depth of 40 to 80 cm was the most important factor increasing pistachio yield in this region table 3 removed p in fruit and abscised leaves in on year pistachio trees is averaged 6 times than in off year trees rosecrance et al 1996 shahriaripour et al 2011 reported that p application significantly decreased root na concentration irrigation frequency was another variable entered into the mentioned model goldhamer and beede 2004 noted that irrigation cutoff during growing season can reduce the pistachio yield and quality it was observed that with increasing irrigation frequency from 25 to 45 days in pistachio orchards blankness fruits in all the treatments increased in kerman region the best irrigation frequency can vary between 30 to 45 days for the months with low evaporation and between 20 to 35 days for the warmer months based on soil texture mohammadi mohammadabadi and sedaghati 2010 thus reducing irrigation frequency via switching surface irrigation system to microirrigation and reducing the width of strips or furrows can be considered as one of the management recommendations topsoil s clay content has a positive effect on pistachio yield in anar area with the standardized coefficient equal to 0 37 given that the soil texture in that area is often sandy loam and loamy sand clay increase probably enhances water holding capacity and cation exchange capacity hosseinifard et al 2010 by soil mineralogical assessing in anar area indicated that mica is a dominant clay mineral which in addition to high stability and limited expansibility has interlayer potassium surapaneni et al 2002 and samadi 2011 also observed a significant positive correlation between nonexchangeable potassium and illite nonexchangeable potassium has proven role in plant nutrition richards et al 1988 the pistachio yield in this area has a negative relationship with silt content in soil depth of 40 80 cm the mineralogical composition and amount of silt fraction can affect the fertility and moisture availability of soil hawkins and graham 1950 ismail 1991 najafi ghiri and jaberi 2013 the mlr model explained up to 75 of the yield variations in the eastern suburbs using the input variables including the amount of consumed water soluble calcium and electrical conductivity in depth of 80 120 cm tables 3 and 4 pistachio is resistant to drought but the water supply is an essential requirement to achieve optimal yield evapotranspiration of pistachio trees in rafsanjan is 9432 m3 ha 1 year 1 the amount of consumed water regardless of the water losses in kerman region has been reported about 8 000 15 000 m3 ha 1 year 1 mohammadi mohammadabadi and sedaghati 2010 salinity in soil depth of 80 120 cm with the standardized coefficient 0 67 was the most limiting variable for pistachio yield in the eastern suburbs soil salinity is one of the major problems in arid and semi arid regions eskandari et al 2014 salehi and hosseinifard 2012 stated that soil salinity has a significant impact on pistachio yield in contrast soluble calcium in soil depth of 80 120 cm standardized coefficient 0 36 had a positive effect on the increase in pistachio yield due to the high soluble sodium in the area calcium can reduce the sar in addition calcium plays an important role in pistachio nutrition adibfar et al 2012 agar 2012 hojjat nooghi and mozafari 2012 sajadian and hokmabadi 2011 according to the mentioned issues autumn winter leaching with application of appropriate amendments such as gypsum and sulfuric acid can be recommended as a management practice in this area sanden et al 2005a yazdanpanah et al 2013 the soil available p at depth of 40 80 cm and amount of consumed water had a positive impact and irrigation interval soil soluble mg and sand content at depth of 80 120 cm have a negative effect on the crop yield in noogh area table 4 high mg levels in addition to toxicity for plants can destroy soil structure in fact the high density of positive charge increases magnesium hydrated radius resulting in disaggregation zhang and norton 2002 increasing soil magnesium disrupts potassium and calcium absorption and a false lack of calcium in pistachio trees occurs sajadian and hokmabadi 2011 therefore treating these orchards with amendments increasing the soluble and exchangeable calcium has a positive impact on crop yield increasing sand content reduces soil ability to hold water and nutrients required for the plant table 4 shows that the soluble sodium in topsoil was the limiting factor for the pistachio yield in the western suburbs given that the sar at 90 of the topsoil in this area is less than 13 the negative impact of sodium is probably related to its toxicity excessive sodium uptake by plant can lead to the appearance of toxicity symptoms that are similar to potassium deficiency symptoms beede et al 2005 over time and with leaching other cations sodium can allocate a greater number of colloids exchange sites and therefore soil infiltration and aeration can decline qadir et al 2003 proper and on time management practices can prevent such problems sanden et al 2005a pistachio trees are dioecious with male and female flowers borne on separate trees as pistachio pollen is blown by wind the male density within an orchard is important kallsen et al 1980 reported that most new orchards with acceptable yield in the central valley of california are planted every fifth tree in every fifth row a ratio of 24 female cv kerman to one male cv peters in some instances in areas where few or no other pistachios are grown the ratio of kerman to peters has been reduced to 14 1 to ensure adequate pollination given the different conditions such as relative humidity in rafsanjan region more researches are needed to obtain optimal male to female tree ratio generally the parameters related to the irrigation water are among the most important variables affecting the pistachio yield in the study area among the four regression models the only one in which none of the irrigation water features was significant was related to the western suburbs the pistachio yield in the western suburbs was better than other zones so that in 90 of the studied orchards the crop yield was more than 1200 kg ha 1 the region water balance is extremely negative because of low precipitation high evaporation and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater in recent years reducing water resources and increasing irrigation frequency in pistachio orchards can cause drought stresses and irreparable damages to the trees traditional irrigation techniques common in the region have low efficiency due to their inherent problems and improper management mohammadi mohammadabadi and sedaghati 2010 therefore special attention should be paid to water management practices in order to increase irrigation efficiency this can be achieved by changing the irrigation methods from surface methods to microirrigation improving irrigation scheduling and reducing water use without affecting yields a practice termed regulated deficit irrigation goldhamer 2005 iniesta et al 2008 3 4 pistachio yield modeling using ann ann model was implemented with 23 selected attributes as inputs as well as the amount of the yield as the target variable network architecture was formed by trial and error and with 10 neurons in a hidden layer 51 iterations epochs and tangent sigmoid activation levenberg marquardt training functions rmse and adj r2 values for the proposed ann model for the yield prediction were 16 99 and 0 90 respectively table 3 values of rmse less than 40 indicate acceptable model accuracy hengl and husnjak 2006 the evaluation indices presented in table 3 indicated that ann had higher accuracy compared to mlr for the pistachio yield modeling in the case of using unstable data ann is not superior to linear regression but with precise data application it provides a more accurate model pachepsky et al 1996 in many cases the analyst may want to provide a measure of importance for each variable instead of just listing them this would provide more information for modifying the selected list to accommodate other considerations of the data analysis shirani et al 2015 fig 3 shows the sensitivities of the most important variables used in the developed ann model to predict the pistachio yield over 70 of the model sensitivity was covered by top 10 features including the amount of consumed water soil available p at depth of 40 80 irrigation interval ec of irrigation water silt content at depth of 40 80 sand content at depth of 80 120 cm amount of consumed manure in row tree spacing ph at depth of 80 120 cm and soluble calcium in topsoil the amount of consumed water was the most determinant parameter influencing the pistachio yield importance coefficient value of 17 40 fig 3 it emphasizes the importance of irrigation parameters and the necessity of applying modern and efficient irrigation techniques soil texture is one of the important factors influencing nutritional characteristics and management practices pistachios can be successfully grown on a number of soil types but typically deep uniform loam soils produce the best yields ferguson et al 1980 although fine texture soils have high cation exchange and water holding capacity they may encounter some problems such as low infiltration rate on the other hand the low cation exchange and water holding capacity leading to leaching of nutrients as well as drought stress are the main problems of coarse texture soils brady 2008 the application of manure improves soil organic matter which in turn can improve soil productivity as it enhances soil physical chemical and biological properties indeed soil organic matter may promote crop yields through supplying multiple nutrients encouraging microbial activity and improving infiltration rate sanden et al 2005b swift 2001 appropriate row spacing is particularly important in pistachio orchards kallsen et al 1980 suggested a design with 4 6 5 5 meters between trees in deep soils with proper drainage less tree spacing leaves little room for tree growth or mechanical cross hedging and more expensive hand pruning will be required to keep trees separated from one another for harvest conversely in a more widely spaced initial planting the onset of economic bearing is delayed soil ph is one of the most important factors to assess the quality of soil and water most of the pistachio orchards in the study areas have high soil ph in range of calcareous soils 7 8 5 soil ph has a substantial effect on soil nutrient availability and microbial processes higher soil ph limits the solubility of micronutrients such as fe and mn brady 2008 generally sensitivities show the importance of each variable but do not indicate how they affect pistachio yield thus the results of a sensitivity analysis should be interpreted based on expert knowledge or results of other models such as linear regression 4 conclusions the results indicated the efficiency of a reasonable feature selection for the yield evaluation in pistachio orchards with different soil types water quality and management systems ann achieved more accuracy in regional scale prediction of the pistachio yield compared to mlr mlr model did not accurately predict the pistachio yield for the whole the study area however when the study area was geographically divided into 4 parts the evaluation indices of mlr significantly improved it means that the data homogeneity and decreasing sources of the variations reduced the complexity of the relationships among the features as the models were highly sensitive to the irrigation water features special attention should be paid to new irrigation methods and management practices as an effective strategy to minimize water losses and increase water use efficiency although anns are more efficient compared to linear regression methods in regional scale estimating they are not necessarily better to illustrate the relationships among variables therefore the application of other methods such as linear regression is recommended for planning appropriate farm management in local scales acknowledgments the present work was financially supported by shahrekord

11229,in recent decades the quantity and quality of irrigation water have been reduced due to a significant increase in pistachio cultivation and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources as well as reduction in rainfall precipitation therefore agricultural producers researchers and policy makers need to pay more attention to appropriate land management as an important strategy to achieve greater yield per unit area and to use soil and water resources in an optimal way so the present study was conducted to model the relationships between pistachio yield and soil water and management variables in rafsanjan region the southeast of iran one hundred and ninety nine mature orchards were selected and sampled in such a way that an acceptable range of soil and water quality and management were included the data set consisted of a dependent variable pistachio yield and 67 independent variables including soil water and management characteristics the results of hybrid genetic algorithm artificial neural network ga ann showed that the lowest error was related to the case in which the 23 features were used in modeling then stepwise multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural network ann techniques were applied to estimate pistachio yield the results indicated that mlr could explain only 28 of the pistachio yield variation whereas its accuracy increased when the data became more homogeneous via geographically dividing the study area into four parts with the highest densities of pistachio orchards ann based model had a 90 accuracy to predict pistachio yield in the study area thus an accurate estimation of pistachio yield could be achieved by reducing the data dimensionality using feature selection techniques and modeling with ann as the models were highly sensitive to irrigation water features special attention should be paid to new irrigation methods and management practices as an effective strategy to minimize water losses and increase water use efficiency keywords soil quality pistachio orchard management feature selection hybrid models multiple linear regression artificial neural network 1 introduction pistachio pistacia vera l is one of the most important exportable products in arid and semi arid areas of iran although pistachio trees are tolerant to drought and salinity optimum pistachio yield is not necessarily achieved in drought conditions hasheminasab and assad 2015 in recent decades due to considerable increase of the areas under pistachio cultivation and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources as well as reduction in atmospheric precipitation groundwater resources have been depleted and reduction in the quantity and quality of water has become a major concern of farmers bagheri et al 2012 therefore optimum management as an important strategy to achieve acceptable pistachio yield and the efficient use of soil and water resources have been of interest to researchers and orchard owners to develop management plans e g planting harvesting productivity transportation etc the mathematical modeling has been used as a process for crops yield prediction soares et al 2013 some researchers have used a simple linear correlation between the crop yield and soil characteristics the results of such researches were different from farm to farm and from one year to another in some studies crop yield was predicted by multiple linear regression mlr techniques e g hosseinifard et al 2008 khakural et al 1999 kravchenko and bullock 2000 satir and berberoglu 2016 zhou et al 2017 non linear statistical methods have also been used by some researchers e g adams et al 1999 blanc 2017 hansen and indeje 2004 recent developments in computational intelligence in the area of machine learning in particular have greatly expanded the capabilities of empirical modeling a machine learning algorithm is used to determine the relationship between a system inputs and outputs using a training data set that is the representative of all the behavior found in the system solomatine et al 2008 artificial neural networks anns genetic algorithms gas and approaches to model integration are among the most popular computational intelligence techniques many researchers are interested in identifying the most important factors influencing a certain outcome of interest in addition original datasets often contain features of which some are either redundant or irrelevant to the target concept fayyad et al 1996 as one of the existing methods that deals with these problems feature selection is a process of selecting an optimal subset of features according to some reasonable criteria feature selection gives a deeper insight into the driving forces of a prediction and also reduces the feature space dimension behrens et al 2010 ga goldberg 1989 is an efficient tool for problems of model optimization and feature selection when the model space is complex and has many local minima beiko and charlebois 2005 garcia gutierrez et al 2014 showed a comparison between common methods for the selection of predictors and recommend the use of evolutionary selection approach besalatpour et al 2014 reported that the optimal feature set obtained from the parallel ga resulted in increasing the coefficient of determination r2 values between the measured and the predicted geometric mean diameter of soil aggregates using mlr and ann by 20 0 and 8 8 respectively shirani et al 2015 introduced a permutation of five input features including soil organic matter electrical conductivity clay sand and bulk density as explanatory variables using the optimized decision tree with particle swarm optimization odt pso in the present study a ga ann model was applied to find a set of features that enable an accurate prediction to be achieved anns are those dynamic systems which transmit the hidden knowledge behind the experimental data to the network structure by data processing anns are useful when the diversity of data is very great and the relationships and interactions between variables are vague and complex schultz et al 2000 scientists have also used ann to simulate parameters such as weekly evapotranspiration landeras et al 2009 groundwater level fluctuations chitsazan et al 2015 soil erosion kim and gilley 2008 soil water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity merdun et al 2006 land cover mapping foody 2000 and fertilization rate yu et al 2010 many studies have estimated target yield as a major issue in precision farming using anns miao et al 2006 kaul et al 2005 used the capabilities of anns to predict corn and soybean yield with rainfall data and the soil rating for plant growth srpg values in maryland they emphasized that ann models consistently provided accurate yield predictions norouzi et al 2010 identified the most important terrain attributes and soil properties affecting wheat yield variability under rainfed conditions using an ann model in the semi arid and hilly regions of western iran zeng et al 2016 established a sunflower seed yield prediction model for saline soils directly from soil salinity and nitrogen application using ann analysis r2 0 51 a few studies have examined the factors affecting pistachio yield hosseinifard et al 2008 after studying groundwater in anar region the southeast of iran pointed to significant negative correlation between the electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio sar of irrigation water and pistachio yield salehi et al 2010 indicated that sodium and boron concentrations in pistachio leaves and soil are the most important factors limiting pistachio yield in rafsanjan region the southeast of iran salehi and hosseinifard 2012 studied six pistachio orchards with the same management properties in rafsanjan region and noted that salinity and soil clay content are the most important properties affecting pistachio yield roosta and mohammadi 2013 concluded that manure ammonium and iron application to pistachio trees can improve some nut quality factors in alkaline soils of iranian pistachio orchards ghorbani and musavi 2015 studied pistachio orchards of damghan the north of iran and stated that 70 of the changes of pistachio yield can be explained by animal manure tree age soil texture financial management and executive skills hasheminasab and assad 2015 evaluated a statistical model for predicting pistachio yield stability based on physiological traits related to plant water status under drought stress condition the findings of the model suggested relative water protection relative water content and water retention capacity as reliable indicators for monitoring drought tolerance and predicting pistachio yield stability a limited number of studies have been carried out regarding pistachio yield modeling using different features on the other hand some of features may be redundant or irrelevant to pistachio yield the current study was conducted to i find a set of features that enable an accurate prediction to be achieved by a ga ann ii model the relationships between pistachio yield and soil water and management variables in study area and iii verify when the mlr and ann models are appropriate for the prediction of pistachio yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the irrigated pistachio orchards in rafsanjan region 56 41 to 54 56 e and 29 54 to 31 13 n kerman province the southeast of iran fig 1 the mean annual precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration in the region are 90 mm 19 c and 3000 mm respectively the mean altitude of the area is 1500 m above sea level and irrigated pistachio orchards are the major land uses in this region 2 2 field studies and sampling one hundred and ninety nine sampling points were selected in such a way that an acceptable range of soil and water quality and management were included fig 1 for this purpose the orchards which were irrigated from the same well were marked then management units orchards with the same management were identified soil samples were performed near the edge of the tree canopy and at three depths of 0 to 40 40 to 80 and 80 to 120 cm the irrigation water of all the orchards was also sampled moreover a face to face questionnaire was prepared for every orchard to collect yield and management data including the amount of consumed water irrigation interval orchard area tree age male to female tree ratio row width row length in row tree spacing amount of consumed manure cultivars number of winter leaching tree age in grafting and days per worker and per year as pistachio is a strongly alternate bearing tree crop species ferguson et al 1980 in the present study pistachio yield was reported as four year averages 2 3 soil and water analyses the soil samples were air dried and ground to pass a 2 mm sieve before the analyses the percentages of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm

determined in the saturated paste extract using an ec meter model 4520 jenway rhoades 1996 soil organic carbon soc was measured by colorimetric method nelson and sommers 1996 calcium carbonate equivalent cce was determined by the back titration method nelson 1982 and gypsum was determined by precipitation in acetone nelson 1982 soluble calcium and soluble magnesium were determined titrimetrically using standard edta barrows and simpson 1962 and soluble sodium was measured by flame photometry knudsen et al 1982 available phosphorus was measured by olsen method olsen and sommers 1982 and available potassium was measured using ammonium acetate knudsen et al 1982 water quality parameters were determined based on pansu and gautheyrou 2007 while the ph and ec values were measured by a ph meter model 220 corning and an ec meter model 4520 jenway respectively calcium and magnesium concentrations were determined titrimetrically using standard edta chloride was determined by the standard agno3 titration method carbonate and bicarbonate were determined by titration with hcl sodium was measured by flame photometry 2 4 feature selection using hybrid ga ann model in the proposed hybrid ga ann model different permutations were first randomly produced by ga according to the number of input features genes where each permutation was a chromosome the first feature was selected from each permutation next ann model was constructed using such candidate feature and error decrease in estimating the pistachio yield was monitored therefore the fitness value of each chromosome was determined by calculating a coast function a three layered feed forward ann was employed to fitness computation table 1 shows the summary of the parameters used in hybrid ga nn model in the next step a selection mechanism was employed for selecting the two fittest chromosomes for reproduction a crossover operator was employed for introducing new chromosomes to the next generation and a mutation operator was employed for creating new information in the offspring table 1 subsequently the previous population was replaced by the new one and the steps above were repeated until the generation number reached its maximum in this way the best feature subset with one member was identified this procedure was continued until the combination including 67 features was investigated finally the combinations with 1 67 features were compared and the feature subset which had the lowest error and the minimum number of inputs was considered as the most effective one 2 5 pistachio yield modeling spss 22 0 software was used to develop the stepwise mlr model and to determine the descriptive statistics of the studied features then the study area was divided geographically into 4 parts including noogh anar eastern suburbs and western suburbs with the highest densities of pistachio orchards and the regression models were run for each part separately ann models were then performed using matlab software package matlab r2013b the data were randomly partitioned into three subsets a training data set 70 of the total a validation data set 15 of the total and a test data set 15 of the total then modeling was carried out using feed forward multilayer perceptron network back propagation of error method with levenberg marquardt function was used for network training sensitivity analysis was used

lie between 0 and 4 if there is no autocorrelation in the residuals d w s value is close to 2 if d w statistic tends to 0 there is a positive serial correlation and if it tends to 4 successive error

the steps for this sensitivity analysis method can be briefly described as follows 1 initially the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated using all inputs 2 one of the variables was eliminated from the inputs set then modeling was carried out with the rest of the variables and the new model coefficient of determination r2 was calculated 3 the difference between the calculated coefficients

data analysis table 2 represents the details of the measured features used for modeling the average yield in the study area was close to 1800 kg ha 1 according to fao 2014 the average pistachio yield in the cultivated areas of iran is 1312 kg ha 1 and its world average is near 1218 kg ha 1 pistachio yield data have a high diversity with the coefficient of variation cv equal to 76 62 cv values show that phosphorus concentration is more diverse than that of potassium which is probably due to low mobility of phosphorus brye et al 2003 also the soil sodicity index sodium adsorption ratio i e sar showed more variability in comparison to soil salinity index electrical conductivity i e ec table 2 generally the higher cv can be attributed to more impact of management factors dahiya et al 1984 wilding and drees 1983 3 2 feature selection using hybrid ga ann model fig 2 shows hybrid ga ann accuracy in yield estimation with different combinations of the input variables accordingly a permutation of 58 features with the lowest rmse was introduced as the most important combination of the variables affecting pistachio yield however a component containing 23 predictor variables had a relatively close rmse to the mentioned permutation therefore by considering investments of time laboratory works and budget considerations the permutation including 23 features was selected to estimate pistachio yield the selected subset included ec 80 120 cm ec of irrigation water sar 40 80 cm ph 80 120 cm soluble mg 80 120 cm soluble ca 0 40 cm soluble ca 80 120 cm silt 0 40 cm silt 40 80

study area was equal to 28 table 3 factors affecting the yield could be identified using standardized regression coefficients table 4 according to this model the amount of water used and sar 40 80 cm had the greatest impact on pistachio yield in the study area rising sar destroys soil structure decreases water infiltration and increases the chance of sodium accumulation to toxic levels in plant tissue sanden et al 2005a to increase mlr efficiency data variability and heterogeneity could be reduced through data portioning seybold et al 2005 the performance parameters showed that the data categorization increased the estimation accuracy so that the model adj r2 for noogh anar eastern suburbs and western suburbs orchards rose to about 81 9 86 4 74 6 and 51 3 respectively table 3 the modeling using samples collected from anar area showed that the phosphorus concentration at depth of 40 to 80 cm was the most important factor increasing pistachio yield in this region table 3 removed p in fruit and abscised leaves in on year pistachio trees is averaged 6 times than in off year trees rosecrance et al 1996 shahriaripour et al 2011 reported that p application significantly decreased root na concentration irrigation frequency was another variable entered into the mentioned model goldhamer and beede 2004 noted that irrigation cutoff during growing season can reduce the pistachio yield and quality it was observed that with increasing irrigation frequency from 25 to 45 days in pistachio orchards blankness fruits in all the treatments increased in kerman region the best irrigation frequency can vary between 30 to 45 days for the months with low evaporation and between 20 to 35 days for the warmer months based on soil texture mohammadi mohammadabadi and sedaghati 2010 thus reducing irrigation frequency via switching surface irrigation system to microirrigation and reducing the width of strips or furrows can be considered as one of the management recommendations topsoil s clay content has a positive effect on pistachio yield in anar area with the standardized coefficient equal to 0 37 given that the soil texture in that area is often sandy loam and loamy sand clay increase probably enhances water holding capacity and cation exchange capacity hosseinifard et al 2010 by soil mineralogical assessing in anar area indicated that mica is a dominant clay mineral which in addition to high stability and limited expansibility has interlayer potassium surapaneni et al 2002 and samadi 2011 also observed a significant positive correlation between nonexchangeable potassium and illite nonexchangeable potassium has proven role in plant nutrition richards et al 1988 the pistachio yield in this area has a negative relationship with silt content in soil depth of 40 80 cm the mineralogical composition and amount of silt fraction can affect the fertility and moisture availability of soil hawkins and graham 1950 ismail 1991 najafi ghiri and jaberi 2013 the mlr model explained up to 75 of the yield variations in the eastern suburbs using the input variables including the amount of consumed water soluble calcium and electrical conductivity in depth of 80 120 cm tables 3 and 4 pistachio is resistant to drought but the water supply is an essential requirement to achieve optimal yield evapotranspiration of pistachio trees in rafsanjan is 9432 m3 ha 1 year 1 the amount of consumed water regardless of the water losses in kerman region has been reported about 8 000 15 000 m3 ha 1 year 1 mohammadi mohammadabadi and sedaghati 2010 salinity in soil depth of 80 120 cm with the standardized coefficient 0 67 was the most limiting variable for pistachio yield in the eastern suburbs soil salinity is one of the major problems in arid and semi arid regions eskandari et al 2014 salehi and hosseinifard 2012 stated that soil salinity has a significant impact on pistachio yield in contrast soluble calcium in soil depth of 80 120 cm standardized coefficient 0 36 had a positive effect on the increase in pistachio yield due to the high soluble sodium in the area calcium can reduce the sar in addition calcium plays an important role in pistachio nutrition adibfar et al 2012 agar 2012 hojjat nooghi and mozafari 2012 sajadian and hokmabadi 2011 according to the mentioned issues autumn winter leaching with application of appropriate amendments such as gypsum and sulfuric acid can be recommended as a management practice in this area sanden et al 2005a yazdanpanah et al 2013 the soil available p at depth of 40 80 cm and amount of consumed water had a positive impact and irrigation interval soil soluble mg and sand content at depth of 80 120 cm have a negative effect on the crop yield in noogh area table 4 high mg levels in addition to toxicity for plants can destroy soil structure in fact the high density of positive charge increases magnesium hydrated radius resulting in disaggregation zhang and norton 2002 increasing soil magnesium disrupts potassium and calcium absorption and a false lack of calcium in pistachio trees occurs sajadian and hokmabadi 2011 therefore treating these orchards with amendments increasing the soluble and exchangeable calcium has a positive impact on crop yield increasing sand content reduces soil ability to hold water and nutrients required for the plant table 4 shows that the soluble sodium in topsoil was the limiting factor for the pistachio yield in the western suburbs given that the sar at 90 of the topsoil in this area is less than 13 the negative impact of sodium is probably related to its toxicity excessive sodium uptake by plant can lead to the appearance of toxicity symptoms that are similar to potassium deficiency symptoms beede et al 2005 over time and with leaching other cations sodium can allocate a greater number of colloids exchange sites and therefore soil infiltration and aeration can decline qadir et al 2003 proper and on time management practices can prevent such problems sanden et al 2005a pistachio trees are dioecious with male and female flowers borne on separate trees as pistachio pollen is blown by wind the male density within an orchard is important kallsen et al 1980 reported that most new orchards with acceptable yield in the central valley of california are planted every fifth tree in every fifth row a ratio of 24 female cv kerman to one male cv peters in some instances in areas where few or no other pistachios are grown the ratio of kerman to peters has been reduced to 14 1 to ensure adequate pollination given the different conditions such as relative humidity in rafsanjan region more researches are needed to obtain optimal male to female tree ratio generally the parameters related to the irrigation water are among the most important variables affecting the pistachio yield in the study area among the four regression models the only one in which none of the irrigation water features was significant was related to the western suburbs the pistachio yield in the western suburbs was better than other zones so that in 90 of the studied orchards the crop yield was more than 1200 kg ha 1 the region water balance is extremely negative because of low precipitation high evaporation and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater in recent years reducing water resources and increasing irrigation frequency in pistachio orchards can cause drought stresses and irreparable damages to the trees traditional irrigation techniques common in the region have low efficiency due to their inherent problems and improper management mohammadi mohammadabadi and sedaghati 2010 therefore special attention should be paid to water management practices in order to increase irrigation efficiency this can be achieved by changing the irrigation methods from surface methods to microirrigation improving irrigation scheduling and reducing water use without affecting yields a practice termed regulated deficit irrigation goldhamer 2005 iniesta et al 2008 3 4 pistachio yield modeling using ann ann model was implemented with 23 selected attributes as inputs as well as the amount of the yield as the target variable network architecture was formed by trial and error and with 10 neurons in a hidden layer 51 iterations epochs and tangent sigmoid activation levenberg marquardt training functions rmse and adj r2 values for the proposed ann model for the yield prediction were 16 99 and 0 90 respectively table 3 values of rmse less than 40 indicate acceptable model accuracy hengl and husnjak 2006 the evaluation indices presented in table 3 indicated that ann had higher accuracy compared to mlr for the pistachio yield modeling in the case of using unstable data ann is not superior to linear regression but with precise data application it provides a more accurate model pachepsky et al 1996 in many cases the analyst may want to provide a measure of importance for each variable instead of just listing them this would provide more information for modifying the selected list to accommodate other considerations of the data analysis shirani et al 2015 fig 3 shows the sensitivities of the most important variables used in the developed ann model to predict the pistachio yield over 70 of the model sensitivity was covered by top 10 features including the amount of consumed water soil available p at depth of 40 80 irrigation interval ec of irrigation water silt content at depth of 40 80 sand content at depth of 80 120 cm amount of consumed manure in row tree spacing ph at depth of 80 120 cm and soluble calcium in topsoil the amount of consumed water was the most determinant parameter influencing the pistachio yield importance coefficient value of 17 40 fig 3 it emphasizes the importance of irrigation parameters and the necessity of applying modern and efficient irrigation techniques soil texture is one of the important factors influencing nutritional characteristics and management practices pistachios can be successfully grown on a number of soil types but typically deep uniform loam soils produce the best yields ferguson et al 1980 although fine texture soils have high cation exchange and water holding capacity they may encounter some problems such as low infiltration rate on the other hand the low cation exchange and water holding capacity leading to leaching of nutrients as well as drought stress are the main problems of coarse texture soils brady 2008 the application of manure improves soil organic matter which in turn can improve soil productivity as it enhances soil physical chemical and biological properties indeed soil organic matter may promote crop yields through supplying multiple nutrients encouraging microbial activity and improving infiltration rate sanden et al 2005b swift 2001 appropriate row spacing is particularly important in pistachio orchards kallsen et al 1980 suggested a design with 4 6 5 5 meters between trees in deep soils with proper drainage less tree spacing leaves little room for tree growth or mechanical cross hedging and more expensive hand pruning will be required to keep trees separated from one another for harvest conversely in a more widely spaced initial planting the onset of economic bearing is delayed soil ph is one of the most important factors to assess the quality of soil and water most of the pistachio orchards in the study areas have high soil ph in range of calcareous soils 7 8 5 soil ph has a substantial effect on soil nutrient availability and microbial processes higher soil ph limits the solubility of micronutrients such as fe and mn brady 2008 generally sensitivities show the importance of each variable but do not indicate how they affect pistachio yield thus the results of a sensitivity analysis should be interpreted based on expert knowledge or results of other models such as linear regression 4 conclusions the results indicated the efficiency of a reasonable feature selection for the yield evaluation in pistachio orchards with different soil types water quality and management systems ann achieved more accuracy in regional scale prediction of the pistachio yield compared to mlr mlr model did not accurately predict the pistachio yield for the whole the study area however when the study area was geographically divided into 4 parts the evaluation indices of mlr significantly improved it means that the data homogeneity and decreasing sources of the variations reduced the complexity of the relationships among the features as the models were highly sensitive to the irrigation water features special attention should be paid to new irrigation methods and management practices as an effective strategy to minimize water losses and increase water use efficiency although anns are more efficient compared to linear regression methods in regional scale estimating they are not necessarily better to illustrate the relationships among variables therefore the application of other methods such as linear regression is recommended for planning appropriate farm management in local scales acknowledgments the present work was financially supported by shahrekord
