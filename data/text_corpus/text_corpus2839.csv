14195,produced water refers to the water that is generated when oil and gas are extracted from the ground and it usually includes the natural water layer within the reservoir formation water as well as the injected water the generation of these large amounts of produced water represents a major environmental and economic challenge to the oil and gas industry although many studies have attempted addressing this challenge there has not been any significant development in the treatment of produced water and most of these studies have achieved limited success this work introduces a novel electrocoagulation cell for the treatment of produced water with the aim of reducing electrode passivation which has always been considered as a bottleneck in the electrochemical treatment of contaminated water the main goal of the study is to develop an effective perforated electrode design that can reduce cathode passivation and consequently reduce energy consumption the novel cell design has been tested and optimized for the treatment of produced water to reduce the concentration of the major organic contaminants in the water the contaminants reduction efficiency of the proposed design was evaluated and benchmarked with multiple cell configurations the perforated electrode was superior to other configurations and effective in mitigating passivation reducing the energy consumption by about 70 compared to the typical plate electrode the cell performance was optimized using response surface methodology and then operated continuously to evaluate the electrocoagulation efficiency the new cell design achieved a steadystate reduction of the organic contaminants in the produced water by up to 97 98 and 95 for toc tph and o g respectively keywords produced water power consumption cathode passivation water treatment cell design 1 introduction produced water pw is often characterized by a very complex composition that usually depends on the source and the type of oil or gas field in general most types of produced water contain considerable amounts of oil and other dissolved organic compounds as well as high tds concentration 1 conventional techniques such as alkaline chemical precipitation by lime addition adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration and coagulation flocculation have been broadly reported in the literature to treat the produced water 2 of these conventional methods coagulation flocculation has major advantages over other methods of wastewater treatment including sufficient performance in dealing with turbidity inorganic pathogens and reduction of organic matter cost effectiveness and low energy consumption 3 5 electrocoagulation ec is a process at which coagulants are electrochemically introduced to remove the aforementioned contaminants the basic ec unit typically consists of a cell with an anode and cathode metal electrodes connected externally by a dc power supply and immersed in the contaminated water aluminum and iron are the most widely used electrodes material for the ec process since they are readily available non toxic and confirmed to have an excellent performance by numerous investigations in the literature 6 ec has several advantages such as being relatively inexpensive compact and versatile which makes it capable of treating a wide range of industrial wastewater and effluents 7 8 these advantages stem from the nature of the process as it does not use coagulant chemicals but instead the consumable aluminum or iron electrodes dissolve in the solution producing ions the released ions can neutralize the charge of the contaminant by the coagulation mechanism the ec mechanism is thoroughly discussed in the literature 6 9 the flocs formed can then be separated by the means of sedimentation or flotation the use of ec to treat pw had received little attention in the literature 10 its utilization has been mostly limited to being used as a pretreatment step integrated with a membrane unit da silva et al 11 studied the electrochemical treatment of produced water through anodic oxidation using ti iro2 ta2o5 and bdd electrodes the authors investigated various operating parameters such as temperature ph conductivity current density total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod as well as energy consumption and cost they also compared the performance using the two electrodes the authors concluded that the cost associated with anodic oxidation using these types of electrodes is usually very high and the process may not be practical for large applications zhu et al 12 investigated the use of ec to pretreat pw from an oilfield the study examined the effect of current density electrode gap and operating time on the performance of the process by measuring the reduction in cod reporting an optimum current density of 40 ma cm2 al malack and al nowaiser 13 combined electrocoagulation with a membrane bioreactor to treat synthetic hypersaline water using steel and aluminum electrodes at different current densities they reported that the aluminum electrode had better cod removal efficiency similarly sardari et al 14 combined ec with membrane distillation to treat high salinity produced water the ec process was effective in reducing more than 90 of the total suspended solids and turbidity while achieving a 60 reduction in toc the full potential of the ec process cannot be fully harnessed without mitigating a major concern cathode passivation passivation is the formation of an inhibiting layer on the cathode which usually consists of oxides 15 this passive layer reduces the direct contact of the cathode with the solution which translates into more resistance between the electrodes hence more power consumption cathode passivation has been observed by numerous authors treating different types of wastewater using ec 15 20 several passivation reduction techniques have been investigated in the literature including the use of ultrasonic waves 17 alternating pulsed current 21 electrode polarity reversal 22 and adding chloride ions to the solution 15 enhancing the electrode design to mitigate the passivation is uncharted territory that to the best of authors knowledge has not been reported in the literature although several modifications to ec cell design have been investigated in the literature 23 25 none of them reported the effect of their design on passivation in this work novel perforated electrode design is investigated to treat pw and its effect on preventing the passivation is examined the aim of this study is to mitigate passivation in ec by evaluating the new electrode design and optimize the different ec process conditions 2 materials methods 2 1 experimental setup in this work a novel ec cell design is tested the new cell design fig 1 was fabricated at qatar university the setup consists of three 1 8 l cylindrical plexiglas vessels for the feed tank reactor cell and settling tank the electrodes were made of iron and aluminum commercial grade with different geometries and same anode surface area 84 cm2 for each metal electrode three different configurations were fabricated for the sake of comparison plate electrodes cylindrical electrodes and perforated hollow cylindrical electrodes for the perforated cylindrical electrode the height of the exposed surface is adjusted to give the same surface area an air compressor was used to supply air at a flowrate of 7 l min 15 scfh for mixing and or cleaning the electrodes in the case of perforated hollow cylindrical electrodes the air was injected from the top of the electrode and allowed to diffuse through the perforation forming small air jets around the surface of the electrode where it is intended to act as a passivation prevention mechanism a rigol dc power supply was externally connected to the electrodes with adjustable current input the system was tested and optimized in a batch mode of operation for 30 min and then operated continuously at the optimum conditions for 90 min the reduction in contaminants concentration is based on percent reduction before c o and after the treatment c f reduction c o c f c o 100 2 2 synthetic produced water preparation synthetic produced water samples were prepared and used for experimentation produced water in general has similar constituents to those of seawater with different concentrations however produced water is usually more saline and more contaminated than seawater 6 therefore using seawater was preferred over synthetizing produced water from deionized water and chemical additives as the latter method usually excludes trace elements that exist in both seawater and real produced water the collected seawater had a conductivity ranging between 40 45 μs cm the seawater was evaporated to increase its salinity and conductivity to be within the desired value a commercial crude oil with a density of 900 kg m3 was then added slowly and mixed using a high speed homogenizer for 15 min 2 3 material characterization a standard usa epa method method 1664 a was used for oil and grease o g analysis and a standard usa epa non halogenated organics using gas chromatography flame ionized detector gc fid 8015 c modified was used for the analysis of the total petroleum hydrocarbons tph samples were analyzed for total organic carbon toc using toc l csh equipment supplied by shimadzu corporation ysi ecosense ph100 ph meter was used for ph measurements ysi ecosense ec 300 conductivity meter was used for conductivity and total dissolved solids tds measurements rigaku miniflexii desktop x ray diffractometer was used for sludge characterization the characteristics of the synthetic produced water used for this work is shown in table 1 2 4 screening experiments several screening experiments were conducted to determine the best electrode material and geometry a electrode material selection basic plate aluminum and iron electrodes were used to perform batch ec experiments at fixed conditions of 15 ma cm2 current density 7 l min of air flowrate and a duration of 30 min the treated water was then analyzed for toc tph and o g b electrode geometry selection for the selected electrode material plate cylindrical and perforated cylindrical electrodes were tested for ec experiments fig 2 the treated samples were analyzed for the same parameters as before to evaluate the effect of different geometries on contaminants removal five different electrode geometries combination have been tested 1 plate electrode 2 non perforated cylindrical electrodes npr 3 perforated cylindrical electrodes pr 4 perforated anode and non perforated cathode cylindrical electrodes pr a 5 perforated cathode and non perforated anode cylindrical electrodes pr c 2 5 response surface methodology to achieve the best performance of the selected electrode geometry the operating parameters were optimized using response surface methodology rsm rsm is among the most widely used techniques in the literature it is a combination of mathematical and statistical techniques to describe the behavior of the experimental data capturing all the nonlinear intricacies between the independent variables and system outputs rsm technique adhere to a systematic approach that organizes the way experiments are conducted which is known as design of experiments doe doe as the name suggests involves developing and executing a fixed number of experiments in specific order to measure how the independent variables are affecting the system response the main premise behind this approach is to maximize the information that can be extracted from conducting a minimum number of experiments 26 2 6 continuous operation after selecting the best electrode material and geometry the system was run in a continuous mode of operation at a water flowrate of 60 ml min this step is essential to examine the effect of electrode material and geometry on cathode passivation for extended periods 3 results discussion 3 1 effect of electrode material on contaminants reduction contaminants reduction is used as benchmarking criteria for selecting which electrode material to be chosen as the main material iron and aluminum plate electrodes 3 cm x 14 cm have been tested in the ec screening experiments all treated water samples were analyzed for toc o g and tph the samples were allowed to settle completely before the analysis and only the clear layer was analyzed fig 3 illustrates that aluminum electrodes are more effective compared to iron electrodes both electrodes achieved good removal of all contaminants and the results were similar with aluminum achieving the best results hence aluminum electrodes were chosen as the main electrode material in addition based on faraday s law the erosion rate of iron is higher than that of aluminum which translates into more electrode consumption at a fixed treatment time also aluminum electrodes are preferred as iron electrodes turn the watercolor into a yellowish color due to the formation of iron rust and the color doesn t change even after the sample is allowed to settle down which makes it harder to observe the settling behavior of the samples moreover aluminum electrodes were easier to clean using sand filter compared to iron electrodes which corrode heavily after each run therefore aluminum was selected as the optimum electrode material 3 2 effect of electrode geometry 3 2 1 contaminants reduction after selecting aluminum as the electrode material the next step was to decide on the aluminum electrode geometry four experiments were conducted using non perforated cylindrical electrodes anode and cathode al npr perforated cylindrical electrodes anode and cathode al pr perforated cylindrical anode with non perforated cylindrical cathode al pr a and non perforated cylindrical anode with a perforated cylindrical cathode al pr c all experiments were run at the same operating conditions as the screening experiments for the sake of comparing the performance of the different geometries the treated water samples were also analyzed for toc o g and tph and the results are illustrated in fig 4 the figure shows that out of the five electrode geometries aluminum plate electrodes gave the least removal which is attributed to the fact that the cylindrical geometry is expected to result in better metal ions distribution compared to plate geometry al pr a achieved better results than the plate geometry however its performance was not as good as al npr this is explained by the partial isolation of the anode due to the air jets flowing from the perforations which formed a film of air on the anode surface thus preventing anode dissolution which in turn led to reduction in ec process efficiency in the case of al npr air was supplied within the solution for mixing purposes to identify the mixing effect when it is compared to al pr the performance of al pr was slightly better than al npr showing that the air injected through the electrode does not only provide a better mixing behavior compared to solution aeration but it also reduces the chances of cathode passivation resulting in a better performance finally al pr c gave the best results since allowing the air to flow only from the cathode is expected to have better cleaning effect on the cathode surface to prevent passivation the effect of passivation on the system performance is better quantified by measuring the potential difference between the electrodes and its associated power consumption in the following section 3 2 2 passivation effect the initial and final potential difference was recorded for the five electrode geometries as illustrated in fig 5 all experiments were conducted for 30 min at the same conditions of current density of 15 ma cm2 and air flowrate of 7 l min the corresponding power consumption was calculated at the final potential using the following equation p w a t t v f i n a l v o l t i a m p the plate electrode experienced the most potential difference increase which translates into the highest power consumption among all the tested electrodes as illustrated in fig 6 this is due to the formation of a thick passive white layer as shown in fig 7 a a similar layer was formed when al pr a was tested however the potential difference increase between the electrodes was not as drastic as the plate electrode although al npr had a better contaminant removal compared to al pr a its potential difference and consequently the power consumption is higher than al pr a this can be attributed to the fact that air jets through the anode perforation reduce the ec efficiency due to partial isolation of the anode when both electrodes were perforated the potential difference was lower than the other discussed geometries and the passive layer was peeling off and not attached to the cathode surface which indicates a reduction in passivation as shown in fig 7 c the al pr c had no potential increase between the electrodes indicating a considerable reduction in cathode passivation fig 6 further supports this by showing that al pr c had the least power consumption among all tested geometries this minimum passivation effect is further illustrated by fig 7 d al pr c as it shows that the cathode surface was relatively clean with minimum scale formation as compared to the other electrodes therefore perforated cathode and non perforated anode were selected as the best electrode geometry and the next step is to test it in continuous operation mode 4 optimization minitab 17 0 software was used to perform rsm and central composite design ccd was selected as the doe of choice with three continuous factors current density air flowrate and ph of the water for each parameter minimum and maximum values are decided at which an optimum is expected to exist table 2 shows the range of each parameter for which a set of 20 experiments are generated by ccd it is worth noting that ccd design dictates the repetition of 5 experiments at the central conditions the range of the experimental parameters was determined based on several screening experiments it is also worth mentioning that at a ph higher than 7 concentrated sodium hydroxide solution was carefully introduced to the pw dropwise it was noticed that the ph of the solution initially increases rapidly by adding naoh until the ph is around 9 when trying to increase the ph beyond that value the solution acted as a buffer consuming considerable amounts of naoh without a change in ph as more naoh is added and the desired ph is reached 10 12 it was noticed that the solution became very viscous this behavior can be attributed to the fact that mixing oil with sodium hydroxide led to soap formation saponification process nonetheless ec screening experiments were conducted at this high ph and contaminant concentration before and after the treatment was unchanged which proves that electrocoagulation was not effective at these conditions therefore high ph was eliminated from the range of the experiments the responses for the experiments were the same as for the previous experiments toc o g and tph reduction after running and analyzing these experiments the optimum operating conditions were determined to be a current density of 17 ma cm2 an air flow rate of 7 3 l min and a ph of 6 table 2 at these conditions the reduction of toc tph and o g reached up to 96 8 97 9 and 94 6 respectively three dimensional surface plots were generated to describe the behavior of the three experimental parameters at the optimum conditions as shown in figs 8 10 the current density and the air flow rate seem to have the highest impact on the performance of the ec cell while ph had a minimum effect within the studied range it is important to note that the initial ph was controlled at a fixed value for each experiment ranging from 4 7 during the experiment the ph was not controlled and it did not change much hence the final ph was not forced to reach a certain value 4 1 continuous operation the last step of this study was to operate the system in a continuous mode at the optimum conditions and observe the effect of the perforated electrode design on reducing cathode passivation since operating the system in a batch mode for 30 min gave excellent results the residence time was selected as 30 min and the water flowrate was set at 60 ml min the continuous experiment was run for 90 min and samples were taken every 10 min from the reactor outlet the samples were analyzed for toc and the removal percent was plotted against time to determine the time taken to reach steady state fig 11 it shows that steady state is reached after 20 min of operation where the removal percent was almost constant for the remaining 70 min achieving 97 toc reduction the potential and power consumption for al pr c was also evaluated in the continuous mode fig 12 shows a steady potential of the electrode geometry throughout the 90 min of operation hence the new electrode design was effective in reducing passivation and hence minimizing its effect on ec performance fig 13 further solidifies the power consumption and potential results by showing that the cathode was slightly passivated after the entire period of operation and the passive layer was peeling off easily and not attached to the cathode surface overall the performance of ec using al pr c in the continuous mode was effective in minimizing passivation 5 conclusions this study focused on designing a new electrode that would overcome cathode passivation a major limitation of electrocoagulation technology regardless of the operating conditions a perforated hollow cylindrical cathode was used with compressed air allowed to flow from cathode perforations to clean the electrode and provide sufficient mixing the new electrode design was tested for treating synthetic produced water and the results were compared to basic electrocoagulation setups with plate electrodes the novel ec cell was found to be more efficient in treating produced water and minimizing cathode passivation to optimize the performance rsm was used and the optimum operating conditions were obtained the system was then run at optimum conditions in a continuous mode of operation and the cathode passivation was monitored it was observed that cathode passivation was minimized significantly and the system performance was stable even with continuous operation for 90 min in conclusion this study produced a novel reactor design that proved to be effective in treating produced water and showed enhanced performance compared to a simple electrocoagulation electrode especially in mitigating passivation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

in the continuous mode fig 12 shows a steady potential of the electrode geometry throughout the 90 min of operation hence the new electrode design was effective in reducing passivation and hence minimizing its effect on ec performance fig 13 further solidifies the power consumption and potential results by showing that the cathode was slightly passivated after the entire period of operation and the passive layer was peeling off easily and not attached to the cathode surface overall the performance of ec using al pr c in the continuous mode was effective in minimizing passivation 5 conclusions this study focused on designing a new electrode that would overcome cathode passivation a major limitation of electrocoagulation technology regardless of the operating conditions a perforated hollow cylindrical cathode was used with compressed air allowed to flow from cathode perforations to clean the electrode and provide sufficient mixing the new electrode design was tested for treating synthetic produced water and the results were compared to basic electrocoagulation setups with plate electrodes the novel ec cell was found to be more efficient in treating produced water and minimizing cathode passivation to optimize the performance rsm was used and the optimum operating conditions were obtained the system was then run at optimum conditions in a continuous mode of operation and the cathode passivation was monitored it was observed that cathode passivation was minimized significantly and the system performance was stable even with continuous operation for 90 min in conclusion this study produced a novel reactor design that proved to be effective in treating produced water and showed enhanced performance compared to a simple electrocoagulation electrode

14196,the bivo4 wo3 nano composite nc was synthesized characterized by the x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscope sem diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs and the photoluminescence spectroscopy pl transmission electron microscope tem electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cyclic voltammetry cv and n2 adsorption desorption for the bet surface area determination and used in the photodegradation of sulfasalazine sfsz aqueous solution band gap energy and potential positions of the conduction and valence bands of the semiconductors were estimated the composite with a mole ratio of 1 4 of bivo4 wo3 showed the best photodegradation efficiency under visible light irradiation the results confirmed a relatively smaller mineralization extent for sfsz molecules than its photodegradation extent the kinetic results showed k values of 0 041 min 1 and 0 022 min 1 for the degradation and mineralization extents of sfsz molecules that correspond to t1 2 values of 17 1 and 31 5 min respectively confirming that photodegradation extent of sfsz is about 1 85 times greater than its mineralization extent effects of the scavenging agents were studied and the results showed superoxide radicals the photogenerated holes oh radicals and the photogenerated electrons have the important roles in sfsz photodegradation respectively among the type ii heterojunction and z scheme mechanisms the latter case had the most important role in the photodegradation of sfsz keywords bivo4 wo3 kinetic degradation pathway z scheme and cascade reactions sulfasalazine 1 introduction due to the increased pollution of the aquatic environment the development of novel cleaning techniques has adopted the highest attention by the environmental chemists engineers in recent decades the heterogeneous photocatalysis based on semiconducting materials has been widely used for the photodegradation and mineralization of different organic inorganic pollutants in water wastewater samples in this strategy the irradiated semiconductor produces the photogenerated electrons and holes e h in the conduction band cb and the valence band vb the photogenerated e h pairs react with dissolved oxygen and water molecules and produce super oxide and hydroxyl radicals respectively thus four reactive species of e h pairs and the superoxide and hydroxyl radicals can attack to the pollutants present in media and break them into smaller fragments and finally mineralize them into water and carbon dioxide molecules 1 10 before the photogenerated e h pairs can reach to the surface of the semiconductor they may recombine and thus consume the used energy as heat this drawback of the semiconducting based photocatalysis diminishes its efficacy and increases the cost of the method so far different alternatives have been used to decrease the e h recombination in this effective removal method of water pollutants one alternative is decreasing the path length for rapid reaching of the e h pairs at the surface of the semiconductor catalyst use of nano dimension for the catalyst helps us to decrease the path length in addition nano materials have a high effective surface area that causes to occur a higher and faster reaction on their surface 11 15 another strategy is supporting of a semiconductor onto a suitable support this can prevent from aggregation of particles that in turn causes to decrease in the path length and increase in the effective surface area by dispersion of a thin layer of the used semiconductor on the surface of the support 16 19 if the support includes an internal electric field this helps to a faster e h separation in the supported excited semiconductors in this regard zeolitic supports have been widely used 20 24 the third alternative is doping of metal or non metal dopants into the subjected semiconductor in this method the used dopant adds novel vb and cb levels into the system that can participate with those of the excited semiconductor in charge carriers e h pairs transfer 25 28 another strategy which is also used in the present work is the coupling of two or more semiconductors and creating a novel composite or a hetero structure hetero junction system at which charge carriers transfer between the vb and cb energy levels of the coupled semiconductors elongates the lifetime of the photogenerated e h pairs in this strategy well matching between the standard potentials of the vb and cb energy levels of the coupled semiconductors plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of the system because in such systems charge carriers separation occurs via an internal reduction oxidation process 29 34 in this work bivo4 wo3 nanocomposite was constructed by coupling of the n type bivo4 and the p type wo3 semiconductors the cb and vb levels of bivo4 have potential positions of 0 11 v and 2 65 v vs nhe respectively which are suitable for coupling with wo3 because its mentioned energy levels have potential positions of 0 5 v and 3 3 v vs nhe respectively 35 36 these matched potentials are suitable for rapid charge separation between the semiconductors the composite showed a boosted activity in the photodegradation of

1 1 xrd results fig 1 shows x ray diffraction peaks of the as prepared bivo4 wo3 nc based on the literature 35 the monoclinic crystalline phase of bivo4 has been appeared in the xrd peaks positioned at 2θ values of 16 67 101 18 98 011 28 95 121 30 52 040 34 49 200 35 21 002 38 211 39 77 150 42 5 231 45 240 49 8 024 53 161 57 321 and 59 7 123 according to standard jcpds card no 14 0688 the cubic crystalline phase of wo3 has also been characterized by xrd peaks located at 2θ values of 23 6 28 6 33 6 and 50 2 according to standard jcpds file no 46 1096 these peaks have respectively indexed to hkl planes of 001 210 201 and 102 36 when the present xrd pattern was comprised of these standard files good agreement was observed and hence the corresponding hkl planes were assigned to corresponding peaks this comparison confirms that bivo4 and wo3 were synthesized successfully to estimate the crystallite size of the used nc the scherer equation d k λ β cos θ was used in which d is the crystallite size λ the x ray wavelength θ the bragg angle k the scherrer constant 0 9 and β the width of the peak full width at half maximum fwhm 41 all data used in this calculation are summarized in sdt2 in supplementary data file the average crystallite size of 27 3 11 5 nm was obtained 3 1 2 sem and tem images of the composite fig 2 a c shows typical sem images recorded to study the morphology and size distribution of the composite image j software was applied on image c and size distribution was estimated as obvious most of the particles have nano dimension in the prepared composite some plate like species and some dispersed nano crystals with irregular morphology in many cases with cubic structure are present in image the plate like crystals belong to bivo4 as reported in literature that formed by assembling of intertwined platelets radiating in all directions 42 fig 3 shows some tem images of the bivo4 wo3 composite some nano flakes are present in the images which belong to bivo4 wo3 nanoparticles were regularly dispersed on the surface of these nano flakes the images confirm nano dimension for the composite 3 1 3 optical absorption properties absorption spectra of the composite in fig 4 a was obtained in the study of the samples by uv vis drs spectroscopy in the case of wo3 two absorption edges were observed that confirms the presence of more crystallite phase in its structure 43 this property was also remained when wo3 formed the composite absorption edges were estimated by extrapolation of the downward segment to cross the x axis the obtained absorption wavelengths were substituted in the following equation to estimate the band gap eg energies of the samples 44 1 eg ev hc λ 1240 λ nm the obtained band gaps were then used for the calculation of the potential positions of cb and vb energy levels of the semiconductors in the composite all data and obtained values are summarized in tables 1 and 2 as shown a red shift in the eg value of the composite was observed with respect to wo3 while it showed a blue shift with respect to bivo4 sample on the other hand the formation of the composite enhanced optical properties of wo3 we used the electronegativity of the semiconductors the energy of free electrons relative to the normal hydrogen electrode ee 4 5 ev and the band gap energy of the semiconductor eg for the calculation of the vb edge potential evb of the semiconductor by using the following equation the term x is the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms of the semiconductor 45 47 2 evb x ee 0 5 eg the electronegativity values of the semiconductors can be determined by the half value of the summation of the first ionization energy ei and the electron affinity ea values of the elements 48 the results are summarized in table 1 the obtained value for evb was then used for the calculation of ecb by using the ecb evb eg formula 49 the obtained results are collected in table 2 based on the obtained results the schematic energy diagrams were constructed to show the charge carriers transfer in the prepared composite and also to illustrate its boosted photocatalytic activity which of results will illustrate in the next sections 3 1 4 photoluminescence fig 4b shows that when bivo4 and wo3 semiconductors constructed a nano composite the pl intensity was significantly decreased pl intensity depends on the e h recombination rate in the photo excited system thus a slower rate of the e h recombination causes a weaker pl intensity the results confirm that a weaker e h recombination process occurred in the composite fig 4c shows that pl intensity of the resulted bivo4 wo3 composites depends on the mole ratio of their ingredients the results showed that the lowest pl intensity was observed when the moles of wo3 is four times greater than that of bivo4 hence the slowest e h recombination happened for this composite that elongated the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes thus we would expect the highest photocatalytic activity for this composite which of the results will discuss in the next sections 3 1 5 surface texture properties of the samples the bet brunauer emmett teller surface area of the as synthesized materials was studied and the corresponding nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms are shown in fig 5 a the data were subjected to the bet equation and sbet was determined see table 3 the increased specific surface area for the as synthesized nano composite provides more active sites for charge carriers transfer for it this in turn causes an enhanced photocatalytic activity for it compared with the mono component systems 50 based on literature 51 the bet surface area of wo3 nano plates is higher than that of wo3 nano rods because the especial geometric shape created more edges and faces in nano plates the particles with smaller pores also have a larger effective surface area the surface area depends also on the porosity of the particles the number of pores on one gram of the particles in some cases a particle with very small pores may having a small number of pores and hence a small specific surface area 52 3 1 6 cyclic voltammograms cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis to comprise the charge transfer ability of the single wo3 and bivo4 semiconductors with that of the resulted composite the cvs of the modified carbon paste electrodes cpe by the samples were recorded in hcl supporting electrolyte which of results are shown in fig 5b the voltammgram of the raw cpe showed no considerable peak current confirming that protons of supporting electrolyte could not be reduced at the electrode surface and no other reactive species were present at the electrode surface for the modified cpe with bivo4 by scanning potential towards more negative values a sharp cathodic peak was appeared at about 308 mv with a peak current of 100 ma this peak may relate to the reduction of vo4 3 or bi iii ingredients of the electrode eo bi iii bi 0 31 v vo2 vo2 1 v vo2 v3 0337 v v3 v2 0 255 v v2 v 1 125 v in the anodic scan two anodic peaks were appeared at about 28 mv ip 40 ma and 246 mv ip 5 ma in the case of wo3 cpe electrode a broad cathodic peak was appeared at about 274 mv ip 60 ma while the anodic peak was appeared at about 32 mv ip 45 ma in the case of modified cpe with the composite cathodic peaks were appeared at 305 570 and 733 mv with a total peak current of 120 ma while anodic peaks appeared at 17 mv ip 500 ma and 550 mv comparing the results show the highest peak current for the modified electrode with the composite we illustrate this increased peak current as follows as shown in the z scheme see fig 8 cb bivo4 energy level has a more negative eo value 0 45 v than that of wo3 0 84 v hence when arrived electrons in the forward scan occupied cb bivo4 energy level an internal oxidation reduction reaction may occur between the cb levels of two semiconductors and the arrived electrons in cb bivo4 energy level transfer to the cb wo3 energy level thus some w species with a lower oxidation states may be formed that could be reduced at more negative potentials thus some reduction peaks appeared in the forward scan eo wo3 w 0 09 v wo3 wo2 0036 v wo2 w 0 12 v in the anodic scan the electrons accumulated in the cb bivo4 level as the homo level can be exited from the electrode as anode thus the accumulated electrons in w species could immigrate to the cb bivo4 level and exit from this level thus a sharp anodic peak was appeared these processes resulted in increased peak currents for the modified electrode with the composite which confirm a better charge carrier transfer for the composite similar results were reported in our previous work for the modified cpe by zns sns2 clinoptilolite 53 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was also used for comparing the charge transfer ability of the samples for this goal the above mentioned modified electrodes were subjected to eis experiments the resulted nyquist plots are shown in fig 5c generally a smaller arc radius in the nyquist plots shows that the related electrode has a smaller electrical resistivity hence a higher charge transfer ability would be expected for the electrode 54 58 well discussion on eis spectra and the resulted bodes plots is present in our previous work 59 here the following trend was obtained for the arc radius of the nyquist plots confirming a better charge transfer ability for the composite bivo4 cpe wo3 cpe bivo4 wo3 cpe 3 2 photocatalytic studies 3 2 1 effects of bivo4 wo3 composite effects of the surface adsorption direct photolysis and photodegradation catalysis were studied at initial steps of the work and the obtained uv visible absorption spectra of sfsz solutions during these experiments are shown in fig 6 a surface adsorption removed about 9 of sfsz molecules after 10 min and reached to 11 after 40 min hence before the photodegradation process all suspensions were shaken at dark for 10 min to achieve an equilibrated adsorption desorption process in the photodegradation process no considerable sfsz removal was obtained by individual wo3 or bivo4 semiconductor while when they formed the wo3 bivo4 nc a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved this boosted effect of the composite is due to the higher charge carriers separation in the composite which will discuss in more detail in the next sections after observing this boosted photocatalytic effect the mole ratio of composite was changed and change in the photocatalytic activity was followed as shown in fig 6b the composite with a mole ratio of 4 1 for bivo4 wo3 showed the best photocatalytic activity regarding the z scheme diagram in fig 8 and this optimum mole ratio value it would be expected that the rate limiting step in the process is e h recombination process thus when the moles of bivo4 is four times greater than that of wo3 the photogenerated electrons in cb wo3 can rapidly immigrate to vb bivo4 and finally to cb bivo4 please see section 3 2 3 3 2 2 kinetic aspects and mineralization studies generally the following equations illustrate the kinetics of an adsorption process that can also use for the catalytic processes because such processes depend on the adsorption of the reactants products onto the surface of the catalyst 3 dc dt k1 1 exp k2c k3 co c k2c k2c k3 co c 4 dc dt k1 1 exp k2 co c co kc 5 ln c co kt or ct coe kt eq 3 is the grotthus drapers law that relates to the beer lambert law and use when both the pollutant and its degradation intermediates can absorb the reached photons the terms k1 k2 and k3 show the rate constant the absorption coefficients of the pollutant and the products respectively 60 61 in a process involved the products absorption free k3 is about zero at a high concentrated solution the process obeys from a zero order reaction rate eq 4 shows the corrected form of eq 3 for a special case at which the photodegradation products absorb a similar spectrum with the reactant k3 is likely equal with k2 this special case is called the pseudo first order reaction rate not a first order one and hence the term k shows the pseudo first order reaction rate constant 60 62 finally eq 5 shows the hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction rate model that is the integration form of eq 4 61 63 65 in this study some photodegradation experiments were done at different irradiation times the conditions selected to perform these experiments were obtained by preliminary experimental design runs done for the study the simultaneous interactions between the variable which of results will submit as the second part of this work absorbance of the cleaned solutions was recorded by uv vis spectrophotometer and the solutions were then subjected to cod chemical oxygen demand analysis to estimate the mineralization extent of sfsz molecules fig 7 a as we know cod analysis is a measure of the required oxygen for the oxidation of organic matters present in solution hence it is a measure of water pollution and a smaller cod value means a lower pollution for the investigated sample 66 by using the obtained results the photodegradation extent of sfsz together with its mineralization extent were calculated by uv vis spectrophotometric and cod results respectively and the results are summarized in table 4 the kinetics aspect of the process was also studied by these results which of results are shown in fig 7b c the results in table 4 confirm that the mineralization of sfsz molecules at the applied conditions is relatively smaller than its photodegradation extent the kinetic results show k values of 0 041 min 1 and 0 022 min 1 for the degradation and mineralization extents of sfsz molecules respectively the values correspond to t1 2 values of 17 1 and 31 5 min based on t1 2 0 693 k respectively these confirm that the photodegradation of sfsz is about 1 85 times greater than its mineralization this shows that some intermediates may be formed during the photodegradation process that may have a higher stability and hence resist to further broking at shorter times no attempts done to detect the degradation intermediates in this state 3 2 3 effect of scavengers generally in heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions the reactive species of o2 h superoxide radicals and oh are known as the main species that can react with organic pollutants and break them into smaller fragments to elucidate the importance role of these species several types of scavengers including agno3 ag 2 propanol 2 proh formic acid fa and ascorbic acid aa were used as the scavengers of the electron e hydroxyl radicals oh holes h and superoxide ion radicals o2 respectively the obtained results are shown in fig 8 as shown by the results compared with the photodegradation extent of sfsz by the bivo4 wo3 nc in the absence of any scavenger its degradation extent over the bivo4 wo3 nc was diminished after the addition of ag i fa and 2 proh as the scavenging agents in the absence of the scavengers 80 of sfsz molecules were degraded by the photocatalyst that decreased to 35 12 5 and 4 2 in the presence of 200 mm ag i 2 proh and fa respectively in the similar conditions common oh scavengers are aliphatic alcohols and diols that their reaction with hydroxyl radicals produces corresponding aldehydes or ketones the reaction rate constant of 2 propanol with oh radicals is about 2 109 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 the product of the reaction is ch3 2 coh that is very weaker than oh radicals in activity it has also reported that 2 proh can be adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and act as an electron donor agent to react with the produced holes 67 68 ascorbic acid aa or h2a can trap superoxide radicals with a k value of 8 2 108 m 1 s 1 in acidic phs the product is the ascorbate free radicals ha which is a relatively non reactive radical it participates in a disproportionation reaction to produce initial h2a and dehydroascorbic acid another k value of 2 7 106 m 1 s 1 has also reported for the reaction of aa with superoxide radicals generated by xanthinexanthine oxidase system 69 at physiological ph the predominant form of aa is ha that can scavenge superoxide radicals and convert to ascorbyl radical ah after de protonation and producing ascorbyl radical anion a it could be stabilized via the electron delocalization the ha a redox system has an eo value of 0 3 v aa as same as other compounds with a high amount of oh substitution is known as a good scavenger of free radicals especially superoxide free radicals 70 71 ag cations are known as the scavengers for the photogenerated electrons this process diminishes the e h recombination process and hence the photogenerated hole gets more chance to react with water to produce more hydroxyl radicals 72 in another mechanism the reaction between silver cations and the photogenerated electrons may form a silver cluster on the surface of the composite that can act as an electron sink at a small number of the cluster the collected electrons in the sink can react with dissolved oxygen and form super oxide radicals at higher numbers and size of these clusters these may act as the bulk silver that act as silver sites for the e h recombination e ag ag ag ag e agn hence the optimum size of the cluster or optimum concentration of ag i is very important 73 formica acid is a hole scavenger that gives the hcoo anion radicals that are weaker than oh radicals in activity 74 based on the results the inhibition degree follows the order ag i fa 2 proh aa this trend confirms that the pivotal roles of the photogenerated electrons and holes and hydroxyl radicals in the photocatalytic degradation of sfsz by the used wo3 bivo4 nc 3 2 4 suggested photodegradation mechanism based on the results obtained in the study of the aforementioned scavenging agents two mechanisms of type ii heterojunction and z scheme were suggested to illustrate the photodegradation pathway occurred in this work the corresponding energy diagrams are shown in fig 8 b c based on the diagrams in the type ii heterojunction pathway the photogenerated electrons can accumulate in the cb wo3 level while the photogenerated holes in the vb bivo4 level in contrast the z scheme pathway accumulates the photogenerated electrons in the cb bivo4 level while the photogenerated holes in the vb wo3 level thus the oxidizing power of the electrons in both systems is different as same as the oxidizing power of the photogenerated holes 75 76 the oxidation potential for oxidizing sfsz molecules is about 0 75 v versus ag agcl about 0 98 v versus she 24 53 68 77 the oh cooh and nh substituents of the sfsz structure have much tendency to be oxidized by attacking oh radicals or other reactive species while azo and oso bonds have a much tendency to be reduced by radicals attacking based on the standard potentials all the generated radicals by the scavengers capable to reduce sfsz molecules or sfsz radicals that may be formed by the irradiated photons or during the initial photodegradation steps this degradation of sfsz molecules has a relatively low role in its degradation based on the reduced photodegradation extent in the presence of the scavenging agents except ag i this low degradation extent may be limited due to kinetic parameters different eo values were reported for o2 o2 and oh oh systems that collected in our previous work 78 based on the eo values reported in the suggested mechanisms fig 8 b c although the photo generated holes in both semiconductors of the composite are capable to oxidize sfsz molecules the accumulated holes in cb wo3 are stronger oxidizing agents for this process these holes are also better oxidizing agents for the production of oh radicals the produced oh species are also capable to oxidize sfsz molecules similarly the accumulated electrons in cb bivo4 are stronger reducing agents to reduce sfsz molecules than that accumulated in cb wo3 energy level thus the z scheme mechanism is a better pathway to illustrate the boosted photocatalytic activity of the wo3 bivo4 composite in sfsz degradation than the type ii heterojunction pathway 3 2 5 reusability of the photocatalyst fig 9 shows the results of the re usability of the bivo4 wo3 nc in the photodegradation of sfsz molecules the degradation extent of 91 after the first photodegradation run was changed to 90 88 85 79 and 67 during the second to 6th runs as shown the catalyst retained its initial activity during the 5th run and no significant decrease in its activity was obtained during the 6th run 4 conclusions the mechanically prepared bivo4 wo3 nc showed a synergistic photocatalytic effect in the degradation of sfsz with respect to the single systems this effect relates to its lower e h recombination of the composite that confirmed by pl results so the lower pl intensity was observed by the composite the scavenging agents showed the superoxide and the photogenerated holes had the most important roles in sfsz degradation and the oh radicals had the next importance because the addition of aa fa and 2 proh caused to decrease in the photodegradation efficiency the photo generated holes in both semiconductors of the composite are capable to oxidize sfsz molecules and they have also a vital role in sfsz photodegradation because of a significant decrease in the degradation efficiency was obtained in the presence of fa as a hole scavenger oh radicals can also oxidize sfsz molecules and their role is also high in the process because adding 2 proh as an oh radical scavenger that significantly decreased sfsz degradation the results confirm that in the applied conditions oxidation of sfsz molecule has an important role in its degradation with respect to its reduction process among the photogenerated electrons the electrons in the cb bivo4 level have an important role in the photogeneration of super oxide radicals the z scheme mechanism accumulates more electrons in cb bivo4 level and hence generates more super oxide radicals based on the results the z scheme mechanism has an important role in the photodegradation of sfsz by the composite with respect to the type ii heterojunction mechanism declaration of

photodegradation extent the kinetic results showed k values of 0 041 min 1 and 0 022 min 1 for the degradation and mineralization extents of sfsz molecules that correspond to t1 2 values of 17 1 and 31 5 min respectively confirming that photodegradation extent of sfsz is about 1 85 times greater than its mineralization extent effects of the scavenging agents were studied and the results showed superoxide radicals the photogenerated holes oh radicals and the photogenerated electrons have the important roles in sfsz photodegradation respectively among the type ii heterojunction and z scheme mechanisms the latter case had the most important role in the photodegradation of sfsz keywords bivo4 wo3 kinetic degradation pathway z scheme and cascade reactions sulfasalazine 1 introduction due to the increased pollution of the aquatic environment the development of novel cleaning techniques has adopted the highest attention by the environmental chemists engineers in recent decades the heterogeneous photocatalysis based on semiconducting materials has been widely used for the photodegradation and mineralization of different organic inorganic pollutants in water wastewater samples in this strategy the irradiated semiconductor produces the photogenerated electrons and holes e h in the conduction band cb and the valence band vb the photogenerated e h pairs react with dissolved oxygen and water molecules and produce super oxide and hydroxyl radicals respectively thus four reactive species of e h pairs and the superoxide and hydroxyl radicals can attack to the pollutants present in media and break them into smaller fragments and finally mineralize them into water and carbon dioxide molecules 1 10 before the photogenerated e h pairs can reach to the surface of the semiconductor they may recombine and thus consume the used energy as heat this drawback of the semiconducting based photocatalysis diminishes its efficacy and increases the cost of the method so far different alternatives have been used to decrease the e h recombination in this effective removal method of water pollutants one alternative is decreasing the path length for rapid reaching of the e h pairs at the surface of the semiconductor catalyst use of nano dimension for the catalyst helps us to decrease the path length in addition nano materials have a high effective surface area that causes to occur a higher and faster reaction on their surface 11 15 another strategy is supporting of a semiconductor onto a suitable support this can prevent from aggregation of particles that in turn causes to decrease in the path length and increase in the effective surface area by dispersion of a thin layer of the used semiconductor on the surface of the support 16 19 if the support includes an internal electric field this helps to a faster e h separation in the supported excited semiconductors in this regard zeolitic supports have been widely used 20 24 the third alternative is doping of metal or non metal dopants into the subjected semiconductor in this method the used dopant adds novel vb and cb levels into the system that can participate with those of the excited semiconductor in charge carriers e h pairs transfer 25 28 another strategy which is also used in the present work is the coupling of two or more semiconductors and creating a novel composite or a hetero structure hetero junction system at which charge carriers transfer between the vb and cb energy levels of the coupled semiconductors elongates the lifetime of the photogenerated e h pairs in this strategy well matching between the standard potentials of the vb and cb energy levels of the coupled semiconductors plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of the system because in such systems charge carriers separation occurs via an internal reduction oxidation process 29 34 in this work bivo4 wo3 nanocomposite was constructed by coupling of the n type bivo4 and the p type wo3 semiconductors the cb and vb levels of bivo4 have potential positions of 0 11 v and 2 65 v vs nhe respectively which are suitable for coupling with wo3 because its mentioned energy levels have potential positions of 0 5 v and 3 3 v vs nhe respectively 35 36 these matched potentials are suitable for rapid charge separation between the semiconductors the composite showed a boosted activity in the photodegradation of

1 1 xrd results fig 1 shows x ray diffraction peaks of the as prepared bivo4 wo3 nc based on the literature 35 the monoclinic crystalline phase of bivo4 has been appeared in the xrd peaks positioned at 2θ values of 16 67 101 18 98 011 28 95 121 30 52 040 34 49 200 35 21 002 38 211 39 77 150 42 5 231 45 240 49 8 024 53 161 57 321 and 59 7 123 according to standard jcpds card no 14 0688 the cubic crystalline phase of wo3 has also been characterized by xrd peaks located at 2θ values of 23 6 28 6 33 6 and 50 2 according to standard jcpds file no 46 1096 these peaks have respectively indexed to hkl planes of 001 210 201 and 102 36 when the present xrd pattern was comprised of these standard files good agreement was observed and hence the corresponding hkl planes were assigned to corresponding peaks this comparison confirms that bivo4 and wo3 were synthesized successfully to estimate the crystallite size of the used nc the scherer equation d k λ β cos θ was used in which d is the crystallite size λ the x ray wavelength θ the bragg angle k the scherrer constant 0 9 and β the width of the peak full width at half maximum fwhm 41 all data used in this calculation are summarized in sdt2 in supplementary data file the average crystallite size of 27 3 11 5 nm was obtained 3 1 2 sem and tem images of the composite fig 2 a c shows typical sem images recorded to study the morphology and size distribution of the composite image j software was applied on image c and size distribution was estimated as obvious most of the particles have nano dimension in the prepared composite some plate like species and some dispersed nano crystals with irregular morphology in many cases with cubic structure are present in image the plate like crystals belong to bivo4 as reported in literature that formed by assembling of intertwined platelets radiating in all directions 42 fig 3 shows some tem images of the bivo4 wo3 composite some nano flakes are present in the images which belong to bivo4 wo3 nanoparticles were regularly dispersed on the surface of these nano flakes the images confirm nano dimension for the composite 3 1 3 optical absorption properties absorption spectra of the composite in fig 4 a was obtained in the study of the samples by uv vis drs spectroscopy in the case of wo3 two absorption edges were observed that confirms the presence of more crystallite phase in its structure 43 this property was also remained when wo3 formed the composite absorption edges were estimated by extrapolation of the downward segment to cross the x axis the obtained absorption wavelengths were substituted in the following equation to estimate the band gap eg energies of the samples 44 1 eg ev hc λ 1240 λ nm the obtained band gaps were then used for the calculation of the potential positions of cb and vb energy levels of the semiconductors in the composite all data and obtained values are summarized in tables 1 and 2 as shown a red shift in the eg value of the composite was observed with respect to wo3 while it showed a blue shift with respect to bivo4 sample on the other hand the formation of the composite enhanced optical properties of wo3 we used the electronegativity of the semiconductors the energy of free electrons relative to the normal hydrogen electrode ee 4 5 ev and the band gap energy of the semiconductor eg for the calculation of the vb edge potential evb of the semiconductor by using the following equation the term x is the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms of the semiconductor 45 47 2 evb x ee 0 5 eg the electronegativity values of the semiconductors can be determined by the half value of the summation of the first ionization energy ei and the electron affinity ea values of the elements 48 the results are summarized in table 1 the obtained value for evb was then used for the calculation of ecb by using the ecb evb eg formula 49 the obtained results are collected in table 2 based on the obtained results the schematic energy diagrams were constructed to show the charge carriers transfer in the prepared composite and also to illustrate its boosted photocatalytic activity which of results will illustrate in the next sections 3 1 4 photoluminescence fig 4b shows that when bivo4 and wo3 semiconductors constructed a nano composite the pl intensity was significantly decreased pl intensity depends on the e h recombination rate in the photo excited system thus a slower rate of the e h recombination causes a weaker pl intensity the results confirm that a weaker e h recombination process occurred in the composite fig 4c shows that pl intensity of the resulted bivo4 wo3 composites depends on the mole ratio of their ingredients the results showed that the lowest pl intensity was observed when the moles of wo3 is four times greater than that of bivo4 hence the slowest e h recombination happened for this composite that elongated the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes thus we would expect the highest photocatalytic activity for this composite which of the results will discuss in the next sections 3 1 5 surface texture properties of the samples the bet brunauer emmett teller surface area of the as synthesized materials was studied and the corresponding nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms are shown in fig 5 a the data were subjected to the bet equation and sbet was determined see table 3 the increased specific surface area for the as synthesized nano composite provides more active sites for charge carriers transfer for it this in turn causes an enhanced photocatalytic activity for it compared with the mono component systems 50 based on literature 51 the bet surface area of wo3 nano plates is higher than that of wo3 nano rods because the especial geometric shape created more edges and faces in nano plates the particles with smaller pores also have a larger effective surface area the surface area depends also on the porosity of the particles the number of pores on one gram of the particles in some cases a particle with very small pores may having a small number of pores and hence a small specific surface area 52 3 1 6 cyclic voltammograms cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis to comprise the charge transfer ability of the single wo3 and bivo4 semiconductors with that of the resulted composite the cvs of the modified carbon paste electrodes cpe by the samples were recorded in hcl supporting electrolyte which of results are shown in fig 5b the voltammgram of the raw cpe showed no considerable peak current confirming that protons of supporting electrolyte could not be reduced at the electrode surface and no other reactive species were present at the electrode surface for the modified cpe with bivo4 by scanning potential towards more negative values a sharp cathodic peak was appeared at about 308 mv with a peak current of 100 ma this peak may relate to the reduction of vo4 3 or bi iii ingredients of the electrode eo bi iii bi 0 31 v vo2 vo2 1 v vo2 v3 0337 v v3 v2 0 255 v v2 v 1 125 v in the anodic scan two anodic peaks were appeared at about 28 mv ip 40 ma and 246 mv ip 5 ma in the case of wo3 cpe electrode a broad cathodic peak was appeared at about 274 mv ip 60 ma while the anodic peak was appeared at about 32 mv ip 45 ma in the case of modified cpe with the composite cathodic peaks were appeared at 305 570 and 733 mv with a total peak current of 120 ma while anodic peaks appeared at 17 mv ip 500 ma and 550 mv comparing the results show the highest peak current for the modified electrode with the composite we illustrate this increased peak current as follows as shown in the z scheme see fig 8 cb bivo4 energy level has a more negative eo value 0 45 v than that of wo3 0 84 v hence when arrived electrons in the forward scan occupied cb bivo4 energy level an internal oxidation reduction reaction may occur between the cb levels of two semiconductors and the arrived electrons in cb bivo4 energy level transfer to the cb wo3 energy level thus some w species with a lower oxidation states may be formed that could be reduced at more negative potentials thus some reduction peaks appeared in the forward scan eo wo3 w 0 09 v wo3 wo2 0036 v wo2 w 0 12 v in the anodic scan the electrons accumulated in the cb bivo4 level as the homo level can be exited from the electrode as anode thus the accumulated electrons in w species could immigrate to the cb bivo4 level and exit from this level thus a sharp anodic peak was appeared these processes resulted in increased peak currents for the modified electrode with the composite which confirm a better charge carrier transfer for the composite similar results were reported in our previous work for the modified cpe by zns sns2 clinoptilolite 53 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was also used for comparing the charge transfer ability of the samples for this goal the above mentioned modified electrodes were subjected to eis experiments the resulted nyquist plots are shown in fig 5c generally a smaller arc radius in the nyquist plots shows that the related electrode has a smaller electrical resistivity hence a higher charge transfer ability would be expected for the electrode 54 58 well discussion on eis spectra and the resulted bodes plots is present in our previous work 59 here the following trend was obtained for the arc radius of the nyquist plots confirming a better charge transfer ability for the composite bivo4 cpe wo3 cpe bivo4 wo3 cpe 3 2 photocatalytic studies 3 2 1 effects of bivo4 wo3 composite effects of the surface adsorption direct photolysis and photodegradation catalysis were studied at initial steps of the work and the obtained uv visible absorption spectra of sfsz solutions during these experiments are shown in fig 6 a surface adsorption removed about 9 of sfsz molecules after 10 min and reached to 11 after 40 min hence before the photodegradation process all suspensions were shaken at dark for 10 min to achieve an equilibrated adsorption desorption process in the photodegradation process no considerable sfsz removal was obtained by individual wo3 or bivo4 semiconductor while when they formed the wo3 bivo4 nc a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved this boosted effect of the composite is due to the higher charge carriers separation in the composite which will discuss in more detail in the next sections after observing this boosted photocatalytic effect the mole ratio of composite was changed and change in the photocatalytic activity was followed as shown in fig 6b the composite with a mole ratio of 4 1 for bivo4 wo3 showed the best photocatalytic activity regarding the z scheme diagram in fig 8 and this optimum mole ratio value it would be expected that the rate limiting step in the process is e h recombination process thus when the moles of bivo4 is four times greater than that of wo3 the photogenerated electrons in cb wo3 can rapidly immigrate to vb bivo4 and finally to cb bivo4 please see section 3 2 3 3 2 2 kinetic aspects and mineralization studies generally the following equations illustrate the kinetics of an adsorption process that can also use for the catalytic processes because such processes depend on the adsorption of the reactants products onto the surface of the catalyst 3 dc dt k1 1 exp k2c k3 co c k2c k2c k3 co c 4 dc dt k1 1 exp k2 co c co kc 5 ln c co kt or ct coe kt eq 3 is the grotthus drapers law that relates to the beer lambert law and use when both the pollutant and its degradation intermediates can absorb the reached photons the terms k1 k2 and k3 show the rate constant the absorption coefficients of the pollutant and the products respectively 60 61 in a process involved the products absorption free k3 is about zero at a high concentrated solution the process obeys from a zero order reaction rate eq 4 shows the corrected form of eq 3 for a special case at which the photodegradation products absorb a similar spectrum with the reactant k3 is likely equal with k2 this special case is called the pseudo first order reaction rate not a first order one and hence the term k shows the pseudo first order reaction rate constant 60 62 finally eq 5 shows the hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction rate model that is the integration form of eq 4 61 63 65 in this study some photodegradation experiments were done at different irradiation times the conditions selected to perform these experiments were obtained by preliminary experimental design runs done for the study the simultaneous interactions between the variable which of results will submit as the second part of this work absorbance of the cleaned solutions was recorded by uv vis spectrophotometer and the solutions were then subjected to cod chemical oxygen demand analysis to estimate the mineralization extent of sfsz molecules fig 7 a as we know cod analysis is a measure of the required oxygen for the oxidation of organic matters present in solution hence it is a measure of water pollution and a smaller cod value means a lower pollution for the investigated sample 66 by using the obtained results the photodegradation extent of sfsz together with its mineralization extent were calculated by uv vis spectrophotometric and cod results respectively and the results are summarized in table 4 the kinetics aspect of the process was also studied by these results which of results are shown in fig 7b c the results in table 4 confirm that the mineralization of sfsz molecules at the applied conditions is relatively smaller than its photodegradation extent the kinetic results show k values of 0 041 min 1 and 0 022 min 1 for the degradation and mineralization extents of sfsz molecules respectively the values correspond to t1 2 values of 17 1 and 31 5 min based on t1 2 0 693 k respectively these confirm that the photodegradation of sfsz is about 1 85 times greater than its mineralization this shows that some intermediates may be formed during the photodegradation process that may have a higher stability and hence resist to further broking at shorter times no attempts done to detect the degradation intermediates in this state 3 2 3 effect of scavengers generally in heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions the reactive species of o2 h superoxide radicals and oh are known as the main species that can react with organic pollutants and break them into smaller fragments to elucidate the importance role of these species several types of scavengers including agno3 ag 2 propanol 2 proh formic acid fa and ascorbic acid aa were used as the scavengers of the electron e hydroxyl radicals oh holes h and superoxide ion radicals o2 respectively the obtained results are shown in fig 8 as shown by the results compared with the photodegradation extent of sfsz by the bivo4 wo3 nc in the absence of any scavenger its degradation extent over the bivo4 wo3 nc was diminished after the addition of ag i fa and 2 proh as the scavenging agents in the absence of the scavengers 80 of sfsz molecules were degraded by the photocatalyst that decreased to 35 12 5 and 4 2 in the presence of 200 mm ag i 2 proh and fa respectively in the similar conditions common oh scavengers are aliphatic alcohols and diols that their reaction with hydroxyl radicals produces corresponding aldehydes or ketones the reaction rate constant of 2 propanol with oh radicals is about 2 109 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 the product of the reaction is ch3 2 coh that is very weaker than oh radicals in activity it has also reported that 2 proh can be adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and act as an electron donor agent to react with the produced holes 67 68 ascorbic acid aa or h2a can trap superoxide radicals with a k value of 8 2 108 m 1 s 1 in acidic phs the product is the ascorbate free radicals ha which is a relatively non reactive radical it participates in a disproportionation reaction to produce initial h2a and dehydroascorbic acid another k value of 2 7 106 m 1 s 1 has also reported for the reaction of aa with superoxide radicals generated by xanthinexanthine oxidase system 69 at physiological ph the predominant form of aa is ha that can scavenge superoxide radicals and convert to ascorbyl radical ah after de protonation and producing ascorbyl radical anion a it could be stabilized via the electron delocalization the ha a redox system has an eo value of 0 3 v aa as same as other compounds with a high amount of oh substitution is known as a good scavenger of free radicals especially superoxide free radicals 70 71 ag cations are known as the scavengers for the photogenerated electrons this process diminishes the e h recombination process and hence the photogenerated hole gets more chance to react with water to produce more hydroxyl radicals 72 in another mechanism the reaction between silver cations and the photogenerated electrons may form a silver cluster on the surface of the composite that can act as an electron sink at a small number of the cluster the collected electrons in the sink can react with dissolved oxygen and form super oxide radicals at higher numbers and size of these clusters these may act as the bulk silver that act as silver sites for the e h recombination e ag ag ag ag e agn hence the optimum size of the cluster or optimum concentration of ag i is very important 73 formica acid is a hole scavenger that gives the hcoo anion radicals that are weaker than oh radicals in activity 74 based on the results the inhibition degree follows the order ag i fa 2 proh aa this trend confirms that the pivotal roles of the photogenerated electrons and holes and hydroxyl radicals in the photocatalytic degradation of sfsz by the used wo3 bivo4 nc 3 2 4 suggested photodegradation mechanism based on the results obtained in the study of the aforementioned scavenging agents two mechanisms of type ii heterojunction and z scheme were suggested to illustrate the photodegradation pathway occurred in this work the corresponding energy diagrams are shown in fig 8 b c based on the diagrams in the type ii heterojunction pathway the photogenerated electrons can accumulate in the cb wo3 level while the photogenerated holes in the vb bivo4 level in contrast the z scheme pathway accumulates the photogenerated electrons in the cb bivo4 level while the photogenerated holes in the vb wo3 level thus the oxidizing power of the electrons in both systems is different as same as the oxidizing power of the photogenerated holes 75 76 the oxidation potential for oxidizing sfsz molecules is about 0 75 v versus ag agcl about 0 98 v versus she 24 53 68 77 the oh cooh and nh substituents of the sfsz structure have much tendency to be oxidized by attacking oh radicals or other reactive species while azo and oso bonds have a much tendency to be reduced by radicals attacking based on the standard potentials all the generated radicals by the scavengers capable to reduce sfsz molecules or sfsz radicals that may be formed by the irradiated photons or during the initial photodegradation steps this degradation of sfsz molecules has a relatively low role in its degradation based on the reduced photodegradation extent in the presence of the scavenging agents except ag i this low degradation extent may be limited due to kinetic parameters different eo values were reported for o2 o2 and oh oh systems that collected in our previous work 78 based on the eo values reported in the suggested mechanisms fig 8 b c although the photo generated holes in both semiconductors of the composite are capable to oxidize sfsz molecules the accumulated holes in cb wo3 are stronger oxidizing agents for this process these holes are also better oxidizing agents for the production of oh radicals the produced oh species are also capable to oxidize sfsz molecules similarly the accumulated electrons in cb bivo4 are stronger reducing agents to reduce sfsz molecules than that accumulated in cb wo3 energy level thus the z scheme mechanism is a better pathway to illustrate the boosted photocatalytic activity of the wo3 bivo4 composite in sfsz degradation than the type ii heterojunction pathway 3 2 5 reusability of the photocatalyst fig 9 shows the results of the re usability of the bivo4 wo3 nc in the photodegradation of sfsz molecules the degradation extent of 91 after the first photodegradation run was changed to 90 88 85 79 and 67 during the second to 6th runs as shown the catalyst retained its initial activity during the 5th run and no significant decrease in its activity was obtained during the 6th run 4 conclusions the mechanically prepared bivo4 wo3 nc showed a synergistic photocatalytic effect in the degradation of sfsz with respect to the single systems this effect relates to its lower e h recombination of the composite that confirmed by pl results so the lower pl intensity was observed by the composite the scavenging agents showed the superoxide and the photogenerated holes had the most important roles in sfsz degradation and the oh radicals had the next importance because the addition of aa fa and 2 proh caused to decrease in the photodegradation efficiency the photo generated holes in both semiconductors of the composite are capable to oxidize sfsz molecules and they have also a vital role in sfsz photodegradation because of a significant decrease in the degradation efficiency was obtained in the presence of fa as a hole scavenger oh radicals can also oxidize sfsz molecules and their role is also high in the process because adding 2 proh as an oh radical scavenger that significantly decreased sfsz degradation the results confirm that in the applied conditions oxidation of sfsz molecule has an important role in its degradation with respect to its reduction process among the photogenerated electrons the electrons in the cb bivo4 level have an important role in the photogeneration of super oxide radicals the z scheme mechanism accumulates more electrons in cb bivo4 level and hence generates more super oxide radicals based on the results the z scheme mechanism has an important role in the photodegradation of sfsz by the composite with respect to the type ii heterojunction mechanism declaration of

14197,this research aims to promote photocatalysis of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in water two reactor setups with i modified air clad optical fibres and ii waterproof led strips were utilised to transmit light to photocatalysts p25 tio2 and gold modified tio2 au tio2 the performances to photodegrade 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 and estriol e3 under cool white and uva high efficacy leds were examined au tio2 showed superior photocatalytic activity for ee2 removal over p25 tio2 the pseudo first order rate constants for ee2 photocatalysis under uva were 0 55 h 1 and 0 89 h 1 for tio2 and au tio2 respectively e3 was effectively degraded by au tio2 in the immersible led strip reactor 0 13 h 1 keywords photocatalysis optical fibre visible light au tio2 edcs 1 introduction of current global concern are the endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs exogenous chemicals that alter the functions of the endogenous hormones to cause adverse effects especially in reproductive health 1 2 to the animals and potentially human 3 4 edcs can be natural substances such as estrone e1 and estriol e3 or synthetic chemicals such as alkylphenols and 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 although their biological potency can vary by several orders of magnitude 5 it is widely reported that the effluents from the sewage treatment plants stps are one of the key sources of edcs discharges to the natural aquatic environment 4 6 7 steroidal hormones are resistant to biodegradation hence their removal by conventional stp facilities is limited 7 9 tio2 is considered an attractive advanced oxidation process due to its high photocatalytic activity under uv irradiation commercial availability non toxicity and photo stability 9 11 however only uv light which is 3 5 in the sunlight can activate pure tio2 12 13 hence the use of visible light for photocatalysis is of great interest 13 by using solar energy as the driving force hence making the process a green technology noble metals ag au pt pd ru are proved to be efficient in enhancing the uv light activity of tio2 while introducing a notable visible light response 14 15 gold is favoured due to its non toxicity stability plasmonic effect and biocompatibility 15 16 the enhanced photocatalytic performance of au tio2 compared to p25 tio2 under uva could be attributed to the fact that some electrons from tio2 conduction band cross to gold nanoparticles on the tio2 surface therefore electron hole recombination is reduced 17 on the other hand for au tio2 under visible light the electrons in au nanoparticles that gain sufficient energy to overcome the schottky barrier will cross to the conduction band of tio2 thus leading to the visible light activity of the catalyst 18 in addition localised surface plasmons can be excited in gold by visible light with a wavelength of 520 nm 19 the electrons that gain sufficient energy after being excited by localised surface plasmon resonance will flow to tio2 thereby enabling photocatalysis photocatalysis studies in water treatment normally use a light source located outside of the reactors this results in significant loss of transmitted light before reaching the photocatalysts thus limiting activity to the surface layer of the slurry 20 21 there is therefore a motivation to develop a more energy efficient light transmission method to enhance photocatalysis performance nowadays led lights are becoming very popular in different applications as they have many advantages over regular light sources such as high theoretical luminous efficacy and high reliability led lights also possess other outstanding characteristics including shock resistance vibration resistance and chromatic variety moreover led lights have very long lifetime 50 000 h depending on the driving technique and operating temperature and are environmentally friendly as they can be produced without mercury furthermore led lights can easily turn on and turn off which allows their use in intelligent lighting 22 here we examine the use of flexible waterproof led strips or modified air clad fibres to overcome the significant limitation of light penetration optical fibres are thin μm in diameter glass polymer fibres that are used to transmit light over long distances the propagation of light through optical fibres is based on total internal reflection that takes place at the boundary interface of two media when the light passes from a medium with high refractive index towards a medium with low refractive index if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle total internal reflection is achieved in optical fibres as the core is made of high index material covered by a material known as cladding that has low index 21 generally the optical fibre is coated with an optically inactive protective material multimode air clad fibres 23 24 have a large surface area high numerical apertures approaching 1 together with high spectral transmission which makes them attractive for low light collection 25 and suitable for carrying light underwater pure silica cores can resist photo darkening at shorter wavelengths required for photocatalysis compared to conventional doped cores which photodarken with uv exposure emission from the end of fibres alone is insufficient to activate large surface areas of the catalysts hence side emitting fibres are of particular interest 26 27 however light cannot be transmitted for long distances due to the loss of light through sides of the side emitting fibres du et al 28 reported that the relative light intensity emitted from the side was quickly attenuated in the first 10 cm of the fibre uniform side emission from fibres over longer distances 10 m has been reported 27 but most of the light in these fibres propagates in the forward direction hence resulting in only a small portion of side emission catalysts can be immobilised onto fibres 29 31 or the light emitted by the fibres can be projected onto catalysts coated on other surfaces 26 32 in addition to optical fibres leds present a cost effective method to introduce light into a reactor system immersible led strips are now commercially available and have not yet been reported as light sources in this context hence they are tested in this study for light delivery this research therefore aimed to assess the effectiveness of two new light delivery methods i e optical fibres and led strips in photocatalytic processes secondly the photodegradation of the estrogenic hormones ee2 and e3 fig a1 in supplementary material in reactors

protection against solid objects normally dust number 0 indicates no protection while number 6 means full protection against dust the second ip number stands for the protection against liquids where 0 means no protection while 7 indicates protection for immersion between 15 cm to 1 m underwater for 30 min although the aforementioned waterproof led strips can be used underwater it is recommended that they are immersed under water for limited time under the experimental conditions used here the led strip was found to remain waterproof for periods of 5 h the optical fibre thorlabs inc newton

optical microscope zeiss was used to study the cross section of the fibre before and after collapsing the air ring a zeiss supra 55 v p scanning electron microscope sem 10 kv was used to examine the

system with a binary pump and an agilent poroshell 120 ec c18 column 2 7 μm 4 6 mm 50 mm was used to detect ee2 and e3 electrospray ionisation esi technique was used to produce ions the ms was operated in negative ion mode the mobile phases included a milli q water and b methanol the flow rate was 0 35 ml min 1 and the injection volume was 1 μl the elution gradient was 95 a and 5 b for 3 min 10 a and 90 b for the next 4 min followed by 1 a and 99 b for another 2 min and 95 a and 5 b for the final 4 min ptfe syringe filters 0 20 μm were used to filter the analysts before injection 2 3 preparation of au tio catalyst and immobilisation onto glass beads an aqueous solution of tetrachloroauric acid haucl4 was prepared using the method of king et al 33 au tio2 nanoparticles were synthesised by a deposition precipitation method described by haruta 34 the detailed preparation procedures and the material characterisations of the catalysts can be found in previous work 15 to immobilise the catalysts onto glass beads the surface of the beads was first etched in 5 v v hf solutions for 30 min and washed thoroughly with ultrapure water then 50 ml of the catalyst slurry 10 mg l 1 was prepared by sonicating the catalyst powder in ultrapure water for 30 min next the glass beads were dipped into the catalyst suspension for 10 min to attain a catalyst coating the coated beads were dried at 110 c for 4 h in an oven and then transferred to a furnace for 1 h at 300 c the coating and drying cycles were repeated twice more to achieve sufficient catalyst coating finally the catalyst coated glass beads were thoroughly washed with ultrapure water to remove any loosely bonded catalyst particles 2 4 modification of the optical fibres the side emission of light from a selected length l 5 cm of the air clad fibre was achieved by collapsing the air holes at set intervals prior to collapsing the air holes the outer polymer protective coating of the fibre was removed by wiping off with paint stripper followed by cleaning with isopropyl alcohol a fitel s175 single fibre fusion splicer fig a3 in supplementary material which uses a controllable electric arc to melt the glass was used for collapsing the air cladding after optimising arc power and duration this approach was chosen due to its simplicity low cost rapidity and high reliability other approaches could be used e g a co2 laser that offers a route to inscribe longer collapsed regions 2 5 preparation of rhodamine b solution and light emission in the optical fibre light emission from the air clad fibre before and after collapsing the air rings was measured in aqueous solution of rhodamine b which absorbs uv irradiation and emits visible red light this is simply carried out by visualising the fluorescence arising from aqueous rhodamine b and capturing the images as shown in fig 1 the light intensity was measured using a power meter newport 2832c before and after collapsing the air ring the side emission intensity decreased as more air rings were collapsed with no significant side emission observed beyond four arcs under the experimental conditions therefore four arcs were chosen to obtain the optimum amount of side emission a reduction of 75 5 in the end emission intensity of the fibre was obtained when four arcs were applied 2 6 photocatalysis experiments the stock solutions of ee2 and e3 in methanol 1 0 g l 1 were prepared separately and refrigerated at 4 c with the bottles being covered in aluminium foil to avoid photodegradation the 200 μg l 1 ee2 aqueous solutions were made from a dilution of the stock for optical fibre related studies while 100 μg l 1 e3 solutions were made for led strip reactor the optical fibre reactor setup is shown in fig 2 a an acrylic column with ϕ 12 mm inner diameter and height h 55 mm was used as batch reactor the catalyst coated glass beads were placed in the reactor and the modified optical fibres were immersed into the reactor surrounded by the catalyst coated beads both ends of the fibre were hand cleaved with ceramic tiles to ensure a flat end face so that the fibre could be coupled with the led for efficient transmission of light and provide a good end emission photodegradation studies were conducted under one of the two light sources 11 w uva λ 365 nm or cool white λ 410 nm leds led engin in order to compare their performance under different light sources the emission spectrum results of the lamps uva cool white were obtained from led engin as shown fig a4 in supplementary material the light source was isolated from the reactor to ensure that the light received by the catalysts was solely transmitted through the fibre the reactor was flushed with ultrapure water prior to starting the experiments then 200 ml of ee2 solution was circulated using watson marlow peristaltic pump through the reactor under darkness to examine adsorption desorption equilibrium for 2 h the equilibrium time of 30 min was chosen since the concentrations of the target compounds did not change after 20 min ee2 samples were withdrawn at specified intervals filtered through 0 20 μm ptfe syringe filter and then analysed in uhplc ms ms the waterproof led strip reactor setup 16 mm inner diameter 300 mm height is shown in fig 2b the aqueous e3 solution 100 μg l 1 v 45 ml was filled in the reactor along with the photocatalyst 50 mg l 1 the continuous mixing of the reactor contents was ensured through air sparging a total of 15 leds 3 sections of the strip were used for photocatalysis while the unused leds in the strip were covered by aluminium foil the progress in the photodegradation of e3 was analysed using an uhplc ms ms method similar to that used for ee2 the photodegradation of ee2 and e3 was found to follow the pseudo first order kinetics when fitted to eq 1 1 ct co e kt where co μg l 1 and ct μg l 1 are ee2 or e3 concentrations at the beginning of irradiation and at a given time t h respectively k is the pseudo first order rate constant h 1 ln ct co vs t for the photodegradation of ee2 or e3 was plotted with a linear fit using originpro the half life t 1 2 h of ee2 or e3 was calculated using eq 2 2 t 1 2 ln2 k 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterisation as shown in fig 3 the structure and cross section of the air clad optical fibre before and after applying the electric arc arc power 245 arbitrary unit arc duration 50 ms are presented without air cladding the immersed silica core comes into contact with water in the reactor permitting light to escape through the sides of the fibre and illuminating the photocatalysts the photocatalysts were examined using an sem fig 4 which shows the surface morphology of spheroidal shaped tio2 catalyst particles detailed sem images of catalysts could be found in our previous work 14 the successful immobilisation of the photocatalyst onto glass beads by dip coating method is shown in fig 4c and d sem images of p25 tio2 and 4 wt au tio2 revealed that tio2 and gold doped tio2 were well attached onto glass beads indicating immobilisation happed successfully after several times of washing and applications the immobilized catalysts did not become detached from the glass beads surface indicating the sufficient stability of the glass breads immobilized catalysts furthermore uv vis spectroscopy study of the commercial catalyst p25 tio2 and synthesized gold doped titania au tio2 was reported in our previous study 14 it was observed that the absorbance wavelength of p25 tio2 is below 400 nm with regard to visible light activity gold doped tio2showed an absorption band between 500 and 600 nm 3 2 photocatalysis in optical fibre reactor the air clad optical fibres efficiently transmitted light from the light source to the catalysts coated onto the glass beads enabling the photodegradation of the pollutant ee2 under uva irradiation for both p25 tio2 and 4 wt au tio2 photocatalysts fig 5 the photocatalytic degradation was insignificant before modification of the optical fibre data not shown as light emitting surface area was very small with light only emitting at the end of the fibre fig 1a the ee2 degradation rate in the presence of 4 wt au tio2 was higher compared to p25 tio2 fig 5a the rate of photodegradation for both catalysts was found to follow the pseudo first order kinetics fig 5b ee2 t1 2 was 1 26 h and 0 78 h in the presence of p25 tio2 and 4 wt au tio2 catalysts respectively table 1 no apparent loss in ee2 was noted under white light irradiation for the duration of the experiment 2 h p25 tio2 was virtually inactive under white light led since the photonic energy from white light irradiation was insufficient to overcome the bandgap of tio2 the visible light active au tio2 as shown in our previous photocatalysis work on the removal of estrone 15 also failed to remove any ee2 in 2 h this was likely attributed to the small amount of the light transmitted and dispersed by the fibre the improvement in activity under uva was due to gold nanoparticles acting as electron sinks to minimise electron hole recombination and surface plasmon resonance plasmonic effect of gold nanoparticles on the tio2 surface 14 the overall photocatalytic degradation process of ee2 under led uva au tio2 can be explained by the photo generation of the strongly reducing electron and strongly oxidizing hole pairs via the electronic excitation of au tio2 thus uva light with energy equal to or higher than the band gap energy of the catalyst enabled the transition of electrons leaving a hole alone in the valence band through the hydroxyl radicals and oxygen radicals ee2 may become hydroxylated 15 35 3 3 photocatalysis in waterproof led strip reactor photocatalysis experiments with e3 were conducted using cool white light waterproof led strip as the light source fig 2b no degradation of the pollutants was observed under the white light led irradiation in the absence of the catalysts photolysis under darkness 8 9 3 9 and 45 5 2 5 decrease in e3 concentration was observed in the presence of p25 tio2 and 4 wt au tio2 due to adsorption there was no change in the e3 concentration after the adsorption under darkness in the presence of p25 tio2 since it is inactive under visible light fig a5a in supplementary material au tio2 degraded e3 following pseudo first order kinetics with k 0 13 h 1 and t1 2 4 62 h fig a5b in supplementary material 3 4 reusability of optical fibre catalyst coated glass beads and led strip the reusability of the optical fibres and the catalysts coated onto glass beads was examined by repeated applications of the catalysts and the fibres for up to three treatment cycles the catalyst coated beads were removed from the reactor after each run washed with ultrapure water and were calcined at 300 c prior to reusing the optical fibre coupled to the led light source was kept intact for all the three cycles to avoid the change in the intensity of the light that exited the fibre however the fibre was washed by circulating ultrapure water through the reactor in the second cycle application of the catalysts the pollutants removal was 98 the ability of the catalysts to remove the pollutants decreased by only 6 after three cycles similar trend was observed elsewhere 36 37 this shows the high stability of the fibres and the catalysts during application similarly the reusability of the waterproof led reactor system was tested for three treatment cycles here the led strip was removed from the reactor washed with ultrapure water and air dried before reuse the removal rate of e3 in the led strip reactor did not change after three cycles only 3 difference the stability and the performance of the optical fibre coupled with the led were similar throughout the cycles of applications therefore this type of optical fibres can be applied for long term run of the photocatalytic experiments the dip coating method used in this study to immobilise the catalysts onto the glass beads resulted in the formation of rings where the beads contacted each other and the container surface some cracks in the catalyst coating were also observed therefore when the glass beads were refilled into the reactor after each cycle the amount of catalyst exposed to the light emitted by the fibre varies which may result in a change in photodegradation rates nevertheless the results obtained after three cycles show that the overall change in ee2 removal rates was insignificant 4 conclusions p25 tio2 and gold modified tio2 photocatalysts were successfully illuminated with air clad optical fibres coupled to high efficacy leds or with flexible waterproof led strips these setups were effective at degrading estrogens ee2 and e3 the reactor setups addressed a major challenge faced by suspended photocatalysis systems which is the introduction of light into reactor systems the efficient side emission of light from the optical fibres was obtained by collapsing the air holes of an air clad optical fibre using a fusion splicer the optical fibre photocatalytic reactor system efficiently removed the pollutants under uva where 4 wt au tio2 showed enhanced activity compared to p25 tio2 the rate of photodegradation for both the catalysts followed pseudo first order kinetics ee2 t1 2 under uva were 1 26 h and 0 78 h in the presence of p25 tio2 and gold modified catalysts respectively the catalysts as well as the fibres were found to be highly stable during repeated applications with only 6 reduction in photodegradation efficiency being noted after three cycles a reactor using waterproof led strips removed the pollutant e3 in the presence of 4 wt au tio2 photocatalysts following pseudo first order kinetics with k of 0 13 h 1 and t1 2 of 4 62 h no photolysis of the pollutants was observed in the absence of the catalysts overall the engineered air clad optical fibres that enable selective side emission of light and flexible

to transmit light to photocatalysts p25 tio2 and gold modified tio2 au tio2 the performances to photodegrade 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 and estriol e3 under cool white and uva high efficacy leds were examined au tio2 showed superior photocatalytic activity for ee2 removal over p25 tio2 the pseudo first order rate constants for ee2 photocatalysis under uva were 0 55 h 1 and 0 89 h 1 for tio2 and au tio2 respectively e3 was effectively degraded by au tio2 in the immersible led strip reactor 0 13 h 1 keywords photocatalysis optical fibre visible light au tio2 edcs 1 introduction of current global concern are the endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs exogenous chemicals that alter the functions of the endogenous hormones to cause adverse effects especially in reproductive health 1 2 to the animals and potentially human 3 4 edcs can be natural substances such as estrone e1 and estriol e3 or synthetic chemicals such as alkylphenols and 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 although their biological potency can vary by several orders of magnitude 5 it is widely reported that the effluents from the sewage treatment plants stps are one of the key sources of edcs discharges to the natural aquatic environment 4 6 7 steroidal hormones are resistant to biodegradation hence their removal by conventional stp facilities is limited 7 9 tio2 is considered an attractive advanced oxidation process due to its high photocatalytic activity under uv irradiation commercial availability non toxicity and photo stability 9 11 however only uv light which is 3 5 in the sunlight can activate pure tio2 12 13 hence the use of visible light for photocatalysis is of great interest 13 by using solar energy as the driving force hence making the process a green technology noble metals ag au pt pd ru are proved to be efficient in enhancing the uv light activity of tio2 while introducing a notable visible light response 14 15 gold is favoured due to its non toxicity stability plasmonic effect and biocompatibility 15 16 the enhanced photocatalytic performance of au tio2 compared to p25 tio2 under uva could be attributed to the fact that some electrons from tio2 conduction band cross to gold nanoparticles on the tio2 surface therefore electron hole recombination is reduced 17 on the other hand for au tio2 under visible light the electrons in au nanoparticles that gain sufficient energy to overcome the schottky barrier will cross to the conduction band of tio2 thus leading to the visible light activity of the catalyst 18 in addition localised surface plasmons can be excited in gold by visible light with a wavelength of 520 nm 19 the electrons that gain sufficient energy after being excited by localised surface plasmon resonance will flow to tio2 thereby enabling photocatalysis

revealed that tio2 and gold doped tio2 were well attached onto glass beads indicating immobilisation happed successfully after several times of washing and applications the immobilized catalysts did not become detached from the glass beads surface indicating the sufficient stability of the glass breads immobilized catalysts furthermore uv vis spectroscopy study of the commercial catalyst p25 tio2 and synthesized gold doped titania au tio2 was reported in our previous study 14 it was observed that the absorbance wavelength of p25 tio2 is below 400 nm with regard to visible light activity gold doped tio2showed an absorption band between 500 and 600 nm 3 2 photocatalysis in optical fibre reactor the air clad optical fibres efficiently transmitted light from the light source to the catalysts coated onto the glass beads enabling the photodegradation of the pollutant ee2 under uva irradiation for both p25 tio2 and 4 wt au tio2 photocatalysts fig 5 the photocatalytic degradation was insignificant before modification of the optical fibre data not shown as light emitting surface area was very small with light only emitting at the end of the fibre fig 1a the ee2 degradation rate in the presence of 4 wt au tio2 was higher compared to p25 tio2 fig 5a the rate of photodegradation for both catalysts was found to follow the pseudo first order kinetics fig 5b ee2 t1 2 was 1 26 h and 0 78 h in the presence of p25 tio2 and 4 wt au tio2 catalysts respectively table 1 no apparent loss in ee2 was noted under white light irradiation for the duration of the experiment 2 h p25 tio2 was virtually inactive under white light led since the photonic energy from white light irradiation was insufficient to overcome the bandgap of tio2 the visible light active au tio2 as shown in our previous photocatalysis work on the removal of estrone 15 also failed to remove any ee2 in 2 h this was likely attributed to the small amount of the light transmitted and dispersed by the fibre the improvement in activity under uva was due to gold nanoparticles acting as electron sinks to minimise electron hole recombination and surface plasmon resonance plasmonic effect of gold nanoparticles on the tio2 surface 14 the overall photocatalytic degradation process of ee2 under led uva au tio2 can be explained by the photo generation of the strongly reducing electron and strongly oxidizing hole pairs via the electronic excitation of au tio2 thus uva light with energy equal to or higher than the band gap energy of the catalyst enabled the transition of electrons leaving a hole alone in the valence band through the hydroxyl radicals and oxygen radicals ee2 may become hydroxylated 15 35 3 3 photocatalysis in waterproof led strip reactor photocatalysis experiments with e3 were conducted using cool white light waterproof led strip as the light source fig 2b no degradation of the pollutants was observed under the white light led irradiation in the absence of the catalysts photolysis under darkness 8 9 3 9 and 45 5 2 5 decrease in e3 concentration was observed in the presence of p25 tio2 and 4 wt au tio2 due to adsorption there was no change in the e3 concentration after the adsorption under darkness in the presence of p25 tio2 since it is inactive under visible light fig a5a in supplementary material au tio2 degraded e3 following pseudo first order kinetics with k 0 13 h 1 and t1 2 4 62 h fig a5b in supplementary material 3 4 reusability of optical fibre catalyst coated glass beads and led strip the reusability of the optical fibres and the catalysts coated onto glass beads was examined by repeated applications of the catalysts and the fibres for up to three treatment cycles the catalyst coated beads were removed from the reactor after each run washed with ultrapure water and were calcined at 300 c prior to reusing the optical fibre coupled to the led light source was kept intact for all the three cycles to avoid the change in the intensity of the light that exited the fibre however the fibre was washed by circulating ultrapure water through the reactor in the second cycle application of the catalysts the pollutants removal was 98 the ability of the catalysts to remove the pollutants decreased by only 6 after three cycles similar trend was observed elsewhere 36 37 this shows the high stability of the fibres and the catalysts during application similarly the reusability of the waterproof led reactor system was tested for three treatment cycles here the led strip was removed from the reactor washed with ultrapure water and air dried before reuse the removal rate of e3 in the led strip reactor did not change after three cycles only 3 difference the stability and the performance of the optical fibre coupled with the led were similar throughout the cycles of applications therefore this type of optical fibres can be applied for long term run of the photocatalytic experiments the dip coating method used in this study to immobilise the catalysts onto the glass beads resulted in the formation of rings where the beads contacted each other and the container surface some cracks in the catalyst coating were also observed therefore when the glass beads were refilled into the reactor after each cycle the amount of catalyst exposed to the light emitted by the fibre varies which may result in a change in photodegradation rates nevertheless the results obtained after three cycles show that the overall change in ee2 removal rates was insignificant 4 conclusions p25 tio2 and gold modified tio2 photocatalysts were successfully illuminated with air clad optical fibres coupled to high efficacy leds or with flexible waterproof led strips these setups were effective at degrading estrogens ee2 and e3 the reactor setups addressed a major challenge faced by suspended photocatalysis systems which is the introduction of light into reactor systems the efficient side emission of light from the optical fibres was obtained by collapsing the air holes of an air clad optical fibre using a fusion splicer the optical fibre photocatalytic reactor system efficiently removed the pollutants under uva where 4 wt au tio2 showed enhanced activity compared to p25 tio2 the rate of photodegradation for both the catalysts followed pseudo first order kinetics ee2 t1 2 under uva were 1 26 h and 0 78 h in the presence of p25 tio2 and gold modified catalysts respectively the catalysts as well as the fibres were found to be highly stable during repeated applications with only 6 reduction in photodegradation efficiency being noted after three cycles a reactor using waterproof led strips removed the pollutant e3 in the presence of 4 wt au tio2 photocatalysts following pseudo first order kinetics with k of 0 13 h 1 and t1 2 of 4 62 h no photolysis of the pollutants was observed in the absence of the catalysts overall the engineered air clad optical fibres that enable selective side emission of light and flexible waterproof led strips are promising modes of light delivery for underwater photocatalysis of edcs and related organic pollutants in remote locations there are no financial or personal relationships

14198,forward osmosis fo using locally available nanofiltration nf membrane and magnesium chloride as draw solution has been carried out for concentration of wastewater maximum water flux of 11 8 l m

and 90 water flux could be easily recovered by cleaning with deionised water specific energy consumption in the fo process was 0 26 kwh m 3 the membrane could effectively reject feed solutes for synthetic dye wastewater feed allowing only pure water to pass through draw solute recovery and better quality water generation 1000 mg l 1 tds was achieved by a low pressure nanofiltration process 10 bar recovery of mgcl2 by an alternate chemical method is also demonstrated morphology of the membrane was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy of the membrane surface and cross section small angle

tortuosity of membrane 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is steadily emerging as a popular membrane process with the potentials of less energy consumption and ability to treat a plethora of complex and difficult aqueous streams 1 fo is an inherently simple natural process in which membrane and draw solution ds feature the two most important elements the concentrate draw solution pulls water from its feed dilute counterpart by virtue of the concentration difference through a semi permeable membrane currently remarkable research activities are underway in fo to make the technology commercially competitive with other conventional pressure driven membrane processes however a number of core issues such as water flux enhancement feed solute rejection controlling reverse solute flux rsf and mitigation of internal and external concentration polarization cp merit further attention a key aspect in fo membrane development lies in creating a structure for the facile diffusion of draw solutes through the support layer sl and efficient feed solute rejection by the active layer al correspondingly the draw solute should have high osmotic potential together with desirable properties like low cost low toxicity low reactivity wide availability and so on the strong interdependence between selection of draw solute and membrane development has been widely recognized 2 moreover an energy efficient recovery of draw solutes and subsequent generation of good quality potable water needs to be carried out to render the overall system commercially implementable the idea of using a ro or nf membrane either directly or modified as an improvised fo membrane stems from the premise that both shares a considerable structural as well as functional similarity literature cites a number of studies to explore the suitability of existing ro or nf membranes for fo applications some of these include direct performance check of similar membranes 3 5 casting a thin active layer on an existing membrane using as a support layer 6 and altering the pore structure of existing membrane by chemical 7 heat treatment 8 or by other means ro membranes having high structural parameter anywhere between 1000 and 10000 μm are reported to produce low water flux in fo process with low rsf and appreciable 80 feed solute rejection 9 10 nf membranes by virtue of their increased porosity and ability to work at reduced pressure are suitable for fo application where no external pressure is applied a short overview of the performance of different nf membranes in fo process is presented in table 1 however ro and nf membranes usually with thick support layer to withstand high pressure could become a severe bottleneck when used as a fo membrane resulting in diminished water flux due to internal concentration polarization icp 11 12 as fo process works in the absence of external pressure the support layer can be reduced optimized recently developed polyethersulphone pes based loose nanofiltration hollow fiber membranes having ultrahigh water permeability and well defined nanopores with application in low pressure water softening might be amenable to fo applications the cross linked pes membranes are also favoured due to their high temperature tolerance chemical resistance ease of fabrication wide range of pore size and lower costs in some fo applications nf membranes have reportedly performed better than existing fo membranes 13 most of the commercial fo membranes developed by hti inc modern water plc porifera inc etc which generate higher water flux are proprietary by nature and are not easily available in the open market this probably underscores a timely need for research and development of such low cost locally available nf membranes for fo application at least for preliminary lab scale studies inorganic salts are extensively studied as draw solutes for fo process and are proved to be effective due to their favourable physic chemical properties magnesium chloride mgcl2 is considered highly effective as draw solute on various counts for wastewater applications 14 16 being a divalent salt it can achieve high rejection efficiency when nf membranes are used for recovery 17 mgcl2 has low molecular weight 95 211 gmol 1 high water solubility 54 3 g 100 ml at 20 c low viscosity 0 05 kg m 1s 1 at 1 0 mol l 1 concentration at 25 c and thus can achieve higher osmotic pressure 256 5 atm at 2 0 mol l 1 concentration favourable for fo application although mg2 is classified as scale precursor ion which is likely to cause mineral salt scaling mg oh 2 precipitates out only at high alkaline condition ph 9 18 hence mgcl2 could be safely used in fo without risk of scaling 16 it is a locally produced low cost 70 ton high consumption commodity chemical and is widely used as dressing and filling of cotton fabrics in textile units polishing abrasive bricks for marbles tiles etc in ceramic industry and numerous other applications gujarat being an industrial hub generates a lot of textile wastewater with high colour content where mgcl2 is often used as a coagulant during the treatment process for disposal most of the work presented in the table 1 checked performance of nf membranes using mgcl2 as draw solute integrated fo nf systems using divalent salts like mgcl2 and na2so4 have been reported in recent times for potential energy and cost efficient application in desalination and wastewater treatment 9 14 19 the objective of the present work was to assess the suitability of a low cost locally manufactured commercial pes nf membrane in fo process using mgcl2 as draw solute for color removal from dye solution and concentration of industrial wastewater the working pressure range of the current membrane was low enough to enable its compatibility to work as a make shift fo membrane successfully a detailed unbiased performance study of the membrane in the fo process without any modification was undertaken an initial sem micrograph of the surface and cross section analysis was carried out for confirmation a detailed analysis of the porous pes membrane structure using small angle x ray scattering saxs method was also undertaken to the best of our knowledge detailed performance study of this membrane in fo process has hitherto not been reported in literature recovery of mgcl2 draw solute and generation of pure water have been demonstrated by nf process using the same membrane overall this study intends to provide useful insights towards development of an integrated fo nf system using low cost membrane and widely available materials to address potential concerns in wastewater handling and treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane the membrane named hfn 300 mwco 300 was procured from m s permionics membrane pvt ltd vadodara india it is cross linked thin film composite membrane with polysulfone support substrate over polyester fabric total thickness 200 μm and has the ability to withstand up to 60 c temperature 41 37 bar pressure and 2 10 ph as per manufacturer s specification the membrane is stable in mineral acids like hcl h2so4 h3po4 etc chlorine sanitizable and high divalent salt rejection ability 2 2 scanning electron microscopy analysis the sem images were obtained using jsm 6010la intouch scope jeol usa equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds with low vacuum lv mode for non conductive materials without pre treatment the microscope has 4 nm resolution at 20 kv 5x to 300000x magnification capacity 500 v to 20 kv accelerating voltage and up to 25 4 mm field of view a pristine membrane sample piece was used without any chemical pre treatment and was dried in a drying oven 40 c for 24 h the sample was sputter coated with gold palladium 80 20 before loading in the microscope 2 3 small angle x ray scattering saxs analysis saxs measurements were performed in a flow through capillary with a kratky type instrument saxsess from anton paar the cu target x ray tube operated at u 30 kv i 10 ma was used as a radiation source λ 0 154 nm the saxs data were collected as a function of scattering vector q 4π λ sin θ where 2θ is the scattering angle moving slit method 20 was applied for determination of the transmittance factor of the sample the sample holder background was subtracted from the saxs curves and next curves were corrected taking into consideration both sample thickness and transmittance 2 4 experimental set up fo experiments were performed in a custom designed laboratory scale experimental set up a flat sheet membrane piece was placed between two close ended flanged pipe arrangement with proper inlet and outlet completed with gasket and screw joints the fo test cell had an active area of 0 00114 m2 active layer of membrane faced feed solution fs and support layer faced draw solution al fs or fo mode orientation no spacers were used feed and draw solution were circulated at 3 6 l min 1 from the respective storage tanks by means of submersible centrifugal pumps a fresh membrane swatch was soaked in pure water for 60 min prior to its use for every new set of experiment the reduction in weight of the feed solution tank was recorded using a digital weighing balance at regular intervals of 1 min for first 30 min 5 min for the next 1 h and 10 min thereafter all experiments were performed at 30 2 c in batch mode where both the solutions after coming in indirect contact through the membrane were recycled back to their respective tanks concentration of ds was maintained through re concentration all performance study experiments were carried out for 4 h except long duration studies of 24 h the schematic diagram of the set up and some more related information can be found elsewhere 9 2 5 chemicals locally manufactured commercial grade magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o of 99 purity nacl 0 3 mgso4 0 4 and cacl2 0 4 max was used as draw solute the pure water conductivity 200 250 μs cm 1 used in flux study was acquired from a ro system industrial wastewater was obtained from a common effluent treatment plant located in a local industrial hub collecting effluent mainly from a cluster of cold steel rolling mill units manufacturing different types of engineering machineries wastewater sample was collected from the inlet of effluent treatment plant and directly used as fs in the fo experiments chemical analysis of industrial wastewater sample is presented in table 3 synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing three dyes namely methyl red 1 5 g indigo carmine 10 g and congo red 5 g in 1 l of water 2 6 nanofiltration experimental nanofiltration experiment was performed in a pilot scale cross flow nf unit supplied by the same manufacturer m s permionics having a flat sheet membrane module the same membrane which was used in fo setup was used the rectangular inner test cell which housed the membrane had dimensions of 160 mm 100 mm 2 mm with an effective membrane area of 0 016 m2 upper half of the cell incorporated the flow distribution chamber and lower half constituted the membrane support system an elaborate arrangement with a perforated 1 mm thick stainless steel plate along with a stainless steel 350 mesh gauge over the membrane provided mechanical support to membrane at high pressure operation the active layer of membrane faced the high pressure feed feed solution was pressurized by a high pressure plunger pump 3 14 bar the pilot plant was complete with circulation pumps pressure gauge rotameter sampling points feed and collection permeate and retentate tanks 2 7 permeability and diffusivity the water flux jw across membrane is directly proportional to the difference in osmotic potential between the feed and draw solution as shown in eq 1 1 j w a σ δ π where a is water permeability coefficient l m 2 h 1 bar 1 σ is reflection coefficient and δπ is the osmotic potential difference the value of reflection coefficient can be taken as unity when membrane rejects the solute completely in fo process due to high solute rejection σ is usually assumed unity rsf is affected by concentration difference between fs and ds and can be described by fick s law as follows 2 j s b δ c where b is solute permeability coefficient l m 2 h 1 and δc is concentration difference across the membrane g l 1 in actual case for an asymmetric membrane the rsf can be separate across active layer and support layer overall the mass transport across a membrane in fo process can be expressed in terms of the characteristic properties of membrane the hydrodynamics in the membrane flow cell and experimentally accessible parameters for membranes with high salt rejection the water flux jw in fo can be estimated using eq 3 21 3 j w a π d e x p j w s d π f e x p j w k 1 b j w e x p j w k e x p j w s d where πd and πf is bulk osmotic pressure of the ds and fs respectively k is feed solute mass transfer coefficient d is bulk diffusion coefficient of the ds and s is membrane structural parameter membrane structural parameter s t s τ is a critical intrinsic parameter dependent on membrane thickness ts tortuosity τ and porosity ε similarly the solute flux can be estimated by eq 4 21 4 j s b c d e x p j w s d c f e x p j w k 1 b j w e x p j w k e x p j w s d where cd and cf is solute concentration of the ds and fs respectively the transport equations 3 and 4 are only valid for fo operation under al fs mode 22 diffusion coefficient d can be expressed by stoke einstein equation as 5 d k b t 6 π η r where kb is boltzmann constant 1 381 10 23 j k 1 t is absolute temperature η is solvent viscosity and r represents the radius of spherical particles stoke einstein equation is generally applicable only for dilute solutions 23 the equation is essentially a thermodynamic model and assumes that under dilute conditions the spherical shaped solute has no interaction with each other and there is no resistance to transport of solute in bulk solution other empirical equations like wilke chang equation can also be used membrane parameters a b and s has been calculated numerically by fitting four sets of experimental values of jw and js at different concentrations as described by tiraferri et al 21 the transport eqs 3 and 4 for fo were fitted to the experimental water and solute flux values using nonlinear least square analysis with cd πd and cf πf as independent experimental variables and a b and s as regression parameters effect of concentrative ecp was neglected because pure water was used as fs consequently the value of e x p j w k was assumed to be 1 diffusion constants calculated by stoke einstein equation was 0 52 10 9 m2s 1 and 1 38 10 9 m2s 1 for mg2 ion and cl ion respectively for calculation purposes the diffusion constant was taken as 1 05 10 9 m2s 1 a constant d is assumed within the membrane support layer which is valid for small concentration range of 0 5 2 mol l 1 reflection coefficient was assumed to be unity due to high solute rejection capacity of the membrane also specific rsf js jw is assumed constant 16 18 the osmotic pressure generated by the solute was assumed to be related linearly to the solute concentration as per the van t hoff equation viscosity of 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution was measured at 1 05 10 3 kg m 1s 1 3 result discussion 3 1 sem analysis sem images of active layer surface support layer surface and the cross section of nf membrane are shown in fig 1 images of top layer of the pristine membrane at 4000 and 8000 magnification fig 1a b revealed compact surface with visible scattered pores intermittent bright spots on the surface are attributed to the presence of deposits having high conductivity which are proprietary additives added to increase hydrophilicity cross sectional images fig 1c d showed the typical asymmetric structure of the pes top layer composed of a thin sponge like skin layer 1 μm thickness and a porous bulk having straight finger like pores of 3 5 μm diameter with spongy walls the pes top layer is around 50 μm thick formed over a surface of a micro porous substrate of about 50 μm thickness by interfacial polymerization reaction the support substrate is a highly porous 50 μm thick polysulfone layer cast over a non woven polyester fabric fig 1e f by phase inversion gelling technique to provide necessary structural strength for pressurized nf operation can withstand up to 40 bar pressure the overall thickness of the membrane is around 200 μm together the porous pes top layer and highly porous support substrate tend to increase the water permeability even at low pressure nf operation rendering the membrane suitable for fo applications 3 2 saxs study the saxs curves of the investigated membrane are shown in fig 2 in double logarithmic plots because small angle x ray scattering is conditioned by the existence of the electron density non homogeneities in the sample which in case of membranes is due to the existence of pores in them the higher intensity is caused by higher content of pores in these membranes content of pores can be determined by calculating the scattering power or invariant q using the equation 6 q 0 q 2 i q d q φ 1 φ δ ρ 2 where i q is the corrected saxs intensity φ is the volume fraction of pores and δρ is the electron density difference between the pores and pes the pores may be assumed to be entirely air filled in dry membranes the electron density difference between pes and pores was calculated to be δρ 511 electrons nm3 24 for determination of pore sizes the guinier approximation describing the scattering intensity for small values of the scattering vector q can be used 7 i q i 0 e x p q 2 r g 2 3 eq 7 describes the mean intensity of radiation scattered by a particle of any shape averaged through all its possible orientations in space rg is electron radius of gyration also called the guinier radius rg can be determined from the slope of the plot between ln i q and q2 using the intensity data in the low q region saxs profile of the membrane in dry state is shown in fig 2 the average periodic spacing is 4 5 μm obtained from q position of the correlation peak observed in saxs pattern periodic spacing was calculated by using the equation d 2 π q the above results indicate that the micro phase separated structures of membranes in a dry condition can be evaluated by stained saxs 3 3 water flux study the performance of divalent salt mgcl2 as draw solute using nf membrane was evaluated the profile of water flux for 4 h operation using 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 draw solution with different feed and membrane orientation is presented in fig 3 a perusal of fig 3 reveals that water flux decreased with time and almost similar profile was observed in all cases sharp decline in water flux was noticed in the very first hour 90 of total decline the decrease in water flux was about 35 of initial flux after 4 h of operation thereafter the water flux was more or less maintained as displayed in the flattish profile fig 8a and the decline was very low 15 drop till 24 h of operation in al fs orientation and pure water feed the water transport from the feed side towards ds led to dilution of ds inside support layer the thick but porous support layer worked as a diffusive boundary layer thus reducing the net osmotic pressure across the active layer resulting in diminished water flux this phenomenon termed as dilutive internal concentration polarization icp occurred inside the support layer and was mostly responsible for the initial flux drop over and above it was difficult to eliminate when pure water was used as fs the effect of external concentration polarization ecp was minimal average rsf was less and measured at 0 175 g m 2 h 1 for pure water feed and 4 h operation however measurement of mgcl2 concentration of the bulk fs may not reveal the true picture nf membranes evidently do not reject 100 solutes the solutes which diffused through the membrane from draw side to feed side in al fs mode might have been retained near the active layer and did not diffuse into the bulk solution plausibly there was some interaction between the membrane and draw solute which prevented normal liberation of the solute ions also the majority of reverse solute transport across the membrane perhaps occurred during the first hour owing to maximum osmotic differential across selective layer this led to a sharp drop in net osmotic potential across the active layer during initial stage which could be the reason for sharp flux decline this was further authenticated by the performance of same membrane using nacl draw solute with pure water feed in al fs orientation nacl was able to diffuse easily and rapidly through the membrane pores mwco of 300 owing to small hydrated radii and was retained near the membrane surface the water flux profile showed sharp decline of flux compared to mgcl2 as more amount of nacl solute diffused resulting in least average flux in case of wastewater feed with mgcl2 draw solute the water flux profile revealed a high degree of similarity in the first hour when compared to pure water feed subsequently the magnesium ions which diffused through the membrane probably interacted with solute ions of the feed resulting in foulants deposition at membrane solution interface which further reduced the water flux a similar phenomenon was reported elsewhere with wastewater mgcl2 fo system 25 26 this resulted in lower average water flux in case of waste water feed compared to pure water feed after 4 h the flux profile with pure water feed in al ds orientation showed a similar downward trend albeit a flatter initial flux profile in the absence of concentrative icp effect in support layer the osmotic potential difference was at peak initially the leakage of solute and subsequent retention across the membrane as explained earlier might have resulted in a major decline in water flux permeation of water from feed to draw side led to dilutive ecp effect which also contributed to overall flux decline however there was higher average water flux in al ds mode compared to al fs mode for pure water feed fig 6 this advantage got nullified when wastewater was used as feed 27 nevertheless it must be noted that in all cases after an initial major dip in water flux the system gained some sort of equilibrium and thereafter water flux was maintained for a sufficiently long duration even though the final flux was much less compared to initial flux this phenomenon holds true even for wastewater feed the complex interaction between the membrane and solutes along with the hydrodynamics resulted in an almost stable system with respect to water flux similar observable fact is also highlighted in other research paper 14 which needs careful deliberation as can be observed from table 1 performance of this membrane was better compared to other nf membranes water flux obtained in the present study is low which is a major concern compared to commercially available proprietary fo membranes using mgcl2 and other draw solutes refer table 4 nevertheless a comparison with similar studies using nf membrane and mgcl2 as draw solute showed that the water flux in our case is almost comparable or at times even better refer table 1 in all the cases where the reported water flux is higher it is invariably coupled with high rsf the specific reverse solute flux js jw 0 023 g l 1 which is a major parameter in evaluating the membrane performance is much lower in our case compared to other nf membranes which makes this membrane worthy of further investigation suitable modification optimization of the support layer in order to enhance water flux without compromising rsf is essential 3 4 reverse solute flux study reverse solute flux is undesirable as it causes loss of precious draw solutes resulting in high replenishment costs and contamination of fs experiment with pure water feed showed rsf of 0 17 and 0 27 g m 2 h 1 at 1 and 2 mol l 1 mgcl2 ds concentration respectively the effective diameters of hydrated ions of mg2 and cl ion are 800 10 12 m and 300 10 12 m respectively 16 in aqueous solution mgcl2 tends to dissociate to one cation of magnesium mg2 and two anions of chloride cl as the pes membrane is negatively charged it tends to repel the chloride ions considering large size of hydrated mg2 ions the combination of all these factors resulted in low rsf the rsf increased with concentration of ds for pure feed water fig 4 due to increase in concentration difference driving force between ds and fs as explained by fick s law eq 2 though the larger solute size of mgcl2 helps achieving low rsf this is at the expense of low diffusivity which tends to increase dilutive icp resistance resulting in lower water flux js jw ratio of 0 023 g l 1 for 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 ds indicated low replenishment cost js jw ratio increased with ds concentration which somewhat contradicts the literature findings and the assumption that js jw is independent of ds concentration 16 18 this might be due to faster dilution of the ds inside support layer owing to higher water flux resulting in a reduction in net osmotic potential the rsf was much lower than what has been reported using other nf membranes both proprietary and fabricated with the same draw solute table 1 the specific rsf of 0 023 g l 1 is also lower than other nf membranes this is especially noteworthy as no specific methodology was adopted for countering rsf proprietary fo membranes by hti using 0 5 mol l 1 mgcl2 as ds reported higher water flux at 9 72 l m 2 h 1 but js jw was high too at 0 5 g l 1 16 compared to 5 8 l m 2 h 1 and 0 015 g l 1 in our case it also merits mentioning that low rsf makes the membrane suitable for applications like food pharmaceutical protein concentration where feed contamination is a sensitive issue a proper combination of membrane and draw solute for the fo process which can maintain a balance between permeability and selectivity is essential increasing water flux to expedite fo process without compromising rsf is a challenging task but necessary for overall implementation and feasibility of the system 3 5 membrane parameters the membrane parameters were calculated by single stage fo based test method as described by tiraferri et al the results are presented in table 2 which shows water and solute permeability coefficient values of 4 75 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 0 01 l m 2 h 1 respectively the structural parameter of nf membrane was determined at 2190 μm s is used to decide the extent of icp in the support layer of fo membranes and low s value is always preferable s value of cellulose tri acetate cta asymmetric membrane and polyamide thin film composite tfc membrane developed by hti inc for fo process are reportedly 600 μm and 450 μm respectively 32 fo membrane commercialized by porifera inc reported s value of 215 μm 33 on the contrary s value of ro membranes like sw30 dow chemical company is apparently much higher at 9583 μm 32 similarly other nf membranes reported more than 10000 μm 4 this is due to the presence of thick support layer in ro nf membranes which is required to withstand high pressure during operation considering that the nf membrane used in the present study has a total thickness of 200 μm and a significant support layer the value of structural parameter is much less compared to ro nf membranes but higher than fo membranes as reported in literature this may be due to the presence of pores in the pes top layer which is also evident from the sem images the hydrophilic polysulfone layer cast over non woven polyester support layer provided less tortuous path and allowed thorough wetting of support structure thus lowering the structural parameter as this membrane has been developed for low pressure nf operations ease of water permeability is vital for its application since fo process operates in the absence of external pressure hence further optimizing the support layer thickness will render this membrane more suitable for fo operation the value of solute resistivity k s d was found to be 2 086 106 s m 1 which was considerably high signifying high icp resulting in reduced water flux k value for cta fo membrane in similar system is reportedly much less at 4 5 105 s m 1 16 k value could be reduced by decreasing thickness and increasing void fraction of the membrane which are comparatively easier to achieve and provide free flow to the solute particles engineering the tortuosity of membrane is rather a difficult proposition however it may be noted that the structural parameter was determined by fo based test method in this paper this non pressurized methodology was found to be suitable for fo process compared to ro based methods since more accurate predictions of performance could be achieved 22 most of the values reported in literature used the conventional method ro fo based hence the values may not be directly comparable moreover while calculating the membrane parameters a b and s the bulk concentration of feed and draw solution were measured and taken into consideration the data were not corrected for icp effects therefore the actual osmotic pressure difference at the membrane interface is not the same as the calculated one furthermore the same icp effect keep the concentration of draw solution low at the support layer interface compared to bulk concentration thus it can be assumed that the deviation from ideality due to higher concentration is not significant and would have minimal effect on the generated osmotic pressure following van t hoff equation also it must be noted that the near constancy of js jw is a necessary condition for the successful application of this method 21 which was not observed in our case as js jw increased with ds concentration 3 6 effect of various parameters on water flux the effect of concentration temperature and flow rate of the ds along with membrane orientation on water flux and rsf was studied temperature and flow rate of pure water fs were kept constant and hence there was no variation effect of concentrative ecp on water flux water flux increased from 5 9 8 32 l m 2 h 1 with an increase in concentration of mgcl2 draw solute from 0 5 to 2 mol l 1 fig 4 osmotic potential of mgcl2 solution increased from 40 to 260 bar between 0 5 2 mol l 1 which was the primary reason for the increase in water flux as shown in eq 1 but the increase in water flux was not proportional to osmotic potential and was severely affected by dilutive icp increasing concentration hence did not help much in improving water flux for 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution there was more than 50 increase in water flux with an increase in ds temperature from 25 to 55 c fig 5a this could be attributed to net increase in osmotic potential to increase in temperature 28 the reduction in viscosity of ds caused by elevated temperature also enhanced the movement of water molecules resulting in increased diffusion of mgcl2 draw solutes through the support layer towards the membrane surface as shown by stoke einstein equation eq 5 thereby increasing the net osmotic potential across active layer at 55 c temperature the water flux was 11 8 l m 2 h 1 this is beneficial for hot tropical countries like india where temperatures up to 45 c in summer are common the experiments were not conducted at a higher temperature as the overall idea was to operate the fo process at or near ambient conditions the high temperature could perhaps damage the membrane or cause alteration in the pore structure of polymeric membranes this membrane is touted to withstand temperature of 60 c as per manufacturer specification the water flux increased from 5 8 to 7 63 l m 2 h 1 with an increase in the circulation flow rate of ds from 0 5 to 3 6 l min 1 fig 5b change in cross flow velocity can influence dilutive ecp at the surface of support layer dilutive ecp works as a barrier at the outside surface of membrane support layer to the incoming draw solute and outgoing permeate water higher cross flow velocities reduce thickness of the boundary layer making the permeated water move and mix faster in bulk ds the contribution of dilutive ecp towards decreasing net osmotic pressure is much less 10 20 compared to dilutive icp in al fs mode nevertheless it cannot be neglected especially at lower cross flow velocities 29 for maximum flow rate of 3 6 l min 1 and a cross flow velocity of 0 052 m s 1 the reynolds number was determined at 1910 implying laminar flow the degree of dilutive ecp can be estimated by boundary layer film theory and the ds side mass transfer coefficient k is calculated as 8 k s h d d h where dh is hydraulic diameter calculated dh 0 0381 m and sh is the dimensionless sherwood number which is estimated for laminar flow as 9 s h 1 85 r e s c d h l 1 3 where re and sc are reynolds and schmidt number respectively when cross flow velocity over the membrane was decreased from 0 052 m s 1 to 0 007 m s 1 the flow became more laminar and the boundary layer thickness increased hence the draw side mass transfer coefficient decreased from 6 03 10 6 m s 1 to 3 14 10 6 m s 1 48 decline this increased the barrier effect of dilutive ecp and as a result the flux decreased from 7 63 l m 2 h 1 to 5 8 l m 2 h 1 however an 86 decrease in cross flow velocity led to only 24 decrease in water flux therefore increase in cross flow velocity at the draw side resulted in the increase of water flux albeit in a subdued manner which was more prominent at lower cross flow velocities in the case of well designed thin membranes with highly porous support layer high cross flow velocity is argued to decrease boundary layer thickness to the extent that it is able to induce mixing in the support layer thus reducing dilutive icp effect 30 a careful cost calculation needs to be undertaken to evaluate the benefit of higher throughput at the expense of additional pumping costs to obtain optimal cross flow velocity incorporating well designed feed channels with spacers that can induce turbulence and cause enhanced mixing in boundary layer on either side of the membrane can be beneficial for industrial application membrane orientation also affects the water flux in fo process water flux was higher in case of al ds mode compared to al fs mode for pure water feed fig 6 this occurred because the draw solute faced resistance in the support layer al fs mode which resulted in dilutive icp it has been established that dilutive icp is the major cause of the decrease in net osmotic pressure drop in al fs mode and in some cases could contribute up to 60 of the net pressure drop 29 absence of draw solute in the support layer at the al ds mode did not result in dilutive icp usually al ds orientation is favoured in case of low concentration low fouling feed solutions like brackish water in desalination applications in case of high fouling scaling feed solution al fs mode provides a more stable and higher water flux 27 nevertheless the increase in water flux with concentration and temperature of ds coincided with an increase of rsf the above factors are responsible for higher diffusion of draw solute towards active layer through support layer resulting in high concentrations of draw solute at the sl al interface which is necessary to generate a large osmotic gradient ensuing high water flux but above factors do not increase the rsf selectivity of membrane active layer so this higher concentration of draw solute which increases the concentration gradient across the active layer could also increase the reverse salt flux it has been established that the reverse flux selectivity is independent of support layer structural parameter as well as bulk ds concentration 18 4 application in wastewater concentration 4 1 synthetic and industrial wastewater concentration the performance of the fo system was checked for synthetic and industrial wastewater feed with 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 as ds for 4 h operation at 30 c the water flux for synthetic and industrial wastewater was 6 6 and 7 58 l m 2 h 1 respectively compared to 7 63 l m 2 h 1 with pure water feed the observed difference in water flux might be due to a reduction in the net osmotic potential owing to the presence of dissolved solutes in fs also the presence of feed solutes might have instigated concentrative ecp effect reducing net osmotic potential across membrane active layer causing lower water flux the water flux profile was almost similar in all cases the change in colour of ds was checked by a turbidity meter after passage of 30 ml water in case of synthetic wastewater feed after 4 h operation fig 7a b initial and final turbidity of the ds were 0 5 ntu and 0 7 ntu respectively moreover when 30 ml of synthetic wastewater fs was directly added to 1030 ml ds the distinct colour difference fig 7c demonstrated optically that the membrane could reject feed solutes and allowed only pure water to pass through a 24 h study of the fo system performance with industrial wastewater feed and 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 ds was carried out without membrane cleaning the average water flux reduced to 5 74 l m 2 h 1 detailed analysis of the raw and concentrated industrial feed wastewater is presented in table 3 good quality water was successfully drawn out resulting in concentration of fs which could be observed by the increase of all major water quality parameters the ds concentration decreased from 1 0 0 8 mol l 1 which further confirmed water transport through the membrane concentration of sulfate nitrate and ammoniacal n in the ds were below detection limit indicating good feed rejection capacity of the membrane here it must be noted that incomplete solute rejection by the membrane will lead to gradual accumulation of feed solute in ds and will be noticeable after multiple recycle the performance of some commercial fo membranes using mgcl2 draw solute with different feed solutions is shown in table 4 commercial fo membranes developed after years of research clearly demonstrated higher water flux in most of the cases compared to the nf membrane used in our case only in few cases commercial fo membrane reported lower water flux 15 it is important to mention that the results may not be directly comparable owing to variation in wastewater composition moreover all the commercial fo membranes exhibited high rsf compared to our membrane the compromise in rsf makes the membranes vulnerable to applications where feed contamination is unacceptable 4 2 membrane regeneration and flux recovery fouling of membrane is unavoidable while handling industrial wastewater which results in a further decrease in water flux during long period of operation in order to mitigate fouling cleaning of membrane at regular interval assumes paramount importance the performance of the fo system with industrial wastewater feed and 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 as ds was checked with membrane cleaning at regular intervals an arrangement of feed tanks with proper piping and valve connections was set up which ensured alternate 4 h of fo operation followed by 1 h pure water circulation in the feed side the cycle was repeated multiple times without changing membrane and addition of small quantity makeup draw solute to maintain the ds concentration comparative experimental results with and without cleaning of the membrane are presented in fig 8 the initial water flux was 23 67 l m 2 h 1 which eventually dropped to 7 59 l m 2 h 1 after one hour of pure water recirculation the water flux could be recovered to the tune of 18 06 l m 2 h 1 which was around 76 of initial flux low flux recovery was a one off occurrence as the initial high flux was due to usage of the fresh membrane piece and non development of cp effect in the subsequent cycles water flux could be restored to almost previous cycle levels and the decrease was less than 5 each time the flux profile was also similar each time this indicated that particles were deposited loosely on the membrane surface in the absence of any external applied pressure which could be easily removed even after 10 cycles the membrane was fit for use the results implied that membrane fouling in the process was reversible for industrial wastewater feed and water flux could be restored by standard cleaning protocols this low fouling tendency also reported elsewhere 9 25 prolongs the life of membrane which leads to low operating cost fouling can also be reduced by making suitable changes in hydrodynamic conditions incorporating well designed spacers at feed side or by increasing cross flow velocity subsequently prolonging membrane life the cleaning cycle can be optimized to attain maximum average water flux 4 3 draw solute recovery by nanofiltration process recovery of draw solute after fo process is absolutely essential to facilitate reuse of precious draw solutes and simultaneous separation of water having a high level of purity separation must be achieved using minimal energy in order to keep the overall cost in check the same nf membrane was used for separation of water from mgcl2 draw solution in the pilot scale nf setup the nf setup was operated within the range of 3 10 bar pressure nf permeate samples were collected at definite time intervals and tds was measured fig 9 shows permeate flux and salt retention for the nf membrane using 0 5 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution as feed permeate flux increased from 30 111 l m 2 h 1 as pressure increased from 3 to 10 bar at 5 bar trans membrane pressure the flux and the solute retention were 65 l m 2 h 1 and 98 respectvely very good quality permeate water was produced with tds content less than 1000 mg l 1 concentrations of sulfate nitrate and ammoniacal n were found below detection limits however sophisticated analysis by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy gc ms is necessary to detect the presence of trace feed ions that might have leaked through the membrane in both fo and nf operation in order to confirm the potability of permeate in essence the nf process demonstrated generation of good quality water at low pressure which may be used for unrestricted irrigation purposes as suggested by giagnorio et al 25 a two pass nf can be used for further polishing and generation of potable quality water the concentrate stream of nf process having high mgcl2 content was recovered and reused as draw solution in the fo process with necessary make up addition of small quantities of mgcl2 was essential to compensate for the loss of draw solute due to incomplete rejection of mgcl2 in fo and nf steps no noticeable change was observed in the water flux of fo process due to usage of recycled mgcl2 solution possibility of accumulation of feed contaminants in the ds is unlikely when same membrane is used in both fo and nf steps this is because the feed contaminants which leak through the membrane in fo process will in all probability leak through the membrane in nf process as well and will be traceable in the permeate this can be advantageous compared to other fo hybrid systems involving higher selective membrane in regeneration step e g fo ro leading to accumulation of feed contaminants in draw solute which may render the draw solute unusable after multiple recycle and may need partial total replacement 4 4 alternate recovery of mgcl2 draw solute by chemical route mgcl2 can be recovered in pure mgcl2 6h2o form if absolutely required from nf concentrate through chemical route by precipitation method using 1 4 dioxane as demonstrated by fezei et al 31 1 4 dioxane c4h8o2 is a heterocyclic organic compound ether and is used widely as a solvent for paper cotton and textile processing and having presence in numerous household products a separate independent experiment was carried out to recover mgcl2 in 10 ml of 8 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution 7 ml of 1 4 dioxane was added the mixture was stirred in a temperature controlled mechanically stirred reactor for 40 min at 25 c and was allowed to settle for 1 h the precipitate was filtered using whatman filter paper 2 5 μm pore size about 5 6 g of wet precipitate of mgcl2 6h2o c4h8o2 was filtered in cake form along with 15 1 ml of filtrate the cake was dried for 1 h at 100 c to get 3 544 g mgcl2 6h2o giving a yield of 22 purity of mgcl2 6h2o was ascertained by comparing its melting point of 119 c melting point of mgcl2 6h2o is 117 c and was determined at 98 quality of filtrate which contained unrecovered mgcl2 along with excess dioxane and soluble mg complex chelates needs further verification before recycle or subsequent usage possibility of precipitation at lower concentrations of mgcl2 solution needs additional study it is important to mention that united states environmental protection agency usepa has classified 1 4 dioxane as a probable human carcinogen a more detailed study is required to ascertain the sustainability of this recovery process 5 energy consumption specific energy consumption sec for fo process was determined as the energy consumed kwh per unit volume of water transport m3 the energy required in fo process is only for pumping the feed and draw solution where two small laboratory scale centrifugal pumps were used at feed circulation rate of 3 6 l min 1 and an average water flux of 7 58 l m 2 h 1 for industrial wastewater feed the sec of fo process was calculated at 0 21 kw h m 3 lower sec in fo process has been reported in some cases 32 33 for 24 h study without cleaning the membrane the sec increased to 0 28 kw h m 3 as average water flux was low at 5 74 l m 2 h 1 when the same fo process was carried out with membrane cleaning a reduction in the sec was observed at 0 26 kw h m 3 this indicated that additional energy input in membrane cleaning could be compensated with higher average water flux the sec can be further reduced by optimizing the cleaning time the low fouling propensity of fo process can eliminate the need for feed treatment and chemical cleaning of membrane thus reducing costs and can be useful for high fouling feed 34 36 the nf process used for draw solute recovery and generation of pure water consumed much more energy than the fo process itself sec of the high pressure plunger pump at specific operating conditions was calculated at different feed pressures at 10 bar feed pressure and permeate flow of 111 6 l m 2 h 1 the sec was 8 8 kw h m 3 the sec of integrated fo nf system was around 9 06 kw h per m3 of pure water produced the pilot scale nf set up used here consumes more energy at lower throughput and sec decreases at higher trans membrane pressure low pressure nf ro systems have the potential to consume much lower energy 37 39 specially developed nf ro membrane has been reported to operate at very low pressure and provide higher permeate flux 40 this can perhaps replace the costly electrical energy with less expensive sources of energy like low grade heat or solar energy 41 these low pressure ro nf membrane systems can possibly be used for ds recovery which can help in reducing sec and can make the whole process commercially feasible 42 6 conclusion the performance of a low cost locally fabricated and widely available nf membrane in a forward osmosis process using mgcl2 as draw solute was assessed an initial detailed sem micrograph study of the low pressure nf membrane revealed porous pes top layer and highly porous support substrate facilitating water permeability essential for fo operation periodic sizes calculated from saxs profiles in dry state were as large as those measured by sem the fo process reported water flux of 6 9 l m 2 h 1 with low rsf of 0 1 0 3 gm 2 h 1 using 0 5 2 mol l 1 mgcl2 draw solution and pure water as feed structural parameter of the nf membrane was calculated at 2190 μm the water flux increased with draw solute temperature the maximum water flux was measured at 11 8 l m 2 h 1 at 55 c water flux was higher in the al ds orientation compared to al fs orientation low rsf ensured low draw solute replenishment cost and suitability in contamination sensitive application with a synthetic dye wastewater feed the membrane could reject feed solutes efficiently and allowed only pure water to pass through the fo process generated similar water flux with industrial wastewater feed at 7 58 l m 2 h 1 compared to 7 63 l m 2 h 1 with pure feed water using 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 draw solution loose fouling deposition was observed which could be easily removed by the pure water wash and more than 90 flux could be restored the membrane was able to perform even after multiple washing cycles specific energy consumption was determined at 0 26 kw h m 3 for fo process with industrial wastewater feed same membrane was used in low pressure nf operation 10 bar to recover mgcl2 draw solute solute retention was around 98 producing very good quality permeate water with tds content around 1000 mg l 1 overall the coupled fo nf process could produce good quality pure water from industrial wastewater with a prolonged membrane life further studies can be undertaken in optimizing the support layer and lowering the icp effect thereby increasing water flux which will expedite the fo process understanding the complex membrane solute interaction and system hydrodynamics will help in developing sustainable higher water flux after the initial dip increasing energy efficiency of draw solute recovery can make the integrated fo nf system for pure water generation from wastewater commercially viable declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the valuable contribution of

14198,forward osmosis fo using locally available nanofiltration nf membrane and magnesium chloride as draw solution has been carried out for concentration of wastewater maximum water flux of 11 8 l m 2h 1 with pure water feed at 55 c using 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 draw solution was observed water flux of 7 58 l m 2h 1 was obtained for industrial wastewater feed membrane fouling was found to be reversible and 90 water flux could be easily recovered by cleaning with deionised water specific energy consumption in the fo process was 0 26 kwh m 3 the membrane could effectively reject feed solutes for synthetic dye wastewater feed allowing only pure water to pass through draw solute recovery and better quality water generation 1000 mg l 1 tds was achieved by a low pressure nanofiltration process 10 bar recovery of mgcl2 by an alternate chemical method is also demonstrated morphology of the membrane was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy of the membrane surface and cross section small angle x ray scattering saxs investigation of the membrane is attempted to understand micro phase separated structures of this membrane overall the coupled fo nf process could produce good quality pure water

tortuosity of membrane 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is steadily emerging as a popular membrane process with the potentials of less energy consumption and ability to treat a plethora of complex and difficult aqueous streams 1 fo is an inherently simple natural process in which membrane and draw solution ds feature the two most important elements the concentrate draw solution pulls water from its feed dilute counterpart by virtue of the concentration difference through a semi permeable membrane currently remarkable research activities are underway in fo to make the technology commercially competitive with other conventional pressure driven membrane processes however a number of core issues such as water flux enhancement feed solute rejection controlling reverse solute flux rsf and mitigation of internal and external concentration polarization cp merit further attention a key aspect in fo membrane development lies in creating a structure for the facile diffusion of draw solutes through the support layer sl and efficient feed solute rejection by the active layer al correspondingly the draw solute should have high osmotic potential together with desirable properties like low cost low toxicity low reactivity wide availability and so on the strong interdependence between selection of draw solute and membrane development has been widely recognized 2 moreover an energy efficient recovery of draw solutes and subsequent generation of good quality potable water needs to be carried out to render the overall system commercially implementable the idea of using a ro or nf membrane either directly or modified as an improvised fo membrane stems from the premise that both shares a considerable structural as well as functional similarity literature cites a number of studies to explore the suitability of existing ro or nf membranes for fo applications some of these include direct performance check of similar membranes 3 5 casting a thin active layer on an existing membrane using as a support layer 6 and altering the pore structure of existing membrane by chemical 7 heat treatment 8 or by other means ro membranes having high structural parameter anywhere between 1000 and 10000 μm are reported to produce low water flux in fo process with low rsf and appreciable 80 feed solute rejection 9 10 nf membranes by virtue of their increased porosity and ability to work at reduced pressure are suitable for fo application where no external pressure is applied a short overview of the performance of different nf membranes in fo process is presented in table 1 however ro and nf membranes usually with thick support layer to withstand high pressure could become a severe bottleneck when used as a fo membrane resulting in diminished water flux due to internal concentration polarization icp 11 12 as fo process works in the absence of external pressure the support layer can be reduced optimized recently developed polyethersulphone pes based loose nanofiltration hollow fiber membranes having ultrahigh water permeability and well defined nanopores with application in low pressure water softening might be amenable to fo applications the cross linked pes membranes are also favoured due to their high temperature tolerance chemical resistance ease of fabrication wide range of pore size and lower costs in some fo applications nf membranes have reportedly performed better than existing fo membranes 13 most of the commercial fo membranes developed by hti inc modern water plc porifera inc etc which generate higher water flux are proprietary by nature and are not easily available in the open market this probably underscores a timely need for research and development of such low cost locally available nf membranes for fo application at least for preliminary lab scale studies inorganic salts are extensively studied as draw solutes for fo process and are proved to be effective due to their favourable physic chemical properties magnesium chloride mgcl2 is considered highly effective as draw solute on various counts for wastewater applications 14 16 being a divalent salt it can achieve high rejection efficiency when nf membranes are used for recovery 17 mgcl2 has low molecular weight 95 211 gmol 1 high water solubility 54 3 g 100 ml at 20 c low viscosity 0 05 kg m 1s 1 at 1 0 mol l 1 concentration at 25 c and thus can achieve higher osmotic pressure 256 5 atm at 2 0 mol l 1 concentration favourable for fo application although mg2 is classified as scale precursor ion which is likely to cause mineral salt scaling mg oh 2 precipitates out only at high alkaline condition ph 9 18 hence mgcl2 could be safely used in fo without risk of scaling 16 it is a locally produced low cost 70 ton high consumption commodity chemical and is widely used as dressing and filling of cotton fabrics in textile units polishing abrasive bricks for marbles tiles etc in ceramic industry and numerous other applications gujarat being an industrial hub generates a lot of textile wastewater with high colour content where mgcl2 is often used as a coagulant during the treatment process for disposal most of the work presented in the table 1 checked performance of nf membranes using mgcl2 as draw solute integrated fo nf systems using divalent salts like mgcl2 and na2so4 have been reported in recent times for potential energy and cost efficient application in desalination and wastewater treatment 9 14 19 the objective of the present work was to assess the suitability of a low cost locally manufactured commercial pes nf membrane in fo process using mgcl2 as draw solute for color removal from dye solution and concentration of industrial wastewater the working pressure range of the current membrane was low enough to enable its compatibility to work as a make shift fo membrane successfully a detailed unbiased performance study of the membrane in the fo process without any modification was undertaken an initial sem micrograph of the surface and cross section analysis was carried out for confirmation a detailed analysis of the porous pes membrane structure using small angle x ray scattering saxs method was also undertaken to the best of our knowledge detailed performance study of this membrane in fo process has hitherto not been reported in literature recovery of mgcl2 draw solute and generation of pure water have been demonstrated by nf process using the same membrane overall this study intends to provide useful insights towards development of an integrated fo nf system using low cost membrane and widely available materials to address potential concerns in wastewater handling and treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane the membrane named hfn 300 mwco 300 was procured from m s permionics membrane pvt ltd vadodara india it is cross linked thin film composite membrane with polysulfone support substrate over polyester fabric total thickness 200 μm and has the ability to withstand up to 60 c temperature 41 37 bar pressure and 2 10 ph as per manufacturer s specification the membrane is stable in mineral acids like hcl h2so4 h3po4 etc chlorine sanitizable and high divalent salt rejection ability 2 2 scanning electron microscopy analysis the sem images were obtained using jsm 6010la intouch scope jeol usa equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds with low vacuum lv mode for non conductive materials without pre treatment the microscope has 4 nm resolution at 20 kv 5x to 300000x magnification capacity 500 v to 20 kv accelerating voltage and up to 25 4 mm field of view a pristine membrane sample piece was used without any chemical pre treatment and was dried in a drying oven 40 c for 24 h the sample was sputter coated with gold palladium 80 20 before loading in the microscope 2 3 small angle x ray scattering saxs analysis saxs measurements were performed in a flow through capillary with a kratky type instrument saxsess from anton paar the cu target x ray tube operated at u 30 kv i 10 ma was used as a radiation source λ 0 154 nm the saxs data were collected as a function of scattering vector q 4π λ sin θ where 2θ is the scattering angle moving slit method 20 was applied for determination of the transmittance factor of the sample the sample holder background was subtracted from the saxs curves and next curves were corrected taking into consideration both sample thickness and transmittance 2 4 experimental set up fo experiments were performed in a custom designed laboratory scale experimental set up a flat sheet membrane piece was placed between two close ended flanged pipe arrangement with proper inlet and outlet completed with gasket and screw joints the fo test cell had an active area of 0 00114 m2 active layer of membrane faced feed solution fs and support layer faced draw solution al fs or fo mode orientation no spacers were used feed and draw solution were circulated at 3 6 l min 1 from the respective storage tanks by means of submersible centrifugal pumps a fresh membrane swatch was soaked in pure water for 60 min prior to its use for every new set of experiment the reduction in weight of the feed solution tank was recorded using a digital weighing balance at regular intervals of 1 min for first 30 min 5 min for the next 1 h and 10 min thereafter all experiments were performed at 30 2 c in batch mode where both the solutions after coming in indirect contact through the membrane were recycled back to their respective tanks concentration of ds was maintained through re concentration all performance study experiments were carried out for 4 h except long duration studies of 24 h the schematic diagram of the set up and some more related information can be found elsewhere 9 2 5 chemicals locally manufactured commercial grade magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o of 99 purity nacl 0 3 mgso4 0 4 and cacl2 0 4 max was used as draw solute the pure water conductivity 200 250 μs cm 1 used in flux study was acquired from a ro system industrial wastewater was obtained from a common effluent treatment plant located in a local industrial hub collecting effluent mainly from a cluster of cold steel rolling mill units manufacturing different types of engineering machineries wastewater sample was collected from the inlet of effluent treatment plant and directly used as fs in the fo experiments chemical analysis of industrial wastewater sample is presented in table 3 synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing three dyes namely methyl red 1 5 g indigo carmine 10 g and congo red 5 g in 1 l of water 2 6 nanofiltration experimental nanofiltration experiment was performed in a pilot scale cross flow nf unit supplied by the same manufacturer m s permionics having a flat sheet membrane module the same membrane which was used in fo setup was used the rectangular inner test cell which housed the membrane had dimensions of 160 mm 100 mm 2 mm with an effective membrane area of 0 016 m2 upper half of the cell incorporated the flow distribution chamber and lower half constituted the membrane support system an elaborate arrangement with a perforated 1 mm thick stainless steel plate along with a stainless steel 350 mesh gauge over the membrane provided mechanical support to membrane at high pressure operation the active layer of membrane faced the high pressure feed feed solution was pressurized by a high pressure plunger pump 3 14 bar the pilot plant was complete with circulation pumps pressure gauge rotameter sampling points feed and collection permeate and retentate tanks 2 7 permeability and diffusivity the water flux jw across membrane is directly proportional to the difference in osmotic potential between the feed and draw solution as shown in eq 1 1 j w a σ δ π where a is water permeability coefficient l m 2 h 1 bar 1 σ is reflection coefficient and δπ is the osmotic potential difference the value of reflection coefficient can be taken as unity when membrane rejects the solute completely in fo process due to high solute rejection σ is usually assumed unity rsf is affected by concentration difference between fs and ds and can be described by fick s law as follows 2 j s b δ c where b is solute permeability coefficient l m 2 h 1 and δc is concentration difference across the membrane g l 1 in actual case for an asymmetric membrane the rsf can be separate across active layer and support layer overall the mass transport across a membrane in fo process can be expressed in terms of the characteristic properties of membrane the hydrodynamics in the membrane flow cell and experimentally accessible parameters for membranes with high salt rejection the water flux jw in fo can be estimated using eq 3 21 3 j w a π d e x p j w s d π f e x p j w k 1 b j w e x p j w

parameter membrane structural parameter s t s τ is a critical intrinsic parameter dependent on membrane thickness ts tortuosity τ and porosity ε similarly the solute flux can be estimated by eq 4 21 4 j s b c d e x p j w s d c f e x p j w k 1 b j w e x p j w k e x p j w s d where cd and cf is solute concentration of the ds and fs respectively the transport equations 3 and 4 are only valid for fo operation under al fs mode 22 diffusion coefficient d can be expressed by stoke einstein equation as 5 d k b t 6 π η r where kb is boltzmann constant 1 381 10 23 j k 1 t is absolute temperature η is solvent viscosity and r represents the radius of spherical particles stoke einstein equation is generally applicable only for dilute solutions 23 the equation is essentially a thermodynamic model and assumes that under dilute conditions the spherical shaped solute has no interaction with each other and there is no resistance to transport of solute in bulk solution other empirical equations like wilke chang equation can also be used membrane parameters a b and s has been calculated numerically by fitting four sets of experimental values of jw and js at different concentrations as described by tiraferri et al 21 the transport eqs 3 and 4 for fo were fitted to the experimental water and solute flux values using nonlinear least square analysis with cd πd and cf πf as independent experimental variables and a b and s as regression parameters effect of concentrative ecp was neglected because pure water was used as fs consequently the value of e x p j w k was assumed to be 1 diffusion constants calculated by stoke einstein equation was 0 52 10 9 m2s 1 and 1 38 10 9 m2s 1 for mg2 ion and cl ion respectively for calculation purposes the diffusion constant was taken as 1 05 10 9 m2s 1 a constant d is assumed within the membrane support layer which is valid for small concentration range of 0 5 2 mol l 1 reflection coefficient was assumed to be unity due to high solute rejection capacity of the membrane also specific rsf js jw is assumed constant 16 18 the osmotic pressure generated by the solute was assumed to be related linearly to the solute concentration as per the van t hoff equation viscosity of 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution was measured at 1 05 10 3 kg m 1s 1 3 result discussion 3 1 sem analysis sem images of active layer surface support layer surface and the cross section of nf membrane are shown in fig 1 images of top layer of the pristine membrane at 4000 and 8000 magnification fig 1a b revealed compact surface with visible scattered pores intermittent bright spots on the surface are attributed to the presence of deposits having high conductivity which are proprietary additives added to increase hydrophilicity cross sectional images fig 1c d showed the typical asymmetric structure of the pes top layer composed of a thin sponge like skin layer 1 μm thickness and a porous bulk having straight finger like pores of 3 5 μm diameter with spongy walls the pes top layer is around 50 μm thick formed over a surface of a micro porous substrate of about 50 μm thickness by interfacial polymerization reaction the support substrate is a highly porous 50 μm thick polysulfone layer cast over a non woven polyester fabric fig 1e f by phase inversion gelling technique to provide necessary structural strength for pressurized nf operation can withstand up to 40 bar pressure the overall thickness of the membrane is around 200 μm together the porous pes top layer and highly porous support substrate tend to increase the water permeability even at low pressure nf operation rendering the membrane suitable for fo applications 3 2 saxs study the saxs curves of the investigated membrane are shown in fig 2 in double logarithmic plots because small angle x ray scattering is conditioned by the existence of the electron density non homogeneities in the sample which in case of membranes is due to the existence of pores in them the higher intensity is caused by higher content of pores in these membranes content of pores can be determined by calculating the scattering power or invariant q using the equation 6 q 0 q 2 i q d q φ 1 φ δ ρ 2 where i q is the corrected saxs intensity φ is the volume fraction of pores and δρ is the electron density difference between the pores and pes the pores may be assumed to be entirely air filled in dry membranes the electron density difference between pes and pores was calculated to be δρ 511 electrons nm3 24 for determination of pore sizes the guinier approximation describing the scattering intensity for small values of the scattering vector q can be used 7 i q i 0 e x p q 2 r g 2 3 eq 7 describes the mean intensity of radiation scattered by a particle of any shape averaged through all its possible orientations in space rg is electron radius of gyration also called the guinier radius rg can be determined from the slope of the plot between ln i q and q2 using the intensity data in the low q region saxs profile of the membrane in dry state is shown in fig 2 the average periodic spacing is 4 5 μm obtained from q position of the correlation peak observed in saxs pattern periodic spacing was calculated by using the equation d 2 π q the above results indicate that the micro phase separated structures of membranes in a dry condition can be evaluated by stained saxs 3 3 water flux study the performance of divalent salt mgcl2 as draw solute using nf membrane was evaluated the profile of water flux for 4 h operation using 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 draw solution with different feed and membrane orientation is presented in fig 3 a perusal of fig 3 reveals that water flux decreased with time and almost similar profile was observed in all cases sharp decline in water flux was noticed in the very first hour 90 of total decline the decrease in water flux was about 35 of initial flux after 4 h of operation thereafter the water flux was more or less maintained as displayed in the flattish profile fig 8a and the decline was very low 15 drop till 24 h of operation in al fs orientation and pure water feed the water transport from the feed side towards ds led to dilution of ds inside support layer the thick but porous support layer worked as a diffusive boundary layer thus reducing the net osmotic pressure across the active layer resulting in diminished water flux this phenomenon termed as dilutive internal concentration polarization icp occurred inside the support layer and was mostly responsible for the initial flux drop over and above it was difficult to eliminate when pure water was used as fs the effect of external concentration polarization ecp was minimal average rsf was less and measured at 0 175 g m 2 h 1 for pure water feed and 4 h operation however measurement of mgcl2 concentration of the bulk fs may not reveal the true picture nf membranes evidently do not reject 100 solutes the solutes which diffused through the membrane from draw side to feed side in al fs mode might have been retained near the active layer and did not diffuse into the bulk solution plausibly there was some interaction between the membrane and draw solute which prevented normal liberation of the solute ions also the majority of reverse solute transport across the membrane perhaps occurred during the first hour owing to maximum osmotic differential across selective layer this led to a sharp drop in net osmotic potential across the active layer during initial stage which could be the reason for sharp flux decline this was further authenticated by the performance of same membrane using nacl draw solute with pure water feed in al fs orientation nacl was able to diffuse easily and rapidly through the membrane pores mwco of 300 owing to small hydrated radii and was retained near the membrane surface the water flux profile showed sharp decline of flux compared to mgcl2 as more amount of nacl solute diffused resulting in least average flux in case of wastewater feed with mgcl2 draw solute the water flux profile revealed a high degree of similarity in the first hour when compared to pure water feed subsequently the magnesium ions which diffused through the membrane probably interacted with solute ions of the feed resulting in foulants deposition at membrane solution interface which further reduced the water flux a similar phenomenon was reported elsewhere with wastewater mgcl2 fo system 25 26 this resulted in lower average water flux in case of waste water feed compared to pure water feed after 4 h the flux profile with pure water feed in al ds orientation showed a similar downward trend albeit a flatter initial flux profile in the absence of concentrative icp effect in support layer the osmotic potential difference was at peak initially the leakage of solute and subsequent retention across the membrane as explained earlier might have resulted in a major decline in water flux permeation of water from feed to draw side led to dilutive ecp effect which also contributed to overall flux decline however there was higher average water flux in al ds mode compared to al fs mode for pure water feed fig 6 this advantage got nullified when wastewater was used as feed 27 nevertheless it must be noted that in all cases after an initial major dip in water flux the system gained some sort of equilibrium and thereafter water flux was maintained for a sufficiently long duration even though the final flux was much less compared to initial flux this phenomenon holds true even for wastewater feed the complex interaction between the membrane and solutes along with the hydrodynamics resulted in an almost stable system with respect to water flux similar observable fact is also highlighted in other research paper 14 which needs careful deliberation as can be observed from table 1 performance of this membrane was better compared to other nf membranes water flux obtained in the present study is low which is a major concern compared to commercially available proprietary fo membranes using mgcl2 and other draw solutes refer table 4 nevertheless a comparison with similar studies using nf membrane and mgcl2 as draw solute showed that the water flux in our case is almost comparable or at times even better refer table 1 in all the cases where the reported water flux is higher it is invariably coupled with high rsf the specific reverse solute flux js jw 0 023 g l 1 which is a major parameter in evaluating the membrane performance is much lower in our case compared to other nf membranes which makes this membrane worthy of further investigation suitable modification optimization of the support layer in order to enhance water flux without compromising rsf is essential 3 4 reverse solute flux study reverse solute flux is undesirable as it causes loss of precious draw solutes resulting in high replenishment costs and contamination of fs experiment with pure water feed showed rsf of 0 17 and 0 27 g m 2 h 1 at 1 and 2 mol l 1 mgcl2 ds concentration respectively the effective diameters of hydrated ions of mg2 and cl ion are 800 10 12 m and 300 10 12 m respectively 16 in aqueous solution mgcl2 tends to dissociate to one cation of magnesium mg2 and two anions of chloride cl as the pes membrane is negatively charged it tends to repel the chloride ions considering large size of hydrated mg2 ions the combination of all these factors resulted in low rsf the rsf increased with concentration of ds for pure feed water fig 4 due to increase in concentration difference driving force between ds and fs as explained by fick s law eq 2 though the larger solute size of mgcl2 helps achieving low rsf this is at the expense of low diffusivity which tends to increase dilutive icp resistance resulting in lower water flux js jw ratio of 0 023 g l 1 for 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 ds indicated low replenishment cost js jw ratio increased with ds concentration which somewhat contradicts the literature findings and the assumption that js jw is independent of ds concentration 16 18 this might be due to faster dilution of the ds inside support layer owing to higher water flux resulting in a reduction in net osmotic potential the rsf was much lower than what has been reported using other nf membranes both proprietary and fabricated with the same draw solute table 1 the specific rsf of 0 023 g l 1 is also lower than other nf membranes this is especially noteworthy as no specific methodology was adopted for countering rsf proprietary fo membranes by hti using 0 5 mol l 1 mgcl2 as ds reported higher water flux at 9 72 l m 2 h 1 but js jw was high too at 0 5 g l 1 16 compared to 5 8 l m 2 h 1 and 0 015 g l 1 in our case it also merits mentioning that low rsf makes the membrane suitable for applications like food pharmaceutical protein concentration where feed contamination is a sensitive issue a proper combination of membrane and draw solute for the fo process which can maintain a balance between permeability and selectivity is essential increasing water flux to expedite fo process without compromising rsf is a challenging task but necessary for overall implementation and feasibility of the system 3 5 membrane parameters the membrane parameters were calculated by single stage fo based test method as described by tiraferri et al the results are presented in table 2 which shows water and solute permeability coefficient values of 4 75 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 0 01 l m 2 h 1 respectively the structural parameter of nf membrane was determined at 2190 μm s is used to decide the extent of icp in the support layer of fo membranes and low s value is always preferable s value of cellulose tri acetate cta asymmetric membrane and polyamide thin film composite tfc membrane developed by hti inc for fo process are reportedly 600 μm and 450 μm respectively 32 fo membrane commercialized by porifera inc reported s value of 215 μm 33 on the contrary s value of ro membranes like sw30 dow chemical company is apparently much higher at 9583 μm 32 similarly other nf membranes reported more than 10000 μm 4 this is due to the presence of thick support layer in ro nf membranes which is required to withstand high pressure during operation considering that the nf membrane used in the present study has a total thickness of 200 μm and a significant support layer the value of structural parameter is much less compared to ro nf membranes but higher than fo membranes as reported in literature this may be due to the presence of pores in the pes top layer which is also evident from the sem images the hydrophilic polysulfone layer cast over non woven polyester support layer provided less tortuous path and allowed thorough wetting of support structure thus lowering the structural parameter as this membrane has been developed for low pressure nf operations ease of water permeability is vital for its application since fo process operates in the absence of external pressure hence further optimizing the support layer thickness will render this membrane more suitable for fo operation the value of solute resistivity k s d was found to be 2 086 106 s m 1 which was considerably high signifying high icp resulting in reduced water flux k value for cta fo membrane in similar system is reportedly much less at 4 5 105 s m 1 16 k value could be reduced by decreasing thickness and increasing void fraction of the membrane which are comparatively easier to achieve and provide free flow to the solute particles engineering the tortuosity of membrane is rather a difficult proposition however it may be noted that the structural parameter was determined by fo based test method in this paper this non pressurized methodology was found to be suitable for fo process compared to ro based methods since more accurate predictions of performance could be achieved 22 most of the values reported in literature used the conventional method ro fo based hence the values may not be directly comparable moreover while calculating the membrane parameters a b and s the bulk concentration of feed and draw solution were measured and taken into consideration the data were not corrected for icp effects therefore the actual osmotic pressure difference at the membrane interface is not the same as the calculated one furthermore the same icp effect keep the concentration of draw solution low at the support layer interface compared to bulk concentration thus it can be assumed that the deviation from ideality due to higher concentration is not significant and would have minimal effect on the generated osmotic pressure following van t hoff equation also it must be noted that the near constancy of js jw is a necessary condition for the successful application of this method 21 which was not observed in our case as js jw increased with ds concentration 3 6 effect of various parameters on water flux the effect of concentration temperature and flow rate of the ds along with membrane orientation on water flux and rsf was studied temperature and flow rate of pure water fs were kept constant and hence there was no variation effect of concentrative ecp on water flux water flux increased from 5 9 8 32 l m 2 h 1 with an increase in concentration of mgcl2 draw solute from 0 5 to 2 mol l 1 fig 4 osmotic potential of mgcl2 solution increased from 40 to 260 bar between 0 5 2 mol l 1 which was the primary reason for the increase in water flux as shown in eq 1 but the increase in water flux was not proportional to osmotic potential and was severely affected by dilutive icp increasing concentration hence did not help much in improving water flux for 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution there was more than 50 increase in water flux with an increase in ds temperature from 25 to 55 c fig 5a this could be attributed to net increase in osmotic potential to increase in temperature 28 the reduction in viscosity of ds caused by elevated temperature also enhanced the movement of water molecules resulting in increased diffusion of mgcl2 draw solutes through the support layer towards the membrane surface as shown by stoke einstein equation eq 5 thereby increasing the net osmotic potential across active layer at 55 c temperature the water flux was 11 8 l m 2 h 1 this is beneficial for hot tropical countries like india where temperatures up to 45 c in summer are common the experiments were not conducted at a higher temperature as the overall idea was to operate the fo process at or near ambient conditions the high temperature could perhaps damage the membrane or cause alteration in the pore structure of polymeric membranes this membrane is touted to withstand temperature of 60 c as per manufacturer specification the water flux increased from 5 8 to 7 63 l m 2 h 1 with an increase in the circulation flow rate of ds from 0 5 to 3 6 l min 1 fig 5b change in cross flow velocity can influence dilutive ecp at the surface of support layer dilutive ecp works as a barrier at the outside surface of membrane support layer to the incoming draw solute and outgoing permeate water higher cross flow velocities reduce thickness of the boundary layer making the permeated water move and mix faster in bulk ds the contribution of dilutive ecp towards decreasing net osmotic pressure is much less 10 20 compared to dilutive icp in al fs mode nevertheless it cannot be neglected especially at lower cross flow velocities 29 for maximum flow rate of 3 6 l min 1 and a cross flow velocity of 0 052 m s 1 the reynolds number was determined at 1910 implying laminar flow the degree of dilutive ecp can be estimated by boundary layer film theory and the ds side mass transfer coefficient k is calculated as 8 k s h d d h where dh is hydraulic diameter calculated dh 0 0381 m and sh is the dimensionless sherwood number which is estimated for laminar flow as 9 s h 1 85 r e s c d h l 1 3 where re and sc are reynolds and schmidt number respectively when cross flow velocity over the membrane was decreased from 0 052 m s 1 to 0 007 m s 1 the flow became more laminar and the boundary layer thickness increased hence the draw side mass transfer coefficient decreased from 6 03 10 6 m s 1 to 3 14 10 6 m s 1 48 decline this increased the barrier effect of dilutive ecp and as a result the flux decreased from 7 63 l m 2 h 1 to 5 8 l m 2 h 1 however an 86 decrease in cross flow velocity led to only 24 decrease in water flux therefore increase in cross flow velocity at the draw side resulted in the increase of water flux albeit in a subdued manner which was more prominent at lower cross flow velocities in the case of well designed thin membranes with highly porous support layer high cross flow velocity is argued to decrease boundary layer thickness to the extent that it is able to induce mixing in the support layer thus reducing dilutive icp effect 30 a careful cost calculation needs to be undertaken to evaluate the benefit of higher throughput at the expense of additional pumping costs to obtain optimal cross flow velocity incorporating well designed feed channels with spacers that can induce turbulence and cause enhanced mixing in boundary layer on either side of the membrane can be beneficial for industrial application membrane orientation also affects the water flux in fo process water flux was higher in case of al ds mode compared to al fs mode for pure water feed fig 6 this occurred because the draw solute faced resistance in the support layer al fs mode which resulted in dilutive icp it has been established that dilutive icp is the major cause of the decrease in net osmotic pressure drop in al fs mode and in some cases could contribute up to 60 of the net pressure drop 29 absence of draw solute in the support layer at the al ds mode did not result in dilutive icp usually al ds orientation is favoured in case of low concentration low fouling feed solutions like brackish water in desalination applications in case of high fouling scaling feed solution al fs mode provides a more stable and higher water flux 27 nevertheless the increase in water flux with concentration and temperature of ds coincided with an increase of rsf the above factors are responsible for higher diffusion of draw solute towards active layer through support layer resulting in high concentrations of draw solute at the sl al interface which is necessary to generate a large osmotic gradient ensuing high water flux but above factors do not increase the rsf selectivity of membrane active layer so this higher concentration of draw solute which increases the concentration gradient across the active layer could also increase the reverse salt flux it has been established that the reverse flux selectivity is independent of support layer structural parameter as well as bulk ds concentration 18 4 application in wastewater concentration 4 1 synthetic and industrial wastewater concentration the performance of the fo system was checked for synthetic and industrial wastewater feed with 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 as ds for 4 h operation at 30 c the water flux for synthetic and industrial wastewater was 6 6 and 7 58 l m 2 h 1 respectively compared to 7 63 l m 2 h 1 with pure water feed the observed difference in water flux might be due to a reduction in the net osmotic potential owing to the presence of dissolved solutes in fs also the presence of feed solutes might have instigated concentrative ecp effect reducing net osmotic potential across membrane active layer causing lower water flux the water flux profile was almost similar in all cases the change in colour of ds was checked by a turbidity meter after passage of 30 ml water in case of synthetic wastewater feed after 4 h operation fig 7a b initial and final turbidity of the ds were 0 5 ntu and 0 7 ntu respectively moreover when 30 ml of synthetic wastewater fs was directly added to 1030 ml ds the distinct colour difference fig 7c demonstrated optically that the membrane could reject feed solutes and allowed only pure water to pass through a 24 h study of the fo system performance with industrial wastewater feed and 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 ds was carried out without membrane cleaning the average water flux reduced to 5 74 l m 2 h 1 detailed analysis of the raw and concentrated industrial feed wastewater is presented in table 3 good quality water was successfully drawn out resulting in concentration of fs which could be observed by the increase of all major water quality parameters the ds concentration decreased from 1 0 0 8 mol l 1 which further confirmed water transport through the membrane concentration of sulfate nitrate and ammoniacal n in the ds were below detection limit indicating good feed rejection capacity of the membrane here it must be noted that incomplete solute rejection by the membrane will lead to gradual accumulation of feed solute in ds and will be noticeable after multiple recycle the performance of some commercial fo membranes using mgcl2 draw solute with different feed solutions is shown in table 4 commercial fo membranes developed after years of research clearly demonstrated higher water flux in most of the cases compared to the nf membrane used in our case only in few cases commercial fo membrane reported lower water flux 15 it is important to mention that the results may not be directly comparable owing to variation in wastewater composition moreover all the commercial fo membranes exhibited high rsf compared to our membrane the compromise in rsf makes the membranes vulnerable to applications where feed contamination is unacceptable 4 2 membrane regeneration and flux recovery fouling of membrane is unavoidable while handling industrial wastewater which results in a further decrease in water flux during long period of operation in order to mitigate fouling cleaning of membrane at regular interval assumes paramount importance the performance of the fo system with industrial wastewater feed and 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 as ds was checked with membrane cleaning at regular intervals an arrangement of feed tanks with proper piping and valve connections was set up which ensured alternate 4 h of fo operation followed by 1 h pure water circulation in the feed side the cycle was repeated multiple times without changing membrane and addition of small quantity makeup draw solute to maintain the ds concentration comparative experimental results with and without cleaning of the membrane are presented in fig 8 the initial water flux was 23 67 l m 2 h 1 which eventually dropped to 7 59 l m 2 h 1 after one hour of pure water recirculation the water flux could be recovered to the tune of 18 06 l m 2 h 1 which was around 76 of initial flux low flux recovery was a one off occurrence as the initial high flux was due to usage of the fresh membrane piece and non development of cp effect in the subsequent cycles water flux could be restored to almost previous cycle levels and the decrease was less than 5 each time the flux profile was also similar each time this indicated that particles were deposited loosely on the membrane surface in the absence of any external applied pressure which could be easily removed even after 10 cycles the membrane was fit for use the results implied that membrane fouling in the process was reversible for industrial wastewater feed and water flux could be restored by standard cleaning protocols this low fouling tendency also reported elsewhere 9 25 prolongs the life of membrane which leads to low operating cost fouling can also be reduced by making suitable changes in hydrodynamic conditions incorporating well designed spacers at feed side or by increasing cross flow velocity subsequently prolonging membrane life the cleaning cycle can be optimized to attain maximum average water flux 4 3 draw solute recovery by nanofiltration process recovery of draw solute after fo process is absolutely essential to facilitate reuse of precious draw solutes and simultaneous separation of water having a high level of purity separation must be achieved using minimal energy in order to keep the overall cost in check the same nf membrane was used for separation of water from mgcl2 draw solution in the pilot scale nf setup the nf setup was operated within the range of 3 10 bar pressure nf permeate samples were collected at definite time intervals and tds was measured fig 9 shows permeate flux and salt retention for the nf membrane using 0 5 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution as feed permeate flux increased from 30 111 l m 2 h 1 as pressure increased from 3 to 10 bar at 5 bar trans membrane pressure the flux and the solute retention were 65 l m 2 h 1 and 98 respectvely very good quality permeate water was produced with tds content less than 1000 mg l 1 concentrations of sulfate nitrate and ammoniacal n were found below detection limits however sophisticated analysis by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy gc ms is necessary to detect the presence of trace feed ions that might have leaked through the membrane in both fo and nf operation in order to confirm the potability of permeate in essence the nf process demonstrated generation of good quality water at low pressure which may be used for unrestricted irrigation purposes as suggested by giagnorio et al 25 a two pass nf can be used for further polishing and generation of potable quality water the concentrate stream of nf process having high mgcl2 content was recovered and reused as draw solution in the fo process with necessary make up addition of small quantities of mgcl2 was essential to compensate for the loss of draw solute due to incomplete rejection of mgcl2 in fo and nf steps no noticeable change was observed in the water flux of fo process due to usage of recycled mgcl2 solution possibility of accumulation of feed contaminants in the ds is unlikely when same membrane is used in both fo and nf steps this is because the feed contaminants which leak through the membrane in fo process will in all probability leak through the membrane in nf process as well and will be traceable in the permeate this can be advantageous compared to other fo hybrid systems involving higher selective membrane in regeneration step e g fo ro leading to accumulation of feed contaminants in draw solute which may render the draw solute unusable after multiple recycle and may need partial total replacement 4 4 alternate recovery of mgcl2 draw solute by chemical route mgcl2 can be recovered in pure mgcl2 6h2o form if absolutely required from nf concentrate through chemical route by precipitation method using 1 4 dioxane as demonstrated by fezei et al 31 1 4 dioxane c4h8o2 is a heterocyclic organic compound ether and is used widely as a solvent for paper cotton and textile processing and having presence in numerous household products a separate independent experiment was carried out to recover mgcl2 in 10 ml of 8 mol l 1 mgcl2 solution 7 ml of 1 4 dioxane was added the mixture was stirred in a temperature controlled mechanically stirred reactor for 40 min at 25 c and was allowed to settle for 1 h the precipitate was filtered using whatman filter paper 2 5 μm pore size about 5 6 g of wet precipitate of mgcl2 6h2o c4h8o2 was filtered in cake form along with 15 1 ml of filtrate the cake was dried for 1 h at 100 c to get 3 544 g mgcl2 6h2o giving a yield of 22 purity of mgcl2 6h2o was ascertained by comparing its melting point of 119 c melting point of mgcl2 6h2o is 117 c and was determined at 98 quality of filtrate which contained unrecovered mgcl2 along with excess dioxane and soluble mg complex chelates needs further verification before recycle or subsequent usage possibility of precipitation at lower concentrations of mgcl2 solution needs additional study it is important to mention that united states environmental protection agency usepa has classified 1 4 dioxane as a probable human carcinogen a more detailed study is required to ascertain the sustainability of this recovery process 5 energy consumption specific energy consumption sec for fo process was determined as the energy consumed kwh per unit volume of water transport m3 the energy required in fo process is only for pumping the feed and draw solution where two small laboratory scale centrifugal pumps were used at feed circulation rate of 3 6 l min 1 and an average water flux of 7 58 l m 2 h 1 for industrial wastewater feed the sec of fo process was calculated at 0 21 kw h m 3 lower sec in fo process has been reported in some cases 32 33 for 24 h study without cleaning the membrane the sec increased to 0 28 kw h m 3 as average water flux was low at 5 74 l m 2 h 1 when the same fo process was carried out with membrane cleaning a reduction in the sec was observed at 0 26 kw h m 3 this indicated that additional energy input in membrane cleaning could be compensated with higher average water flux the sec can be further reduced by optimizing the cleaning time the low fouling propensity of fo process can eliminate the need for feed treatment and chemical cleaning of membrane thus reducing costs and can be useful for high fouling feed 34 36 the nf process used for draw solute recovery and generation of pure water consumed much more energy than the fo process itself sec of the high pressure plunger pump at specific operating conditions was calculated at different feed pressures at 10 bar feed pressure and permeate flow of 111 6 l m 2 h 1 the sec was 8 8 kw h m 3 the sec of integrated fo nf system was around 9 06 kw h per m3 of pure water produced the pilot scale nf set up used here consumes more energy at lower throughput and sec decreases at higher trans membrane pressure low pressure nf ro systems have the potential to consume much lower energy 37 39 specially developed nf ro membrane has been reported to operate at very low pressure and provide higher permeate flux 40 this can perhaps replace the costly electrical energy with less expensive sources of energy like low grade heat or solar energy 41 these low pressure ro nf membrane systems can possibly be used for ds recovery which can help in reducing sec and can make the whole process commercially feasible 42 6 conclusion the performance of a low cost locally fabricated and widely available nf membrane in a forward osmosis process using mgcl2 as draw solute was assessed an initial detailed sem micrograph study of the low pressure nf membrane revealed porous pes top layer and highly porous support substrate facilitating water permeability essential for fo operation periodic sizes calculated from saxs profiles in dry state were as large as those measured by sem the fo process reported water flux of 6 9 l m 2 h 1 with low rsf of 0 1 0 3 gm 2 h 1 using 0 5 2 mol l 1 mgcl2 draw solution and pure water as feed structural parameter of the nf membrane was calculated at 2190 μm the water flux increased with draw solute temperature the maximum water flux was measured at 11 8 l m 2 h 1 at 55 c water flux was higher in the al ds orientation compared to al fs orientation low rsf ensured low draw solute replenishment cost and suitability in contamination sensitive application with a synthetic dye wastewater feed the membrane could reject feed solutes efficiently and allowed only pure water to pass through the fo process generated similar water flux with industrial wastewater feed at 7 58 l m 2 h 1 compared to 7 63 l m 2 h 1 with pure feed water using 1 mol l 1 mgcl2 draw solution loose fouling deposition was observed which could be easily removed by the pure water wash and more than 90 flux could be restored the membrane was able to perform even after multiple washing cycles specific energy consumption was determined at 0 26 kw h m 3 for fo process with industrial wastewater feed same membrane was used in low pressure nf operation 10 bar to recover mgcl2 draw solute solute retention was around 98 producing very good quality permeate water with tds content around 1000 mg l 1 overall the coupled fo nf process could produce good quality pure water from industrial wastewater with a prolonged membrane life further studies can be undertaken in optimizing the support layer and lowering the icp effect thereby increasing water flux which will expedite the fo process understanding the complex membrane solute interaction and system hydrodynamics will help in developing sustainable higher water flux after the initial dip increasing energy efficiency of draw solute recovery can make the integrated fo nf system for pure water generation from wastewater commercially viable declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the valuable contribution of

reported in the ftir and sem analyses as well in the column experiments run using laboratory simulated solution considerably the highest adsorption capacity of 362 8 mg g is obtained since these results are favourable column experiments have also been performed on composite electroplating effluents containing chromium ions notably for composite electroplating effluents maximum bed capacity of 50 05 mg g is obtained another key point is the favourable breakthrough time reported for 100 mg l chromium solution which is 1260 min further models such as thomas yoon nelson and bed depth service time bdst have also shown excellent fits on the whole the results revealed that the developed column is effective in handling effluent containing chromium besides this study also provides a better understanding of the adsorption process in composite industrial effluents keywords column fixed chromium electroplating lantana weed 1 introduction due to the rapid growth in chemical process industries concerns related to heavy metal contamination have increased in recent years 1 the industrial sources of chromium include stainless steel corrosion control paint tannery textile fertilizers wood preservation and electroplating units 2 as long as heavy metals persist in the aquatic environment they have more chances to accumulate through the food chain and cause serious health impacts 3 apparently since the late 19th century chromium s toxicity and carcinogenic properties have been well documented notably issues such as skin ulceration lung cancer and various respiratory related disorders such as bronchial asthma epistaxis and nasal irritation are commonly reported due to prolonged chromium exposure 4 among the various forms of chromium ions the hexavalent species is found to be highly toxic 5 the international agency for research on cancer iarc declared chromium as a group i human carcinogen further the us environmental protection agency usepa categorized chromium as an inhalation carcinogen in group a under these circumstances the world health organization set the permissible standard for chromium in drinking water as not to exceed 0 05 mg l the conventional technologies for metal removal include chemical precipitation oxidation solvent extraction ion exchange membrane separations electro dialysis and chemical coagulation some of the shortfalls of these techniques include ineffective separation at lower concentrations sludge handling chemical and energy consumption and economic viability 6 while adsorption is not a very new technique for the removal of heavy metals it is proven as the best technology worldwide 7 despite the problems involved in disposal and regeneration of the spent adsorbent the use of low cost and abundantly available materials as sorbents is one of the important criteria in adsorbent selection 8 some of the widely employed natural adsorbents are agricultural weed based algal bacterial fungal and plant based materials for instance numerous adsorption studies were reported in the past using the commonly seen cilantro coriandrum sativum and neem azadiracta indica leaves 9 11 most of the adsorbents derived from natural sources constitute significant functional groups required for adsorption some of them are hydroxyl carbonyl carboxylate carboxyl sulfonate imidazole sulfhydryl thioether amide amine phenolic phosphate and phosphodiester groups alternatively activation methods using heat 12 chemical 13 and selective functionalization techniques 14 were also widely employed to open the sites required for adsorption further carbonaceous amendments like activated carbon 15 and biochar 16 were also used to increase sorption capacity 17 different from biobased adsorbents there is another class of adsorbents derived from hybrid nanomaterials and bionanocomposites for instance recent research on organic inorganic hybrid materials using green geopolymer alginate hybrid spheres has proven to be an effective adsorbent for copper adsorption 18 very recently 19 reported the use of silver nanoparticles coupled with yttrium oxide for chromium adsorption and presented a very high adsorption capacity of 865 85 mg g meanwhile industrial waste based adsorbents such as tea factory waste 20 21 tannery waste 22 blast furnace slag 23 and bagasse fly ash 24 were also documented in some of the metal ion adsorption studies in general most of the time the kinetic and equilibrium results obtained from the batch experiments constitute insufficient data required for proper scaling up to fixed bed systems 25 specifically contact time obtained from batch adsorption studies cannot be scaled up directly for industrial adsorbers 26 under these circumstances the study of a packed bed system is more appropriate to understand industrial wastewater treatment 27 notably in a very recent publication 28 investigated the adsorption of methyl tert butyl ether onto zsm 5 zeolite using a fixed bed column and found a maximum adsorption capacity of 31 85 mg g 1 in the light of the above discussions the current research proposes the development of fixed bed adsorption column using chemically modified lantana camara to handle chromium ions the plant l camara is spread in and around 60 regions of the world occupying 13 million hectares in india specifically this invasive species pose a huge threat in western ghats india thus the study selectively used the fruits of l camara to adsorb chromium ions the research specifically focuses on achieving a reasonably higher adsorption capacity using appropriate chemical modifications in the biomass the potential of l camara based adsorbents to remove chromium ions was reported in our previous batch studies 29 30 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw adsorbent preparation the l camara fruits were collected from mudumalai tiger reserve mtr the nilgiris tamilnadu the fresh fruits were cleaned to remove impurities and washed several times with distilled water the cleaned fruits were subjected to drying at a temperature of 80 0c for almost 12 h and were then pulverized the sample is once again washed with distilled water to prevent colour leaching using buchner funnel with vacuum assisted conditions and allowed for drying at 60 0c for about 12 h after suitable sieving a particle size of 850 μm is obtained and this sample is referred to as ra adsorbent 2 2 chemically modified adsorbent preparation the ra adsorbent is then soaked with concentrated sulphuric acid in weight ratio 1 1 for about 10 h at room temperature to remove the residual acids the acid treated material was then rinsed several times with distilled water the sample herein referred to as aa adsorbent is then allowed to dry at 60 0c for almost 12 h all the drying process used in the preparation of the adsorbent is carried in a hot air oven and the entire sample preparation procedure was carried out in one week this acid treated adsorbent is used to conduct fixed bed column studies 2 3 characterization fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir nicolet is 10 usa and scanning electron microscope sem carl zeiss sigma version germany were used to determine the functional groups and morphology of the adsorbent respectively these analyses were done on metal ion loaded samples as well surface area and porosity analyzer micromeritics asap 2010 usa was used to determine surface area and porosity 2 4 lab simulated solutions 1000 mg l stock chromium solution is obtained by dissolving 2 8287 g of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in 1000 ml distilled water further sample solutions of concentration 100 200 and 300 mg l were made using the stock solution the ph of these solutions was modified to 1 5 using 0 1 n hydrochloric acid 2 5 wastewater analysis of effluents of nickel chromium plating unit from electroplating industry the wastewater samples were collected from the electroplating industry located at chinnavedampatti coimbatore industrial wastewater parameters were estimated according to is 3025 standards the samples were collected from the mixed rinse bath containing chromium and nickel the industry is a small scale electroplating unit generating wastewater of about 500 l day the plant is operated for the past 53 years since 1966 the plant operates zinc chromium nickel chromium copper silver tin and electroless nickel plating operations specifically rinsing generates a huge volume of wastewater with varying heavy metal ion concentrations in the effluents 2 6 fixed bed column studies the internal diameter and length of the glass column used in the experiment are 2 54 cm and 30 cm respectively the glass beads and glass wool placed at the top and bottom of the column supported the adsorbent bed to avoid the air gap at first a known weight of powdered aa adsorbent prepared in the form of slurry is sent into the column in downward flow mode the schematic of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the weight of the adsorbent packed into the column varied based on the varying depths of the packing the effluents containing metal ions of predetermined concentrations with the required ph and fixed flow rate were sent into the column in the downward mode using a peristaltic pump the column was run using both laboratory prepared solutions and industrial effluents the treated effluents were collected every 60 min at the outlet of the column subsequently these samples were tested for the determination of chromium ions the investigations of column process parameters on laboratory simulated samples were carried out as given in table 1 additionally desorption studies were carried out by passing the desorbing agent into the exhausted bed at appropriate flow rates the concentration of the metal ion solution at the exit of the packed column was investigated at periodic intervals the regenerated adsorbent was again subjected to adsorption studies after the desorption process was completed likewise the adsorption desorption processes were carried out in three cycles until their exhaustion using 0 4 n naoh solution 2 7 modeling of fixed bed adsorption column data 2 7 1 calculations of significant parameters of the fixed bed adsorption system the performance of the fixed bed column study is evaluated based on the breakthrough curves obtained from the curve ci co vs t the important parameters of

experimental value respectively and n is the number of experimental data points 3 results and discussions 3 1 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectra of aa and chromium loaded aa adsorbent are shown in fig 2 as the column is operated for a long time more and more chromium ions are adsorbed onto the adsorbent bed hence many clusters of new small peaks emerged between 1544 cm 1 to 1702 cm 1 wavenumbers very importantly a shift of oh group from 3384 to 3396 cm 1 and co stretch from 1628 to 1640 cm 1 is an indication of a significant morphological change in the chromium loaded adsorbent furthermore the disappearance of 1399 cm 1 co and 1037 cm 1 coh peaks confirm the involvement of these groups in the adsorption of chromium ions 3 2 surface morphology studies to understand the surface morphology of the materials raw and acid treated adsorbents were subjected to sem analysis as seen in fig 3 a a c a highly porous network is seen in the images of raw adsorbent meanwhile in the sem images of acid treated adsorbent as seen in fig 3 a d e a complete transformation is noticed in the morphology and dimensions of the pore network these pores are not uniform and randomly distributed throughout the entire framework as expected after the adsorption of metal ions a further change in morphology is observed in the chromium loaded adsorbent samples as seen in fig 3 a f the figure shows a prominent and enlarged pore and this is a typical pattern of a metal loaded adsorbent sample thus the sem imaging analysis confirmed the diffusion of metal ions on to the acid based adsorbent additionally the edx imaging of the raw and acid treated samples were shown in fig 3 b and c on the positive note all the significant elements found in the edx spectrum of raw adsorbent are also seen in acid treated adsorbent this is compelling evidence to understand that no significant functionalities of the absorbent have been removed by acid treatment 3 3 bet and elemental studies of raw and acid treated adsorbents the results of bet analyses of raw and acid treated adsorbents showed a surface area of 0 0850 m² g and 0 1829 m² g respectively both the adsorbents exhibited a low surface area but they are found to be macroporous pore size 50 nm however as the raw adsorbent was treated with sulphuric acid the surface area of acid treated adsorbent is found to be almost three times higher than the unmodified adsorbent as the acid treatment involves dehydration and dissolution of external layers the structure of the raw adsorbent is altered and the surface area is hence improved in general for porous adsorbents pore volume and pore size play an active role in adsorption compared to the surface area in this regard a pore volume of 0 011452 cm³ g reported for the modified adsorbent explains the suitability of the material for the sorption studies 3 4 influence of varying process parameters on column adsorption 3 4 1 bed height studies the fixed bed column experiments were run with a chromium solution of 100 mg l concentration at 4 ml min for varying bed heights 2 3 and 4 cm an s shaped curve is obtained and is shown in fig 4 a an increase in bed height from 2 to 4 cm at an interval of 1 cm resulted in an increase of breakthrough and exhaustion times the increase in the breakthrough time from 300 to 1260 min is attributed to the longer distance of the mass transfer zone established by the 4 cm adsorbent bed in other words the residence time of the chromium ions in the adsorbent bed increases and hence longer contact time facilitated better adsorption besides at increased bed depths and adsorbent dosages it is obvious that more active sites are available for the sorption of metal ions as this bed is longer the column is operated for a long time and the exhaustion time increased from 2640 to 4740 minutes further the longer bed also increased the output of the treated effluents increased breakthrough at higher bed depth is due to the development of rapid and broadened mass transfer zone in the packed bed it is noted from table 2 that a bed of 4 cm delivered 18 96 liters volume of treated output whereas a 2 cm bed generated only 10 56 liters of treated effluent this is because at lower bed heights axial dispersion occurs which affects the overall mass transfer process thereby reducing the diffusion of the adsorbate the results therefore show that the 4 cm bed has the potential to be used for a longer time than the shorter 2 cm bed moreover in the 4 cm bed the delayed breakthrough time increased the amount of treated effluents correspondingly the chromium uptake capacity and the sorption efficiency continue to increase with an increase in the bed depth table 2 notably the adsorption efficiency improved from 52 6 59 8 and the sorption capacity increased from 189 6 222 2 mg g hence to enhance the overall performance of the fixed bed adsorption system higher bed depths are considered desirable additionally while designing the column the ratio of bed depth to particle diameter was maintained to be greater than 20 to minimize wall and axial dispersion effects 3 4 2 flow rate studies the adsorption studies on the fixed bed column were done at different flow rates as defined in table 2 these studies were carried out for a 100 mg l chromium solution at a maximum fixed bed depth of 4 cm it is inferred from fig 4 b that with the increase in flow rates the slope of the curve increases and the breakthrough curve becomes steeper as seen in the figure breakthrough time was found to be decreasing with an increase in flow rates and reached a minimum of 540 min at 6 ml min further with an increase in flow rates a decrease in bed capacity and adsorption efficiency is noticed table 2 this is due to the poor interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbates at higher flow rates 34 but positively an extended breakthrough time of 1260 min was noticed for a flow rate of 4 ml min correspondingly with the increase in flow rates the adsorption efficiency reduced from 59 8 to 52 9 and the bed capacity varied from 222 2 mg g to 186 6 mg g at higher flow rates the flow turbulence increases which further decreases the external mass transfer resistance pronounced in the adsorbent particle surfaces hence at increased flow rates the rate at which the chromium ions are adsorbed on to the sorbent surfaces increases leading to an earlier breakthrough time and fast saturation this also reduces the treated output from 18 9 liters to 17 6 liters on the whole the retention time of chromium ions in the adsorbent bed decreases at higher flow rates therefore the metal ions do not have sufficient interaction with the adsorbent surfaces and a reduced adsorption capacity is established hence it is concluded that a column operated at lower flow rates increases the contact time and achieves better performance however while handling large volumes of effluents a very low flow rate increases the overall treatment time and hence not considered favorable and an optimum flow rate will have to be selected moreover as column diameter to particle ratio selected in the study is maintained in the range of 10 20 favourable adsorption is noticed at lower flow rates leading to decreased flow resistance with negligible wall effects in addition problems such as channeling packed bed compression and head losses are prevented as well 3 4 3 concentration studies to understand the effect of concentration on breakthrough curves the adsorption studies on the fixed bed column were done at the different metal concentrations as defined in table 2 the breakthrough time appeared to be longer for lower metal concentration and hence larger volumes of effluent were treated fig 4c table 2 shows that a treated volume of 18 96 liters is obtained in the column loaded with a 100 mg l chromium solution alternatively a volume of 11 28 liters of treated effluent is reported in the column operated using 300 mg l chromium solution correspondingly the breakthrough time was found to be 1260 600 and 300 min for 100 200 300 mg l chromium ions concentration respectively this is because at 100 mg l chromium ions a lower concentration gradient is developed and this decreased the diffusion coefficient and established a slower transport of metal ions on to the adsorbent surfaces however at 300 mg l metal ion concentration the adsorbent bed is saturated with metal ions in the very beginning leading to early breakthrough time and fast saturation 35 this fast saturation and short breakthrough curves are due to faster transport of metal ions onto the sorbent surfaces also the driving forces for the mass transfer increases at higher adsorbate concentrations and as a result the adsorption capacity increases at higher chromium ion concentration on the whole the maximum adsorptive capacities at 100 200 and 300 mg l chromium ions are reported to be 222 2 mg g 322 2 mg and 362 8 mg g respectively these results comply with the results of other researchers 36 37 in contrast the adsorption efficiency decreased from 59 8 53 6 with an increase in metal ion concentration from 100 to 300 mg l as can be seen in the above findings the diffusion of metal ions is found to be totally concentration dependent during the past 5 years there were several studies reported on acid treated adsorbents for chromium removal using fixed bed column 38 40 in comparison to these adsorbents the present study resulted in higher adsorption capacity of 362 8 mg g hence it is understood that unlike in other acid modified adsorbents in addition to porosity the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups of acid modified l camara also played a significant role in enhancing the adsorption process 3 5 modeling of column data 3 5 1 thomas model thomas model assumes second order reversible reaction kinetics and langmuir isotherm to calculate the adsorbent capacity and predict breakthrough curves 41 moreover they are very appropriate when internal and external diffusion resistances are small 42 specifically the column adsorption capacity q0 and thomas model constant kth are the significant outcomes of the model column data modeling using thomas model was done at different metal concentrations bed depth and flow rates as given in table 3 the validity of the model is shown by the high r2 value obtained under various experimental conditions the results of the model show that with an increase in flow rates the column sorption capacity decreases with an increase in kth values table 3 on the contrary kth values established a decreasing trend and the column adsorption capacity increased with increasing chromium concentration in other words this trend suggests that at higher concentrations the pollutant sorption rate decreases this trend is due to the fact that the model assumes that the adsorption is not limited by chemical reaction and is assumed to be governed by interface mass transfer on the other hand at higher chromium ion concentration the driving force is more due to the huge difference in metal ion concentrations at adsorbent and adsorbate phases this phenomenon ultimately leads to an increase in column adsorption capacity at higher metal ion concentrations a similar trend is developed with the change in adsorbent bed heights hence to increase the adsorption capacity and achieve better column performance lower flow rate higher bed depth and metal concentrations are considered to be optimal the important parameters in the thomas model have arrived from the plot of ln co ci 1 and time as shown in fig 5 a c 3 5 2 yoon nelson model the experimental column data obtained by varying different process parameters were fitted with this model as given in table 3 the significant outcomes of the model are the yoon nelson rate constant kyn and the time required for 50 of the chromium ions to attain breakthrough τ based on the high coefficient of determination r2 value the validity of the model is found to be satisfactory these parameters were derived from the results of the plot ln ci c0 ci vs time t the plot gives a straight line and slope and intercept of the plots were found to be kyn and τ respectively as shown in fig 6 a c the column parameters calculated from yoon nelson model is presented in table 3 as can be seen in the modeling equation kyn and τ are known to be inversely related as expected the rate constant kyn increases and the τ decreases with an increase in both metal ion concentrations and flow rates this is due to the fact that at higher metal ion concentration more metal ions compete for the adsorption sites resulting in the rapid uptake of metal ions on the other hand rapid saturation of the adsorbent bed also leads to a decrease in adsorbate breakthroughs contrary to this trend the values of rate constant decreased and τ increased with an increase in bed height further as more ions enter into the system at higher flow rates the rate constant increases with an increase in flow rate 3 5 3 bed depth service time bdst model one of the important segments in a column study is to determine the service time of the adsorbent bed the calculation of bdst parameters helps in scaling up the adsorption results for any fixed metal ion concentration and flow rates without performing additional experiments this analysis is carried out for a 100 mg l chromium concentration at 4 ml min in various outlets to inlet concentrations it establishes a linear relationship between the service times of the column and the bed height and related constants are calculated as shown in tables 3 and 4 a higher r2 value is seen for the entire outlets to inlet concentrations for ci co 0 2 0 3 and 0 5 establishing a better fit of the model fig 7 moreover on increasing ci co the bed adsorption capacity per unit bed volume n0 increases from 51408 to 58344 mg l due to more buildup of metal ions on the adsorbent bed table 3 alternatively with an increase in ci co values the rate constant decreases and the least value is obtained for 50 ci co this trend indicates that a longer bed is needed to avoid early breakthroughs but in general if the rate constant value is higher that is the rate at which chromium ions are adsorbed is more even a shorter adsorbent bed will delay the breakthrough the service time of the bed is predicted at a given concentration of 100 mg l chromium concentration and a flow rate of 4 ml min at these conditions the column performance is predicted for a solution of 200 mg l chromium concentration and a flow rate of 5 ml min for ci co 0 20 0 30 and 0 51 the experimental and predicted time is shown in table 4 specifically a very good prediction is obtained for the new flow rate than the metal ion concentration 3 6 desorption and regeneration studies three cycles of adsorption desorption processes were done until the exhaustion of the bed using 0 4 n naoh at a flow rate of 4 ml min in a 4 cm bed column the regeneration experiments were conducted in the column loaded with a metal solution of concentration 100 mg l in cycle 1 the column was allowed to run until the concentration of influent and outlet remains the same and the adsorption capacity was calculated subsequently the exhausted column was regenerated using appropriate eluents and the regeneration efficiency was calculated regeneration efficiency is given by the ratio of qreg to qorg where qreg is the adsorption capacity of the column after regeneration and qorg is the original adsorption capacity of the column similarly the adsorption desorption studies were carried out in the second and third cycles as well as expected the breakthrough time gradually decreased after every cycle notably the regeneration efficiency of the loaded column in the first second and third cycles is reported to be 71 58 and 30 respectively fig 8 the result implies that the regeneration of the acid treated adsorbent column is found to be satisfactory using the selected eluent 3 7 breakthrough analysis of composite industrial effluents the effluents were collected from the ni cr plating bath of the electroplating industry this composite electroplating wastewater solution was sent into the fixed bed using the peristaltic pump and the breakthrough analysis was carried out the flow rate and the bed height to conduct column studies on plating effluents were maintained to be 4 ml min and 4 cm respectively the breakthrough analysis of plating effluents with respect to chromium ions resulted in a breakthrough time tb of 900 min and the exhaustion point of 3660 min as shown in fig 9 further the breakthrough effluent volume vb ml and total effluent volume vt ml were found to be 3600 ml and 14640 ml respectively in addition maximum bed capacity of 50 05 mg g is reported for chromium effluents with a removal efficiency of 59 2 it is important to realize that the maximum bed capacity of the adsorbent is lower for industrial effluents containing chromium compared to the laboratory prepared chromium solution this is due to the competitive adsorption of the other interfering ions in the composite effluents the comparison of adsorption capacity of chemically modified l camara with other adsorbents used in various packed bed column studies for chromium removal is shown in table 5 from the table it is understood the proposed adsorbent has a remarkably high adsorption capacity than many adsorbents used in the fixed bed column studies in fact the adsorption capacity of the studied adsorbent is even higher than py fe3o4 nanocomposite as evident from the table in addition the table also shows that the bed capacity revealed in the current study is much higher than the recently investigated biochar supported nzvi composite for chromium removal 4 conclusion a significant shift of oh group and c 0 stretch in the chromium loaded adsorbent is an indication of strong adsorption as established in functional group analyses in addition the improved metal adsorption is also recognized by the visibly expanded pores of the metal loaded sample as seen in the sem analysis compared to the recently reported adsorbents the current study reported a higher adsorption capacity of 362 8 mg g the study hypothesis of developing a fixed bed column for chromium ion adsorption with the greatest adsorption capacity is thus demonstrated further a breakthrough effluent volume of 5 liters presents the novelty of acid treated l camara adsorbent in the removal of chromium ions from the continuous adsorption system the regenerative efficiency of the fabricated column was also proven which ensures the successful reuse of the adsorbent however for electroplating effluents containing a composite sample a maximum bed capacity of 50 05 mg g was reported hence further studies are to be carried out to understand the competitive adsorption of metal ions and to ensure the effective utilization of the adsorbent in the multi metal ions system acknowledgements the authors are grateful to center of excellence in advanced materials and green technologies coe amgt amrita school of

14199,the current study proposes to address the growing concerns related to chromium discharges from metal plating facilities for this purpose acid treated lantana camara is synthesized and continuous adsorption experiments were conducted on the fixed bed column set up some of the desirable attributes of the adsorbent are their favourable functional groups and the porous nature these findings are reported in the ftir and sem analyses as well in the column experiments run using laboratory simulated solution considerably the highest adsorption capacity of 362 8 mg g is obtained since these results are favourable column experiments have also been performed on composite electroplating effluents containing chromium ions notably for composite electroplating effluents maximum bed capacity of 50 05 mg g is obtained another key point is the favourable breakthrough time reported for 100 mg l chromium solution which is 1260 min further models such as thomas yoon nelson and bed depth service time bdst have also shown excellent fits on the whole the results revealed that the developed column is effective in handling effluent containing chromium besides this study also provides a better understanding of the adsorption process in composite industrial effluents keywords column fixed chromium electroplating lantana weed 1 introduction due to the rapid growth in chemical process industries concerns related to heavy metal contamination have increased in recent years 1 the industrial sources of chromium include stainless steel corrosion control paint tannery textile fertilizers wood preservation and electroplating units 2 as long as heavy metals persist in the aquatic environment they have more chances to accumulate through the food chain and cause serious health impacts 3 apparently since the late 19th century chromium s toxicity and carcinogenic properties have been well documented notably issues such as skin ulceration lung cancer and various respiratory related disorders such as bronchial asthma epistaxis and nasal irritation are commonly reported due to prolonged chromium exposure 4 among the various forms of chromium ions the hexavalent species is found to be highly toxic 5 the international agency for research on cancer iarc declared chromium as a group i human carcinogen further the us environmental protection agency usepa categorized chromium as an inhalation carcinogen in group a under these circumstances the world health organization set the permissible standard for chromium in drinking water as not to exceed 0 05 mg l the conventional technologies for metal removal include chemical precipitation oxidation solvent extraction ion exchange membrane separations electro dialysis and chemical coagulation some of the shortfalls of these techniques include ineffective separation at lower concentrations sludge handling chemical and energy consumption and economic viability 6 while adsorption is not a very new technique for the removal of heavy metals it is proven as the best technology worldwide 7 despite the problems involved in disposal and regeneration of the spent adsorbent the use of low cost and abundantly available materials as sorbents is one of the important criteria in adsorbent selection 8 some of the widely employed natural adsorbents are agricultural weed based algal bacterial fungal and plant based materials for instance numerous adsorption studies were reported in the past using the commonly seen cilantro coriandrum sativum and neem azadiracta indica leaves 9 11 most of the adsorbents derived from natural sources constitute significant functional groups required for adsorption some of them are hydroxyl carbonyl carboxylate carboxyl sulfonate imidazole sulfhydryl thioether amide amine phenolic phosphate and phosphodiester groups alternatively activation methods using heat 12 chemical 13 and selective functionalization techniques 14 were also widely employed to open the sites required for adsorption further carbonaceous amendments like activated carbon 15 and biochar 16 were also used to increase sorption capacity 17 different from biobased adsorbents there is another class of adsorbents derived from hybrid nanomaterials and bionanocomposites for instance recent research on organic inorganic hybrid materials using green geopolymer alginate hybrid spheres has proven to be an effective adsorbent for copper adsorption 18 very recently 19 reported the use of silver nanoparticles coupled with yttrium oxide for chromium adsorption and presented a very high adsorption capacity of 865 85 mg g meanwhile industrial waste based adsorbents such as tea factory waste 20 21 tannery waste 22 blast furnace slag 23 and bagasse fly ash 24 were also documented in some of the metal ion adsorption studies in general most of the time the kinetic and equilibrium results obtained from the batch experiments constitute insufficient data required for proper scaling up to fixed bed systems 25 specifically contact time obtained from batch adsorption studies cannot be scaled up directly for industrial adsorbers 26 under these circumstances the study of a packed bed system is more appropriate to understand industrial wastewater treatment 27 notably in a very recent publication 28 investigated the adsorption of methyl tert butyl ether onto zsm 5 zeolite using a fixed bed column and found a maximum adsorption capacity of 31 85 mg g 1 in the light of the above discussions the current research proposes the development of fixed bed adsorption column using chemically modified lantana camara to handle chromium ions the plant l camara is spread in and around 60 regions of the world occupying 13 million hectares in india specifically this invasive species pose a huge threat in western ghats india thus the study selectively used the fruits of l camara to adsorb chromium ions the research specifically focuses on achieving a reasonably higher adsorption capacity using appropriate chemical modifications in the biomass the potential of l camara based adsorbents to remove chromium ions was reported in our previous batch studies 29 30 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw adsorbent preparation the l camara fruits were collected from mudumalai tiger reserve mtr the nilgiris tamilnadu the fresh fruits were cleaned to remove impurities and washed several times with distilled water the cleaned fruits were subjected to drying at a temperature of 80 0c for almost 12 h and were then pulverized the sample is once again washed with distilled water to prevent colour leaching using buchner funnel with vacuum assisted conditions and allowed for drying at 60 0c for about 12 h after suitable sieving a particle size of 850 μm is obtained and this sample is referred to as ra adsorbent 2 2 chemically modified adsorbent preparation the ra adsorbent is then soaked with concentrated sulphuric acid in weight ratio 1 1 for about 10 h at room temperature to remove the residual acids the acid treated material was then rinsed several times with distilled water the sample herein referred to as aa adsorbent is then allowed to dry at 60 0c for almost 12 h all the drying process used in the preparation of the adsorbent is carried in a hot air oven and the entire sample preparation procedure was carried out in one week this acid treated adsorbent is used to conduct fixed bed column studies 2 3 characterization fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir nicolet is 10 usa and scanning electron microscope sem carl zeiss sigma version germany were used to determine the functional groups and morphology of the adsorbent respectively these analyses were done on metal ion loaded samples as well surface area and porosity analyzer micromeritics asap 2010 usa was used to determine surface area and porosity 2 4 lab simulated solutions 1000 mg l stock chromium solution is obtained by dissolving 2 8287 g of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in 1000 ml distilled water further sample solutions of concentration 100 200 and 300 mg l were made using the stock solution the ph of these solutions was modified to 1 5 using 0 1 n hydrochloric acid 2 5 wastewater analysis of effluents of nickel chromium plating unit from electroplating industry the wastewater samples were collected from the electroplating industry located at chinnavedampatti coimbatore industrial wastewater parameters were estimated according to is 3025 standards the samples were collected from the mixed rinse bath containing chromium and nickel the industry is a small scale electroplating unit generating wastewater of about 500 l day the plant is operated for the past 53 years since 1966 the plant operates zinc chromium nickel chromium copper silver tin and electroless nickel plating operations specifically rinsing generates a huge volume of wastewater with varying heavy metal ion concentrations in the effluents 2 6 fixed bed column studies the internal diameter and length of the glass column used in the experiment are 2 54 cm and 30 cm respectively the glass beads and glass wool placed at the top and bottom of the column supported the adsorbent bed to avoid the air gap at first a known weight of powdered aa adsorbent prepared in the form of slurry is sent into the column in downward flow mode the schematic of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the weight of the adsorbent packed into the column varied based on the varying depths of the packing the effluents containing metal ions of predetermined concentrations with the required ph and fixed flow rate were sent into the column in the downward mode using a peristaltic pump the column was run using both laboratory prepared solutions and industrial effluents the treated effluents were collected every 60 min at the outlet of the column subsequently these samples were tested for the determination of chromium ions the investigations of column process parameters on laboratory simulated samples were carried out as given in table 1 additionally desorption studies were carried out by passing the desorbing agent into the exhausted bed at appropriate flow rates the concentration of the metal ion solution at the exit of the packed column was investigated at periodic intervals the regenerated adsorbent was again subjected to adsorption studies after the desorption process was completed likewise the adsorption desorption processes were carried out in three cycles until their exhaustion using 0 4 n naoh solution 2 7 modeling of fixed bed adsorption column data 2 7 1 calculations of significant

experimental value respectively and n is the number of experimental data points 3 results and discussions 3 1 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectra of aa and chromium loaded aa adsorbent are shown in fig 2 as the column is operated for a long time more and more chromium ions are adsorbed onto the adsorbent bed hence many clusters of new small peaks emerged between 1544 cm 1 to 1702 cm 1 wavenumbers very importantly a shift of oh group from 3384 to 3396 cm 1 and co stretch from 1628 to 1640 cm 1 is an indication of a significant morphological change in the chromium loaded adsorbent furthermore the disappearance of 1399 cm 1 co and 1037 cm 1 coh peaks confirm the involvement of these groups in the adsorption of chromium ions 3 2 surface morphology studies to understand the surface morphology of the materials raw and acid treated adsorbents were subjected to sem analysis as seen in fig 3 a a c a highly porous network is seen in the images of raw adsorbent meanwhile in the sem images of acid treated adsorbent as seen in fig 3 a d e a complete transformation is noticed in the morphology and dimensions of the pore network these pores are not uniform and randomly distributed throughout the entire framework as expected after the adsorption of metal ions a further change in morphology is observed in the chromium loaded adsorbent samples as seen in fig 3 a f the figure shows a prominent and enlarged pore and this is a typical pattern of a metal loaded adsorbent sample thus the sem imaging analysis confirmed the diffusion of metal ions on to the acid based adsorbent additionally the edx imaging of the raw and acid treated samples were shown in fig 3 b and c on the positive note all the significant elements found in the edx spectrum of raw adsorbent are also seen in acid treated adsorbent this is compelling evidence to understand that no significant functionalities of the absorbent have been removed by acid treatment 3 3 bet and elemental studies of raw and acid treated adsorbents the results of bet analyses of raw and acid treated adsorbents showed a surface area of 0 0850 m² g and 0 1829 m² g respectively both the adsorbents exhibited a low surface area but they are found to be macroporous pore size 50 nm however as the raw adsorbent was treated with sulphuric acid the surface area of acid treated adsorbent is found to be almost three times higher than the unmodified adsorbent as the acid treatment involves dehydration and dissolution of external layers the structure of the raw adsorbent is altered and the surface area is hence improved in general for porous adsorbents pore volume and pore size play an active role in adsorption compared to the surface area in this regard a pore volume of 0 011452 cm³ g reported for the modified adsorbent explains the suitability of the material for the sorption studies 3 4 influence of varying process parameters on column adsorption 3 4 1 bed height studies the fixed bed column experiments were run with a chromium solution of 100 mg l concentration at 4 ml min for varying bed heights 2 3 and 4 cm an s shaped curve is obtained and is shown in fig 4 a an increase in bed height from 2 to 4 cm at an interval of 1 cm resulted in an increase of breakthrough and exhaustion times the increase in the breakthrough time from 300 to 1260 min is attributed to the longer distance of the mass transfer zone established by the 4 cm adsorbent bed in other words the residence time of the chromium ions in the adsorbent bed increases and hence longer contact time facilitated better adsorption besides at increased bed depths and adsorbent dosages it is obvious that more active sites are available for the sorption of metal ions as this bed is longer the column is operated for a long time and the exhaustion time increased from 2640 to 4740 minutes further the longer bed also increased the output of the treated effluents increased breakthrough at higher bed depth is due to the development of rapid and broadened mass transfer zone in the packed bed it is noted from table 2 that a bed of 4 cm delivered 18 96 liters volume of treated output whereas a 2 cm bed generated only 10 56 liters of treated effluent this is because at lower bed heights axial dispersion occurs which affects the overall mass transfer process thereby reducing the diffusion of the adsorbate the results therefore show that the 4 cm bed has the potential to be used for a longer time than the shorter 2 cm bed moreover in the 4 cm bed the delayed breakthrough time increased the amount of treated effluents correspondingly the chromium uptake capacity and the sorption efficiency continue to increase with an increase in the bed depth table 2 notably the adsorption efficiency improved from 52 6 59 8 and the sorption capacity increased from 189 6 222 2 mg g hence to enhance the overall performance of the fixed bed adsorption system higher bed depths are considered desirable additionally while designing the column the ratio of bed depth to particle diameter was maintained to be greater than 20 to minimize wall and axial dispersion effects 3 4 2 flow rate studies the adsorption studies on the fixed bed column were done at different flow rates as defined in table 2 these studies were carried out for a 100 mg l chromium solution at a maximum fixed bed depth of 4 cm it is inferred from fig 4 b that with the increase in flow rates the slope of the curve increases and the breakthrough curve becomes steeper as seen in the figure breakthrough time was found to be decreasing with an increase in flow rates and reached a minimum of 540 min at 6 ml min further with an increase in flow rates a decrease in bed capacity and adsorption efficiency is noticed table 2 this is due to the poor interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbates at higher flow rates 34 but positively an extended breakthrough time of 1260 min was noticed for a flow rate of 4 ml min correspondingly with the increase in flow rates the adsorption efficiency reduced from 59 8 to 52 9 and the bed capacity varied from 222 2 mg g to 186 6 mg g at higher flow rates the flow turbulence increases which further decreases the external mass transfer resistance pronounced in the adsorbent particle surfaces hence at increased flow rates the rate at which the chromium ions are adsorbed on to the sorbent surfaces increases leading to an earlier breakthrough time and fast saturation this also reduces the treated output from 18 9 liters to 17 6 liters on the whole the retention time of chromium ions in the adsorbent bed decreases at higher flow rates therefore the metal ions do not have sufficient interaction with the adsorbent surfaces and a reduced adsorption capacity is established hence it is concluded that a column operated at lower flow rates increases the contact time and achieves better performance however while handling large volumes of effluents a very low flow rate increases the overall treatment time and hence not considered favorable and an optimum flow rate will have to be selected moreover as column diameter to particle ratio selected in the study is maintained in the range of 10 20 favourable adsorption is noticed at lower flow rates leading to decreased flow resistance with negligible wall effects in addition problems such as channeling packed bed compression and head losses are prevented as well 3 4 3 concentration studies to understand the effect of concentration on breakthrough curves the adsorption studies on the fixed bed column were done at the different metal concentrations as defined in table 2 the breakthrough time appeared to be longer for lower metal concentration and hence larger volumes of effluent were treated fig 4c table 2 shows that a treated volume of 18 96 liters is obtained in the column loaded with a 100 mg l chromium solution alternatively a volume of 11 28 liters of treated effluent is reported in the column operated using 300 mg l chromium solution correspondingly the breakthrough time was found to be 1260 600 and 300 min for 100 200 300 mg l chromium ions concentration respectively this is because at 100 mg l chromium ions a lower concentration gradient is developed and this decreased the diffusion coefficient and established a slower transport of metal ions on to the adsorbent surfaces however at 300 mg l metal ion concentration the adsorbent bed is saturated with metal ions in the very beginning leading to early breakthrough time and fast saturation 35 this fast saturation and short breakthrough curves are due to faster transport of metal ions onto the sorbent surfaces also the driving forces for the mass transfer increases at higher adsorbate concentrations and as a result the adsorption capacity increases at higher chromium ion concentration on the whole the maximum adsorptive capacities at 100 200 and 300 mg l chromium ions are reported to be 222 2 mg g 322 2 mg and 362 8 mg g respectively these results comply with the results of other researchers 36 37 in contrast the adsorption efficiency decreased from 59 8 53 6 with an increase in metal ion concentration from 100 to 300 mg l as can be seen in the above findings the diffusion of metal ions is found to be totally concentration dependent during the past 5 years there were several studies reported on acid treated adsorbents for chromium removal using fixed bed column 38 40 in comparison to these adsorbents the present study resulted in higher adsorption capacity of 362 8 mg g hence it is understood that unlike in other acid modified adsorbents in addition to porosity the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups of acid modified l camara also played a significant role in enhancing the adsorption process 3 5 modeling of column data 3 5 1 thomas model thomas model assumes second order reversible reaction kinetics and langmuir isotherm to calculate the adsorbent capacity and predict breakthrough curves 41 moreover they are very appropriate when internal and external diffusion resistances are small 42 specifically the column adsorption capacity q0 and thomas model constant kth are the significant outcomes of the model column data modeling using thomas model was done at different metal concentrations bed depth and flow rates as given in table 3 the validity of the model is shown by the high r2 value obtained under various experimental conditions the results of the model show that with an increase in flow rates the column sorption capacity decreases with an increase in kth values table 3 on the contrary kth values established a decreasing trend and the column adsorption capacity increased with increasing chromium concentration in other words this trend suggests that at higher concentrations the pollutant sorption rate decreases this trend is due to the fact that the model assumes that the adsorption is not limited by chemical reaction and is assumed to be governed by interface mass transfer on the other hand at higher chromium ion concentration the driving force is more due to the huge difference in metal ion concentrations at adsorbent and adsorbate phases this phenomenon ultimately leads to an increase in column adsorption capacity at higher metal ion concentrations a similar trend is developed with the change in adsorbent bed heights hence to increase the adsorption capacity and achieve better column performance lower flow rate higher bed depth and metal concentrations are considered to be optimal the important parameters in the thomas model have arrived from the plot of ln co ci 1 and time as shown in fig 5 a c 3 5 2 yoon nelson model the experimental column data obtained by varying different process parameters were fitted with this model as given in table 3 the significant outcomes of the model are the yoon nelson rate constant kyn and the time required for 50 of the chromium ions to attain breakthrough τ based on the high coefficient of determination r2 value the validity of the model is found to be satisfactory these parameters were derived from the results of the plot ln ci c0 ci vs time t the plot gives a straight line and slope and intercept of the plots were found to be kyn and τ respectively as shown in fig 6 a c the column parameters calculated from yoon nelson model is presented in table 3 as can be seen in the modeling equation kyn and τ are known to be inversely related as expected the rate constant kyn increases and the τ decreases with an increase in both metal ion concentrations and flow rates this is due to the fact that at higher metal ion concentration more metal ions compete for the adsorption sites resulting in the rapid uptake of metal ions on the other hand rapid saturation of the adsorbent bed also leads to a decrease in adsorbate breakthroughs contrary to this trend the values of rate constant decreased and τ increased with an increase in bed height further as more ions enter into the system at higher flow rates the rate constant increases with an increase in flow rate 3 5 3 bed depth service time bdst model one of the important segments in a column study is to determine the service time of the adsorbent bed the calculation of bdst parameters helps in scaling up the adsorption results for any fixed metal ion concentration and flow rates without performing additional experiments this analysis is carried out for a 100 mg l chromium concentration at 4 ml min in various outlets to inlet concentrations it establishes a linear relationship between the service times of the column and the bed height and related constants are calculated as shown in tables 3 and 4 a higher r2 value is seen for the entire outlets to inlet concentrations for ci co 0 2 0 3 and 0 5 establishing a better fit of the model fig 7 moreover on increasing ci co the bed adsorption capacity per unit bed volume n0 increases from 51408 to 58344 mg l due to more buildup of metal ions on the adsorbent bed table 3 alternatively with an increase in ci co values the rate constant decreases and the least value is obtained for 50 ci co this trend indicates that a longer bed is needed to avoid early breakthroughs but in general if the rate constant value is higher that is the rate at which chromium ions are adsorbed is more even a shorter adsorbent bed will delay the breakthrough the service time of the bed is predicted at a given concentration of 100 mg l chromium concentration and a flow rate of 4 ml min at these conditions the column performance is predicted for a solution of 200 mg l chromium concentration and a flow rate of 5 ml min for ci co 0 20 0 30 and 0 51 the experimental and predicted time is shown in table 4 specifically a very good prediction is obtained for the new flow rate than the metal ion concentration 3 6 desorption and regeneration studies three cycles of adsorption desorption processes were done until the exhaustion of the bed using 0 4 n naoh at a flow rate of 4 ml min in a 4 cm bed column the regeneration experiments were conducted in the column loaded with a metal solution of concentration 100 mg l in cycle 1 the column was allowed to run until the concentration of influent and outlet remains the same and the adsorption capacity was calculated subsequently the exhausted column was regenerated using appropriate eluents and the regeneration efficiency was calculated regeneration efficiency is given by the ratio of qreg to qorg where qreg is the adsorption capacity of the column after regeneration and qorg is the original adsorption capacity of the column similarly the adsorption desorption studies were carried out in the second and third cycles as well as expected the breakthrough time gradually decreased after every cycle notably the regeneration efficiency of the loaded column in the first second and third cycles is reported to be 71 58 and 30 respectively fig 8 the result implies that the regeneration of the acid treated adsorbent column is found to be satisfactory using the selected eluent 3 7 breakthrough analysis of composite industrial effluents the effluents were collected from the ni cr plating bath of the electroplating industry this composite electroplating wastewater solution was sent into the fixed bed using the peristaltic pump and the breakthrough analysis was carried out the flow rate and the bed height to conduct column studies on plating effluents were maintained to be 4 ml min and 4 cm respectively the breakthrough analysis of plating effluents with respect to chromium ions resulted in a breakthrough time tb of 900 min and the exhaustion point of 3660 min as shown in fig 9 further the breakthrough effluent volume vb ml and total effluent volume vt ml were found to be 3600 ml and 14640 ml respectively in addition maximum bed capacity of 50 05 mg g is reported for chromium effluents with a removal efficiency of 59 2 it is important to realize that the maximum bed capacity of the adsorbent is lower for industrial effluents containing chromium compared to the laboratory prepared chromium solution this is due to the competitive adsorption of the other interfering ions in the composite effluents the comparison of adsorption capacity of chemically modified l camara with other adsorbents used in various packed bed column studies for chromium removal is shown in table 5 from the table it is understood the proposed adsorbent has a remarkably high adsorption capacity than many adsorbents used in the fixed bed column studies in fact the adsorption capacity of the studied adsorbent is even higher than py fe3o4 nanocomposite as evident from the table in addition the table also shows that the bed capacity revealed in the current study is much higher than the recently investigated biochar supported nzvi composite for chromium removal 4 conclusion a significant shift of oh group and c 0 stretch in the chromium loaded adsorbent is an indication of strong adsorption as established in functional group analyses in addition the improved metal adsorption is also recognized by the visibly expanded pores of the metal loaded sample as seen in the sem analysis compared to the recently reported adsorbents the current study reported a higher adsorption capacity of 362 8 mg g the study hypothesis of developing a fixed bed column for chromium ion adsorption with the greatest adsorption capacity is thus demonstrated further a breakthrough effluent volume of 5 liters presents the novelty of acid treated l camara adsorbent in the removal of chromium ions from the continuous adsorption system the regenerative efficiency of the fabricated column was also proven which ensures the successful reuse of the adsorbent however for electroplating effluents containing a composite sample a maximum bed capacity of 50 05 mg g was reported hence further studies are to be carried out to understand the competitive adsorption of metal ions and to ensure the effective utilization of the adsorbent in the multi metal ions system acknowledgements the authors are grateful to center of excellence in advanced materials and green technologies coe amgt amrita school of
