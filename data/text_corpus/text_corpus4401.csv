22005,blowout is a catastrophic accident in offshore drilling operations and it poses a serious threat to the operational safety of an offshore platform this paper uses a computational fluid dynamics cfd model to simulate an offshore platform blowout accident and to assess its impact on the assets and personnel it integrates the dispersion of flammable gas with the subsequent deflagration due to the accidental ignition the dispersion behavior of blowout gas with wind is predicted and the hazardous area generated on an offshore platform is assessed also the effect of well productivity on the blowout gas dispersion is examined subsequently the deflagration scenario due to ignition of flammable gas is simulated to predict the deflagration loads including overpressure high temperature and heat radiation eventually the impact of blowout gas deflagration on offshore platform and personnel is assessed the hazardous area generated by blowout gas dispersion is mainly distributed on the drill floor the increase of well productivity can cause an increase of the hazardous area the minimum radius to ensure the safety under deflagration overpressure is 30 63 m the present work could help in conducting a prior risk assessment and tomake an emergency response plan keywords offshore platform blowout accident gas dispersion deflagration safety assessment 1 introduction blowout is one type of major accident that may occur in offshore drilling operations in which a volume of flammable gas is discharged from the wellhead and disperses on an offshore platform a deflagration accident may be induced when flammable gas cloud is ignited by the potential ignition sources existing on the offshore platform yang et al 2019 shi et al 2017 as per the historical statistics the main risk associated with offshore platforms is oil and gas release incident arising from human error equipment failure and management flaws about 70 of offshore platform accidents are caused by highly destructive oil and gas fire and explosion which have a catastrophic impact on humans equipment and the environment paik et al 2011 deepwater horizon accident was a graphic case dadashzadeh et al 2013 skogdalen and vinnem 2012 nowadays many studies have been conducted to model the dispersion and explosion of flammable gas in blowout accident or other scanrios zhang and chen 2010 joshi et al 2016 the cfd based approaches were widely adopted because of the advantages of low cost and risk compared to field experiments tauseef et al 2011 tan et al 2018 jiao et al 2019 yi et al 2019 li et al 2018 carried out a systematic simulation of gas dispersion and deflagration above sea from a subsea release yang et al 2018 built a cfd based procedure to study potential accident scenarios in an offshore facility with the different ignition source locations dadashzadeh et al 2016 proposed a cfd based model to evaluate the dispersion behavior of hydrogen gas after a release from a hydrogen fuel cell car in an enclosed area the above mentioned studies illustrated the cfd approach to be a useful tool to reproduce an accident triggered by flammable gas release and to obtain the detailed information relating to the accidents a blowout accident during drilling operations has a large influencing range and it is difficult to assess the accident hazards using a field experiment due to the high risk and cost the cfd approach is an alternative method in modeling and assessment of such an accident zhu and chen 2010 built an integrated model in the hills to simulate the blowout accident and to assess the consequences of so2 poisoning ma and zhang 2011 employed the cfd approach to model the sour gas dispersion in the atmosphere after blowout these studies focused on an onshore blowout accident during drilling operations the exploration and development of oil and gas resources is moving into the deep oceans where drilling operations are challenged by higher risk due to the harsh environmental conditions the offshore drilling platform is the main tool used to extract oil and gas resources from the ocean since it is far from land there is difficulty in rescuing workers and evacuating the platform in the case of a blowout accident consequently understanding the risk of offshore platform blowout accident is in high demand recently some studies have been carried out on the risk assessment of different aspects of offshore blowout accident the data driven model was developed to predict the dimension of flammable cloud in the congested offshore platform and to predict the explosion consequence shi et al 2018 2019 an integral model to track the fate and transport of underwater oil and gas plume from the subsea blowout yapa and chen 2004 wang et al 2018 meng et al 2018 identified the systematic hazards and restrictions of the deepwater well control system khakzad et al 2014 integrated the event tree and hierarchical bayesian analysis to assess the risk of offshore blowouts using precursor data a series of quantitative risk analysis methodologies were developed to identity the hazards in drilling operations and to prevent and control the blowout accidents abimbola and khan 2016 khakzad et al 2013 chang et al 2018 dadashzadeh et al 2013 reproduced the deepwater horizon blowout accident and assessed the consequences such as flammable gas cloud explosion nevertheless offshore blowout accident is a systematic cascading evolution process including several stages the researchers above studied offshore blowout accident from several different aspects e g modeling of underwater fate and transport of contaminants explosion consequences and probabilistic risk assessment etc the fire and explosion incidents may appear in a rapid sequence when a blowout accident occurs the accurate assessment of an offshore blowout accident needs to consider blowout gas release dispersion and deflagration scenarios as a whole however most previously developed models only focused on one of the stages of blowout accident evolution and the systematic studies integrating the entire blowout accident process are sporadic therefore a comprehensive simulation to reveal the detailed process of blowout accident and to assess its impact is required the considerable previous studies have illustrated that the application of a validated cfd code fluent can give a convincing result in the field of simulation of gas release dispersion fire and explosion thus this paper uses the fluent based cfd code to model and assess the dispersion and deflagration of blowout gas the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the dispersion and deflagration behavior of flammable gas from an offshore platform blowout the novelty of this paper is an integration of blowout gas dispersion with the subsequent deflagration consequence for this purpose an integrated cfd model is built blowout gas dispersion with wind is simulated to predict the spatial distribution of flammable gas cloud and assess the hazardous area distributed on an offshore platform considering the accidental ignition the deflagration scenario is considered to predict the distribution of overpressure high temperature and heat radiation the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theoretical model of blowout gas dispersion and deflagration whereas simulation model and calculation method are provided in section 3 blowout gas dispersion is analyzed in section 4 and the subsequent deflagration consequence is assessed in section 5 section 6 summarizes the conclusions of this paper 2 theoretical model 2 1 blowout gas jet the blowout gas jet is a complex process involving material transport and turbulence motion blowout gas jet process can be simplified as shown in fig 1 in which the wind direction is from the left to the right blowout gas is released from the wellhead and the pressure reduces rapidly to the atmospheric level internal energy of blowout gas at high pressure is considered to completely transform into kinetic energy the exchange of momentum heat and mass of blowout gas with the surrounding air occurs in the drag zone the motion direction and velocity of blowout gas is changed before moving into the dispersion zone due to the effect of wind or ground structures which may cause a certain momentum loss zhu and chen 2009 the modeling of blowout gas dispersion is subject to the following assumptions the densities of gases in the computational domain have very little changes in the dispersion the movement of gas belongs to the transient turbulence the dispersion process of blowout gas is an incompressible flow with low speed 2 2 basic governing equations the dispersion of blowout gas involves turbulence motion substance dispersion and thermal transmission and is assumed to be a steady jet process it follows the mass energy and momentum conservations the blowout gas dispersion includes the following control equations zhu and chen 2010 li et al 2019 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j v u i x j τ i j x j 3 ρ h t p t ρ u j h x j x j λ t x j i n ρ d i h i y i x j μ t p r t h i x j s e where ρ is the

conductivity t is temperature p rt is turbulence prandtl number d i is the dispersion coefficient of component i h i is the enthalpy of component i s e is the energy source blowout gas is a multi

μ t s c t y i x j s i where y i is the mass fraction of component i s ct is the turbulent schmidt number s i is the source item of component i the dispersion of blowout gas is an unsteady turbulence motion and the turbulent characteristics of blowout gas in the dispersion process are considered by the realizable κ ε model 2 3 deflagration model a deflagration accident occurs when blowout gas encounters ignition sources such as high temperature or open flame the overpressure and heat radiation generated during deflagration may cause severe damage to an offshore platform and personnel mixture fraction combustion model is widely used in simulation of a large scale deflagration accident and is also employed in the present paper the basic assumption of mixture fraction combustion model is that the transient thermochemical status of fluid only depends on a single conserved scalar i e mixture fraction f the component concentration of combustion product is calculated by solving the transport equations of mixture fraction distribution the mixture fraction f is defined by applying equation 5 fluent 2011 5 f z i z i o x z i f u e l z i o x where z i is the mass fraction of component i z i ox is the mass fraction at the oxidant s entry while z i fuel is the mass fraction at fuel entry the chemical reaction of combustion is calculated by chemical equilibrium hypothesis or non chemical equilibrium hypothesis the substantial heat is released during blowout gas combustion the heat radiation is obtained by solving transfer equations of heat radiation energy the available radiation model includes p 1 model do model and surface radiation model p 1 radiation model is capable of accounting for the scattering effect of radiation in addition it can solve transfer equations with less computational complexity therefore this paper adopted p 1 model to calculate the heat radiation flux of deflagration the control equation is as following 6 q r 1 3 α σ s c σ s g where q r is radiation heat α is absorption coefficient σ s is scattering coefficient c is the linear diverse phase coefficient g is incident radiation the simulation of blowout gas deflagration is subject to the following assumptions both blowout gas and air are incompressible the diffusion flux of all variables at the boundaries of the computational domain is zero ignoring the loss of radiative heat the combustion reaction between blowout gas and air is the complete reaction of one step blowout gas was released from the wellhead during deflagration 3 modeling blowout gas dispersion and deflagration case study a semi submersible drill platform is utilized for illustrative purposes based on the size of this offshore platform cad is used to establish the three dimensional geometric shape model of the offshore platform as shown in fig 2 an actual offshore platform has a complex appearance structure which may increase the difficulty of mesh generation and calculation cost as a result a certain simplification is carried out during the geometric model establishment of the offshore platform the main structures on an offshore platform are considered including the main deck drill floor living area helicopter deck crane etc at the same time the structures and equipment with less influence on blowout gas dispersion are simplified e g internal structure of retreat air vent personnel passage and guardrail etc the size of the computational domain is 5 times the size of an offshore platform the dividing blocks method is used to generate the required mesh model the whole computational domain is divided into a central domain containing the offshore platform and five rectangular regions around the center region the pressure gradient at the wellhead obviously varies and a relatively dense grid density is adopted for the area around the wellhead which is achieved by a size function blowout gas gradually evolves into the steady flow state during dispersion from wellhead to outward area thus the grids with the larger size are used for the areas away from the wellhead to reduce calculation nodes and improve the calculation speed the central area of computational domain is affected by the irregular shape of the offshore platform the triangular tetrahedral grids are utilized in this region to adapt the complex shapes of the offshore platform the regular hexahedral grids are used for the external regions of the central computational region fig 3 presents the established mesh model used for the simulation a grid independence test is carried out to find the suitable grid density required by simulation which can ensure the simulation results independent from grid size the simulations with a set of grids with the different numbers are performed the grids with the larger size are used and then the grid size is reduced to check the effect of grid size change on simulations this paper uses three grids with the different sizes 3 6 106 4 8 106 and 6 2 106 the spatial distribution of blowout gas cloud and overpressure at the rig are predicted using these grids the comparisons reflect that the difference between the simulations with the grid numbers of 3 6 106 and 4 8 106 is about 1 8 whereas the difference between the simulations with grid numbers 3 6 106 and 6 2 106 is about 2 1 overall the simulations with different grid numbers are consistent thus the grid number used in this article is 3643520 considering the computational cost boundary condition definition is a critical step for numerical modeling for the whole computational domain the symmetrical boundary is set for the top plane the front plane and the back plane of computational domain the wellhead is set as the velocity inlet boundary where the jet velocity of blowout gas is given the surface of the offshore platform is set as the no slip boundary the left side of the computational domain is set as the velocity inlet boundary to consider the effect of wind it is assumed that the atmospheric stability is at the level of a and a wind speed profile function shown in eq 7 is used to define the wind velocity inlet li et al 2019 the temperature gradient is 0 018 k m and it is defined along with velocity inlet fig 4 depicts the steady wind speed field in the computation domain it is observed that an apparent wind speed gradient is presented in the vertical direction and wind speed increases with height an offshore platform has a great effect on the wind speed distribution because of the obstruction and reflection of topsides and other modules of an offshore platform the velocity and direction of airflow varies noticeably some areas with low airflow speed are generated on the offshore platform which may cause the accumulation of flammable gas the right side of the computational domain is set as the outflow boundary which is the outlet of wind 7 u z u 10 z 10 0 091 where u z is the wind speed at height of z m above sea surface u 10 is the wind speed at height of 10 m above sea the simulation of gas dispersion and deflagration from offshore platform blowout is divided into three steps firstly the wind field is calculated to generate steady wind speed distribution in the computational domain and the time step is 1 s subsequently the gas dispersion with the wind is simulated to predict the impact range of flammable gas and the time step is 0 1 s finally the deflagration of flammable gas after ignition is analyzed to assess the impact on the offshore platform and personnel the explosion is a very quick phenomena and it is generally measured in milliseconds thus the time step is 0 001 s the transient solution algorithm is utilized to solve the simulation 4 dispersion of blowout gas 4 1 blowout gas dispersion behavior the release rate of blowout gas depends on the well productivity the well in the south china sea is used to illustrate blowout gas dispersion behavior the well productivity is about 36 2 108 m3 yr which is used to assess the blowout gas flowrate blowout gas mainly consists of methane and the volume fraction is about 87 9 the maximum wind speed is 21 m s and the air temperature is 301 k flammable gas is released from the wellhead at a very high speed when the blowout occurs and is gradually blended with the ambient air the surrounding air is entrained into natural gas and disperses with the blowout gas eventually the steady flow state of gas is formed the isosurface of 2 methane volume fraction is defined as the spatial range of blowout gas fig 5 presents the dispersion process of blowout gas blowout gas enters the wellhead plane and expands rapidly due to the rapid decrease of surrounding pressure due to the action of the high pressure of the well blowout gas moves in an upward direction in the initial stage of blowout the flow of blowout gas is mainly driven by the high pressure of the well during this stage blowout gas is less affected by wind and the offset to the stern is also small with the increase in time blowout gas gradually moves away from the wellhead region the dispersion velocity along the vertical direction of the computation domain decreases and the action of wind increases the dispersion distance of blowout gas in the horizontal direction of the computational domain increases continuously the blowout gas under wind disperses towards the stern from the simulation results it can be found that the gas cloud mainly distributes in the upper space of the drill floor and this has little effect on most topsides of the offshore platform fig 6 depicts the variation process of blowout gas dispersion range overall the geometric size of the gas cloud increases over time and then reaches the steady values the geometric size of the blowout gas cloud increases rapidly within 0 10 s after the blowout accident occurs due to the high pressure of the well gas mainly moves in a vertical direction at about 20 s the height of the blowout gas cloud is approximately 60 m due to the action of the wind from the bow the dispersion distance in the longitudinal direction of the platform is about 25 m however the dispersion distance in a lateral direction is about 10 m the geometric size of the blowout gas cloud drops a little after 30 s with the increase in time the blowout gas cloud eventually reaches the steady state 4 2 assessment of hazardous area the deflagration limit volume fraction of natural gas ranges from 0 05 to 0 15 and the area described within this concentration range is defined as the hazardous area fig 7 gives the hazardous area distribution in the vertical plane of an offshore platform at different times in which the concentration of natural gas in the area coloured red exceeds 0 05 vol fraction after the blowout accident occurrence the high pressure gas in the well moves into the drill floor area at 2 s the height of the hazardous area is 6 m measured from wellhead to the upper border and the width is 1 38 m at 10 s the height of the hazardous area is 21 m and the width is 2 81 m the influencing area of blowout gas increases with the increase in time the height of the hazardous area is 29 21 m and the weight is 4 85 m at 80 s the height of hazardous area reaches 29 99 m while the weight is 4 7 m at 300 s it is observed that the size of the hazardous area increases with the continuous gas release in the initial stage of blowout accident after 80 s the influencing range of blowout gas becomes a steady state blowout gas plume under wind shifts in a downwind direction and the cross section of blowout gas plume appears nearly elliptical the volume of the flammable gas cloud in the steady state is 517 81 m3 and the coverage reaches 61 57 m2 the steady sizes of the flammable gas cloud are 4 31 m weight 4 42 m length and 29 65 m height overall the hazardous area is mainly distributed on the drill floor of the offshore platform 4 3 effect of well productivity time duration and flowrate are the critical factors influencing blowout gas dispersion behavior the present work accounts for three well productivities i e 36 2 108 m3 yr 23 1 108 m3 yr and 11 5 108 m3 yr to illustrate the effect of well productivity fig 8 presents the time history of the coverage area and the volume of blowout gas cloud while fig 9 gives the spatial distribution of the steady blowout gas cloud the coverage area of the gas cloud is the projected area of iso surface to offshore platform the volume is the volume of gas cloud iso surface the dispersion range of blowout gas under a given release rate increases with time and becomes the steady state when it reaches the maximum values for example the dispersion range of blowout gas under the well productivity of 11 5 108 m3 yr increases obviously in the initial stage of the blowout accident the coverage area and volume reach the maximum value at 70 s more time is required to reach the steady state for the blowout with the larger well productivity additionally the coverage area and volume gradually increase the dispersion distances in three directions are 17 31 m width 62 32 m length and 30 13 m height the coverage area and volume are 1144 17 m2 and 1998 79 m3 respectively for the blowout accidents under well productivities of 23 1 108 m3 yr and 36 2 108 m3 yr the times for the blowout gas clouds to reach the steady state are 90 s and 100 s the spatial distribution and shape of the blowout gas cloud changes dynamically under wind table 1 provides the dispersion range of blowout gas cloud under different release rates fig 9 presents the hazardous area distribution under different well productivities where the hazardous area is the area coloured red it can be found that the size of the hazardous area increases with well productivity the hazardous area is relatively small in the scenario with well productivity of 11 5 108 m3 yr the maximum height is 13 17 m and the coverage area and volume are 283 09 m2 and 262 03 m3 respectively in the scenario with well productivity of 11 5 108 m3 yr the size of the hazardous area increases in the vertical direction while it decreases in the transverse and longitudinal directions of the offshore platform the coverage and volume are 340 77 m2 and 355 38 m3 respectively table 2 summaries the hazardous area range under different well productivities overall the hazardous area increases in the vertical direction and decreases in the transverse and the longitudinal directions for the scenario with the larger well productivity consequently well productivity has a direct effect on blowout gas dispersion range blowout gas dispersion range and hazardous area continuously increase during the initial stage of blowout accident and maintain a steady state when they reach the maximum values when the well productivity increases more time is required for the blowout gas dispersion range to reach the steady state in addition the hazardous area also increases which increases the possibility of a fire and explosion accident 5 blowout gas deflagration 5 1 overpressure assessment considering the appearance of a potential ignition source in the offshore platform a deflagration accident may be induced by the possible ignition of flammable gas cloud it is assumed that a deflagration accident is caused by the ignition source in the drill floor area the drilling floor is located at the center of an offshore platform and is a three dimensional open unconstrained space the explosion of a flammable gas cloud in this scenario usually belongs to the deflagration phenomenon which is an explosion field generated by the non ideal explosion source the flammable gas cloud expands in a very short period and generates the damage by causing the surrounding air pressure to increase rapidly fig 10 fig 11 depicts the time dependent profile of overpressure at deflagration source flammable gas around the deflagration source involves chemical reactions which release tremendous amounts of energy the products with high temperature high pressure and high energy expand at extremely high speed which generates the undulant air pressure the overpressure appears at around 60 ms and fluctuates with a large amplitude during 60 80 ms the positive and negative pressures alternately fluctuate once the overpressure reaches the maximum the products are discharged rapidly because of the rapid expansion of gas volume due to the high temperature the deflagration reaction gradually reaches a steady state which can be seen in the overpressure profile during 80 ms 120 ms note that the steady state means that the overpressure intensity noticeably fades and flucturates with small amplitude due to continuous release the gas is rapidly added to the reaction this contributes to a second rise of deflagration overpressure however the fluctuation amplitude of overpressure is less than the previous period and the maximum overpressure decreases to about 1 6 104 pa note that the overpressure fluctuation trend basically disappears after 170 ms and the overpressure at the explosion source tends to zero consequently the general trend of overpressure development at the explosion source is summarized as follows intense fluctuation of high pressure steady stage rapid fluctuation of low overpressure steady stage the maximum overpressures at each stage are 28 kpa 15 kpa and 10 kpa respectively deflagration generates a particular pressure load on the offshore platform fig 12 depicts the overpressure distribution on the offshore platform the maximum overpressure distributes in the center of the drill floor and the overpressure gradually decreases in a radial direction the maximum overpressure at the drill floor is 20 kpa and the overpressure at the rig is about 4 kpa fig 13 represents the maximum overpressure field in the vertical section of the offshore platform the overpressure varies in the radial direction the maximum negative pressure is about 6 8 kpa the areas with the positive and negative pressure are in dynamic change during the whole deflagration process to assess the influence area of overpressure isosurfaces with the critical overpressure are established fig 14 depicts the spatial distribution of the overpressure at 61 ms a hemispherical overpressure wave centered on the deflagration source is generated the overpressure decreases in the radial direction the influencing range of the overpressure isosurface of 15 kpa is small and the maximum radius of the influencing range is 4 05 m based on the deflagration damage criteria liu 2012 the steel structure within this range will be seriously damaged and operators will be fatally injured the influencing area of overpressure isosurace of 6 kpa increases noticeably and the radius is about 12 59 m the overpressure cannot cause obvious damage on the structure of the offshore platform but can lead to slight injury to personnel the overpressure isosurface of 4 kpa covers the drill floor completely and the influencing radius is about 17 53 m the overpressure cannot form obvious impact on the offshore platform the overpressure isosurface of 2 kpa covers the most area of the offshore platform and the influencing radius reaches 30 63 m based on the deflagration damage criteria the overpressure has virtually no effect on the offshore platform structure nor the personnel thus the radius of 30 63 m is defined as the minimum safety radius where a deflagration accident cannot impose nor impact on personnel 5 2 high temperature assessment the deflagration reaction gradually develops into jet fire the flame migrates from the ignition source in radial directions with subsonic speed the surrounding premixed flammable gas virtually deflagrates at the same time causing the rapid rise of the ambient temperature the steady jet fire is formed on the drill floor at 8 s fig 15 presents the development of jet fire over time on the drill floor deflagration makes the surrounding involved gas combust rapidly flame spreads from explosion source to the outer space and the outer shape of the flame appears elliptical with the increase in flame height the flowing air provides enough oxygen gas and contributes to the rapid increase of the combustion range the interaction between pressure wave and flame surface generates high turbulence flame the flame expands and appears as a mushroom shaped cloud in addition the released gas continuously involves combustion which makes the combustion range increase further due to the effect of wind and gas pulsation the flowing flame appears as an irregular shape and inclines along the downwind direction due to the consumption of blowout gas and the surrounding air the flame volume gradually decreases and reaches the steady state based on the fire temperature damage criteria liu 2012 the critical temperatures for damage and serious damage to a human body are 391 k and 453 k respectively the critical temperature for the partial failure and the complete failure of a steel structure are 673 k and 873 k respectively li et al 2018 fig 16 presents the influencing area of critical damage temperature the influencing range increases as the critical temperature decreases the influencing area of critical temperatures of 873 k and 673 k are mainly distributed around the rig over the drill floor the continuous fire can cause the rig to lose its designed strength and lead to a complete failure deformation or collapse of the rig it seems that the isothermal surfaces of 453 k and 391 k have the greater coverage range where the personnel working there will experience severe burns and human life may even be endangered based on the numerical simulation results it is recommended that high temperature alarm devices and water sprinkler systems on the drill floor area be arranged to ensure that operators know the disaster information and enter into the safe area in time when an accident occurs they should also take measures to reduce the surface temperature of the rig and prevent the loss of structure strength 5 3 thermal radiation assessment the fire imposes a hazard on the adjacent assets by releasing heat radiation which leads to the temperature increase in adjacent assets it can make for deformation failure or fatality of equipment and personnel when enough heat radiation is generated fig 17 depicts the time dependent profile of heat radiation intensity on the drill floor the deflagration flame is in dynamic change at the initial stage of the accident due to the effect of wind and air pulsation the heat radiation intensity at the monitoring points fluctuates more sharply during 0 0 18 s the heat radiation flux is in dynamic stability after 0 8 s since the flame develops into the steady state note that the monitored heat radiation flux just reflects the time dependent rule fig 18 depicts the variation of radiation intensity in different isoheights the heat radiation flux decreases in a vertical direction the maximum radiation flux is about 27 kw m2 at the isoheight of 91 m the maximum heat radiation flux at the isoheight of 93 m is about 13 kw m2 the heat radiation intensity in an isoheight appears as symmetrical distribution fig 19 presents the heat radiation of the steady fire in different isoheights the height of the drill floor is 41 79 m the shapes of heat radiation distribution are similar in different isoheights the heat radiation intensity decreases with the increase in height table 3 provides the influencing range of radiation intensity the influencing range increases with the decrease of heat radiation intensity for instance the maximum coverage radius of 35 kw m2 isosurface is 11 84 m the corresponding coverage area and volume is 656 12 m2 and 1897 52 m3 respectively the rig structure in this range will experience serious failure in a short time liu 2012 in the range with a coverage radius of 11 84 13 91 m the heat radiation intensity ranges from 25 kw m2 to 35 kw m2 the rig may develop obvious fade and deformation the personnel exposed within 10 s will have serious burns while death will occur when the exposure time is beyond 1 min in the range with coverage radius of 13 91 14 47 m the heat radiation intensity ranges from 12 5 kw m2 to 25 kw m2 which only has a slight effect on the rig the personnel exposed within 10 s have minor burns while there is the possibility of death when the exposure time is beyond 1 min the heat radiation intensity is below 4 kw m2 within the radius of 30 22 m which cannot pose any damage to the rig and the other topsides of the offshore platform 6 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive simulation of offshore platform blowout accident to evaluate the effect of blowout accident on the assests and personnel the emphasis of the present work is an integration of gas dispersion and the subsequent deflagration the deflagration process is simulated based on the prediction of blowout gas dispersion the effective quantitative results provided by the simulations could help to realize the risk of offshore platform blowout accident and prepare a contingency plan the blowout gas cloud mainly distributes in the upper space of the drill floor and it has little effect on most topsides of the offshore platform and the hazardous area is mainly distributed on the drill floor well productivity has a direct effect on blowout gas dispersion with the larger well productivity more time is required for a blowout gas cloud reaching the steady state in the scenario the hazardous area also increases with the increase of well productivity the overpressure can cause serious damage to the drill floor the minimum safe radius under overpressure is 30 63 m and the range outside the radius is defined as the safe area the deflagration jet fire poses a threat to the rig and to the personnel on the drill floor the flame temperature may cause serious burns to the operators to avoid the longtime heat radiation damage the personnel should evacuate to the safe area which is about 30 22 m from the drill floor the main contribution of this study is to reveal the comprehensive process of offshore platform blowout accident by using a cfd model including blowout gas dispersion behavior and subsequent deflagration consequence the simulation with the established cfd required about 38 h to simulate all stages of offshore blowout accident on a computer configured with cpu e5 2650 and 64 g memory running cfd code i e ansys fluent 17 0 this can be further applied in modeling and assessment of other process accidents

of major accident that may occur in offshore drilling operations in which a volume of flammable gas is discharged from the wellhead and disperses on an offshore platform a deflagration accident may be induced when flammable gas cloud is ignited by the potential ignition sources existing on the offshore platform yang et al 2019 shi et al 2017 as per the historical statistics the main risk associated

to the accidents a blowout accident during drilling operations has a large influencing range and it is difficult to assess the accident hazards using a field experiment due to the high risk and cost the cfd approach is an alternative method in modeling and assessment of such an accident zhu and chen 2010 built an integrated model in the hills to simulate the blowout accident and to assess the consequences of so2 poisoning ma and zhang 2011 employed the cfd approach to model the sour gas dispersion in the atmosphere after blowout these studies focused on an onshore blowout accident during drilling operations the exploration and development of oil and gas resources is moving into the deep oceans where drilling operations are challenged by higher risk due to the harsh environmental conditions the offshore drilling platform is the main tool used to extract oil and gas resources from the ocean since it is far from land there is difficulty in rescuing workers and evacuating the platform in the case of a blowout accident consequently understanding the risk of offshore platform blowout accident is in high demand recently some studies have been carried out on the risk assessment of different aspects of offshore blowout accident the data driven model was developed to predict the dimension of flammable cloud in the congested offshore platform and to predict the explosion consequence shi et al 2018 2019 an integral model to track the fate and transport of underwater oil and gas plume from the subsea blowout yapa and chen 2004 wang et al 2018 meng et al 2018 identified the systematic hazards and restrictions of the deepwater well control system khakzad et al 2014 integrated the event tree and hierarchical bayesian analysis to assess the risk of offshore blowouts using precursor data a series of quantitative risk analysis methodologies were developed to identity the hazards in drilling operations and to prevent and control the blowout accidents abimbola and khan 2016 khakzad et al 2013 chang et al 2018 dadashzadeh et al 2013 reproduced the deepwater horizon blowout accident and assessed the consequences such as flammable gas cloud explosion nevertheless offshore blowout accident is a systematic cascading evolution process including several stages the researchers above studied offshore blowout accident from several different aspects e g modeling of underwater fate and transport of contaminants explosion consequences and probabilistic risk assessment etc the fire and explosion incidents may appear in a rapid sequence when a blowout accident occurs the accurate assessment of an offshore blowout accident needs to consider blowout gas release dispersion and deflagration scenarios as a whole however most previously developed models only focused on one of the stages of blowout accident evolution and the systematic studies integrating the entire blowout accident process are sporadic therefore a comprehensive simulation to reveal the detailed process of blowout accident and to assess its impact is required the considerable previous studies have illustrated that the application of a validated cfd code fluent can give a convincing result in the field of simulation of gas release dispersion fire and explosion thus this paper uses the fluent based cfd code to model and assess the dispersion and deflagration of blowout gas the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the dispersion and deflagration behavior of flammable gas from an offshore platform blowout the novelty of this paper is an integration of blowout gas dispersion with the subsequent deflagration consequence for this purpose an integrated cfd model is built blowout gas dispersion with wind is simulated to predict the spatial distribution of flammable gas cloud and assess the hazardous area distributed on an offshore platform considering the accidental ignition the deflagration scenario is considered to predict the distribution of overpressure high temperature and heat radiation the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theoretical model of blowout gas dispersion and deflagration whereas simulation model and calculation method are provided in section 3 blowout gas dispersion is analyzed in section 4 and the subsequent deflagration consequence is assessed in section 5 section 6 summarizes the conclusions of this paper 2 theoretical model 2 1 blowout gas jet the blowout gas jet is a complex process involving material transport and turbulence motion blowout gas jet process can be simplified as shown in fig 1 in which the wind direction is from the left to the right blowout gas is released from the wellhead and the pressure reduces rapidly to the atmospheric level internal energy of blowout gas at high pressure is considered to completely transform into kinetic energy the exchange of momentum heat and mass of blowout gas with the surrounding air occurs in the drag zone the motion direction and velocity of blowout gas is changed before moving into the dispersion zone due to the effect of wind or ground structures which may cause a certain momentum loss zhu and chen 2009 the modeling of blowout gas dispersion is subject to the following assumptions the densities of gases in the computational domain have very little changes in the dispersion the movement of gas belongs to the transient turbulence the dispersion process of blowout gas is an incompressible flow with low speed 2 2 basic governing equations the dispersion of blowout gas involves turbulence motion substance dispersion and thermal transmission and is assumed to be a steady jet process it follows the mass energy and momentum conservations the blowout gas dispersion includes the following control equations zhu and chen 2010 li et al 2019 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j v u i x j τ i j x j 3 ρ h t p t ρ u j h x j x j λ t x j i n ρ d i h i y i x j μ t p r t h i x j s e where ρ is the

conductivity t is temperature p rt is turbulence prandtl number d i is the dispersion coefficient of component i h i is the enthalpy of component i s e is the energy source blowout gas is a multi

μ t s c t y i x j s i where y i is the mass fraction of component i s ct is the turbulent schmidt number s i is the source item of component i the dispersion of blowout gas is an unsteady turbulence motion and the turbulent characteristics of blowout gas in the dispersion process are considered by the realizable κ ε model 2 3 deflagration model a deflagration accident occurs when blowout gas encounters ignition sources such as high temperature or open flame the overpressure and heat radiation generated during deflagration may cause severe damage to an offshore platform and personnel mixture fraction combustion model is widely used in simulation of a large scale deflagration accident and is also employed in the present paper the basic assumption of mixture fraction combustion model is that the transient thermochemical status of fluid only depends on a single conserved scalar i e mixture fraction f the component concentration of combustion product is calculated by solving the transport equations of mixture fraction distribution the mixture fraction f is defined by applying equation 5 fluent 2011 5 f z i z i o x z i f u e l z i o x where z i is the mass fraction of component i z i ox is the mass fraction at the oxidant s entry while z i fuel is the mass fraction at fuel entry the chemical reaction of combustion is calculated by chemical equilibrium hypothesis or non chemical equilibrium hypothesis the substantial heat is released during blowout gas combustion the heat radiation is obtained by solving transfer equations of heat radiation energy the available radiation model includes p 1 model do model and surface radiation model p 1 radiation model is capable of accounting for the scattering effect of radiation in addition it can solve transfer equations with less computational complexity therefore this paper adopted p 1 model to calculate the heat radiation flux of deflagration the control equation is as following 6 q r 1 3 α σ s c σ s g where q r is radiation heat α is absorption coefficient σ s is scattering coefficient c is the linear diverse phase coefficient g is incident radiation the simulation of blowout gas deflagration is subject to the following assumptions both blowout gas and air are incompressible the diffusion flux of all variables at the boundaries of the computational domain is zero ignoring the loss of radiative heat the combustion reaction between blowout gas and air is the complete reaction of one step blowout gas was released from the wellhead during deflagration 3 modeling blowout gas dispersion and deflagration case study a semi submersible drill platform is utilized for illustrative purposes based on the size of this offshore platform cad is used to establish the three dimensional geometric shape model of the offshore platform as shown in fig 2 an actual offshore platform has a complex appearance structure which may increase the difficulty of mesh generation and calculation cost as a result a certain simplification is carried out during the geometric model establishment of the offshore platform the main structures on an offshore platform are considered including the main deck drill floor living area helicopter deck crane etc at the same time the structures and equipment with less influence on blowout gas dispersion are simplified e g internal structure of retreat air vent personnel passage and guardrail etc the size of the computational domain is 5 times the size of an offshore platform the dividing blocks method is used to generate the required mesh model the whole computational domain is divided into a central domain containing the offshore platform and five rectangular regions around the center region the pressure gradient at the wellhead obviously varies and a relatively dense grid density is adopted for the area around the wellhead which is achieved by a size function blowout gas gradually evolves into the steady flow state during dispersion from wellhead to outward area thus the grids with the larger size are used for the areas away from the wellhead to reduce calculation nodes and improve the calculation speed the central area of computational domain is affected by the irregular shape of the offshore platform the triangular tetrahedral grids are utilized in this region to adapt the complex shapes of the offshore platform the regular hexahedral grids are used for the external regions of the central computational region fig 3 presents the established mesh model used for the simulation a grid independence test is carried out to find the suitable grid density required by simulation which can ensure the simulation results independent from grid size the simulations with a set of grids with the different numbers are performed the grids with the larger size are used and then the grid size is reduced to check the effect of grid size change on simulations this paper uses three grids with the different sizes 3 6 106 4 8 106 and 6 2 106 the spatial distribution of blowout gas cloud and overpressure at the rig are predicted using these grids the comparisons reflect that the difference between the simulations with the grid numbers of 3 6 106 and 4 8 106 is about 1 8 whereas the difference between the simulations with grid numbers 3 6 106 and 6 2 106 is about 2 1 overall the simulations with different grid numbers are consistent thus the grid number used in this article is 3643520 considering the computational cost boundary condition definition is a critical step for numerical modeling for the whole computational domain the symmetrical boundary is set for the top plane the front plane and the back plane of computational domain the wellhead is set as the velocity inlet boundary where the jet velocity of blowout gas is given the surface of the offshore platform is set as the no slip boundary the left side of the computational domain is set as the velocity inlet boundary to consider the effect of wind it is assumed that the atmospheric stability is at the level of a and a wind speed profile function shown in eq 7 is used to define the wind velocity inlet li et al 2019 the temperature gradient is 0 018 k m and it is defined along with velocity inlet fig 4 depicts the steady wind speed field in the computation domain it is observed that an apparent wind speed gradient is presented in the vertical direction and wind speed increases with height an offshore platform has a great effect on the wind speed distribution because of the obstruction and reflection of topsides and other modules of an offshore platform the velocity and direction of airflow varies noticeably some areas with low airflow speed are generated on the offshore platform which may cause the accumulation of flammable gas the right side of the computational domain is set as the outflow boundary which is the outlet of wind 7 u z u 10 z 10 0 091 where u z is the wind speed at height of z m above sea surface u 10 is the wind speed at height of 10 m above sea the simulation of gas dispersion and deflagration from offshore platform blowout is divided into three steps firstly the wind field is calculated to generate steady wind speed distribution in the computational domain and the time step is 1 s subsequently the gas dispersion with the wind is simulated to predict the impact range of flammable gas and the time step is 0 1 s finally the deflagration of flammable gas after ignition is analyzed to assess the impact on the offshore platform and personnel the explosion is a very quick phenomena and it is generally measured in milliseconds thus the time step is 0 001 s the transient solution algorithm is utilized to solve the simulation 4 dispersion of blowout gas 4 1 blowout gas dispersion behavior the release rate of blowout gas depends on the well productivity the well in the south china sea is used to illustrate blowout gas dispersion behavior the well productivity is about 36 2 108 m3 yr which is used to assess the blowout gas flowrate blowout gas mainly consists of methane and the volume fraction is about 87 9 the maximum wind speed is 21 m s and the air temperature is 301 k flammable gas is released from the wellhead at a very high speed when the blowout occurs and is gradually blended with the ambient air the surrounding air is entrained into natural gas and disperses with the blowout gas eventually the steady flow state of gas is formed the isosurface of 2 methane volume fraction is defined as the spatial range of blowout gas fig 5 presents the dispersion process of blowout gas blowout gas enters the wellhead plane and expands rapidly due to the rapid decrease of surrounding pressure due to the action of the high pressure of the well blowout gas moves in an upward direction in the initial stage of blowout the flow of blowout gas is mainly driven by the high pressure of the well during this stage blowout gas is less affected by wind and the offset to the stern is also small with the increase in time blowout gas gradually moves away from the wellhead region the dispersion velocity along the vertical direction of the computation domain decreases and the action of wind increases the dispersion distance of blowout gas in the horizontal direction of the computational domain increases continuously the blowout gas under wind disperses towards the stern from the simulation results it can be found that the gas cloud mainly distributes in the upper space of the drill floor and this has little effect on most topsides of the offshore platform fig 6 depicts the variation process of blowout gas dispersion range overall the geometric size of the gas cloud increases over time and then reaches the steady values the geometric size of the blowout gas cloud increases rapidly within 0 10 s after the blowout accident occurs due to the high pressure of the well gas mainly moves in a vertical direction at about 20 s the height of the blowout gas cloud is approximately 60 m due to the action of the wind from the bow the dispersion distance in the longitudinal direction of the platform is about 25 m however the dispersion distance in a lateral direction is about 10 m the geometric size of the blowout gas cloud drops a little after 30 s with the increase in time the blowout gas cloud eventually reaches the steady state 4 2 assessment of hazardous area the deflagration limit volume fraction of natural gas ranges from 0 05 to 0 15 and the area described within this concentration range is defined as the hazardous area fig 7 gives the hazardous area distribution in the vertical plane of an offshore platform at different times in which the concentration of natural gas in the area coloured red exceeds 0 05 vol fraction after the blowout accident occurrence the high pressure gas in the well moves into the drill floor area at 2 s the height of the hazardous area is 6 m measured from wellhead to the upper border and the width is 1 38 m at 10 s the height of the hazardous area is 21 m and the width is 2 81 m the influencing area of blowout gas increases with the increase in time the height of the hazardous area is 29 21 m and the weight is 4 85 m at 80 s the height of hazardous area reaches 29 99 m while the weight is 4 7 m at 300 s it is observed that the size of the hazardous area increases with the continuous gas release in the initial stage of blowout accident after 80 s the influencing range of blowout gas becomes a steady state blowout gas plume under wind shifts in a downwind direction and the cross section of blowout gas plume appears nearly elliptical the volume of the flammable gas cloud in the steady state is 517 81 m3 and the coverage reaches 61 57 m2 the steady sizes of the flammable gas cloud are 4 31 m weight 4 42 m length and 29 65 m height overall the hazardous area is mainly distributed on the drill floor of the offshore platform 4 3 effect of well productivity time duration and flowrate are the critical factors influencing blowout gas dispersion behavior the present work accounts for three well productivities i e 36 2 108 m3 yr 23 1 108 m3 yr and 11 5 108 m3 yr to illustrate the effect of well productivity fig 8 presents the time history of the coverage area and the volume of blowout gas cloud while fig 9 gives the spatial distribution of the steady blowout gas cloud the coverage area of the gas cloud is the projected area of iso surface to offshore platform the volume is the volume of gas cloud iso surface the dispersion range of blowout gas under a given release rate increases with time and becomes the steady state when it reaches the maximum values for example the dispersion range of blowout gas under the well productivity of 11 5 108 m3 yr increases obviously in the initial stage of the blowout accident the coverage area and volume reach the maximum value at 70 s more time is required to reach the steady state for the blowout with the larger well productivity additionally the coverage area and volume gradually increase the dispersion distances in three directions are 17 31 m width 62 32 m length and 30 13 m height the coverage area and volume are 1144 17 m2 and 1998 79 m3 respectively for the blowout accidents under well productivities of 23 1 108 m3 yr and 36 2 108 m3 yr the times for the blowout gas clouds to reach the steady state are 90 s and 100 s the spatial distribution and shape of the blowout gas cloud changes dynamically under wind table 1 provides the dispersion range of blowout gas cloud under different release rates fig 9 presents the hazardous area distribution under different well productivities where the hazardous area is the area coloured red it can be found that the size of the hazardous area increases with well productivity the hazardous area is relatively small in the scenario with well productivity of 11 5 108 m3 yr the maximum height is 13 17 m and the coverage area and volume are 283 09 m2 and 262 03 m3 respectively in the scenario with well productivity of 11 5 108 m3 yr the size of the hazardous area increases in the vertical direction while it decreases in the transverse and longitudinal directions of the offshore platform the coverage and volume are 340 77 m2 and 355 38 m3 respectively table 2 summaries the hazardous area range under different well productivities overall the hazardous area increases in the vertical direction and decreases in the transverse and the longitudinal directions for the scenario with the larger well productivity consequently well productivity has a direct effect on blowout gas dispersion range blowout gas dispersion range and hazardous area continuously increase during the initial stage of blowout accident and maintain a steady state when they reach the maximum values when the well productivity increases more time is required for the blowout gas dispersion range to reach the steady state in addition the hazardous area also increases which increases the possibility of a fire and explosion accident 5 blowout gas deflagration 5 1 overpressure assessment considering the appearance of a potential ignition source in the offshore platform a deflagration accident may be induced by the possible ignition of flammable gas cloud it is assumed that a deflagration accident is caused by the ignition source in the drill floor area the drilling floor is located at the center of an offshore platform and is a three dimensional open unconstrained space the explosion of a flammable gas cloud in this scenario usually belongs to the deflagration phenomenon which is an explosion field generated by the non ideal explosion source the flammable gas cloud expands in a very short period and generates the damage by causing the surrounding air pressure to increase rapidly fig 10 fig 11 depicts the time dependent profile of overpressure at deflagration source flammable gas around the deflagration source involves chemical reactions which release tremendous amounts of energy the products with high temperature high pressure and high energy expand at extremely high speed which generates the undulant air pressure the overpressure appears at around 60 ms and fluctuates with a large amplitude during 60 80 ms the positive and negative pressures alternately fluctuate once the overpressure reaches the maximum the products are discharged rapidly because of the rapid expansion of gas volume due to the high temperature the deflagration reaction gradually reaches a steady state which can be seen in the overpressure profile during 80 ms 120 ms note that the steady state means that the overpressure intensity noticeably fades and flucturates with small amplitude due to continuous release the gas is rapidly added to the reaction this contributes to a second rise of deflagration overpressure however the fluctuation amplitude of overpressure is less than the previous period and the maximum overpressure decreases to about 1 6 104 pa note that the overpressure fluctuation trend basically disappears after 170 ms and the overpressure at the explosion source tends to zero consequently the general trend of overpressure development at the explosion source is summarized as follows intense fluctuation of high pressure steady stage rapid fluctuation of low overpressure steady stage the maximum overpressures at each stage are 28 kpa 15 kpa and 10 kpa respectively deflagration generates a particular pressure load on the offshore platform fig 12 depicts the overpressure distribution on the offshore platform the maximum overpressure distributes in the center of the drill floor and the overpressure gradually decreases in a radial direction the maximum overpressure at the drill floor is 20 kpa and the overpressure at the rig is about 4 kpa fig 13 represents the maximum overpressure field in the vertical section of the offshore platform the overpressure varies in the radial direction the maximum negative pressure is about 6 8 kpa the areas with the positive and negative pressure are in dynamic change during the whole deflagration process to assess the influence area of overpressure isosurfaces with the critical overpressure are established fig 14 depicts the spatial distribution of the overpressure at 61 ms a hemispherical overpressure wave centered on the deflagration source is generated the overpressure decreases in the radial direction the influencing range of the overpressure isosurface of 15 kpa is small and the maximum radius of the influencing range is 4 05 m based on the deflagration damage criteria liu 2012 the steel structure within this range will be seriously damaged and operators will be fatally injured the influencing area of overpressure isosurace of 6 kpa increases noticeably and the radius is about 12 59 m the overpressure cannot cause obvious damage on the structure of the offshore platform but can lead to slight injury to personnel the overpressure isosurface of 4 kpa covers the drill floor completely and the influencing radius is about 17 53 m the overpressure cannot form obvious impact on the offshore platform the overpressure isosurface of 2 kpa covers the most area of the offshore platform and the influencing radius reaches 30 63 m based on the deflagration damage criteria the overpressure has virtually no effect on the offshore platform structure nor the personnel thus the radius of 30 63 m is defined as the minimum safety radius where a deflagration accident cannot impose nor impact on personnel 5 2 high temperature assessment the deflagration reaction gradually develops into jet fire the flame migrates from the ignition source in radial directions with subsonic speed the surrounding premixed flammable gas virtually deflagrates at the same time causing the rapid rise of the ambient temperature the steady jet fire is formed on the drill floor at 8 s fig 15 presents the development of jet fire over time on the drill floor deflagration makes the surrounding involved gas combust rapidly flame spreads from explosion source to the outer space and the outer shape of the flame appears elliptical with the increase in flame height the flowing air provides enough oxygen gas and contributes to the rapid increase of the combustion range the interaction between pressure wave and flame surface generates high turbulence flame the flame expands and appears as a mushroom shaped cloud in addition the released gas continuously involves combustion which makes the combustion range increase further due to the effect of wind and gas pulsation the flowing flame appears as an irregular shape and inclines along the downwind direction due to the consumption of blowout gas and the surrounding air the flame volume gradually decreases and reaches the steady state based on the fire temperature damage criteria liu 2012 the critical temperatures for damage and serious damage to a human body are 391 k and 453 k respectively the critical temperature for the partial failure and the complete failure of a steel structure are 673 k and 873 k respectively li et al 2018 fig 16 presents the influencing area of critical damage temperature the influencing range increases as the critical temperature decreases the influencing area of critical temperatures of 873 k and 673 k are mainly distributed around the rig over the drill floor the continuous fire can cause the rig to lose its designed strength and lead to a complete failure deformation or collapse of the rig it seems that the isothermal surfaces of 453 k and 391 k have the greater coverage range where the personnel working there will experience severe burns and human life may even be endangered based on the numerical simulation results it is recommended that high temperature alarm devices and water sprinkler systems on the drill floor area be arranged to ensure that operators know the disaster information and enter into the safe area in time when an accident occurs they should also take measures to reduce the surface temperature of the rig and prevent the loss of structure strength 5 3 thermal radiation assessment the fire imposes a hazard on the adjacent assets by releasing heat radiation which leads to the temperature increase in adjacent assets it can make for deformation failure or fatality of equipment and personnel when enough heat radiation is generated fig 17 depicts the time dependent profile of heat radiation intensity on the drill floor the deflagration flame is in dynamic change at the initial stage of the accident due to the effect of wind and air pulsation the heat radiation intensity at the monitoring points fluctuates more sharply during 0 0 18 s the heat radiation flux is in dynamic stability after 0 8 s since the flame develops into the steady state note that the monitored heat radiation flux just reflects the time dependent rule fig 18 depicts the variation of radiation intensity in different isoheights the heat radiation flux decreases in a vertical direction the maximum radiation flux is about 27 kw m2 at the isoheight of 91 m the maximum heat radiation flux at the isoheight of 93 m is about 13 kw m2 the heat radiation intensity in an isoheight appears as symmetrical distribution fig 19 presents the heat radiation of the steady fire in different isoheights the height of the drill floor is 41 79 m the shapes of heat radiation distribution are similar in different isoheights the heat radiation intensity decreases with the increase in height table 3 provides the influencing range of radiation intensity the influencing range increases with the decrease of heat radiation intensity for instance the maximum coverage radius of 35 kw m2 isosurface is 11 84 m the corresponding coverage area and volume is 656 12 m2 and 1897 52 m3 respectively the rig structure in this range will experience serious failure in a short time liu 2012 in the range with a coverage radius of 11 84 13 91 m the heat radiation intensity ranges from 25 kw m2 to 35 kw m2 the rig may develop obvious fade and deformation the personnel exposed within 10 s will have serious burns while death will occur when the exposure time is beyond 1 min in the range with coverage radius of 13 91 14 47 m the heat radiation intensity ranges from 12 5 kw m2 to 25 kw m2 which only has a slight effect on the rig the personnel exposed within 10 s have minor burns while there is the possibility of death when the exposure time is beyond 1 min the heat radiation intensity is below 4 kw m2 within the radius of 30 22 m which cannot pose any damage to the rig and the other topsides of the offshore platform 6 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive simulation of offshore platform blowout accident to evaluate the effect of blowout accident on the assests and personnel the emphasis of the present work is an integration of gas dispersion and the subsequent deflagration the deflagration process is simulated based on the prediction of blowout gas dispersion the effective quantitative results provided by the simulations could help to realize the risk of offshore platform blowout accident and prepare a contingency plan the blowout gas cloud mainly distributes in the upper space of the drill floor and it has little effect on most topsides of the offshore platform and the hazardous area is mainly distributed on the drill floor well productivity has a direct effect on blowout gas dispersion with the larger well productivity more time is required for a blowout gas cloud reaching the steady state in the scenario the hazardous area also increases with the increase of well productivity the overpressure can cause serious damage to the drill floor the minimum safe radius under overpressure is 30 63 m and the range outside the radius is defined as the safe area the deflagration jet fire poses a threat to the rig and to the personnel on the drill floor the flame temperature may cause serious burns to the operators to avoid the longtime heat radiation damage the personnel should evacuate to the safe area which is about 30 22 m from the drill floor the main contribution of this study is to reveal the comprehensive process of offshore platform blowout accident by using a cfd model including blowout gas dispersion behavior and subsequent deflagration consequence the simulation with the established cfd required about 38 h to simulate all stages of offshore blowout accident on a computer configured with cpu e5 2650 and 64 g memory running cfd code i e ansys fluent 17 0 this can be further applied in modeling and assessment of other process accidents

encountered by the ship along its route is one of the key factors affecting the safety of navigation in this respect the assessment of sea state parameters is useful to minimize the risks of navigation and reduce the costs as it provides an additional guidance to the onboard decision support systems and enables the crew to avoid potential dangerous phenomena in following and quartering seas such as surf riding broaching and parametric rolling pascoal et al 2007 furthermore the continuous monitoring of sea state conditions is helpful to improve the statistics of long term wave data providing additional information especially in open ocean waters where the weather buoys are very scattered besides the assessment of weather conditions in terms of sea state parameters is also required if the ship voyage is planned by means of weather routing methods in order to detect the optimal route based on changeable weather conditions and navigational constraints krata and szlapczynska 2012 as concerns the safety of crew additional advantages coming from the knowledge of sea state parameters are connected to the assessment of the risk level during the routine onboard operations that in turn are related to well known seakeeping parameters such as the motion induced interruptions for sliding longitudinal and lateral tipping events gaglione et al 2016 finally additional benefits arise from the assessment of the onboard comfort level mainly related to the motion sickness incidence parameter that needs to be continuously monitored to increase the seakeeping performances of passenger ships scamardella and piscopo 2014 based on previous remarks since the mid 70s a variety of research activities were carried out to explore the possible analogy between ships and wave buoys as some issues arise when assessing the sea state parameters based on onboard measurements mainly related to the doppler shift between the absolute and encounter wave frequencies besides the ship hull doesn t have circular symmetry as regards the incoming waves so as its dynamic behaviour is affected by the encounter angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction furthermore the ship size also affects the hydrodynamic behaviour of a vessel in a seaway that acts as a low pass filter so reducing the capability of detecting the wave spectral energy at small wavelengths pascoal et al 2007 all these factors negatively affect the reliability of sea state measurements based on ship motion analysis as it will be further discussed in section 2 where a brief literature review of actual state of art is provided in fact some issues are still open and do not have a unique answer such as i the selection of the most suitable ship motions to be embodied in the wave spectrum resembling procedure ii the employment of parametric or non parametric techniques nielsen 2017a to detect the sea state parameters iii the selection of the proper time duration of motion measurements to obtain an almost real time monitoring of weather conditions without affecting the reliability of resembled sea state parameters iv the incidence of heading angles and vessel speed on the effectiveness of sea state measurements combined with the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between the absolute and encounter wave frequencies at quartering and following seas all these issues were recently discussed by several researchers in this respect montazeri et al 2016a carried out a local sensitivity analysis devoted to assess the importance of individual responses in sea state estimation and concluded that the wave bending moment is generally the most effective response to estimate both the wave period and direction and that the selection of the proper ship motions mainly depends on the heading angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction brodtkorb et al 2018 developed a signal based algorithm to detect the wave spectrum by iteratively solving a set of linear equations based on heave pitch and roll motion measurements they also investigated the incidence of transient conditions data overlapping and sampling frequency on the effectiveness of resembled sea spectra nielsen and diez 2020 analysed the motion measurements of a large in service containership focusing on the incidence of the advance speed and performed a comparative analysis between sea state estimates obtained by motion measurements and a hindicast study they also investigated the incidence of sample length concluding that a sampling period between 15 and 30 min generally contains sufficient wave components and is of such a short duration that sea state conditions remains almost constant based on previous remarks the main aims of current research are summarized as follows a new wave spectrum resembling procedure consisting of two subsequent steps and based on the analysis of heave and pitch motions is developed in section 2 and applied to the s175 containership whose main data and hydrodynamic parameters are provided in section 3 hence a preliminary analysis of some selected basic conditions is performed in section 4 in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure heave and pitch motion time histories are obtained by a set of time domain simulations carried out by a purposely programme developed in matlab mathworks 2017 that allows systematically varying the sea state parameters the vessel speed and the heading angle between the ship route and the prevailing wave direction the incidence of time duration of onboard measurements on resembled sea state parameters is investigated in a wide benchmark study carried out in section 5 where the wave peak period the significant wave height and the vessel speed are randomly selected at four heading angles equally spaced from head to following seas the whole benchmark study consists of 1200 data sets of heave and pitch motion time series that also in this case are obtained by time domain simulations carried out in matlab mathworks 2017 the main aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure at different time intervals and heading angles so also accounting for the 1 to 3 multivalued problem that occurs at quartering and following seas the selection of the proper time duration that allows balancing the need of an almost real time monitoring of sea state parameters with the reliability of resembled data is further investigated in section 6 focusing on the statistics of errors between theoretical and resembled values of sea state parameters obtained results are further discussed in section 7 while additional information about the wave spectrum resembling procedure the 1 to 3 multivalued problem and the time domain simulations are provided in the attached appendixes 2 theoretical background 2 1 a brief literature review the first pioneering works on wave spectrum resembling based on ship motion measurements were carried out in the mid 70s by takekuma and takahashi 1973 who applied a reverse analysis technique to ships without forward speed in the following years several attempts were performed to include the doppler shift for ships advancing in head and bow seas isobe et al 1984 kobune and hashimoto 1986 and subsequently in quartering and following seas iseki and ohtsu 2000 so including the 1 to 3 multivalued relation between absolute and encounter wave frequencies following these works in the last two decades a variety of research activities was carried out throughout the world iseki and terada 2002 nielsen 2006 nielsen et al 2013 montazeri et al 2016b among others by frequency and in a few cases time domain analysis of ship motion measurements with the main aim of resembling the wave spectra with sufficient accuracy especially for ships advancing in following seas provided that in this case the encounter frequency has a non bijective relation with the absolute wave one pascoal et al 2007 wave spectrum resembling by frequency domain analysis is based on the following assumptions i the ship motions are linear with the incident wave amplitude ii the incoming waves resemble an ergodic random process ochi 1990 so as all sea state parameters are stationary in a stochastic sense in a short time interval iii the ship speed and course are kept constant during the ship motion measurements hence wave spectra are resembled by comparing the spectral energy distributions of measured motion spectra or by the energy equivalence principle nielsen 2017a according to the first method the measured motion spectra obtained by fast fourier transformation fft of recorded time histories are taken as reference and compared with a set of candidate theoretical spectra in order to detect by parametric or nonparametric modelling techniques the best fit sea state parameters the former consists of detecting the parameters of a spectral shape based on a given analytical formulation while the latter only assumes a non negative constraint on the spectral amplitude even if the spectral shape is not specified a priori according to the second method instead the energy equivalence principle is applied so as the zero order spectral moments of ship motion measured spectra shall be equal to the theoretical ones that in turn depend on the ship motion frequency dependent complex transfer functions as concerns the application of time domain techniques only few works mainly based on kalman filtering are available in literature pascoal and soares 2009 pascoal et al 2017 due to the high numerical effort required to resemble the unknown sea state parameters in this respect the assessment of sea state parameters is performed directly in the time domain based on real time sea state updates obtained from continuous ship response measurements kalman filtering is applied to convert the ship motion measurements into the wave elevation time history based on ship raos with no need of preliminarily evaluating the response spectrum of ship motions in the encounter frequency domain nevertheless most of past studies based on time domain techniques were performed with reference to station kept ships while only few attempts have been carried out to include the ship forward speed further details are provided in the valuable work by nielsen 2017a that provides an account of the available techniques for shipboard sea state estimation in both frequency and time domain following this brief review of the available wave spectrum resembling strategies some concerns still arise with reference to the proper selection of ship motions to be embodied in the resembling procedure and the time window length required to obtain a robust estimate of sea state parameters as concerns the first issue different strategies were applied in the past mainly based on the analysis of single combined ship motions or on the selection of different weighting factors pascoal et al 2007 in order to achieve a robust numerical estimate of wave spectrum parameters particularly heave and pitch motions are considered in the numerical procedures sometimes in conjunction with sway tannuri et al 2003 or roll nielsen 2006 motions sway motion has the great advantage that its transfer function is barely dependent on the ship loading conditions even if it is substantially uncoupled from heave pitch responses the opposite holds true for the roll motion that is highly sensitive to the ship loading conditions and suffers of nonlinear effects mainly related to the drag forces that cannot be easily accounted if the frequency dependent motion transfer functions are embodied in the wave spectrum resembling procedure based on previous remarks the dependence of the wave spectrum resembling procedure on motion measurements vessel speed and heading angles is still unclear and needs to be further investigated besides the length of the measurement time plays a fundamental role for a reliable assessment of sea state parameters in this respect even if 10 15 min are generally required to carry out a robust spectral analysis nielsen 2017a the dependence of resembled sea state parameters on time window length needs to be further investigated hence in the following a new multi step resembling procedure is preliminarily outlined and subsequently applied to different scenarios characterized by various combinations of sea state conditions vessel speeds and heading angles finally it is noticed that the new resembling procedure belongs to the class of parametric methods nielsen 2017a in other words the ship motion encounter spectra are resembled starting from a parameterised wave spectrum namely the jonswap one whose main parameters are detected by the resembling procedure outlined in sub section 2 3 2 2 wave spectrum transformation the jonswap spectrum s j is embodied in the resembling procedure as it extends the pierson moskowitz s p m one suitable for fully developed seas to developing sea states in fetch limited conditions according to the following equation format dnv 2010 1 s j h s t p γ ω 1 0 287 l n γ s p m h s t p γ ω γ e x p 0 5 ω ω p σ ω p 2 where s p m is determined as follows 2 s p m h s t p γ ω 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 e x p 5 4 ω ω p 4 having denoted by h s the significant wave height t p the spectrum peak period γ the shape parameter and ω the wave absolute frequency in eq 1 the spectral width parameter σ depends on the peak circular frequency ω p 2 π t p by the relation 3 σ 0 07 f o r ω ω p 0 09 f o r ω ω p it is noticed that if γ 1 the jonswap spectrum reduces to the pierson moskowitz one the wave spectrum is subsequently resembled in the encounter frequency domain ω e by the doppler shift depending on the ship speed u and course 4 ω e ω ω 2 ψ with ψ u g c o s μ the heading angle μ between the ship route and the prevailing sea direction is equal to 180 0 for the head following sea condition as depicted in fig 1 a furthermore if ψ 0 the wave spectrum transformation shall account for the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between encounter and wave frequencies that occurs if ω e 1 4 ψ as shown in fig 1 b if ψ 0 or ψ 0 and ω e 1 4 ψ the encounter spectrum is determined by the following equality 5 s j h s t p γ ω e d ω e s j h s t p γ ω d ω instead if ψ 0 and ω e 1 4 ψ three absolute wave frequencies namely ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 correspond to the same encounter frequency ω e so as the encounter spectrum is the sum of three terms 6 s j h s t p γ ω e d ω e s j h s t p γ ω 1 d ω 1 s j h s t p γ ω 2 d ω 2 s j h s t p γ ω 3 d ω 3 further details about the assessment of s j h s t p γ ω e are provided in appendix a 2 3 wave spectrum resembling procedure the heading angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction is assumed to be preliminarily known this assumption is true for wind developed seas provided that wind and wave directions are almost coincident and wind data can be easily monitored by a 2 axes ultrasonic anemometer nevertheless a part from the onboard wind measurement system the wave direction can be monitored by an independent and cooperating synthetic aperture radar device pleskachevsky et al 2019 which reveals to be very effective for the assessment of the prevailing wave direction being on the contrary less accurate for the measurement of the significant wave height as it is generally obtained by a transfer function based on the radar signal noise ratio this problem was partly solved by thornhill and stredulinsky 2010 who combined wave radar and ship motion measurements particularly they developed a data fusion method that embodies the heave and pitch motions to correct the wave height obtained by the radar device the method allows improving the assessment of sea state parameters even if it under and over predicts the significant wave height at low sea state and head sea conditions respectively in fact the relative error on the significant wave height as regards the weather buoy measurements is still high as gathered by the results of the onboard measurements carried out during several sea trials thornhill and stredulinsky 2010 hence the main aim of the new procedure is to overcome these issues and provide a reliable method to assess the sea state parameters that takes advantage of the strength points of both wave radar and onboard ship motion measurements particularly the new resembling procedure consists of two subsequently steps as detailed in the following step i the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are determined by a best fit parametric procedure independently of the significant wave height and based on the spectral analysis of heave and pitch motions the best fit iterative procedure leads to the assessment of the two unknown variables or alternatively to the detection of the only wave peak period if the shape parameter is preliminarily known as it occurs for fully developed seas γ 1 step ii the significant wave height is assessed based on single or combined heave pitch motion measurements that are selected on the basis of a new non dimensional parameter namely the ship kinetic energy ratio as detailed in the following in sub sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 additional details about the two step procedure are outlined 2 3 1 step i detection of wave peak period and spectrum shape parameter the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are assessed after determining the encounter spectra of heave s ξ 3 ω e and pitch s ξ 5 ω e motions based on relevant time histories recorded by the onboard equipment the encounter spectra are obtained by the fourier transform of the biased estimate of the autocorrelation sequence of the recorded time variant signal up to the nyquist frequency auger and flandrin 1995 fulop et al 2006 subsequently the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are iteratively varied and at each step the following non dimensional term is determined 7 ϱ c t p i γ j k 3 5 ρ s ξ k ω e 0 s ξ k ω e d ω e h k ω e 2 s j h s t p i γ j ω e 0 h k ω e 2 s j h s t p i γ j ω e d ω e 2 having denoted by ρ the pearson correlation coefficient of heave pitch motion spectra whose analytical formulation is provided in appendix b in eq 7 s ξ k and h k are the heave pitch k 3 5 motion resembled spectrum and complex transfer function while t p i and γ j denote the i th and j th tentative peak period and shape parameter respectively it is noticed that ρ is independent of the significant wave height so as this variable can be arbitrarily selected at this step of the procedure in fact the two arguments of the correlation coefficient each one with the same number of scalar observations corresponding to the circular wave frequency vector ω e are scaled with respect to their zero order spectral moments so as they are independent of the wave height amplitude the analytical formulations of heave pitch transfer functions are reported in appendix c where the coupled heave pitch equations are solved in the frequency domain hence the wave peak period t p and the shape parameter γ of the resembled spectrum shall maximize the correlation between heave pitch theoretical and measured motion spectra so satisfying the following equality 8 t p γ ϱ c t p γ m a x ϱ c t p i γ j i j ε 1 n 1 m the main advantage of eqs 7 and 8 is that it is not required to solve the non trivial problem of detecting the absolute wave spectrum starting from the encounter one in case of quartering and following seas the problem in fact has no exact solution as discussed by lindgren et al 1999 among others and only approximate formulations can be furnished as the one provided by nielsen 2017b in fact in current procedure a set of tentative jonswap spectra is provided and resembled in the encounter frequency domain once the heading angle is provided by an independent wave radar system in this way a set of parameterised and tentative heave pitch motion encounter spectra is obtained at the second term of the pearson correlation coefficient so as the non trivial 1 to 3 multivalued problem that occurs moving from the encounter to the absolute frequency domain in quartering and following seas disappears hence the tentative ship motion encounter spectra are subsequently compared with those ones obtained by onboard measurements and provided at the first term of the pearson correlation coefficient in order to detect the effective wave spectrum peak period and shape parameter by eq 8 some notes about the well known assessment of wave spectra from the absolute to the encounter frequency domain and the combined heave pitch motion raos are reported in appendixes a and c respectively besides if the shape parameter is preliminarily known as it occurs for fully developed seas γ 1 or for specific areas such as the north sea one γ 3 3 eqs 7 and 8 can be simplified accordingly the number of tentative peak periods and shape parameters to be embodied in the iterative procedure needs to be selected in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the two variables paying attention to not excessively increase the time effort amount required to perform the calculations 2 3 2 step ii detection of significant wave height after detecting the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter the significant wave height can be determined nevertheless the selection of the motion expected to provide the best estimate of the significant wave height needs to be preliminarily investigated really it is well known that pitch motion amplitude is maximum at head and following seas while the opposite holds true for the heave motion that in turn is maximum at beam seas starting from this clear observation it is necessary to establish a function that allows selecting the most suitable motion to subsequently detect the significant wave height in this respect according to the 2nd könig s theorem halliday et al 2010 the total kinetic energy of a ship in a seaway is the sum of two terms the former associated to the movement of the ship centre of mass the latter related to the movement around the centre of mass obviously at head and following seas the kinetic energy due to pitch motion is higher as regards the heave one while the opposite holds true at beam seas furthermore at intermediate heading angles namely bow and quartering seas the two kinetic energy components are expected to be comparable so as the selection of the proper motion is not straightforward based on these preliminary remarks the heave pitch motion selection is performed based on a non dimensional parameter namely the kinetic energy ratio e depending on recorded heave pitch time histories 9 e δ a 33 ξ 3 s 2 i 55 a 55 ξ 5 s 2 having denoted by δ i 55 the ship displacement pitch moment of inertia a 33 a 55 the heave pitch added mass at infinite frequency and ξ 3 s ξ 5 s the heave pitch motion significant velocity obtained by onboard motion measurements hence the resembled significant wave height h s is determined by the following equation where ξ 3 s ξ 5 s denote the heave pitch motion significant amplitude 10 h s ξ 5 s 4 0 h 5 ω e 2 s j 1 t p γ ω e d ω e i f e 1 2 k 3 5 ξ k s 4 0 h k ω e 2 s j 1 t p γ ω e d ω e i f 1 2 e 2 ξ 3 s 4 0 h 3 ω e 2 s j 1 t p γ ω e d ω e i f e 2 according to eq 10 if the kinetic energy ratio is less than or equal to 1 2 the significant wave height is assessed based on pitch motion measurement while the opposite holds true if the non dimensional parameter is greater than or equal to 2 at intermediate values the significant wave height is the geometric mean of the values obtained by heave and pitch motion analysis obviously the selection of the three ranges of the kinetic energy ratio is questionable and other limit values could be selected nevertheless current intervals seem to be reliable as it will be subsequently verified 2 4 flow chart based on previous developments the flow chart of the new wave spectrum resembling procedure is reported in fig 2 the input data are highlighted in grey colour while the remaining cells summarize the calculations performed at the first and second step of the procedure at the end of step i the wave peak period and the shape parameter of the jonswap spectrum are obtained while at the end of step ii the significant wave height is assessed so resembling all sea state parameters the procedure belongs to the class of parametric methods such as that one initially developed by hua and palmquist 1994 combined with an independent radar system devoted to the assessment of the heading angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction it also allows managing the 1 to 3 multivalued problem at quartering and following seas by comparing a set of parameterised theoretical heave pitch motion spectra in the encounter frequency domain with relevant ones obtained by onboard measurements at the first step the wave spectrum peak period and the shape parameter are determined by maximising the pearson correlation coefficient based on eqs 7 and 8 subsequently at the second step the significant wave height is determined by eq 10 based on heave pitch or combined heave pitch motions depending on the value of the kinetic energy ratio provided by eq 9 the outlined procedure can be extended to manage more complicated environmental conditions such as those ones combining swells and wind waves 3 the s175 containership the s175 containership is assumed as reference vessel for the numerical calculations carried out in sections 4 and 5 as it represents a basic design for seakeeping analysis widely investigated in the past by several researchers ittc 1978 fonseca and soares 1998 kim et al 2017 among others the main particulars of the reference ship are listed in table 1 while its body plan is shown in fig 3 the frequency dependent zero speed added masses a i j 0 and radiation damping b i j 0 were determined by the open source code nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 and are reported in fig 4 a f where l p p denotes the ship length between perpendiculars they were subsequently corrected to account for the forward speed based on the speed dependent corrective factors provided by salvesen et al 1970 and reported in appendix c 4 preliminary analysis 4 1 selection of basic conditions the wave spectrum resembling procedure outlined in section 2 is preliminarily applied to a set of heave and pitch motion data sets obtained by time domain simulations in a seaway based on theoretical wave spectra with known input parameters time domain analysis was performed by a dedicated code developed in matlab mathworks 2017 that solves the coupled heave pitch motion equations reported in appendix d based on random sea surface elevation the time series of heave and pitch motions obtained by time domain simulation is subsequently embodied as input for the wave spectrum resembling procedure based on the flow chart reported in fig 2 in current analysis the time duration was set equal to 1 h as the main aim of the preliminary study is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure while the incidence of time duration on resembled wave spectrum parameters will be investigated in section 5 hence two sets of basic conditions are investigated based on random sea surface elevations obtained by pierson moskowitz pm and jonswap spectra respectively combined with a significant wave height equal to 3 0 m in the first case the shape parameter is preliminarily known provided that it is equal to 1 for fully developed seas on the contrary if the random sea surface elevation is obtained by jonswap spectra the shape parameter is unknown and needs to be detected besides four heading angles equally spaced from head to following seas are selected in conjunction with three wave peak periods ranging from 8 up to 16 s each reference condition is analysed at six equally spaced vessel speeds corresponding to a fn ranging from 0 up to 0 25 apart from the following sea condition where the maximum fn is equal to 0 20 in fact if the froude number is further increased the condition would be located in the marginal zone of the surf riding diagram imo 1995 imo 2007 that should be avoided during the navigation based on previous remarks table 2 summarizes the reference conditions analysed in sub sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 2 pm wave spectrum the wave spectrum resembling procedure is applied to the first set of heave and pitch motion time series obtained by time domain simulations with random wave elevations based on pm wave spectra obtained results are reported in fig 5 a f where the resembled wave peak periods and significant wave heights are plotted versus the ship speed at the selected heading angles in this respect it is remembered that heading angles are determined by an independent wave radar system based on the flow chart of the wave spectrum resembling procedure reported in fig 2 the green areas represent the set of values with a percentage error as regards the reference ones up to 5 the yellow and red areas instead represent the set of values with percentage errors between 5 and 10 and greater than 10 respectively besides tables 3 a 3b report the mean percentage errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights for the reference combinations of sea states and heading angles based on current results the percentage error on wave peak period is generally lower than 5 as gathered from fig 5 a c and e on the contrary the percentage error on significant wave height is slightly higher as gathered from fig 5 b d and f especially for sea states with 8 s wave peak periods anyway all resembled values are still acceptable for practical purposes apart from some isolated cases where the percentage error is higher than 10 4 3 jonswap wave spectrum the same set of reference conditions is investigated after generating the random sea surface elevation based on jonswap spectra with shape parameter randomly selected in the range 1 5 almost the same outcomes already stressed in sub section 4 2 can be highlighted with reference to the assessment of wave peak periods and significant wave heights obtained results are reported in fig 6 a f and summarized in tables 4 a 4b where the mean percentage errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights are listed the only difference as regards the basic cases analysed in sub section 4 2 concerns the following sea condition μ 0 provided that the mean percentage errors are higher as regards the values obtained in sub section 4 2 probably due to the combined effect of the 1 to 3 multivalued problem with the assessment of the unknown wave spectrum shape parameter at the first step of the resembling procedure 5 benchmark study 5 1 preliminary remarks in the preliminary analysis carried out in section 4 the duration of heave and pitch motion time series was set equal to 1 h in order to obtain a robust assessment of sea state parameters even if this time interval is generally too high for practical purposes really the selection of the proper time window is a quite challenging issue provided that it needs to be chosen based on the proper balancing of different affecting factors in fact the minimum time window required to perform the spectral analysis is generally equal to 10 15 min nielsen 2017a as lower time intervals lead to unreliable estimates of sea state parameters on the contrary extremely long time windows could lead to other types of errors mainly related to non stationary sea state conditions and changings of vessel speed and or heading angles during the measurements besides long time windows produce additional consequences on the response prediction provided that the estimate of sea state parameters is not carried out in real time but it is backdated as stressed by nielsen and iseki 2015 based on previous remarks the incidence of time duration on resembled sea state parameters is investigated in order to develop and apply a resembling procedure which is contemporarily reliable but also feasible for practical purposes hence three different time intervals namely 10 20 and 30 min are analysed the lower bound is selected on the basis of the minimum time interval required to perform the spectral analysis nielsen 2017a while the upper one is chosen in order to not exceed the maximum expected duration of stationary sea state conditions hence 100 simulations are performed at each time interval and heading angle based on random generation of significant wave heights wave peak periods and vessel speeds as reported in table 5 in order to cover most of sea state conditions the ship is expected to encounter during its lifetime in all cases the wave spectrum shape parameter was set equal to 1 in order to speed up the calculations 5 2 incidence of recording time duration fig 7 a f provide the results of the benchmark study consisting of a total of 1200 simulations green yellow and red areas represent the set of wave peak periods and significant wave heights with a relative error less than 5 between 5 and 10 and greater than 10 respectively fig 7 a c and e provide the plots of the resembled wave peak periods against the theoretical ones randomly selected in the interval 8 16 s similarly fig 7 b d and f provide the plots of the resembled significant wave heights versus the theoretical ones randomly chosen up to 5 m obviously the effectiveness of the resembling procedure is high if the points are close to the reference continuous line furthermore tables 6 a 6b report the mean relative errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights for the analysed combinations of heading angles and time durations based on current results time duration has a great incidence on the assessment of sea state parameters as the relative errors diminish among with the length of recording time as it could be predictable furthermore the mean errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights are almost comparable up to 60 deg independently of the time duration while they increase at following seas probably due to the doppler shift combined with the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between absolute and encounter wave frequencies 6 statistics of errors after investigating the incidence of time duration on resembled sea state parameters the statistics of errors need to be provided in order to select the time duration that allows balancing the need of an almost real time monitoring of sea state parameters with the reliability of the resembled sea state parameters hence fig 8 a f show the frequency histograms of the percentage errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights at head seas based on different time durations the bin size was selected by the freedman and diaconis 1981 rule depending on the inter quartile range of the data set in all cases the frequency histograms can be successfully resembled by the exponential law so as the probability that the error is less than any assigned target level ε can be determined by the following cdf where ε denotes the mean error 11 f ε 1 e x p ε ε similar outcomes can be gathered for the remaining heading angles so as relevant frequency histograms are not reported for sake of brevity the cdf values with a 5 relative error on wave peak periods and significant wave height are reported in tables 7 a 7b respectively tables 8 a and 8b report the same data with reference to a 10 relative error based on current results the accuracy of resembled data also depends on the heading angle between the ship route and the prevailing wave direction as it can be gathered from fig 9 a b in fact the procedure reveals to be very effective from head to quartering seas while slightly low performances are gathered at following seas nevertheless following sea conditions are avoided during navigation as far as possible to prevent possible manoeuvring problems that could compromise the safety of ship so as this issue is expected to have a moderate impact for practical purposes based on these outcomes a 20 min time duration seems to be the most suitable choice to properly balance the need of an almost real time monitoring of sea state parameters with the reliability of resembled data in fact a further increase of the time interval doesn t lead to a substantial improvement of resembled data on the contrary a decrease of time duration improves the readiness of the procedure but it excessively penalizes the reliability of resembled sea state parameters 7 combination of swell and wind waves the wave spectrum resembling procedure outlined in sub section 2 3 is tested against more complex sea state conditions characterized by a combination of swell and wind waves coming from different directions the double peak wave spectrum is obtained by combining two jonswap spectra having different wave heights peak periods and shape parameters the latter generally ranging from 1 to 7 and from 7 to 10 for wind and swell waves respectively boukhanovsky and guedes soares 2009 really the resembling procedure of double peak wave spectra is certainly more challenging if compared with that one outlined in sub section 2 3 that in turn can be properly extended to model more complex wave scenarios based on the spectral partitioning method in fact the peak periods of swell and wind wave spectra are generally quite different so as it is possible to separate the spectral components due to swell and wind waves located up to and beyond the so called separation frequency ω s respectively really the evaluation of ω s is a quite challenging issue as widely discussed by montazeri et al 2016b who developed a spectral partitioning procedure based on the knowledge of the wind speed at 10 m above the sea water level nevertheless following the results of a consistent set of preliminary test cases the separation frequency can be efficiently detected based on the only heave motion encounter spectrum by the following equation 12 ω s d s ξ 3 ω e d ω e ω e ω s 0 in other words ω s almost coincides with the local minimum of the heave motion encounter spectrum that in turn is located between two local maxima corresponding to the peak frequencies of the swell and wind wave components after detecting the separation frequency ω s the procedure outlined in sub section 2 3 is separately applied to resemble the swell and wind wave components taking care of properly varying the integration extremes in eqs 7 and 10 that shall be resembled by 0 ω s and ω s for the swell and wind wave spectra respectively even if the proposed spectral partionining procedure will be further detailed in a future work some preliminary results are outlined in this respect fig 10 a d report the resembled double peak wave spectra obtained by time domain simulations with h s w h s s equal to 3 2 m t p w t p s equal to 12 20 s and γ w γ s equal to 1 5 with fn 0 15 for different combinations of wind μ w and swell μ s heading angles in this respect it is pointed out that the suffixes w and s always refer to the physical quantities of wind and swell wave components respectively furthermore the resembled significant wave heights and peak periods for the previously analysed scenarios are listed in table 9 from which a good agreement between the input and resembled parameters is always recognized current results not only suggest that the two step resembling procedure can be efficiently extended to model double peak wave spectra but it also highlights that the proposed spectral partitioning method with reference to the assessment of the separation frequency ω s is effective for practical purposes 8 conclusions a new wave spectrum resembling procedure based on the analysis of heave and pitch motion time series was developed to assess the sea state parameters the procedure was applied to the s175 containership assumed as reference vessel in order to investigate its effectiveness at different vessel speeds heading angles and sea state conditions the following main outcomes have been achieved the new wave spectrum resembling procedure consists of two subsequent steps at the first step the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are detected by maximising the person correlation coefficient between measured and theoretical heave pitch motion spectra subsequently the significant wave height is assessed based on single or combined heave pitch motion analysis depending on the value of the ship kinetic energy ratio parameter the effectiveness of the procedure was preliminarily tested against a set of reference vessel speeds heading angles and sea states the incidence of time duration on resembled sea state parameters was subsequently investigated to select the most suitable time interval that allows balancing the reliability of the resembling procedure with the need of an almost real time monitoring process of sea state parameters in this respect a wide set of heave and pitch motion time series was obtained by time domain simulations carried out in matlab based on random generation of wave peak periods significant wave heights and vessel speeds at four heading angles equally spaced from head to following seas the selection of proper time duration was carried out after investigating the statistical properties of the relative errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights in this respect it was verified that the relative error between theoretical and resembled values follows the exponential law and that a 20 min time duration is sufficient to reliably resemble the unknown sea state parameters in fact the relative errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights are less than 10 in almost the 90 of cases from head to quartering seas slightly low performances occur at following seas probably due to the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between absolute and encounter wave frequencies combined with the doppler shift nevertheless following sea conditions are generally avoided to prevent possible manoeuvring problems so as it is predictable that this issue will not significantly affect the overall reliability of the resembling procedure during real onboard measurements current outcomes seem to be promising for further developments mainly devoted to i investigate the possible employment of windowing functions in the fourier analysis of ship motions ii provide corrective factors if the ship operates at following seas and iii test the procedure during real onboard measurements furthermore the extension of the resembling procedure to two double peak wave spectra needs to be also carefully investigated these studies

frequency list of acronyms c d f cumulative distribution function p d f probability density function p m pierson moskowitz 1 introduction the real time knowledge of the environmental conditions encountered by the ship along its route is one of the key factors affecting the safety of navigation in this respect the assessment of sea state parameters is useful to minimize the risks of navigation and reduce the costs as it provides an additional guidance to the onboard decision support systems and enables the crew to avoid potential dangerous phenomena in following and quartering seas such as surf riding broaching and parametric rolling pascoal et al 2007 furthermore the continuous monitoring of sea state conditions is helpful to improve the statistics of long term wave data providing additional information especially in open ocean waters where the weather buoys are very scattered besides the assessment of weather conditions in terms of sea state parameters is also required if the ship voyage is planned by means of weather routing methods in order to detect the optimal route based on changeable weather conditions and navigational constraints krata and szlapczynska 2012 as concerns the safety of crew additional advantages coming from the knowledge of sea state parameters are connected to the assessment of the risk level during the routine onboard operations that in turn are related to well known seakeeping parameters such as the motion induced interruptions for sliding longitudinal and lateral tipping events gaglione et al 2016 finally additional benefits arise from the assessment of the onboard comfort level mainly related to the motion sickness incidence parameter that needs to be continuously monitored to increase the seakeeping performances of passenger ships scamardella and piscopo 2014 based on previous remarks since the mid 70s a variety of research activities were carried out to explore the possible analogy between ships and wave buoys as some issues arise when assessing the sea state parameters based on onboard measurements mainly related to the doppler shift between the absolute and encounter wave frequencies besides the ship hull doesn t have circular symmetry as regards the incoming waves so as its dynamic behaviour is affected by the encounter angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction furthermore the ship size also affects the hydrodynamic behaviour of a vessel in a seaway that acts as a low pass filter so reducing the capability of detecting the wave spectral energy at small wavelengths pascoal et al 2007 all these factors negatively affect the reliability of sea state measurements based on ship motion analysis as it will be further discussed in section 2 where a brief literature review of actual state of art is provided in fact some issues are still open and do not have a unique answer such as i the selection of the most suitable ship motions to be embodied in the wave spectrum resembling procedure ii the employment of parametric or non parametric techniques nielsen 2017a to detect the sea state parameters iii the selection of the proper time duration of motion measurements to obtain an almost real time monitoring of weather conditions without affecting the reliability of resembled sea state parameters iv the incidence of heading angles and vessel speed on the effectiveness of sea state measurements combined with the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between the absolute and encounter wave frequencies at quartering and following seas all these issues were recently discussed by several researchers in this respect montazeri et al 2016a carried out a local sensitivity analysis devoted to assess the importance of individual responses in sea state estimation and concluded that the wave bending moment is generally the most effective response to estimate both the wave period and direction and that the selection of the proper ship motions mainly depends on the heading angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction brodtkorb et al 2018 developed a signal based algorithm to detect the wave spectrum by iteratively solving a set of linear equations based on heave pitch and roll motion measurements they also investigated the incidence of transient conditions data overlapping and sampling frequency on the effectiveness of resembled sea spectra nielsen and diez 2020 analysed the motion measurements of a large in service containership focusing on the incidence of the advance speed and performed a comparative analysis between sea state estimates obtained by motion measurements and a hindicast study they also investigated the incidence of sample length concluding that a sampling period between 15 and 30 min generally contains sufficient wave components and is of such a short duration that sea state conditions remains almost constant based on previous remarks the main aims of current research are summarized as follows a new wave spectrum resembling procedure consisting of two subsequent steps and based on the analysis of heave and pitch motions is developed in section 2 and applied to the s175 containership whose main data and hydrodynamic parameters are provided in section 3 hence a preliminary analysis of some selected basic conditions is performed in section 4 in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure heave and pitch motion time histories are obtained by a set of time domain simulations carried out by a purposely programme developed in matlab mathworks 2017 that allows systematically varying the sea state parameters the vessel speed and the heading angle between the ship route and the prevailing wave direction the incidence of time duration of onboard measurements on resembled sea state parameters is investigated in a wide benchmark study carried out in section 5 where the wave peak period the significant wave height and the vessel speed are randomly selected at four heading angles equally spaced from head to following seas the whole benchmark study consists of 1200 data sets of heave and pitch motion time series that also in this case are obtained by time domain simulations carried out in matlab mathworks 2017 the main aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure at different time intervals and heading angles so also accounting for the 1 to 3 multivalued problem that occurs at quartering and following seas the selection of the proper time duration that allows balancing the need of an almost real time monitoring of sea state parameters with the reliability of resembled data is further investigated in section 6 focusing on the statistics of errors between theoretical and resembled values of sea state parameters obtained results are further discussed in section 7 while additional information about the wave spectrum resembling procedure the 1 to 3 multivalued problem and the time domain simulations are provided in the attached appendixes 2 theoretical background 2 1 a brief literature review the first pioneering works on wave spectrum resembling based on ship motion measurements were carried out in the mid 70s by takekuma and takahashi 1973 who applied a reverse analysis technique to ships without forward speed in the following years several attempts were performed to include the doppler shift for ships advancing in head and bow seas isobe et al 1984 kobune and hashimoto 1986 and subsequently in quartering and following seas iseki and ohtsu 2000 so including the 1 to 3 multivalued relation between absolute and encounter wave frequencies following these works in the last two decades a variety of research activities was carried out throughout the world iseki and terada 2002 nielsen 2006 nielsen et al 2013 montazeri et al 2016b among others by frequency and in a few cases time domain analysis of ship motion measurements with the main aim of resembling the wave spectra with sufficient accuracy especially for ships advancing in following seas provided that in this case the encounter frequency has a non bijective relation with the absolute wave one pascoal et al 2007 wave spectrum resembling by frequency domain analysis is based on the following assumptions i the ship motions are linear with the incident wave amplitude ii the incoming waves resemble an ergodic random process ochi 1990 so as all sea state parameters are stationary in a stochastic sense in a short time interval iii the ship speed and course are kept constant during the ship motion measurements hence wave spectra are resembled by comparing the spectral energy distributions of measured motion spectra or by the energy equivalence principle nielsen 2017a according to the first method the measured motion spectra obtained by fast fourier transformation fft of recorded time histories are taken as reference and compared with a set of candidate theoretical spectra in order to detect by parametric or nonparametric modelling techniques the best fit sea state parameters the former consists of detecting the parameters of a spectral shape based on a given analytical formulation while the latter only assumes a non negative constraint on the spectral amplitude even if the spectral shape is not specified a priori according to the second method instead the energy equivalence principle is applied so as the zero order spectral moments of ship motion measured spectra shall be equal to the theoretical ones that in turn depend on the ship motion frequency dependent complex transfer functions as concerns the application of time domain techniques only few works mainly based on kalman filtering are available in literature pascoal and soares 2009 pascoal et al 2017 due to the high numerical effort required to resemble the unknown sea state parameters in this respect the assessment of sea state parameters is performed directly in the time domain based on real time sea state updates obtained from continuous ship response measurements kalman filtering is applied to convert the ship motion measurements into the wave elevation time history based on ship raos with no need of preliminarily evaluating the response spectrum of ship motions in the encounter frequency domain nevertheless most of past studies based on time domain techniques were performed with reference to station kept ships while only few attempts have been carried out to include the ship forward speed further details are provided in the valuable work by nielsen 2017a that provides an account of the available techniques for shipboard sea state estimation in both frequency and time domain following this brief review of the available wave spectrum resembling strategies some concerns still arise with reference to the proper selection of ship motions to be embodied in the resembling procedure and the time window length required to obtain a robust estimate of sea state parameters as concerns the first issue different strategies were applied in the past mainly based on the analysis of single combined ship motions or on the selection of different weighting factors pascoal et al 2007 in order to achieve a robust numerical estimate of wave spectrum parameters particularly heave and pitch motions are considered in the numerical procedures sometimes in conjunction with sway tannuri et al 2003 or roll nielsen 2006 motions sway motion has the great advantage that its transfer function is barely dependent on the ship loading conditions even if it is substantially uncoupled from heave pitch responses the opposite holds true for the roll motion that is highly sensitive to the ship loading conditions and suffers of nonlinear effects mainly related to the drag forces that cannot be easily accounted if the frequency dependent motion transfer functions are embodied in the wave spectrum resembling procedure based on previous remarks the dependence of the wave spectrum resembling procedure on motion measurements vessel speed and heading angles is still unclear and needs to be further investigated besides the length of the measurement time plays a fundamental role for a reliable assessment of sea state parameters in this respect even if 10 15 min are generally required to carry out a robust spectral analysis nielsen 2017a the dependence of resembled sea state parameters on time window length needs to be further investigated hence in the following a new multi step resembling procedure is preliminarily outlined and subsequently applied to different scenarios characterized by various combinations of sea state conditions vessel speeds and heading angles finally it is noticed that the new resembling procedure belongs to the class of parametric methods nielsen 2017a in other words the ship motion encounter spectra are resembled starting from a parameterised wave spectrum namely the jonswap one whose main parameters are detected by the resembling procedure outlined in sub section 2 3 2 2 wave spectrum transformation the jonswap spectrum s j is embodied in the resembling procedure as it extends the pierson moskowitz s p m one suitable for fully developed seas to developing sea states in fetch limited conditions according to the following equation format dnv 2010 1 s j h s t p γ ω 1 0 287 l n γ s p m h s t p γ ω γ e x p 0 5 ω ω p σ ω p 2 where s p m is determined as follows 2 s p m h s t p γ ω 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 e x p 5 4 ω ω p 4 having denoted by h s the significant wave height t p the spectrum peak period γ the shape parameter and ω the wave absolute frequency in eq 1 the spectral width parameter σ depends on the peak circular frequency ω p 2 π t p by the relation 3 σ 0 07 f o r ω ω p 0 09 f o r ω ω p it is noticed that if γ 1 the jonswap spectrum reduces to the pierson moskowitz one the wave spectrum is subsequently resembled in the encounter frequency domain ω e by the doppler shift depending on the ship speed u and course 4 ω e ω ω 2 ψ with ψ u g c o s μ the heading angle μ between the ship route and the prevailing sea direction is equal to 180 0 for the head following sea condition as depicted in fig 1 a furthermore if ψ 0 the wave spectrum transformation shall account for the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between encounter and wave frequencies that occurs if ω e 1 4 ψ as shown in fig 1 b if ψ 0 or ψ 0 and ω e 1 4 ψ the encounter spectrum is determined by the following equality 5 s j h s t p γ ω e d ω e s j h s t p γ ω d ω instead if ψ 0 and ω e 1 4 ψ three absolute wave frequencies namely ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 correspond to the same encounter frequency ω e so as the encounter spectrum is the sum of three terms 6 s j h s t p γ ω e d ω e s j h s t p γ ω 1 d ω 1 s j h s t p γ ω 2 d ω 2 s j h s t p γ ω 3 d ω 3 further details about the assessment of s j h s t p γ ω e are provided in appendix a 2 3 wave spectrum resembling procedure the heading angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction is assumed to be preliminarily known this assumption is true for wind developed seas provided that wind and wave directions are almost coincident and wind data can be easily monitored by a 2 axes ultrasonic anemometer nevertheless a part from the onboard wind measurement system the wave direction can be monitored by an independent and cooperating synthetic aperture radar device pleskachevsky et al 2019 which reveals to be very effective for the assessment of the prevailing wave direction being on the contrary less accurate for the measurement of the significant wave height as it is generally obtained by a transfer function based on the radar signal noise ratio this problem was partly solved by thornhill and stredulinsky 2010 who combined wave radar and ship motion measurements particularly they developed a data fusion method that embodies the heave and pitch motions to correct the wave height obtained by the radar device the method allows improving the assessment of sea state parameters even if it under and over predicts the significant wave height at low sea state and head sea conditions respectively in fact the relative error on the significant wave height as regards the weather buoy measurements is still high as gathered by the results of the onboard measurements carried out during several sea trials thornhill and stredulinsky 2010 hence the main aim of the new procedure is to overcome these issues and provide a reliable method to assess the sea state parameters that takes advantage of the strength points of both wave radar and onboard ship motion measurements particularly the new resembling procedure consists of two subsequently steps as detailed in the following step i the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are determined by a best fit parametric procedure independently of the significant wave height and based on the spectral analysis of heave and pitch motions the best fit iterative procedure leads to the assessment of the two unknown variables or alternatively to the detection of the only wave peak period if the shape parameter is preliminarily known as it occurs for fully developed seas γ 1 step ii the significant wave height is assessed based on single or combined heave pitch motion measurements that are selected on the basis of a new non dimensional parameter namely the ship kinetic energy ratio as detailed in the following in sub sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 additional details about the two step procedure are outlined 2 3 1 step i detection of wave peak period and spectrum shape parameter the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are assessed after determining the encounter spectra of heave s ξ 3 ω e and pitch s ξ 5 ω e motions based on relevant time histories recorded by the onboard equipment the encounter spectra are obtained by the fourier transform of the biased estimate of the autocorrelation sequence of the recorded time variant signal up to the nyquist frequency auger and flandrin 1995 fulop et al 2006 subsequently the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are iteratively varied and at each step the following non dimensional term is determined 7 ϱ c t p i γ j k 3 5 ρ s ξ k ω e 0 s ξ k ω e d ω e h k ω e 2 s j h s t p i γ j ω e 0 h k ω e 2 s j h s t p i γ j ω e d ω e 2 having denoted by ρ the pearson correlation coefficient of heave pitch motion spectra whose analytical formulation is provided in appendix b in eq 7 s ξ k and h k are the heave pitch k 3 5 motion resembled spectrum and complex transfer function while t p i and γ j denote the i th and j th tentative peak period and shape parameter respectively it is noticed that ρ is independent of the significant wave height so as this variable can be arbitrarily selected at this step of the procedure in fact the two arguments of the correlation coefficient each one with the same number of scalar observations corresponding to the circular wave frequency vector ω e are scaled with respect to their zero order spectral moments so as they are independent of the wave height amplitude the analytical formulations of heave pitch transfer functions are reported in appendix c where the coupled heave pitch equations are solved in the frequency domain hence the wave peak period t p and the shape parameter γ of the resembled spectrum shall maximize the correlation between heave pitch theoretical and measured motion spectra so satisfying the following equality 8 t p γ ϱ c t p γ m a x ϱ c t p i γ j i j ε 1 n 1 m the main advantage of eqs 7 and 8 is that it is not required to solve the non trivial problem of detecting the absolute wave spectrum starting from the encounter one in case of quartering and following seas the problem in fact has no exact solution as discussed by lindgren et al 1999 among others and only approximate formulations can be furnished as the one provided by nielsen 2017b in fact in current procedure a set of tentative jonswap spectra is provided and resembled in the encounter frequency domain once the heading angle is provided by an independent wave radar system in this way a set of parameterised and tentative heave pitch motion encounter spectra is obtained at the second term of the pearson correlation coefficient so as the non trivial 1 to 3 multivalued problem that occurs moving from the encounter to the absolute frequency domain in quartering and following seas disappears hence the tentative ship motion encounter spectra are subsequently compared with those ones obtained by onboard measurements and provided at the first term of the pearson correlation coefficient in order to detect the effective wave spectrum peak period and shape parameter by eq 8 some notes about the well known assessment of wave spectra from the absolute to the encounter frequency domain and the combined heave pitch motion raos are reported in appendixes a and c respectively besides if the shape parameter is preliminarily known as it occurs for fully developed seas γ 1 or for specific areas such as the north sea one γ 3 3 eqs 7 and 8 can be simplified accordingly the number of tentative peak periods and shape parameters to be embodied in the iterative procedure needs to be selected in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the two variables paying attention to not excessively increase the time effort amount required to perform the calculations 2 3 2 step ii detection of significant wave height after detecting the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter the significant wave height can be determined nevertheless the selection of the motion expected to provide the best estimate of the significant wave height needs to be preliminarily investigated really it is well known that pitch motion amplitude is maximum at head and following seas while the opposite holds true for the heave motion that in turn is maximum at beam seas starting from this clear observation it is necessary to establish a function that allows selecting the most suitable motion to subsequently detect the significant wave height in this respect according to the 2nd könig s theorem halliday et al 2010 the total kinetic energy of a ship in a seaway is the sum of two terms the former associated to the movement of the ship centre of mass the latter related to the movement around the centre of mass obviously at head and following seas the kinetic energy due to pitch motion is higher as regards the heave one while the opposite holds true at beam seas furthermore at intermediate heading angles namely bow and quartering seas the two kinetic energy components are expected to be comparable so as the selection of the proper motion is not straightforward based on these preliminary remarks the heave pitch motion selection is performed based on a non dimensional parameter namely the kinetic energy ratio e depending on recorded heave pitch time histories 9 e δ a 33 ξ 3 s 2 i 55 a 55 ξ 5 s 2 having denoted by δ i 55 the ship displacement pitch moment of inertia a 33 a 55 the heave pitch added mass at infinite frequency and ξ 3 s ξ 5 s the heave pitch motion significant velocity obtained by onboard motion measurements hence the resembled significant wave height h s is determined by the following equation where ξ 3 s ξ 5 s denote the heave pitch motion significant amplitude 10 h s ξ 5 s 4 0 h 5 ω e 2 s j 1 t p γ ω e

2 the significant wave height is assessed based on pitch motion measurement while the opposite holds true if the non dimensional parameter is greater than or equal to 2 at intermediate values the significant wave height is the geometric mean of the values obtained by heave and pitch motion analysis obviously the selection of the three ranges of the kinetic energy ratio is questionable and other limit values could be selected nevertheless current intervals seem to be reliable as it will be subsequently verified 2 4 flow chart based on previous developments the flow chart of the new wave spectrum resembling procedure is reported in fig 2 the input data are highlighted in grey colour while the remaining cells summarize the calculations performed at the first and second step of the procedure at the end of step i the wave peak period and the shape parameter of the jonswap spectrum are obtained while at the end of step ii the significant wave height is assessed so resembling all sea state parameters the procedure belongs to the class of parametric methods such as that one initially developed by hua and palmquist 1994 combined with an independent radar system devoted to the assessment of the heading angle between the vessel route and the prevailing wave direction it also allows managing the 1 to 3 multivalued problem at quartering and following seas by comparing a set of parameterised theoretical heave pitch motion spectra in the encounter frequency domain with relevant ones obtained by onboard measurements at the first step the wave spectrum peak period and the shape parameter are determined by maximising the pearson correlation coefficient based on eqs 7 and 8 subsequently at the second step the significant wave height is determined by eq 10 based on heave pitch or combined heave pitch motions depending on the value of the kinetic energy ratio provided by eq 9 the outlined procedure can be extended to manage more complicated environmental conditions such as those ones combining swells and wind waves 3 the s175 containership the s175 containership is assumed as reference vessel for the numerical calculations carried out in sections 4 and 5 as it represents a basic design for seakeeping analysis widely investigated in the past by several researchers ittc 1978 fonseca and soares 1998 kim et al 2017 among others the main particulars of the reference ship are listed in table 1 while its body plan is shown in fig 3 the frequency dependent zero speed added masses a i j 0 and radiation damping b i j 0 were determined by the open source code nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 and are reported in fig 4 a f where l p p denotes the ship length between perpendiculars they were subsequently corrected to account for the forward speed based on the speed dependent corrective factors provided by salvesen et al 1970 and reported in appendix c 4 preliminary analysis 4 1 selection of basic conditions the wave spectrum resembling procedure outlined in section 2 is preliminarily applied to a set of heave and pitch motion data sets obtained by time domain simulations in a seaway based on theoretical wave spectra with known input parameters time domain analysis was performed by a dedicated code developed in matlab mathworks 2017 that solves the coupled heave pitch motion equations reported in appendix d based on random sea surface elevation the time series of heave and pitch motions obtained by time domain simulation is subsequently embodied as input for the wave spectrum resembling procedure based on the flow chart reported in fig 2 in current analysis the time duration was set equal to 1 h as the main aim of the preliminary study is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure while the incidence of time duration on resembled wave spectrum parameters will be investigated in section 5 hence two sets of basic conditions are investigated based on random sea surface elevations obtained by pierson moskowitz pm and jonswap spectra respectively combined with a significant wave height equal to 3 0 m in the first case the shape parameter is preliminarily known provided that it is equal to 1 for fully developed seas on the contrary if the random sea surface elevation is obtained by jonswap spectra the shape parameter is unknown and needs to be detected besides four heading angles equally spaced from head to following seas are selected in conjunction with three wave peak periods ranging from 8 up to 16 s each reference condition is analysed at six equally spaced vessel speeds corresponding to a fn ranging from 0 up to 0 25 apart from the following sea condition where the maximum fn is equal to 0 20 in fact if the froude number is further increased the condition would be located in the marginal zone of the surf riding diagram imo 1995 imo 2007 that should be avoided during the navigation based on previous remarks table 2 summarizes the reference conditions analysed in sub sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 2 pm wave spectrum the wave spectrum resembling procedure is applied to the first set of heave and pitch motion time series obtained by time domain simulations with random wave elevations based on pm wave spectra obtained results are reported in fig 5 a f where the resembled wave peak periods and significant wave heights are plotted versus the ship speed at the selected heading angles in this respect it is remembered that heading angles are determined by an independent wave radar system based on the flow chart of the wave spectrum resembling procedure reported in fig 2 the green areas represent the set of values with a percentage error as regards the reference ones up to 5 the yellow and red areas instead represent the set of values with percentage errors between 5 and 10 and greater than 10 respectively besides tables 3 a 3b report the mean percentage errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights for the reference combinations of sea states and heading angles based on current results the percentage error on wave peak period is generally lower than 5 as gathered from fig 5 a c and e on the contrary the percentage error on significant wave height is slightly higher as gathered from fig 5 b d and f especially for sea states with 8 s wave peak periods anyway all resembled values are still acceptable for practical purposes apart from some isolated cases where the percentage error is higher than 10 4 3 jonswap wave spectrum the same set of reference conditions is investigated after generating the random sea surface elevation based on jonswap spectra with shape parameter randomly selected in the range 1 5 almost the same outcomes already stressed in sub section 4 2 can be highlighted with reference to the assessment of wave peak periods and significant wave heights obtained results are reported in fig 6 a f and summarized in tables 4 a 4b where the mean percentage errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights are listed the only difference as regards the basic cases analysed in sub section 4 2 concerns the following sea condition μ 0 provided that the mean percentage errors are higher as regards the values obtained in sub section 4 2 probably due to the combined effect of the 1 to 3 multivalued problem with the assessment of the unknown wave spectrum shape parameter at the first step of the resembling procedure 5 benchmark study 5 1 preliminary remarks in the preliminary analysis carried out in section 4 the duration of heave and pitch motion time series was set equal to 1 h in order to obtain a robust assessment of sea state parameters even if this time interval is generally too high for practical purposes really the selection of the proper time window is a quite challenging issue provided that it needs to be chosen based on the proper balancing of different affecting factors in fact the minimum time window required to perform the spectral analysis is generally equal to 10 15 min nielsen 2017a as lower time intervals lead to unreliable estimates of sea state parameters on the contrary extremely long time windows could lead to other types of errors mainly related to non stationary sea state conditions and changings of vessel speed and or heading angles during the measurements besides long time windows produce additional consequences on the response prediction provided that the estimate of sea state parameters is not carried out in real time but it is backdated as stressed by nielsen and iseki 2015 based on previous remarks the incidence of time duration on resembled sea state parameters is investigated in order to develop and apply a resembling procedure which is contemporarily reliable but also feasible for practical purposes hence three different time intervals namely 10 20 and 30 min are analysed the lower bound is selected on the basis of the minimum time interval required to perform the spectral analysis nielsen 2017a while the upper one is chosen in order to not exceed the maximum expected duration of stationary sea state conditions hence 100 simulations are performed at each time interval and heading angle based on random generation of significant wave heights wave peak periods and vessel speeds as reported in table 5 in order to cover most of sea state conditions the ship is expected to encounter during its lifetime in all cases the wave spectrum shape parameter was set equal to 1 in order to speed up the calculations 5 2 incidence of recording time duration fig 7 a f provide the results of the benchmark study consisting of a total of 1200 simulations green yellow and red areas represent the set of wave peak periods and significant wave heights with a relative error less than 5 between 5 and 10 and greater than 10 respectively fig 7 a c and e provide the plots of the resembled wave peak periods against the theoretical ones randomly selected in the interval 8 16 s similarly fig 7 b d and f provide the plots of the resembled significant wave heights versus the theoretical ones randomly chosen up to 5 m obviously the effectiveness of the resembling procedure is high if the points are close to the reference continuous line furthermore tables 6 a 6b report the mean relative errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights for the analysed combinations of heading angles and time durations based on current results time duration has a great incidence on the assessment of sea state parameters as the relative errors diminish among with the length of recording time as it could be predictable furthermore the mean errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights are almost comparable up to 60 deg independently of the time duration while they increase at following seas probably due to the doppler shift combined with the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between absolute and encounter wave frequencies 6 statistics of errors after investigating the incidence of time duration on resembled sea state parameters the statistics of errors need to be provided in order to select the time duration that allows balancing the need of an almost real time monitoring of sea state parameters with the reliability of the resembled sea state parameters hence fig 8 a f show the frequency histograms of the percentage errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights at head seas based on different time durations the bin size was selected by the freedman and diaconis 1981 rule depending on the inter quartile range of the data set in all cases the frequency histograms can be successfully resembled by the exponential law so as the probability that the error is less than any assigned target level ε can be determined by the following cdf where ε denotes the mean error 11 f ε 1 e x p ε ε similar outcomes can be gathered for the remaining heading angles so as relevant frequency histograms are not reported for sake of brevity the cdf values with a 5 relative error on wave peak periods and significant wave height are reported in tables 7 a 7b respectively tables 8 a and 8b report the same data with reference to a 10 relative error based on current results the accuracy of resembled data also depends on the heading angle between the ship route and the prevailing wave direction as it can be gathered from fig 9 a b in fact the procedure reveals to be very effective from head to quartering seas while slightly low performances are gathered at following seas nevertheless following sea conditions are avoided during navigation as far as possible to prevent possible manoeuvring problems that could compromise the safety of ship so as this issue is expected to have a moderate impact for practical purposes based on these outcomes a 20 min time duration seems to be the most suitable choice to properly balance the need of an almost real time monitoring of sea state parameters with the reliability of resembled data in fact a further increase of the time interval doesn t lead to a substantial improvement of resembled data on the contrary a decrease of time duration improves the readiness of the procedure but it excessively penalizes the reliability of resembled sea state parameters 7 combination of swell and wind waves the wave spectrum resembling procedure outlined in sub section 2 3 is tested against more complex sea state conditions characterized by a combination of swell and wind waves coming from different directions the double peak wave spectrum is obtained by combining two jonswap spectra having different wave heights peak periods and shape parameters the latter generally ranging from 1 to 7 and from 7 to 10 for wind and swell waves respectively boukhanovsky and guedes soares 2009 really the resembling procedure of double peak wave spectra is certainly more challenging if compared with that one outlined in sub section 2 3 that in turn can be properly extended to model more complex wave scenarios based on the spectral partitioning method in fact the peak periods of swell and wind wave spectra are generally quite different so as it is possible to separate the spectral components due to swell and wind waves located up to and beyond the so called separation frequency ω s respectively really the evaluation of ω s is a quite challenging issue as widely discussed by montazeri et al 2016b who developed a spectral partitioning procedure based on the knowledge of the wind speed at 10 m above the sea water level nevertheless following the results of a consistent set of preliminary test cases the separation frequency can be efficiently detected based on the only heave motion encounter spectrum by the following equation 12 ω s d s ξ 3 ω e d ω e ω e ω s 0 in other words ω s almost coincides with the local minimum of the heave motion encounter spectrum that in turn is located between two local maxima corresponding to the peak frequencies of the swell and wind wave components after detecting the separation frequency ω s the procedure outlined in sub section 2 3 is separately applied to resemble the swell and wind wave components taking care of properly varying the integration extremes in eqs 7 and 10 that shall be resembled by 0 ω s and ω s for the swell and wind wave spectra respectively even if the proposed spectral partionining procedure will be further detailed in a future work some preliminary results are outlined in this respect fig 10 a d report the resembled double peak wave spectra obtained by time domain simulations with h s w h s s equal to 3 2 m t p w t p s equal to 12 20 s and γ w γ s equal to 1 5 with fn 0 15 for different combinations of wind μ w and swell μ s heading angles in this respect it is pointed out that the suffixes w and s always refer to the physical quantities of wind and swell wave components respectively furthermore the resembled significant wave heights and peak periods for the previously analysed scenarios are listed in table 9 from which a good agreement between the input and resembled parameters is always recognized current results not only suggest that the two step resembling procedure can be efficiently extended to model double peak wave spectra but it also highlights that the proposed spectral partitioning method with reference to the assessment of the separation frequency ω s is effective for practical purposes 8 conclusions a new wave spectrum resembling procedure based on the analysis of heave and pitch motion time series was developed to assess the sea state parameters the procedure was applied to the s175 containership assumed as reference vessel in order to investigate its effectiveness at different vessel speeds heading angles and sea state conditions the following main outcomes have been achieved the new wave spectrum resembling procedure consists of two subsequent steps at the first step the wave peak period and the spectrum shape parameter are detected by maximising the person correlation coefficient between measured and theoretical heave pitch motion spectra subsequently the significant wave height is assessed based on single or combined heave pitch motion analysis depending on the value of the ship kinetic energy ratio parameter the effectiveness of the procedure was preliminarily tested against a set of reference vessel speeds heading angles and sea states the incidence of time duration on resembled sea state parameters was subsequently investigated to select the most suitable time interval that allows balancing the reliability of the resembling procedure with the need of an almost real time monitoring process of sea state parameters in this respect a wide set of heave and pitch motion time series was obtained by time domain simulations carried out in matlab based on random generation of wave peak periods significant wave heights and vessel speeds at four heading angles equally spaced from head to following seas the selection of proper time duration was carried out after investigating the statistical properties of the relative errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights in this respect it was verified that the relative error between theoretical and resembled values follows the exponential law and that a 20 min time duration is sufficient to reliably resemble the unknown sea state parameters in fact the relative errors on wave peak periods and significant wave heights are less than 10 in almost the 90 of cases from head to quartering seas slightly low performances occur at following seas probably due to the 1 to 3 multivalued problem between absolute and encounter wave frequencies combined with the doppler shift nevertheless following sea conditions are generally avoided to prevent possible manoeuvring problems so as it is predictable that this issue will not significantly affect the overall reliability of the resembling procedure during real onboard measurements current outcomes seem to be promising for further developments mainly devoted to i investigate the possible employment of windowing functions in the fourier analysis of ship motions ii provide corrective factors if the ship operates at following seas and iii test the procedure during real onboard measurements furthermore the extension of the resembling procedure to two double peak wave spectra needs to be also carefully investigated these studies

22007,vegetation can act as a bio shield in disastrous events like tsunamis or storm surges the effectiveness of a single layer of emergent vegetation against tsunamis has been revealed by extensive research while the role of a double layer rigid vegetation submerged vegetation coupled with emergent vegetation as a defense system against a tsunami is still not clearly understood in this study the mitigation effects of double layer vegetation were investigated experimentally paying special attention to the reduction of velocity and fluid force within and behind the vegetation experiments were conducted in a flume under a quasi steady subcritical flow condition with a high inundation depth the double layer vegetation produced a large water rise in front of the vegetation and entrained a large amount of air bubbles in the flow behind the vegetation the double layer vegetation generated a mild water gradient behind the vegetation which prevented the direct collision between the ground and flowing water in comparison with single layer emergent vegetation the double layer vegetation reduced the velocity near the ground in front within and behind the vegetation by maximums of 18 74 and 33 respectively moreover the maximum mean flow velocity and fluid force behind the vegetation were reduced around 25 and 29 respectively keywords tsunami vegetation fluid force washout mixing layer air entrainment 1 introduction a large tsunami can inundate vast inland areas in a coastal region causing catastrophic damage to human life and properties several artificial viz embankments tsunami gates and natural coastal or inland forest sand dunes coral reefs methods have been proposed as well as implemented to mitigate the tsunami disasters a coastal or inland forest has been widely recognized to effectively reduce the tsunami energy shuto 1987 trap tsunami produced debris pasha and tanaka 2016 tanaka and onai 2017 provide a buffer zone and escape route for people swept up by the tsunami flow tanaka et al 2007 as well as offering a natural ecosystem in the coastal environment in recent decades much research has focused on understanding the effectiveness of a coastal forest in the 1998 papua new guinea tsunami dengler and preuss 2003 harada and imamura 2005 2004 indian ocean tsunami iot danielsen et al 2005 and great east japan tsunami gejt tanaka et al 2013 several studies including laboratory research and or post tsunami surveys were conducted to find the optimal arrangement of a coastal forest as a tsunami countermeasure a post tsunami survey in sri lanka after the 2004 iot conducted by tanaka et al 2007 reported that a dense forest effectively reduced the tsunami energy behind the forest belt but most of the trees with small trunk diameters 5 10 cm were destroyed by trunk breakage on the other hand widely spaced trees having a larger trunk diameter 0 3 m were found unbroken and to have effectively trapped floating debris however due to the wide spacing between the trees the tsunami passed through the forest at high velocity and destroyed the houses behind the forest tanaka et al 2007 an experimental and numerical study reported that the velocity and inundation depth behind the vegetation were reduced significantly with increased density of the vegetation iimura and tanaka 2012 the vegetation with high density increased the water level in front of it and increased the water surface gradient inside pasha and tanaka 2017 it was also observed that the flow behind the forest became supercritical and formed a hydraulic jump which caused additional energy loss due to the increase in the water surface gradient pasha and tanaka 2017 however the formation of a hydraulic jump downstream of vegetation may have disadvantages such as erosion or scouring as a tsunami flows through a forest a backwater rise occurs in front of it and the water depth decreases in the downstream region due to the hydraulic resistance of the forest furthermore a sharp water surface gradient is generated inside the forest and the flow may collide directly with the ground just behind the forest and cause soil erosion to occur previous research has shown that the rearward region of the forest can be washed out due to the erosion tanaka et al 2013 thus the reduction of the fluid force in the vegetation area is necessary to minimize the tree damage from soil erosion limited research has been carried out on how to reduce forest damage by a combination of vegetation and artificial structures such as an embankment and a coastal forest tanaka et al 2014 or sand dunes and vegetation tanaka et al 2006 however the implementation of such artificial structures may not be economically viable for developing and under developed countries vegetation in the riparian environment river floodplains and wetlands is found in different sizes including grass shrubs or trees short vegetation often becomes submerged during high flow depth events like floods some studies have investigated the effectiveness of submerged or emergent vegetation alone and the combination of submerged and emergent vegetation on reducing the flow velocity and discharge in an open channel gambi et al 1990 ghisalberti and nepf 2002 huai et al 2014 in the flows through the submerged vegetation the mean velocity was high above the canopy and low within the canopy gambi et al 1990 in a study of a two layer vegetation array the velocity above the submerged layer was reduced by tall dowels liu et al 2010 huai et al 2014 analytically investigated the velocity distribution through a double layer of rigid vegetation in an open channel and showed that a very low velocity zone is created within the submerged layer near the channel bed whereas a slightly higher velocity was observed in the zone above the submerged layer compared to that within the submerged layer thus a submerged layer of vegetation combined with emergent vegetation may reduce the flow velocity and fluid force around the vegetation ground in a tsunami event however studies on the effectiveness of double layer vegetation for tsunami mitigation purposes are still limited pandanus odoratissimus is a representative tree in the coastal area that produces dense aerial roots this species was found to be effective in reducing the tsunami energy due to its dense aerial roots when tsunami inundation was less than 5 m tanaka et al 2007 it is reported that vertically double layer vegetation a combination of c equisetifolia tall trees and p odoratissimus short trees in kalutara sri lanka and a combination of cocos nucifera tall trees and p odoratissimus short trees in habaraduwa sri lanka were effective in reducing the tsunami energy behind the vegetation in the 2004 iot tanaka et al 2007 after the 2004 iot c equisetifolia and p odoratissimus were planted together as the new coastal vegetation in the tsunami affected area in sri lanka tanaka 2009 since p odoratissimus can grow with dense aerial roots and c equisetifolia trees become tall with a large trunk diameter the combination of these two tree species could be considered as a double layer forest for mitigating future tsunamis an environment friendly forested embankment system with various tree species including short and tall tree species was implemented in the tohoku area of japan after gejt by the morino project a nonprofit organization strusińska correia 2017 although the double layer vegetation was found effective against the iot and its implementation has already started the mitigation effects of double layer vegetation against a tsunami are not clearly understood this study aimed to investigate the mitigation effects of a double layer of rigid vegetation against a tsunami inundation and to further elucidate the role of a submerged layer of vegetation within an emergent vegetation for reducing the fluid force behind the vegetation as well as reducing the flow velocity near the ground in and around the vegetation in order to achieve the aforementioned objective flume experiments were conducted with physical models representing emergent vegetation only submerged vegetation only and double layer vegetation a combination of submerged and emergent vegetation the height and density of the submerged vegetation were varied while keeping the emergent vegetation condition fixed a range of froude numbers corresponding to those observed in the past tsunami inundation in the inland regions were considered for the flume experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions 2 1 1 flume characteristics and flow conditions laboratory experiments were conducted at saitama university in an experimental flume that is 5 m in length 0 7 m in width and 0 5 m in height a constant bed slope of 1 500 was installed in the flume the vegetation models were mounted on the flume bed at 1 82 m from the inlet a schematic of the experimental flume is shown in fig 1 a the estimated froude numbers fr u gh 0 5 where u is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and h is the water depth m in the sendai plain were between 0 7 and 1 during the 2011gejt tanaka et al 2013 while fr 0 64 1 04 were observed in the inland area in banda aceh during the 2004 iot fritz et al 2006 most of the tsunami flow in the inland was identified as subcritical with fr values 0 7 1 in the 2004 sumatra and 2006 java tsunamis spiske et al 2010 because the period of an actual tsunami wave is very long its regeneration in an experimental scenario is very difficult and not suitable for proper scaling whereas the tsunami flow in the flume could be generated by a control pump larsen et al 2018 due to the long period a tsunami current can be considered as a quasi steady flow tanaka and igarashi 2016 in this study the tsunami current was produced by a pump discharge m3 s for appropriate scaling and a better understanding of the mitigation effect of a vegetation model against a tsunami flow inland the flow was maintained by a valve and a flow meter signet 8150 flow totalizer considering the actual case a model scale of 1 100 and five quasi steady flow conditions were set to replicate a real scale inland tsunami flow while keeping the froude value like the real scale the flow condition was set before placement of the vegetation model in the flume a flume flow meter was used to maintain a quasi steady subcritical flow and identify the discharge a particle image velocimetry piv system and an electromagnetic flow meter emfm amplifier type vm 2000 sensor type vm2 200 04p kenek corporation were used to measure the streamwise velocity of the flow and the water depth was measured along the centerline throughout the flume by a moveable point gauge kenek corporation first five initial water depths h 0 5 50 6 06 6 54 7 01 and 7 6 cm were selected against five identified discharges second the velocity for each of the selected water depths was measured by the emfm with 10 s and 100 hz sampling frequencies and a piv system type green laser sheet 200 m g kato koen co ltd with 30 s and 200 hz sampling frequencies the mean velocities measured by the emfm and piv systems were within 2 the velocities measured by the two systems were then averaged and the final initial depth averaged velocities u 0 0 51 0 57 0 60 0 64 and 0 67 m s were obtained for each of the five depths finally five initial quasi steady subcritical flow conditions were set with five initial froude numbers fr 0 u 0 gh 0 0 5 of 0 70 0 73 0 75 0 77 and 0 78 2 1 2 vegetation condition and model setup the average tree trunk height diameter and density observed in the sendai plain were 15 m 0 4 m and 0 2 trees m2 respectively tanaka and onai 2017 the field observation conducted by tanaka et al 2007 after the 2004 iot reported that the trees in the front line of c equisetifolia vegetation in sri lanka having a trunk diameter greater than 0 3 m were unbroken and also able to trap artificial debris and broken branches of trees that study also found that the trees with a large trunk diameter were found at a lower tree density larger spacing between trees if the tree crown height is high relative to the tsunami inundation depth then the trees could be considered as circular cylinders pasha and tanaka 2017 p odoratissimus was found to be effective in reducing the tsunami force due to its high density and complex aerial roots tanaka et al 2007 2013 the vertical structure of a p odoratissimus tree varies due to its dense aerial roots considering the trunk diameter at breast height and dense roots the vertical configuration of a real p odoratissimus tree was scaled down to a rigid circular cylinder thuy et al 2018 in the current study the double layered vegetation was considered by a combination of short and tall trees the tall vegetation was considered with lower density and thickness so that the crown was relatively high compared to the heights of the tsunami inundation and the short trees thus only trunks of the tall trees were taken into account in providing the drag force against the tsunami flow which were simulated by the circular cylinders while the short layer vegetation was modeled assuming dense growth of the p odoratissimus trees in a real tsunami tree breakage may occur however this study assumed the nonbreaking condition of trees for simplicity in investigating the energy loss mechanisms through the combination of short submerged and tall emergent vegetation as an initial step previous studies iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 have reported that dense emergent vegetation is effective in reducing a tsunami s energy further dense vegetation of a particular thickness was shown to be more effective in reducing a tsunami s energy than sparse vegetation having a similar thickness pasha and tanaka 2017 in this current study the vegetation thickness selected for emergent vegetation was similar to that of the previous study indeed the vegetation was designed to be sparse so that a secondary submerged layer could be incorporated to create a double layer vegetation model in addition the changes to the behavior of the flow through the double layer vegetation could be elucidated by comparing it with the single layer emergent vegetation of similar thickness to investigate the mitigation effect of a submerged layer within an emergent vegetation the density and height of the submerged layer were varied while keeping the emergent vegetation fixed considering a physical scale of 1 100 circular wooden cylinders of 0 004 m diameter d were chosen to simulate the trees the cylinders were mounted on a flat plate in a staggered arrangement for the construction of the vegetation model fig 1b e the vegetation models covered the full width of the flume identical cylinders were chosen for the short and tall vegetation models to maintain the similarity of the vegetation arrangements cylinders of heights 0 03 and 0 05 m were respectively used for the short vegetation and a fixed height of 0 18 m was selected for the tall vegetation model the double layer vegetation model was constructed by combining short 0 03 and 0 05 m in height and tall 0 18 m in height cylinders i e 0 03 and 0 05 m height cylinders were separately used with the 0 18 m tall cylinders for the construction of two different double layers the flow structure around a vegetation model depends upon the non dimensional spacing g d g is the space between neighboring cylinders in the cross flow direction and d is the diameter of a cylinder takemura and tanaka 2007 first cylinders of height 0 18 m were set at g d 2 15 to construct the tall vegetation model g is the space between neighboring tall cylinders in the cross flow direction so that the density of the vegetation was 0 18 trees m2 in full scale where the area is considered to be the horizontal area of the flume bed covered by the cylinders the center to center distance between the cylinders d and the width w v of the emergent vegetation was determined considering a vegetation thickness of dn 1 8 no cm which corresponds to 180 no cm on a real scale where d is the diameter of the cylinder and n is the number of cylinders in the direction of flow per unit length along the cross stream direction of flow shuto 1987 iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 the value of n is defined as the product of the tree density and forest width in the flow direction shuto 1987 in this study the value of dn in model scale was calculated by the following formula 1 d n 2 3 d 2 w v d where the first factor 2 3 d2 represents the cylinder density and 2 represents the number of cylinders contained within the rectangular area in a staggered arrangement defined in fig 1c for the double layer vegetation the tall cylinders were first arranged identically to the tall vegetation model and the short cylinders of heights 0 03 and 0 05 m were then respectively placed within the tall vegetation arrangement two types of double layer vegetation models were constructed by setting two g d values 0 042 and 0 563 where g is the space between neighboring short cylinders in the cross stream direction of flow the density and width of tall vegetation were kept constant while the short cylinders were arranged among the tall cylinders because the initial flow depths were above 0 05 m the short cylinders remained submerged and the tall cylinders remained emergent during the experiment two types of single short vegetation models of g d 0 042 and 0 563 were also constructed each short layer model was identical to the short layer in the double layer vegetation the flow within the double layer vegetation can be distinguished as two layers a submerged layer sl and an emergent layer el above sl defined in fig 1d details of the vegetation arrangement are given in table 1 and fig 1b where d el and d sl are the distances between neighboring cylinders in the same line in emergent and submerged layers respectively g el d el 2 d and g sl d sl 2 d are spaces between the neighboring cylinders in the two following lines in an emergent and submerged layers respectively z sl is the height of the submerged layer and the subscripts sl and el represent the submerged and emergent layers respectively the double layer vegetation model el with sl esl in table 1 fig 1d single layer emergent oel only emergent layer fig 1e and single layer submerged osl only submerged layer fig 1f were placed individually in the flume two different heights of osl were selected to observe the effect of height as well as density single layer submerged vegetation corresponding to the double layer vegetation case osl in table 1 was placed in the flume to compare the flow structures of double layer vegetation case esl 2 2 experimental procedures and data analysis 2 2 1 water depth measurement selected flow conditions were maintained after placing each type of vegetation model water depth was measured throughout the center of the flume at 1 5 cm intervals depending on the water surface variation in the vegetated channel 2 2 2 velocity measurement the streamwise velocity of a vegetated flow was measured at three different locations f front 10 cm upstream of vegetation m middle center of the vegetation and flume and b behind 7 cm downstream of vegetation to analyze the impact of fluid force on trees and near the ground in the vegetation zone to measure the stream wise velocity an emfm was placed 1 cm above the channel bed and in a vertically upward direction with 0 5 1 cm spacing up to 2 cm below the water surface this process was conducted in front of inside and behind the vegetation i e the streamwise velocities were measured at a place and then the emfm was moved to the next place for an experimental case because the spacing between the cylinders in the short layer was not adequate a small hole removal of cylinders was made to place the emfm inside the vegetation fig 1g data were collected at 10 s and 100 hz sampling frequencies piv was used in front of and behind the vegetation in the crosswise direction of the flow to measure the streamwise velocity the velocity inside the vegetation was not measured by piv due to the limited space between cylinders piv data was collected at 30 s and 200 hz sampling frequencies for similarity of data resolution the vertical velocity profile in front of inside and behind the vegetation is presented by the emfm data the mean velocity in front and behind the vegetation was then selected by averaging the data obtained from the piv and emfm because the placement of the emfm required a minimum of 1 2 cm above the channel bed and the height of the sl for dense case esld3 and intermediate case esli3 cylinders was 3 cm the velocities inside the submerged vegetation for those two cases were not measured the velocity inside the vegetation u v was also calculated analytically by assuming that the slope component of the gravity force was equal to the drag force huai et al 2014 kbarak et al 2008 2 u v 2 g i s x s y c d d where i is the slope component here the water surface slope was used s x and s y are the spaces between the cylinders in the direction of flow and its transverse direction respectively c d is the coefficient of drag of a cylinder here c d 1 is used 2 2 3 fluid force index measurement the breaking and wash out conditions of trees and houses were determined by the force f acting on a tree and house as follows tanaka and onai 2017 3 f 1 2 c d ρ d bh f i where f i u 2 h is the fluid force index c d is the coefficient of the drag of the tree ρ is the density of water kg m3 and d bh is the tree trunk diameter m at breast height therefore f i is an important parameter to determine the tree breakage and wash out condition of trees in this study the f i values were estimated behind the forest for all experimental cases 2 3 important non dimensional parameters used in this study this study analyzed the flow characteristics in the vegetated flume by considering the following important dimensional parameters 4 f 1 u 0 h 0 w v d el d sl d g el g sl z sl g 0 where z sl is the height of the submerged layer for the definitions of d d el d sl g el g sl and w v please see section 2 1 2 using the buckingham π theorem the following dimensionless groups could be formed 5 f u 0 g h 0 g el d g sl d t a n θ z n u n 0 where u 0 gh 0 fr 0 tanθ h 2 h 1 w v is the water surface slope h 1 and h 2 are the water depths in front of and at the end of the vegetation respectively z n z z sl z is the vertical distance from the flume bed within a flow depth is the non dimensional distance to the bed within a flow depth and u n u u 0 is the non dimensional velocity at z n 3 results 3 1 flow structure in the vegetation zone fig 2 represents the flow structure around and inside the vegetation the initial water depth h 0 throughout the flume was constant before placement of the vegetation model when vegetation models were placed in the flume the water surface was elevated in front of the vegetation and gradually decreased towards the downstream section fig 2a and b for all flow conditions fig 2c shows the change in water level rise δh 1 h 1 h 0 defined in fig 2a and b and changes in relative water depth δh 1 h 0 in front of the vegetation with changing fr 0 for all vegetation models δh 1 increased with increasing fr 0 the upstream water level increased rapidly with increasing sl height and density in cases esl and osl whereas the relative water rise was almost constant with increasing fr 0 in case esl the water rise and relative water rise increased in comparison with cases oel and osl the maximum δh 1was observed in case esld5 which increased 36 42 and 25 54 compared to cases osl and oel respectively with fr 0 0 78 in comparison the maximum relative water rise was increased by 37 and 89 with fr 0 0 70 in case esld5 compared to case osl and oel respectively inside the vegetation the water surface declined gradually the water surface gradient tan θ inside the vegetation as a function of fr 0 is presented in fig 2d the value of tan θ increased slightly with increasing fr 0 for case oel whereas it remained almost constant but higher for all double layer vegetation cases compared to case osl and oel respectively the maximum water surface gradient inside the vegetation was observed in case esld5 where it increased by 35 and 48 compared to case osl and oel respectively for fr 0 0 78 although the water level rise in front of the vegetation was much larger the surface gradient did not change much in double layer vegetation cases relative to the single layer vegetation case oel with increasing fr 0 although the water gradient was very steep inside the vegetation in esl cases it gradually decreased behind the vegetation and the flow did not collide directly with the ground behind the vegetation due to the presence of sl the water level remained above the initial depth with a continuous mild water surface gradient fig 2a 3 2 change in water depth behind the vegetation air bubbles were not observed in the flow with cases osl fig 2b however they were clearly observed in cases esl fig 2a fig 3 shows the air entrainment phenomenon inside the double layer vegetation and air bubbles in the flow behind the vegetation air bubbles were produced and circulated through the water behind the vegetation fig 3b the maximum air bubble flow zone bz behind the vegetation was observed up to 40 cm downstream from the end of the vegetation i e from x1 to x2 in fig 3c in this study the water surface elevation in the air bubble zone δh bz h esl h osl where h esl and h osl represent the average water depth in the zone bz for case esl and associated osl respectively e g the difference of the average water depths between esld5 and osld5 in the zone bz was determined to show the effect of sl in an el on changing the water depth behind the vegetation fig 3d is a schematic of the changes in water depth between case esl and the corresponding case osl in the zone bz the average increase in water depth for double layer vegetation compared to the associated single layer submerged vegetation is shown in table 2 it was observed that δh bz increased with increasing fr 0 and sl height the maximum depth increase was around 12 18 for cases esl compared to osl the increasing trend remained almost constant for high fr 0 values the greatest water depth increase was in case esli5 air entrainment and its effect on the flow behind the vegetation are discussed in section 4 2 3 3 velocity in the vegetation zone measured velocities at three locations f m and b as shown in fig 3d for vegetation cases oel esld5 and esli5 are given in figs 4 and 5 at the three locations the near ground zone was considered to be 3 cm high i e from the flume bed 3 cm in the vertical direction fig 4 shows the non dimensional velocity profiles at f fig 4a m fig 4b and b fig 4c respectively for fr 0 0 78 the data shows that the velocity near the flume bed was higher for case oel compared with the double layer vegetation cases at position b the near bed velocity was almost identical in cases esld5 and esli5 however as the distance from the bed increased the velocity of case esld5 became higher than those of esli5 and oel in this study the velocity in front of vegetation was measured 10 cm upstream of the vegetation the velocity in this region was also affected by vegetation the pressure difference in front and behind the vegetation created a steep slope inside the vegetation and the maximum velocity was reached near the ground the velocity in front of the vegetation was slightly reduced near the water surface which may be the effect of the pressure difference caused by the backwater rise the effects of backwater rise reduce the flow velocity in front of the forest iimura and tanaka 2012 in case oel the higher velocity was observed near the ground both in front of inside and behind the vegetation when there was a sl the velocity near the ground was reduced and the maximum velocity was observed just above the sl inside and behind the vegetation the velocity near the water surface was affected by air bubbles changes of mean non dimensional velocity in the sl u n sl and el u n el within the vegetation against fr 0 are shown in fig 5a a lower flow velocity in the sl and a higher flow velocity in the el were generated in double layer vegetation cases fig 5a u n sl slightly decreased with fr 0 in both double layer models in contrast u n el remained almost constant until fr 0 0 75 and after that it showed an increasing trend for case esld5 and a decreasing trend for case esli5 in case esld5 the u n sl observed was lower than in case esli5 but for the case esld5 u n el was higher than case esli5 the effect of the two different velocity layers inside the vegetation is explained in section 4 3 fig 5b and c represent the mean non dimensional velocity average of the mean velocity obtained by piv and emfm for fr 0 0 78 the mean non dimensional velocity near the flume bed was significantly reduced by the double layer vegetation relative to the single layer emergent case fig 5b the maximum was reduced by 21 and 74 at f and m respectively in case esld5 whereas it was reduced by 33 at b in case esli5 however not only the velocity near the ground but also the depth averaged velocities of double layer vegetation cases were lower than that of single layer emergent vegetation at three locations fig 5c the average velocities at f and m were almost the same for the double layer vegetation cases where it was notably higher in case esld5 in comparison with esli5 at position b at position b the mean velocity was reduced around 11 and 25 for cases sld5 and sli5 respectively in comparison with the case oel 3 4 fluid force index f i the fluid force index f i was calculated behind the forest using depth averaged velocity fig 6 summarizes the variation of f i for all vegetation cases against fr 0 f i increased rapidly for cases oel esld3 and esli3 with increasing fr 0 while f i increased slowly in cases esld5 and esli5 irrespective of the fr 0 the values of f i in esl cases were lower than in oel cases it was found that case esli5 had the minimum value the fluid force reduction by the double layer vegetation is discussed in section 4 4 4 discussion 4 1 air entrainment through the vegetation air entrainment is often found in hydraulic jumps chanson and brattberg 2000 steep chute and dam spillways chanson and paintal 2003 open channels ohtsu et al 2004 spillways boes and hager 2003 and porous pooled spillways felder and chanson 2013 and it contributes to a reduction of the flow energy however air entrainment in a flow through vegetation is rarely reported in this study a large amount of air bubbles was produced inside the vegetation and continued in the flow behind the vegetation fig 3a summarizes the detailed characteristics of the air entrainment phenomenon inside the vegetation a high angle of the water surface slope and high roughness are the important parameters for air entrainment in the flow through spillways or chutes boes and hager 2003 felder and chanson 2013 in the present study the presence of a submerged layer increased the roughness in the vegetation patch and produced a large backwater rise in front of the vegetation that increased the water surface slope inside the vegetation the water surface slope within the vegetation zone defined in fig 2a was around 14 the steep flow gradient caused a high flow velocity in the el the flow structure of case esli5 for fr 0 0 78 is shown in fig 3a thus the air bubbles could be expected in this current experimental scenario air entrainment in the vegetation zone also depends on the vegetation arrangement and hydraulic conditions in this investigation the air entrainment was not observed in the first row of the vegetation whereas it was started from the 2nd row and continued with increasing the number of bubbles towards the end of the vegetation fig 3a in this arrangement the circular cylinders were mounted in a staggered arrangement where the spacing between the emergent cylinders g el d was 2 13 the value of reynolds number r e du ʋ where d is the diameter of the cylinder u is the velocity and ʋ is the kinematic viscosity of water was calculated to be 1227 1432 and 1844 at the front middle and end rows of the vegetation array respectively the arrangement of the cylinders and the range of r e were favorable to produce the vortices behind the cylinders previous study showed that von karman vortices were apparently close to the cylinders when the density was very low the distance between cylinders was five times their diameter and the r e was supposed to be high around 1340 stoesser et al 2010 a primitive karman vortex was stably formed behind each cylinder in a staggered arrangement when g d 1 8 and r e was between 1000 and 4000 takemura and tanaka 2007 in addition the water surface fluctuation just behind the cylinders from the second row to the end of the vegetation was observed fig 3a the flow through cylindrical arrangements was observed to be accelerated locally on the surface just behind the cylinder which might result in the local water surface depressions stoesser et al 2010 in this study although the r e was high enough for vortices to occur in the front row of cylinders the water surface was almost flat and the local water surface fluctuation was not observed behind these cylinders therefore it could be assumed that the combined effect of the vortex formation and tremendous surface depression behind the cylinders forced air into the water that produced air bubbles in the vegetation zone in this experiment towards the end of the vegetation the r e increased water surface became steeper and water surface fluctuation was observed to be high which may be accelerated the local water surface depression just behind the cylinders due to this air entrainment was enhanced in the rearward region of the vegetation patch most of the air bubbles behind the vegetation were observed just above the sl fig 3b the bubbles traveled some distance within the flow behind the vegetation before disappearing by making a spray the traveling distance of the air bubbles was determined by visualizing the flow with a high resolution camera and the maximum spray was marked on the sidewalls of the flume the spray distance from the end of the vegetation was around 40 cm in length along the flow direction fig 3c in the region of the traveling distance downstream of the vegetation of the air bubbles the size of the individual air bubbles was measured by video analysis video of the flow behind the vegetation was captured by a high speed digital camera kato koen co ltd that was controlled by a pc using photography software k ⅱ ver 1 03 the video was taken with a scale attached in the cross section area of the flume the video was then analyzed by software flow expert ver 1 2 6 kato koen co ltd to determine the size of the bubbles two hundred frames of the video were selected and the bubble size was observed in each frame just behind the vegetation some air bubble clusters and overlapping air bubbles were found therefore the area of analysis for the bubble size measurement was considered 7 8 cm downstream of the vegetation where individual bubbles could be separated rectangular section in fig 7 the observed maximum sizes of isolated bubbles enclosed within circles in the rectangle in fig 7 in the analysis area were selected to measure their size this study found that the diameter of the identified large individual bubbles in each frame was around 2 mm whereas almost all individual bubbles were visualized as less than 2 mm chanson 1997 investigated the bubble size distribution by a double tip conductivity probe in free surface aeration in an open channel experimentally and reported that the greatest frequency of air bubble chord lengths was found for the bubbles with chords between 0 and 3 mm albarkani et al 2018 estimated the bubble size in a hydraulic jump in an experimental flume by video analysis and reported that maximum bubbles are in the range of 2 7 6 5 mm in this study the froude similarity in an actual scale was considered and the model scale was 1 100 however although the length scale of the air bubble is approximated in this experimental scenario the actual bubble size in a real case is characterized by different parameters e g reynolds number vortex formation and its characteristics surface tension buoyancy force etc thus the effect of the bubbles on a real scale is unknown in this study air bubbles were not seen with a single layer of submerged vegetation see fig 2b in the case of the double layer vegetation where the submerged layer density is considered the same air bubbles were present and the flow depth behind the vegetation remained higher than in case osl in the present study it is assumed that the water level rise behind the vegetation in case esl was due to the presence of el where entrained air bubbles may have contributed an experimental observation quantified the water level rise due to entrained air which contributed to reducing the flow energy when they disappeared hoque and aoki 2005 paul and ismail 2012 conducted a numerical simulation to estimate the rise in water levels due to surges associated with the cyclones in april 1991 and aila along the coast of bangladesh the study found that the water level increased 2 12 in the cyclone event due to air entrainment because of the large backwater rise in front of the vegetation a steep water surface gradient was generated inside the vegetation and the flow depth decreased behind the vegetation the decreased water depth created a supercritical flow and in some cases the flow collided with the ground directly behind the vegetation pasha and tanaka 2017 in this study adding a submerged layer within an emergent layer produced a large backwater rise in front of the vegetation entrained a large number of air bubbles and elevated the water surface behind the vegetation due to the surface elevation the water gradient behind the vegetation remained relatively mild and the flow did not collide directly with the ground behind the vegetation this study investigated the air entrainment in the vegetation and discussed its possible effect in the water rise behind the vegetation however further study directly measuring the air concentration is required to clarify its effects 4 2 mixing layer fig 8 a represents a comparison between analytic and experimental velocity profiles for the flow through a double layer of rigid vegetation the analytic value shows that the velocity in the sl was less than that of the el which remained constant in each layer the mean values of analytic and experimental results were very close in the sl some difference in the velocity profile was observed between the two results because the analytic measurement considered only the gravity and drag force respectively on the other hand in the actual case the velocity profile may be affected by other factors viz shear stress air bubbles turbulent mixing the difference in velocity between the two layers is characterized by a strong point of inflection in the velocity profile that induces strong vortices poggi et al 2004 because of the velocity difference in the two parallel streams mixing layer turbulence was formed around the point of inflection in the velocity profile raupach et al 1996 in the flow through rigid double layer vegetation the velocity was lower in the submerged layer compared to the velocity above the submerged layer and created a mixing zone around the top of the submerged layer huai et al 2014 fig 8b in the current study the submerged layer enhanced the resistance of the vegetation near the vegetation ground which lowered the velocity near the flume bed in the vegetation zone inside the vegetation mean velocities in the sl were reduced by 64 and 34 for case esld5 and esli5 respectively as compared to case oel while the fluid velocity increased by 44 and 18 in el for cases esld5 and esli5 respectively fig 5a the mixing layer zone was observed within the sl for case esli5 and within and near the top of sl for case esld5 fig 8a in this investigation the mixing layer zone was also found above the sl because this study considered very dense sl and the water surface gradually declined in the vegetation zone whereas a previous study huai et al 2014 considered very sparse vegetation distance between cylinders in streamwise and transverse directions were 11 and 5 3 cm respectively while the still water depth remained constant throughout the channel the depth of a mixing layer can be quantified by the thickness of the vorticity δ w δu du dz max where δu is the difference between two free stream velocities above and below the mixing length u is the function of z and du dz max represents the maximum slope value of the velocity curve that belongs to the mixing zone raupach et al 1996 in the current study the calculated approximate values of δ w were found to be 2 91 and 3 05 cm for cases esld5 and sli5 respectively where the maximum values of the free stream velocities were taken in the sl and the el respectively these were taken above and below the mixing layer defined in fig 8b because the sl of case esld5 was denser and the velocity was very low compared to case esli5 vortices might be smaller in length in addition the vortex transport rate may be less due to the low velocity in the submerged layer for case seld5 relative to esli5 the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation due to mixing in two parallel co flowing layers is proportional to the production of vortices which increases with the increasing depth of the mixing layer raupach et al 1996 from the calculated value of the mixing layer depth and identification of the mixing zone in the velocity profile fig 8a it could be assumed that the turbulent energy dissipation due to mixing may be higher in case esli5 as compared to case esld5 moreover the high velocity in the el and shorter mixing length inside the vegetation may have caused a higher mean velocity behind the vegetation for case esld5 when compared to that of esli5 however the double layer vegetation is found to be effective to reduce a significant amount of velocity near the bed just behind the vegetation therefore the cumulative effect of a mild water gradient air bubble entrainment and mixing phenomena was found to be effective in reducing the mean velocity that generated a low velocity zone behind the vegetation fig 2a 4 3 fluid force reduction this study investigated the effectiveness of a submerged layer of vegetation within emergent vegetation for reducing the velocity and fluid force in the vegetation zone from the velocity distribution and water surface profile explained in previous sections it is pointed out that the water surface behind the vegetation gradually decreases and velocity increases fig 5c which may increase the fluid force just behind the vegetation high fluid force is reported to damage trees by breaking and washing them out tanaka and onai 2017 tanaka et al 2007 noted that big scoured holes were created just behind c equisetifolia tall and diameter greater than 0 3 m trees at suk samaran village and that the trees were uprooted by a large amount of erosion at khao lak in the 2004 iot in sri lanka soil may be eroded because of the high force and angle of a fluid attack and the rearward portion of the forest was reported to be washed out by the erosion tanaka et al 2013 the driftwood produced by tree breakage and washing out generated a secondary disaster due to collision with the structures behind the vegetation tanaka and ogino 2017 tanaka and suzuki 2013 a previous study pasha and tanaka 2017 showed that a dense and emergent single layer forest increased the upstream water level and generated a steep slope inside the vegetation which directly became supercritical just behind the forest however a flow having a steep slope may collide directly with the ground and increase the fluid force due to the high flow velocity which could make the region vulnerable to erosion as well as damage downstream thus besides the energy dissipation a reduction of fluid force behind the forest is necessary to minimize tsunami disasters eq 3 shows that the fluid force decreases when the f i fluid force index value decreases the fluid force indexes for emergent single and double layer vegetation are presented in fig 6 this index value was very high when the emergent vegetation had no submerged layer on the contrary the value was decreased significantly in the presence of a submerged layer irrespective of the fr 0 the maximum f i values were reduced by 23 and 29 for cases esld5 and esli5 respectively f i was calculated using the mean velocity behind the vegetation from the velocity measurement the average velocity at b was found to be the minimum in case esli5 due to the combined effect of mixing and air bubbles that resulted in a further decrease of the fluid force index value hence the less dense submerged layer was found to be a bit more effective to reduce the f i behind the vegetation in this study the double layer vegetation was effective in reducing the velocity and fluid force behind the vegetation therefore the washing out of trees by erosion just behind the vegetation and damage to the structures downstream of vegetation could be minimized by a double layer of rigid vegetation 4 4 energy reduction the efficacy of a vegetation plan is measured by its capability to reduce the flow energy the total relative energy loss e 1 e 2 e 1 where e 1 and e 2 are the total energy head upstream and downstream of the vegetation is proportional to the difference in water depth and flow velocity respectively in front of and behind the vegetation dense vegetation increases the water depth in front of it by reflection and reduces the velocity and water depth behind it due to its higher resistance iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 investigated the energy reduction through emergent vegetation experimentally and found that dense vegetation reduced the flow energy more than sparse vegetation where the two types of vegetation were similar in thickness dn 1 8 no cm this study considered a sparse emergent vegetation of similar thickness dn 1 8 no cm so that a submerged layer can be incorporated within the vegetation to construct a double layer vegetation because sparse vegetation was found less effective in reducing the flow energy than the same thickness of dense vegetation the effectiveness of sparse vegetation while containing submerged layer vegetation needs to be elucidated in this study the thickness of the emergent vegetation was considered in order to investigate the changes in mitigation effect and to clarify the effectiveness of a sparse emergent forest while containing a submerged layer of vegetation a recent study has shown that a sparse g d 2 13 emergent vegetation of thickness dn 1 8 no cm containing a submerged vegetation layer reduced the total relative energy by 46 52 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2018 in contrast the total relative energy loss for a single layer of emergent vegetation of thickness dn 1 8 no cm was estimated as 33 37 and 26 28 for dense g d 0 25 and sparse g d 2 13 vegetation respectively which increases with the density and thickness of the vegetation pasha and tanaka 2017 however the tree trunk diameter in a dense forest becomes relatively smaller due to the limited spacing between the trees and trees are more prone to destruction in disastrous events like tsunamis the destruction of a dense forest of trees having small trunk diameter was observed in the 2004 iot tanaka et al 2007 moreover tanaka et al 2011 showed that the limited coastal land in sri lanka is a big obstacle to the implementation of a thick forest for tsunami mitigation therefore considering the restriction in land uses and effective growth of the emergent trees a finite length of double layer vegetation having sparse emergent trees containing a dense area of submerged trees may have an improved capability in reducing the energy of an inundating tsunami current 5 conclusions this study aimed to understand the mitigation effects of a double layer of vegetation against a tsunami inundation as well as its role in reducing the velocity in the vegetation zone and destructive fluid force behind the vegetation the following findings could be summarized in this study the presence of a submerged vegetation layer in an emergent vegetation enhanced the hydraulic resistance backwater rise increased around 36 42 and 25 54 in front of the vegetation compared to osl and oel respectively of the vegetation zone and provided more energy reduction the double layer vegetation also produced a large number of air bubbles inside the vegetation which continued in the flow behind the vegetation the increase in the water level behind the vegetation in case esl was around 12 18 maximum compared to case osl the presence of air bubbles may be effective in raising the water surface behind the vegetation the increased water depth created a relatively mild water surface gradient behind the vegetation which protected the ground from a direct impact of the flowing water gradient introducing a submerged vegetation layer within an emergent vegetation layer further reduced the maximum velocity behind the vegetation by 25 the velocity near the bed in front within and behind the vegetation was reduced by maximums of 18 74 and 33 respectively this could effectively reduce bed erosion in and around the vegetation zone moreover the double layer vegetation generated a mixing velocity zone inside the vegetation that may further contribute in reducing the velocity behind the vegetation moreover the double layer vegetation generated a low velocity region behind the vegetation that contributed to reduction of the fluid force by around 23 29 relative to a single layer of emergent vegetation reducing this fluid force coupled with the air bubble effect creating a mild water surface implies reducing the erosion of the ground just behind the vegetation and reduction of breakage or wash out incidents downstream of the vegetation thus not only increasing the resistance against the flow by the emergent forest but also reducing the vulnerability to a secondary disaster due to the driftwood production caused by washing out of trees especially the rearward portion of the forest could be minimized by the double layer vegetation in this study double layer vegetation was found to be effective in the range of experimental conditions simulating an inundating tsunami the double layer of rigid vegetation integrating short trees of high density near the ground with sufficiently spaced tall trees of large trunk diameter may have an improved mitigation capability as a bio shield against tsunamis this study elucidated some important findings including an air entrainment phenomenon in the vegetation zone further study of air entrainment with different parameters e g model scale buoyancy force and reynolds number and direct measurement of the air bubble concentration behind the vegetation is required to clarify its effect on reducing the energy downstream of the vegetation

22007,vegetation can act as a bio shield in disastrous events like tsunamis or storm surges the effectiveness of a single layer of emergent vegetation against tsunamis has been revealed by extensive research while the role of a double layer rigid vegetation submerged vegetation coupled with emergent vegetation as a defense system against a tsunami is still not clearly understood in this study the mitigation effects of double layer vegetation were investigated experimentally paying special attention to the reduction of velocity and fluid force within and behind the vegetation experiments were conducted in a flume under a quasi steady subcritical flow condition with a high inundation depth the double layer vegetation produced a large water rise in front of the vegetation and entrained a large amount of air bubbles in the flow behind the vegetation the double layer vegetation generated a mild water gradient behind the vegetation which prevented the direct collision between the ground and flowing water in comparison with single layer emergent vegetation the double layer vegetation reduced the velocity near the ground in front within and behind the vegetation by maximums of 18 74 and 33 respectively moreover the maximum mean flow velocity and fluid force behind the vegetation were reduced around 25 and 29 respectively keywords tsunami vegetation fluid force washout mixing layer air entrainment 1 introduction a large tsunami can inundate vast inland areas in a coastal region causing catastrophic damage to human life and properties several artificial viz embankments tsunami gates and natural coastal or inland forest sand dunes coral reefs methods have been proposed as well as implemented to mitigate the tsunami disasters a coastal or inland forest has been widely recognized to effectively reduce the tsunami energy shuto 1987 trap tsunami produced debris pasha and tanaka 2016 tanaka and onai 2017 provide a buffer zone and escape route for people swept up by the tsunami flow tanaka et al 2007 as well as offering a natural ecosystem in the coastal environment in recent decades much research has focused on understanding the effectiveness of a coastal forest in the 1998 papua new guinea tsunami dengler and preuss 2003 harada and imamura 2005 2004 indian ocean tsunami iot danielsen et al 2005 and great east japan tsunami gejt tanaka et al 2013 several studies including laboratory research and or post tsunami surveys were conducted to find the optimal arrangement of a coastal forest as a tsunami countermeasure a post tsunami survey in sri lanka after the 2004 iot conducted by tanaka et al 2007 reported that a dense forest effectively reduced the tsunami energy behind the forest belt but most of the trees with small trunk diameters 5 10 cm were destroyed by trunk breakage on the other hand widely spaced trees having a larger trunk diameter 0 3 m were found unbroken and to have effectively trapped floating debris however due to the wide spacing between the trees the tsunami passed through the forest at high velocity and destroyed the houses behind the forest tanaka et al 2007 an experimental and numerical study reported that the velocity and inundation depth behind the vegetation were reduced significantly with increased density of the vegetation iimura and tanaka 2012 the vegetation with high density increased the water level in front of it and increased the water surface gradient inside pasha and tanaka 2017 it was also observed that the flow behind the forest became supercritical and formed a hydraulic jump which caused additional energy loss due to the increase in the water surface gradient pasha and tanaka 2017 however the formation of a hydraulic jump downstream of vegetation may have disadvantages such as erosion or scouring as a tsunami flows through a forest a backwater rise occurs in front of it and the water depth decreases in the downstream region due to the hydraulic resistance of the forest furthermore a sharp water surface gradient is generated inside the forest and the flow may collide directly with the ground just behind the forest and cause soil erosion to occur previous research has shown that the rearward region of the forest can be washed out due to the erosion tanaka et al 2013 thus the reduction of the fluid force in the vegetation area is necessary to minimize the tree damage from soil erosion limited research has been carried out on how to reduce forest damage by a combination of vegetation and artificial structures such as an embankment and a coastal forest tanaka et al 2014 or sand dunes and vegetation tanaka et al 2006 however the implementation of such artificial structures may not be economically viable for developing and under developed countries vegetation in the riparian environment river floodplains and wetlands is found in different sizes including grass shrubs or trees short vegetation often becomes submerged during high flow depth events like floods some studies have investigated the effectiveness of submerged or emergent vegetation alone and the combination of submerged and emergent vegetation on reducing the flow velocity and discharge in an open channel gambi et al 1990 ghisalberti and nepf 2002 huai et al 2014 in the flows through the submerged vegetation the mean velocity was high above the canopy and low within the canopy gambi et al 1990 in a study of a two layer vegetation array the velocity above the submerged layer was reduced by tall dowels liu et al 2010 huai et al 2014 analytically investigated the velocity distribution through a double layer of rigid vegetation in an open channel and showed that a very low velocity zone is created within the submerged layer near the channel bed whereas a slightly higher velocity was observed in the zone above the submerged layer compared to that within the submerged layer thus a submerged layer of vegetation combined with emergent vegetation may reduce the flow velocity and fluid force around the vegetation ground in a tsunami event however studies on the effectiveness of double layer vegetation for tsunami mitigation purposes are still limited pandanus odoratissimus is a representative tree in the coastal area that produces dense aerial roots this species was found to be effective in reducing the tsunami energy due to its dense aerial roots when tsunami inundation was less than 5 m tanaka et al 2007 it is reported that vertically double layer vegetation a combination of c equisetifolia tall trees and p odoratissimus short trees in kalutara sri lanka and a combination of cocos nucifera tall trees and p odoratissimus short trees in habaraduwa sri lanka were effective in reducing the tsunami energy behind the vegetation in the 2004 iot tanaka et al 2007 after the 2004 iot c equisetifolia and p odoratissimus were planted together as the new coastal vegetation in the tsunami affected area in sri lanka tanaka 2009 since p odoratissimus can grow with dense aerial roots and c equisetifolia trees become tall with a large trunk diameter the combination of these two tree species could be considered as a double layer forest for mitigating future tsunamis an environment friendly forested embankment system with various tree species including short and tall tree species was implemented in the tohoku area of japan after gejt by the morino project a nonprofit organization strusińska correia 2017 although the double layer vegetation was found effective against the iot and its implementation has already started the mitigation effects of double layer vegetation against a tsunami are not clearly understood this study aimed to investigate the mitigation effects of a double layer of rigid vegetation against a tsunami inundation and to further elucidate the role of a submerged layer of vegetation within an emergent vegetation for reducing the fluid force behind the vegetation as well as reducing the flow velocity near the ground in and around the vegetation in order to achieve the aforementioned objective flume experiments were conducted with physical models representing emergent vegetation only submerged vegetation only and double layer vegetation a combination of submerged and emergent vegetation the height and density of the submerged vegetation were varied while keeping the emergent vegetation condition fixed a range of froude numbers corresponding to those observed in the past tsunami inundation in the inland regions were considered for the flume experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions 2 1 1 flume characteristics and flow conditions laboratory experiments were conducted at saitama university in an experimental flume that is 5 m in length 0 7 m in width and 0 5 m in height a constant bed slope of 1 500 was installed in the flume the vegetation models were mounted on the flume bed at 1 82 m from the inlet a schematic of the experimental flume is shown in fig 1 a the estimated froude numbers fr u gh 0 5 where u is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and h is the water depth m in the sendai plain were between 0 7 and 1 during the 2011gejt tanaka et al 2013 while fr 0 64 1 04 were observed in the inland area in banda aceh during the 2004 iot fritz et al 2006 most of the tsunami flow in the inland was identified as subcritical with fr values 0 7 1 in the 2004 sumatra and 2006 java tsunamis spiske et al 2010 because the period of an actual tsunami wave is very long its regeneration in an experimental scenario is very difficult and not suitable for proper scaling whereas the tsunami flow in the flume could be generated by a control pump larsen et al 2018 due to the long period a tsunami current can be considered as a quasi steady flow tanaka and igarashi 2016 in this study the tsunami current was produced by a pump discharge m3 s for appropriate scaling and a better understanding of the mitigation effect of a vegetation model against a tsunami flow inland the flow was maintained by a valve and a flow meter signet 8150 flow totalizer considering the actual case a model scale of 1 100 and five quasi steady flow conditions were set to replicate a real scale inland tsunami flow while keeping the froude value like the real scale the flow condition was set before placement of the vegetation model in the flume a flume flow meter was used to maintain a quasi steady subcritical flow and identify the discharge a particle image velocimetry piv system and an electromagnetic flow meter emfm amplifier type vm 2000 sensor type vm2 200 04p kenek corporation were used to measure the streamwise velocity of the flow and the water depth was measured along the centerline throughout the flume by a moveable point gauge kenek corporation first five initial water depths h 0 5 50 6 06 6 54 7 01 and 7 6 cm were selected against five identified discharges second the velocity for each of the selected water depths was measured by the emfm with 10 s and 100 hz sampling frequencies and a piv system type green laser sheet 200 m g kato koen co ltd with 30 s and 200 hz sampling frequencies the mean velocities measured by the emfm and piv systems were within 2 the velocities measured by the two systems were then averaged and the final initial depth averaged velocities u 0 0 51 0 57 0 60 0 64 and 0 67 m s were obtained for each of the five depths finally five initial quasi steady subcritical flow conditions were set with five initial froude numbers fr 0 u 0 gh 0 0 5 of 0 70 0 73 0 75 0 77 and 0 78 2 1 2 vegetation condition and model setup the average tree trunk height diameter and density observed in the sendai plain were 15 m 0 4 m and 0 2 trees m2 respectively tanaka and onai 2017 the field observation conducted by tanaka et al 2007 after the 2004 iot reported that the trees in the front line of c equisetifolia vegetation in sri lanka having a trunk diameter greater than 0 3 m were unbroken and also able to trap artificial debris and broken branches of trees that study also found that the trees with a large trunk diameter were found at a lower tree density larger spacing between trees if the tree crown height is high relative to the tsunami inundation depth then the trees could be considered as circular cylinders pasha and tanaka 2017 p odoratissimus was found to be effective in reducing the tsunami force due to its high density and complex aerial roots tanaka et al 2007 2013 the vertical structure of a p odoratissimus tree varies due to its dense aerial roots considering the trunk diameter at breast height and dense roots the vertical configuration of a real p odoratissimus tree was scaled down to a rigid circular cylinder thuy et al 2018 in the current study the double layered vegetation was considered by a combination of short and tall trees the tall vegetation was considered with lower density and thickness so that the crown was relatively high compared to the heights of the tsunami inundation and the short trees thus only trunks of the tall trees were taken into account in providing the drag force against the tsunami flow which were simulated by the circular cylinders while the short layer vegetation was modeled assuming dense growth of the p odoratissimus trees in a real tsunami tree breakage may occur however this study assumed the nonbreaking condition of trees for simplicity in investigating the energy loss mechanisms through the combination of short submerged and tall emergent vegetation as an initial step previous studies iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 have reported that dense emergent vegetation is effective in reducing a tsunami s energy further dense vegetation of a particular thickness was shown to be more effective in reducing a tsunami s energy than sparse vegetation having a similar thickness pasha and tanaka 2017 in this current study the vegetation thickness selected for emergent vegetation was similar to that of the previous study indeed the vegetation was designed to be sparse so that a secondary submerged layer could be incorporated to create a double layer vegetation model in addition the changes to the behavior of the flow through the double layer vegetation could be elucidated by comparing it with the single layer emergent vegetation of similar thickness to investigate the mitigation effect of a submerged layer within an emergent vegetation the density and height of the submerged layer were varied while keeping the emergent vegetation fixed considering a physical scale of 1 100 circular wooden cylinders of 0 004 m diameter d were chosen to simulate the trees the cylinders were mounted on a flat plate in a staggered arrangement for the construction of the vegetation model fig 1b e the vegetation models covered the full width of the flume identical cylinders were chosen for the short and tall vegetation models to maintain the similarity of the vegetation arrangements cylinders of heights 0 03 and 0 05 m were respectively used for the short vegetation and a fixed height of 0 18 m was selected for the tall vegetation model the double layer vegetation model was constructed by combining short 0 03 and 0 05 m in height and tall 0 18 m in height cylinders i e 0 03 and 0 05 m height cylinders were separately used with the 0 18 m tall cylinders for the construction of two different double layers the flow structure around a vegetation model depends upon the non dimensional spacing g d g is the space between neighboring cylinders in the cross flow direction and d is the diameter of a cylinder takemura and tanaka 2007 first cylinders of height 0 18 m were set at g d 2 15 to construct the tall vegetation model g is the space between neighboring tall cylinders in the cross flow direction so that the density of the vegetation was 0 18 trees m2 in full scale where the area is considered to be the horizontal area of the flume bed covered by the cylinders the center to center distance between the cylinders d and the width w v of the emergent vegetation was determined considering a vegetation thickness of dn 1 8 no cm which corresponds to 180 no cm on a real scale where d is the diameter of the cylinder and n is the number of cylinders in the direction of flow per unit length along the cross stream direction of flow shuto 1987 iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 the value of n is defined as the product of the tree density and forest width in the flow direction shuto 1987 in this study the value of dn in model scale was calculated by the following formula 1 d n 2 3 d 2 w v d where the first factor 2 3 d2 represents the cylinder density and 2 represents the number of cylinders contained within the rectangular area in a staggered arrangement defined in fig 1c for the double layer vegetation the tall cylinders were first arranged identically to the tall vegetation model and the short cylinders of heights 0 03 and 0 05 m were then respectively placed within the tall vegetation arrangement two types of double layer vegetation models were constructed by setting two g d values 0 042 and 0 563 where g is the space between neighboring short cylinders in the cross stream direction of flow the density and width of tall vegetation were kept constant while the short cylinders were arranged among the tall cylinders because the initial flow depths were above 0 05 m the short cylinders remained submerged and the tall cylinders remained emergent during the experiment two types of single short vegetation models of g d 0 042 and 0 563 were also constructed each short layer model was identical to the short layer in the double layer vegetation the flow within the double layer vegetation can be distinguished as two layers a submerged layer sl and an emergent layer el above sl defined in fig 1d details of the vegetation arrangement are given in table 1 and fig 1b where d el and d sl are the distances between neighboring cylinders in the same line in emergent and submerged layers respectively g el d el 2 d and g sl d sl 2 d are spaces between the neighboring cylinders in the two following lines in an emergent and submerged layers respectively z sl is the height of the submerged layer and the subscripts sl and el represent the submerged and emergent layers respectively the double layer vegetation model el with sl esl in table 1 fig 1d single layer emergent oel only emergent layer fig 1e and single layer submerged osl only submerged layer fig 1f were placed individually in the flume two different heights of osl were selected to observe the effect of height as well as density single layer submerged vegetation corresponding to the double layer vegetation case osl in table 1 was placed in the flume to compare the flow structures of double layer vegetation case esl 2 2 experimental procedures and data analysis 2 2 1 water depth measurement selected flow conditions were maintained after placing each type of vegetation model water depth was measured throughout the center of the flume at 1 5 cm intervals depending on the water surface variation in the vegetated channel 2 2 2 velocity measurement the streamwise velocity of a vegetated flow was measured at three different locations f front 10 cm upstream of vegetation m middle center of the vegetation and flume and b behind 7 cm downstream of vegetation to analyze the impact of fluid force on trees and near the ground in the vegetation zone to measure the stream wise velocity an emfm was placed 1 cm above the channel bed and in a vertically upward direction with 0 5 1 cm spacing up to 2 cm below the water surface this process was conducted in front of inside and behind the vegetation i e the streamwise velocities were measured at a place and then the emfm was moved to the next place for an experimental case because the spacing between the cylinders in the short layer was not adequate a small hole removal of cylinders was made to place the emfm inside the vegetation fig 1g data were collected at 10 s and 100 hz sampling frequencies piv was used in front of and behind the vegetation in the crosswise direction of the flow to measure the streamwise velocity the velocity inside the vegetation was not measured by piv due to the limited space between cylinders piv data was collected at 30 s and 200 hz sampling frequencies for similarity of data resolution the vertical velocity profile in front of inside and behind the vegetation is presented by the emfm data the mean velocity in front and behind the vegetation was then selected by averaging the data obtained from the piv and emfm because the placement of the emfm required a minimum of 1 2 cm above the channel bed and the height of the sl for dense case esld3 and intermediate case esli3 cylinders was 3 cm the velocities inside the submerged vegetation for those two cases were not measured the velocity inside the vegetation u v was also calculated analytically by assuming that the slope component of the gravity force was equal to the drag force huai et al 2014 kbarak et al 2008 2 u v 2 g i s x s y c d d where i is the slope component here the water surface slope was used s x and s y are the spaces between the cylinders in the direction of flow and its transverse direction respectively c d is the coefficient of drag of a cylinder here c d 1 is used 2 2 3 fluid force index measurement the breaking and wash out conditions of trees and houses were determined by the force f acting on a tree and house as follows tanaka and onai 2017 3 f 1 2 c d ρ d bh f i where f i u 2 h is the fluid force index c d is the coefficient of the drag of the tree ρ is the density of water kg m3 and d bh is the tree trunk diameter m at breast height therefore f i is an important parameter to determine the tree breakage and wash out condition of trees in this study the f i values were estimated behind the forest for all experimental cases 2 3 important non dimensional parameters used in this study this study analyzed the flow characteristics in the vegetated flume by considering the following important dimensional parameters 4 f 1 u 0 h 0 w v d el d sl d g el g sl z sl g 0 where z sl is the height of the submerged layer for the definitions of d d el d sl g el g sl and w v please see section 2 1 2 using the buckingham π theorem the following dimensionless groups could be formed 5 f u 0 g h 0 g el d g sl d t a n θ z n u n 0 where u 0 gh 0 fr 0 tanθ h 2 h 1 w v is the water surface slope h 1 and h 2 are the water depths in front of and at the end of the vegetation respectively z n z z sl z is the vertical distance from the flume bed within a flow depth is the non dimensional distance to the bed within a flow depth and u n u u 0 is the non dimensional velocity at z n 3 results 3 1 flow structure in the vegetation zone fig 2 represents the flow structure around and inside the vegetation the initial water depth h 0 throughout the flume was constant before placement of the vegetation model when vegetation models were placed in the flume the water surface was elevated in front of the vegetation and gradually decreased towards the downstream section fig 2a and b for all flow conditions fig 2c shows the change in water level rise δh 1 h 1 h 0 defined in fig 2a and b and changes in relative water depth δh 1 h 0 in front of the vegetation with changing fr 0 for all vegetation models δh 1 increased with increasing fr 0 the upstream water level increased rapidly with increasing sl height and density in cases esl and osl whereas the relative water rise was almost constant with increasing fr 0 in case esl the water rise and relative water rise increased in comparison with cases oel and osl the maximum δh 1was observed in case esld5 which increased 36 42 and 25 54 compared to cases osl and oel respectively with fr 0 0 78 in comparison the maximum relative water rise was increased by 37 and 89 with fr 0 0 70 in case esld5 compared to case osl and oel respectively inside the vegetation the water surface declined gradually the water surface gradient tan θ inside the vegetation as a function of fr 0 is presented in fig 2d the value of tan θ increased slightly with increasing fr 0 for case oel whereas it remained almost constant but higher for all double layer vegetation cases compared to case osl and oel respectively the maximum water surface gradient inside the vegetation was observed in case esld5 where it increased by 35 and 48 compared to case osl and oel respectively for fr 0 0 78 although the water level rise in front of the vegetation was much larger the surface gradient did not change much in double layer vegetation cases relative to the single layer vegetation case oel with increasing fr 0 although the water gradient was very steep inside the vegetation in esl cases it gradually decreased behind the vegetation and the flow did not collide directly with the ground behind the vegetation due to the presence of sl the water level remained above the initial depth with a continuous mild water surface gradient fig 2a 3 2 change in water depth behind the vegetation air bubbles were not observed in the flow with cases osl fig 2b however they were clearly observed in cases esl fig 2a fig 3 shows the air entrainment phenomenon inside the double layer vegetation and air bubbles in the flow behind the vegetation air bubbles were produced and circulated through the water behind the vegetation fig 3b the maximum air bubble flow zone bz behind the vegetation was observed up to 40 cm downstream from the end of the vegetation i e from x1 to x2 in fig 3c in this study the water surface elevation in the air bubble zone δh bz h esl h osl where h esl and h osl represent the average water depth in the zone bz for case esl and associated osl respectively e g the difference of the average water depths between esld5 and osld5 in the zone bz was determined to show the effect of sl in an el on changing the water depth behind the vegetation fig 3d is a schematic of the changes in water depth between case esl and the corresponding case osl in the zone bz the average increase in water depth for double layer vegetation compared to the associated single layer submerged vegetation is shown in table 2 it was observed that δh bz increased with increasing fr 0 and sl height the maximum depth increase was around 12 18 for cases esl compared to osl the increasing trend remained almost constant for high fr 0 values the greatest water depth increase was in case esli5 air entrainment and its effect on the flow behind the vegetation are discussed in section 4 2 3 3 velocity in the vegetation zone measured velocities at three locations f m and b as shown in fig 3d for vegetation cases oel esld5 and esli5 are given in figs 4 and 5 at the three locations the near ground zone was considered to be 3 cm high i e from the flume bed 3 cm in the vertical direction fig 4 shows the non dimensional velocity profiles at f fig 4a m fig 4b and b fig 4c respectively for fr 0 0 78 the data shows that the velocity near the flume bed was higher for case oel compared with the double layer vegetation cases at position b the near bed velocity was almost identical in cases esld5 and esli5 however as the distance from the bed increased the velocity of case esld5 became higher than those of esli5 and oel in this study the velocity in front of vegetation was measured 10 cm upstream of the vegetation the velocity in this region was also affected by vegetation the pressure difference in front and behind the vegetation created a steep slope inside the vegetation and the maximum velocity was reached near the ground the velocity in front of the vegetation was slightly reduced near the water surface which may be the effect of the pressure difference caused by the backwater rise the effects of backwater rise reduce the flow velocity in front of the forest iimura and tanaka 2012 in case oel the higher velocity was observed near the ground both in front of inside and behind the vegetation when there was a sl the velocity near the ground was reduced and the maximum velocity was observed just above the sl inside and behind the vegetation the velocity near the water surface was affected by air bubbles changes of mean non dimensional velocity in the sl u n sl and el u n el within the vegetation against fr 0 are shown in fig 5a a lower flow velocity in the sl and a higher flow velocity in the el were generated in double layer vegetation cases fig 5a u n sl slightly decreased with fr 0 in both double layer models in contrast u n el remained almost constant until fr 0 0 75 and after that it showed an increasing trend for case esld5 and a decreasing trend for case esli5 in case esld5 the u n sl observed was lower than in case esli5 but for the case esld5 u n el was higher than case esli5 the effect of the two different velocity layers inside the vegetation is explained in section 4 3 fig 5b and c represent the mean non dimensional velocity average of the mean velocity obtained by piv and emfm for fr 0 0 78 the mean non dimensional velocity near the flume bed was significantly reduced by the double layer vegetation relative to the single layer emergent case fig 5b the maximum was reduced by 21 and 74 at f and m respectively in case esld5 whereas it was reduced by 33 at b in case esli5 however not only the velocity near the ground but also the depth averaged velocities of double layer vegetation cases were lower than that of single layer emergent vegetation at three locations fig 5c the average velocities at f and m were almost the same for the double layer vegetation cases where it was notably higher in case esld5 in comparison with esli5 at position b at position b the mean velocity was reduced around 11 and 25 for cases sld5 and sli5 respectively in comparison with the case oel 3 4 fluid force index f i the fluid force index f i was calculated behind the forest using depth averaged velocity fig 6 summarizes the variation of f i for all vegetation cases against fr 0 f i increased rapidly for cases oel esld3 and esli3 with increasing fr 0 while f i increased slowly in cases esld5 and esli5 irrespective of the fr 0 the values of f i in esl cases were lower than in oel cases it was found that case esli5 had the minimum value the fluid force reduction by the double layer vegetation is discussed in section 4 4 4 discussion 4 1 air entrainment through the vegetation air entrainment is often found in hydraulic jumps chanson and brattberg 2000 steep chute and dam spillways chanson and paintal 2003 open channels ohtsu et al 2004 spillways boes and hager 2003 and porous pooled spillways felder and chanson 2013 and it contributes to a reduction of the flow energy however air entrainment in a flow through vegetation is rarely reported in this study a large amount of air bubbles was produced inside the vegetation and continued in the flow behind the vegetation fig 3a summarizes the detailed characteristics of the air entrainment phenomenon inside the vegetation a high angle of the water surface slope and high roughness are the important parameters for air entrainment in the flow through spillways or chutes boes and hager 2003 felder and chanson 2013 in the present study the presence of a submerged layer increased the roughness in the vegetation patch and produced a large backwater rise in front of the vegetation that increased the water surface slope inside the vegetation the water surface slope within the vegetation zone defined in fig 2a was around 14 the steep flow gradient caused a high flow velocity in the el the flow structure of case esli5 for fr 0 0 78 is shown in fig 3a thus the air bubbles could be expected in this current experimental scenario air entrainment in the vegetation zone also depends on the vegetation arrangement and hydraulic conditions in this investigation the air entrainment was not observed in the first row of the vegetation whereas it was started from the 2nd row and continued with increasing the number of bubbles towards the end of the vegetation fig 3a in this arrangement the circular cylinders were mounted in a staggered arrangement where the spacing between the emergent cylinders g el d was 2 13 the value of reynolds number r e du ʋ where d is the diameter of the cylinder u is the velocity and ʋ is the kinematic viscosity of water was calculated to be 1227 1432 and 1844 at the front middle and end rows of the vegetation array respectively the arrangement of the cylinders and the range of r e were favorable to produce the vortices behind the cylinders previous study showed that von karman vortices were apparently close to the cylinders when the density was very low the distance between cylinders was five times their diameter and the r e was supposed to be high around 1340 stoesser et al 2010 a primitive karman vortex was stably formed behind each cylinder in a staggered arrangement when g d 1 8 and r e was between 1000 and 4000 takemura and tanaka 2007 in addition the water surface fluctuation just behind the cylinders from the second row to the end of the vegetation was observed fig 3a the flow through cylindrical arrangements was observed to be accelerated locally on the surface just behind the cylinder which might result in the local water surface depressions stoesser et al 2010 in this study although the r e was high enough for vortices to occur in the front row of cylinders the water surface was almost flat and the local water surface fluctuation was not observed behind these cylinders therefore it could be assumed that the combined effect of the vortex formation and tremendous surface depression behind the cylinders forced air into the water that produced air bubbles in the vegetation zone in this experiment towards the end of the vegetation the r e increased water surface became steeper and water surface fluctuation was observed to be high which may be accelerated the local water surface depression just behind the cylinders due to this air entrainment was enhanced in the rearward region of the vegetation patch most of the air bubbles behind the vegetation were observed just above the sl fig 3b the bubbles traveled some distance within the flow behind the vegetation before disappearing by making a spray the traveling distance of the air bubbles was determined by visualizing the flow with a high resolution camera and the maximum spray was marked on the sidewalls of the flume the spray distance from the end of the vegetation was around 40 cm in length along the flow direction fig 3c in the region of the traveling distance downstream of the vegetation of the air bubbles the size of the individual air bubbles was measured by video analysis video of the flow behind the vegetation was captured by a high speed digital camera kato koen co ltd that was controlled by a pc using photography software k ⅱ ver 1 03 the video was taken with a scale attached in the cross section area of the flume the video was then analyzed by software flow expert ver 1 2 6 kato koen co ltd to determine the size of the bubbles two hundred frames of the video were selected and the bubble size was observed in each frame just behind the vegetation some air bubble clusters and overlapping air bubbles were found therefore the area of analysis for the bubble size measurement was considered 7 8 cm downstream of the vegetation where individual bubbles could be separated rectangular section in fig 7 the observed maximum sizes of isolated bubbles enclosed within circles in the rectangle in fig 7 in the analysis area were selected to measure their size this study found that the diameter of the identified large individual bubbles in each frame was around 2 mm whereas almost all individual bubbles were visualized as less than 2 mm chanson 1997 investigated the bubble size distribution by a double tip conductivity probe in free surface aeration in an open channel experimentally and reported that the greatest frequency of air bubble chord lengths was found for the bubbles with chords between 0 and 3 mm albarkani et al 2018 estimated the bubble size in a hydraulic jump in an experimental flume by video analysis and reported that maximum bubbles are in the range of 2 7 6 5 mm in this study the froude similarity in an actual scale was considered and the model scale was 1 100 however although the length scale of the air bubble is approximated in this experimental scenario the actual bubble size in a real case is characterized by different parameters e g reynolds number vortex formation and its characteristics surface tension buoyancy force etc thus the effect of the bubbles on a real scale is unknown in this study air bubbles were not seen with a single layer of submerged vegetation see fig 2b in the case of the double layer vegetation where the submerged layer density is considered the same air bubbles were present and the flow depth behind the vegetation remained higher than in case osl in the present study it is assumed that the water level rise behind the vegetation in case esl was due to the presence of el where entrained air bubbles may have contributed an experimental observation quantified the water level rise due to entrained air which contributed to reducing the flow energy when they disappeared hoque and aoki 2005 paul and ismail 2012 conducted a numerical simulation to estimate the rise in water levels due to surges associated with the cyclones in april 1991 and aila along the coast of bangladesh the study found that the water level increased 2 12 in the cyclone event due to air entrainment because of the large backwater rise in front of the vegetation a steep water surface gradient was generated inside the vegetation and the flow depth decreased behind the vegetation the decreased water depth created a supercritical flow and in some cases the flow collided with the ground directly behind the vegetation pasha and tanaka 2017 in this study adding a submerged layer within an emergent layer produced a large backwater rise in front of the vegetation entrained a large number of air bubbles and elevated the water surface behind the vegetation due to the surface elevation the water gradient behind the vegetation remained relatively mild and the flow did not collide directly with the ground behind the vegetation this study investigated the air entrainment in the vegetation and discussed its possible effect in the water rise behind the vegetation however further study directly measuring the air concentration is required to clarify its effects 4 2 mixing layer fig 8 a represents a comparison between analytic and experimental velocity profiles for the flow through a double layer of rigid vegetation the analytic value shows that the velocity in the sl was less than that of the el which remained constant in each layer the mean values of analytic and experimental results were very close in the sl some difference in the velocity profile was observed between the two results because the analytic measurement considered only the gravity and drag force respectively on the other hand in the actual case the velocity profile may be affected by other factors viz shear stress air bubbles turbulent mixing the difference in velocity between the two layers is characterized by a strong point of inflection in the velocity profile that induces strong vortices poggi et al 2004 because of the velocity difference in the two parallel streams mixing layer turbulence was formed around the point of inflection in the velocity profile raupach et al 1996 in the flow through rigid double layer vegetation the velocity was lower in the submerged layer compared to the velocity above the submerged layer and created a mixing zone around the top of the submerged layer huai et al 2014 fig 8b in the current study the submerged layer enhanced the resistance of the vegetation near the vegetation ground which lowered the velocity near the flume bed in the vegetation zone inside the vegetation mean velocities in the sl were reduced by 64 and 34 for case esld5 and esli5 respectively as compared to case oel while the fluid velocity increased by 44 and 18 in el for cases esld5 and esli5 respectively fig 5a the mixing layer zone was observed within the sl for case esli5 and within and near the top of sl for case esld5 fig 8a in this investigation the mixing layer zone was also found above the sl because this study considered very dense sl and the water surface gradually declined in the vegetation zone whereas a previous study huai et al 2014 considered very sparse vegetation distance between cylinders in streamwise and transverse directions were 11 and 5 3 cm respectively while the still water depth remained constant throughout the channel the depth of a mixing layer can be quantified by the thickness of the vorticity δ w δu du dz max where δu is the difference between two free stream velocities above and below the mixing length u is the function of z and du dz max represents the maximum slope value of the velocity curve that belongs to the mixing zone raupach et al 1996 in the current study the calculated approximate values of δ w were found to be 2 91 and 3 05 cm for cases esld5 and sli5 respectively where the maximum values of the free stream velocities were taken in the sl and the el respectively these were taken above and below the mixing layer defined in fig 8b because the sl of case esld5 was denser and the velocity was very low compared to case esli5 vortices might be smaller in length in addition the vortex transport rate may be less due to the low velocity in the submerged layer for case seld5 relative to esli5 the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation due to mixing in two parallel co flowing layers is proportional to the production of vortices which increases with the increasing depth of the mixing layer raupach et al 1996 from the calculated value of the mixing layer depth and identification of the mixing zone in the velocity profile fig 8a it could be assumed that the turbulent energy dissipation due to mixing may be higher in case esli5 as compared to case esld5 moreover the high velocity in the el and shorter mixing length inside the vegetation may have caused a higher mean velocity behind the vegetation for case esld5 when compared to that of esli5 however the double layer vegetation is found to be effective to reduce a significant amount of velocity near the bed just behind the vegetation therefore the cumulative effect of a mild water gradient air bubble entrainment and mixing phenomena was found to be effective in reducing the mean velocity that generated a low velocity zone behind the vegetation fig 2a 4 3 fluid force reduction this study investigated the effectiveness of a submerged layer of vegetation within emergent vegetation for reducing the velocity and fluid force in the vegetation zone from the velocity distribution and water surface profile explained in previous sections it is pointed out that the water surface behind the vegetation gradually decreases and velocity increases fig 5c which may increase the fluid force just behind the vegetation high fluid force is reported to damage trees by breaking and washing them out tanaka and onai 2017 tanaka et al 2007 noted that big scoured holes were created just behind c equisetifolia tall and diameter greater than 0 3 m trees at suk samaran village and that the trees were uprooted by a large amount of erosion at khao lak in the 2004 iot in sri lanka soil may be eroded because of the high force and angle of a fluid attack and the rearward portion of the forest was reported to be washed out by the erosion tanaka et al 2013 the driftwood produced by tree breakage and washing out generated a secondary disaster due to collision with the structures behind the vegetation tanaka and ogino 2017 tanaka and suzuki 2013 a previous study pasha and tanaka 2017 showed that a dense and emergent single layer forest increased the upstream water level and generated a steep slope inside the vegetation which directly became supercritical just behind the forest however a flow having a steep slope may collide directly with the ground and increase the fluid force due to the high flow velocity which could make the region vulnerable to erosion as well as damage downstream thus besides the energy dissipation a reduction of fluid force behind the forest is necessary to minimize tsunami disasters eq 3 shows that the fluid force decreases when the f i fluid force index value decreases the fluid force indexes for emergent single and double layer vegetation are presented in fig 6 this index value was very high when the emergent vegetation had no submerged layer on the contrary the value was decreased significantly in the presence of a submerged layer irrespective of the fr 0 the maximum f i values were reduced by 23 and 29 for cases esld5 and esli5 respectively f i was calculated using the mean velocity behind the vegetation from the velocity measurement the average velocity at b was found to be the minimum in case esli5 due to the combined effect of mixing and air bubbles that resulted in a further decrease of the fluid force index value hence the less dense submerged layer was found to be a bit more effective to reduce the f i behind the vegetation in this study the double layer vegetation was effective in reducing the velocity and fluid force behind the vegetation therefore the washing out of trees by erosion just behind the vegetation and damage to the structures downstream of vegetation could be minimized by a double layer of rigid vegetation 4 4 energy reduction the efficacy of a vegetation plan is measured by its capability to reduce the flow energy the total relative energy loss e 1 e 2 e 1 where e 1 and e 2 are the total energy head upstream and downstream of the vegetation is proportional to the difference in water depth and flow velocity respectively in front of and behind the vegetation dense vegetation increases the water depth in front of it by reflection and reduces the velocity and water depth behind it due to its higher resistance iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 investigated the energy reduction through emergent vegetation experimentally and found that dense vegetation reduced the flow energy more than sparse vegetation where the two types of vegetation were similar in thickness dn 1 8 no cm this study considered a sparse emergent vegetation of similar thickness dn 1 8 no cm so that a submerged layer can be incorporated within the vegetation to construct a double layer vegetation because sparse vegetation was found less effective in reducing the flow energy than the same thickness of dense vegetation the effectiveness of sparse vegetation while containing submerged layer vegetation needs to be elucidated in this study the thickness of the emergent vegetation was considered in order to investigate the changes in mitigation effect and to clarify the effectiveness of a sparse emergent forest while containing a submerged layer of vegetation a recent study has shown that a sparse g d 2 13 emergent vegetation of thickness dn 1 8 no cm containing a submerged vegetation layer reduced the total relative energy by 46 52 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2018 in contrast the total relative energy loss for a single layer of emergent vegetation of thickness dn 1 8 no cm was estimated as 33 37 and 26 28 for dense g d 0 25 and sparse g d 2 13 vegetation respectively which increases with the density and thickness of the vegetation pasha and tanaka 2017 however the tree trunk diameter in a dense forest becomes relatively smaller due to the limited spacing between the trees and trees are more prone to destruction in disastrous events like tsunamis the destruction of a dense forest of trees having small trunk diameter was observed in the 2004 iot tanaka et al 2007 moreover tanaka et al 2011 showed that the limited coastal land in sri lanka is a big obstacle to the implementation of a thick forest for tsunami mitigation therefore considering the restriction in land uses and effective growth of the emergent trees a finite length of double layer vegetation having sparse emergent trees containing a dense area of submerged trees may have an improved capability in reducing the energy of an inundating tsunami current 5 conclusions this study aimed to understand the mitigation effects of a double layer of vegetation against a tsunami inundation as well as its role in reducing the velocity in the vegetation zone and destructive fluid force behind the vegetation the following findings could be summarized in this study the presence of a submerged vegetation layer in an emergent vegetation enhanced the hydraulic resistance backwater rise increased around 36 42 and 25 54 in front of the vegetation compared to osl and oel respectively of the vegetation zone and provided more energy reduction the double layer vegetation also produced a large number of air bubbles inside the vegetation which continued in the flow behind the vegetation the increase in the water level behind the vegetation in case esl was around 12 18 maximum compared to case osl the presence of air bubbles may be effective in raising the water surface behind the vegetation the increased water depth created a relatively mild water surface gradient behind the vegetation which protected the ground from a direct impact of the flowing water gradient introducing a submerged vegetation layer within an emergent vegetation layer further reduced the maximum velocity behind the vegetation by 25 the velocity near the bed in front within and behind the vegetation was reduced by maximums of 18 74 and 33 respectively this could effectively reduce bed erosion in and around the vegetation zone moreover the double layer vegetation generated a mixing velocity zone inside the vegetation that may further contribute in reducing the velocity behind the vegetation moreover the double layer vegetation generated a low velocity region behind the vegetation that contributed to reduction of the fluid force by around 23 29 relative to a single layer of emergent vegetation reducing this fluid force coupled with the air bubble effect creating a mild water surface implies reducing the erosion of the ground just behind the vegetation and reduction of breakage or wash out incidents downstream of the vegetation thus not only increasing the resistance against the flow by the emergent forest but also reducing the vulnerability to a secondary disaster due to the driftwood production caused by washing out of trees especially the rearward portion of the forest could be minimized by the double layer vegetation in this study double layer vegetation was found to be effective in the range of experimental conditions simulating an inundating tsunami the double layer of rigid vegetation integrating short trees of high density near the ground with sufficiently spaced tall trees of large trunk diameter may have an improved mitigation capability as a bio shield against tsunamis this study elucidated some important findings including an air entrainment phenomenon in the vegetation zone further study of air entrainment with different parameters e g model scale buoyancy force and reynolds number and direct measurement of the air bubble concentration behind the vegetation is required to clarify its effect on reducing the energy downstream of the vegetation

22008,this paper proposes a hybrid technique combining the discrete modules method dmm lu et al 2016 the eigenfunction matching method emm tsai et al 2011 and a further extended rankine source method rsm to treat the two dimensional hydroelastic problem of floating structures over variable bathymetry in the hybrid technique dmm is employed to discrete a floating structure into a set of rigid modules connected by elastic beams with equivalent deformation conditions of the structure the incident wave potential over variable bathymetry without the presence of floating structures is obtained by emm a rankine source method developed by feng et al 2017 is further extended to gain the diffracted and radiated wave potentials with the discreted multi rigid modules over variable bathymetry a coupled model for the hydroelasticity of floating structures over variable bathymetry can be established by substituting the external wave loads exerted by the obtained incident diffracted and radiated potentials into the multi rigid body dynamic equation by dmm in the frequency domain the convergence of the hybrid technique is validated through a good agreement against published data riyansyah et al 2010 for hydroelastic responses of a two dimensional floating structure over a flat seabed effects of sloping seabeds on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure are preliminarily investigated by the present hybrid technique keywords hydroelastic response eigenfunction matching method discrete modules method rankine source method a hybrid technique 1 introduction floating structures with large dimensions and relatively small structural rigidities such as very large floating structures vlfss have apparent flexible body responses rather than just rigid body movements in waves thereby significantly relying on accurate hydroelastic analyses of the floating structures over realistic bathymetries ding et al 2017 in the past several decades development of hydroelasticity theory can be divided into four phases i e 2d linear theory 2d nonlinear theory 3d linear theory and 3d nonlinear theory chen et al 2006 now this theory has been widely employed to predict motions wave loads and sectional forces of elastic floating bodies in deep and shallow seabed conditions the water depth in most publications is assumed to be constant that is practically valid when the depth variation is small or in deep sea where the varying seabed topography has little effects on hydrodynamic responses of floating bodies however when floating structures are deployed in complicated seabed environments such as islands or coastal regions hydroelastic responses of floating bodies would be quite different from that in constant bathymetry the main cause of the differences is that waves would be scattered by the undulating seabed which would not take place in the flat seabed condition in this connection there had been many researches focused on hydroelastic wave body interactions over realistic seabed conditions athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 used the variational formulation and derived a consistent coupled mode system ccms to deal with linear wave propagations over a bed of arbitrary and consistent topography by including a sloping bottom mode the neumann condition on the sea bottom was satisfied afterwards based on the idea of the sloping bottom mode they developed a creative three dimensional green s function for linear water wave over variable bathymetry belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 in 2005 they further extended ccms and applied their method to hydroelastic analyses of large floating bodies of shallow draught lying over variable bathymetry regions belibassakis 2005 however the computation of the green s function based on the idea of ccms is always complicated and time consuming besides kyoung et al 2005 adopted finite element method fem based on the variational formulation in the fluid domain to calculate the sea bottom effects song et al 2005 employed the boundary element method bem solving the finite water depth green function to investigate hydrodynamic responses of a vlfs lying over uneven sea bottom and found that effects of the undulating seabed could not be neglected in the long incident wave length and in the shallow water depth however in their work water depths at infinity in all directions are assumed to be a same constant tian et al 2014 proposed a new wave spectrum assuming that waves at different locations have different spectral forms wave directions and correlated phases to represent the non uniform incident wave environment in their work bem was also employed to calculate the diffracted and radiated potentials by distributing sources in the complex seabed profile a direct coupled method was established by ding et al 2017 to analyze hydroelastic responses of floating bodies over undulating seabed in their method the fluid domain was divided into the outer and the inner regions where boussinesq equations and rankine source method rsm were respectively employed to solve the wave propagation problem the continuity relations between the two regions were fulfilled through matching wave elevations and distribution of velocities at vertical interfaces wei et al 2017 introduced a second fixed body on the seabed to represent the cylindrical bottom in the diffraction theory and conducted simulations by commercial codes like wamit although buchner 2006 had suggested that refraction and interference effects were too strong and could affect wave exciting forces on floating bodies in an incorrect way by using this method in addition a larger size and smoother edges of the second body could not improve the situation it should also be noted that this second body method cannot be directly applied to the problem of different water depths at infinity in the present work inspired by the work of 3 16 and 11 a hybrid technique combining emm dmm and a further extended rsm is proposed to treat the two dimensional frequency domain hydroelastic problem of floating structures lying over variable bathymetry 3 developed the bem technique to perform hydrodynamic analyses of a single body over variable bathymetry in their work the incident wave potential was solved by ccms proposed in athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 and the diffracted radiated potential was treated by the green s function brought up in belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 different from their work the incident wave field in this work is generated by emm proposed by tsai et al 2011 which can be applied in arbitrary seabed conditions unlike ccms requires a twice continuously differentiable seabed curve dmm was proposed by lu et al 2016 to turn the hydroelastic problem into a multi rigid body problem to analyze elastic behaviors of the vlfs and was further applied to the problem of a complicated sea environment wei et al 2017 in this paper we employ dmm combining with rsm to deal with the diffracted radiated problem of elastic floating structures over variable bathymetry in this paper the two dimensional floating structure is assumed to be a thin layer at the free surface and modeled as an elastic beam with zero thickness and zero draft for simplicity which is always supposed to be reasonable for a vlfs a general bathymetry is assumed and characterized by a depth function h x joining two semi infinite regions with constant water depths although nonlinear effects are of specific importance as in the study of slamming or large amplitude motions the solution of the linear problem still provides valuable information serving as the basis of weakly nonlinear models belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 in this connection the present problem is formulated within the framework of linear water wave and elastic beam theory under the assumption of small amplitude waves and small beam deflections the rest of this paper is organized as follows the mathematical model of a two dimensional hydroelastic problem over variable bathymetry is formulated in section 2 section 3 gives a detailed description of a hybrid technique to treat the present problem convergence study of the proposed hybrid technique is given in section 4 then section 5 presents numerical cases to investigate the effects of sloping seabed parameters on frequency domain hydroelastic responses of a floating structure finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 problem formulation in this paper a two dimensional problem concerning the hydroelastic behavior of a floating structure with a total length l over varying bathymetry is considered the problem is formulated in cartesian coordinates x z see fig 1 with its origin at left most point on the undisturbed floating structure the x axis is horizontal and z axis pointing upwards the incident wave travels from x to x note that we assume the wavelength in the left semi infinite region to be the incident wavelength λ as the wavelength varies with the varying bathymetry the seabed shows an arbitrary one dimensional variation in the middle region which lies between two regions of constant but possibly different water depths the water depth is given by 1 h x h l x x l h x x l x x r h r x x r where h l and h r denote the water depths of the left and right semi infinite domain respectively the fluid domain investigated here is bounded below by the seabeds τ 1 τ 2 and τ 3 and bounded top by the free water surfaces τ 4 τ 6 and the fluid structure interface τ 5 the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and its flow is assumed to be irrotational the wave amplitude is assumed to be sufficiently small thus the linear wave theory can be utilized the floating structure is modeled as a elastic beam with zero thickness and zero draft and is allowed to move freely in the vertical direction and would always be in contact with the fluid based on the above assumptions fluid motion can be described by a time domain velocity potential ϕ re φ e i ω t which must satisfy the laplace equation 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 where t is time ω is the wave frequency obviously φ is the frequency domain complex velocity potential and ψ φ e i ω t is the time domain complex velocity potential and they also both satisfy the laplace equation the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface conditions are expressed respectively by 3 η t ϕ z 0 o n τ 4 a n d τ 6 and 4 ϕ t g η 0 o n τ 4 a n d τ 6 where g is the gravity acceleration after substituting eq 4 into eq 3 and separation by time t a linear free surface condition in the frequency domain can be derived 5 φ z ω 2 g φ 0 o n τ 4 a n d τ 6 no flow conditions on seabed gives 6 ϕ n 0 o n τ 1 τ 2 a n d τ 3 where n is the unit normal vector with respect to the rigid seabed on the fluid structure interface i e the wet surfaces no flow penetrating boundary condition can be expressed as 7 ϕ n w t t o n τ 5 where n is the unit normal vector on the wet surface w re δ δ is the time domain complex vertical displacement along the floating structure since both ends of the floating beam are free the shear force and the bending moment must be equal to zero thus we have 8 3 w x 3 0 a n d 2 w x 2 0 x l 2 a n d x l 2 3 a hybrid technique in this section a hybrid technique is proposed to solve the two dimensional hydroelastic problem of floating structures over variable bathymetry when considering the structure domain following the work by lu et al 2016 the present technique adopts dmm to turn the hydroelastic problem into a multi rigid body problem and the continuous displacement along the floating structure is approximated by that of discrete points representing the equivalent centers of all bodies when it comes to the fluid domain the velocity potential can be divided into the incident diffracted and radiated potentials yielding the corresponding wave forces respectively emm is utilized here to take the scattering effects on the incident wave by the undulating seabed into consideration for floating structures over variable bathymetry traditional commercial codes like wamit or hydrostar employing free surface green s function cannot be used to solve the diffraction and radiation problems in order to deal with this problem feng et al 2016 2017 developed a new source distribution scheme for rsm to determine the interaction between a single body and the wave over a sloping seabed in this paper this method is further extended to generate the diffracted and radiated potentials for multi rigid bodies over sloping seabed this section can be divided into 4 subsections and organized as follows in the 1st subsection the multi body dynamic equation is constructed by utilizing dmm followed by section 3 2 where the incident wave potential over variable bathymetry is generated by emm in the 3rd subsection the diffracted and radiated potentials of the multi rigid body over variable bathymetry are obtained by used of rsm in the final subsection the incident diffracted and radiated forces derived by use of bernoulli s equation are substituted into the multi body dynamic motion equation thus forming the coupled model for the hydroelasticity of floating structures over variable bathymetry 3 1 discrete modules method discrete modules method dmm proposed by lu et al 2016 is used in this paper and briefly reviewed in this subsection the main idea of dmm is to discrete the floating structure into a set of rigid modules which are connected by elastic beams indicating that the hydroelastic problem is turned into a multi rigid body problem according to dmm euler bernoulli beam theory is employed to simulate the elastic beam connection at the equivalent center o m of adjacent modules ensuring the deformation continuity of the entire floating structure the floating structure is discretized into n rigid modules which indicates that n 1 beam elements are distributed to connect the modules in order as shown in fig 2 in accordance with finite element method and newton s second law the multi rigid body dynamic equation of the floating structure under external loads is established by 9 m δ c δ k δ f where m is the mass matrix of the floating structure c is the structural damping matrix f refers to the external wave load in the complex form including hydrostatic restoring force f s t a and the hydrodynamic forces which can be divided into the incident force f i n the diffracted force f d and the radiated force f r i e 10 f f s t a f i n f d f r δ δ and δ are respectively the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors for all freedoms of the multi rigid body system k is the entire structural stiffness matrix assembled with the stiffness matrix of all beam elements when considering the multi rigid body dynamic equation eq 9 it can be solved only if the quantity of f is known therefore the aim of the following subsections is to determine all the force components in eq 10 3 2 eigenfunction matching method the incident wave potential associated with the propagation of water waves over variable bathymetry regions without the presence of floating structures could be conveniently obtained by means of eigenfunction matching method emm in this method the seabed profile under consideration is approximated by a sequence of flat shelves separated by abrupt steps and solution of water problem on each shelf is established in terms of eigenfunctions through separation of variables although neumann condition on the seabed cannot be fully satisfied because of the artificial discontinuities bottom corners introduced in step like approximation predictions of wave propagation by emm tsai et al 2011 2014 show very good agreements with ccms and a semi analytical method by porter and porter 2000 therefore emm is employed here to determine the incident wave over an arbitrary seabed profile as shown in fig 3 the seabed is approximated by m flat shelves with water depth h m in the interval from x x m 1 to x x m by separation of time with incident potential ψ i n φ i n e i ω t the frequency domain incident potential φ i n over all the fluid domain can be expressed by 11 φ i n φ i n 1 x x 1 φ i n m x m 1 x x m φ i n m x m 1 x through separation of variables with the laplace equation the frequency domain incident wave on the m th shelf can be expressed as 12 φ i n m c m 1 e i k m 1 x x m d m 1 e i k m 1 x x m 1 z m 1 n 2 c m n e k m n x x m d m n e k m n x x m 1 z m n 13 z m 1 cosh k m 1 z h m cosh k m 1 h m z m n cos k m n z h m cos k m n h m n 2 3 4 14 k m 1 tanh k m 1 h m ω 2 g k m n tan k m n h m ω 2 g n 2 3 4 the above expressions in eq 12 of incident wave potential have satisfied the bottom and free surface conditions to calculate the coefficients c m n and d m n in eq 12 the solutions on adjacent shelves should be matched conservation of mass and momentum requires that the normal velocity and fluid pressure should be continuous on the vertical interfaces by satisfying these conditions in a least square manner linear equations are constructed details of the algorithms have already been discussed by tsai et al 2011 2014 therefore not repeated here consequently the incident wave potential φ i n x z all over the fluid domain is obtained the incident wave forces on all bodies can be calculated by integrating the incident wave pressure obtained by use of bernoulli s equation it is assumed that the incident force f i n varies periodically with the frequency ω 15 f i n f i n e i ω t 3 3 rankine source method numerical computation processes of rsm to deal with a single body problem have been fully illustrated by feng et al 2016 2017 however these processes could not be directly applied in a multi rigid body problem hence rsm is extended here to solve the diffracted and radiated potentials of the multi rigid body problem the problem on the time domain diffracted or radiated potential ϕ x t re ψ x t can be treated by rsm based on gauss divergence theorem accordingly the integral representations of ϕ is given in the following form 16 ϕ x t m 1 n s m b σ b ln r d s x s f σ f ln r d s x s o σ o ln r d s x where n is the number of the bodies x x z is the control point located arbitrarily in the fluid domain x x z is the source point r x x is the distance between the control and source points s m b is the wet surface of the m th body s f is the free surface and s o represents the seabed σ b σ f and σ o are the corresponding source strengths for the bodies the free surface and the seabed respectively on the wet surface of the bodies we have 17 ϕ n v b n where n is the unit normal vector on the present fluid boundaries and v b n represents the normal velocity of the fluid particle for the diffraction or radiation problem boundaries of the fluid field are discretized by panels with constant source strength assumed in each panel thus eq 16 is approximated by 18 ϕ x t m 1 n i 1 n m b s m i b σ m i b ln r d s x j 1 n j f s j f σ j f ln r d s x k 1 n k b s k o σ k o ln r d s x where s m i b is the i th panel of the m th body n m b is the number of panels on the m th body control points on fluid boundaries are denoted as x m i b x j f and x k o for the bodies the free surface and the seabed respectively substitute eq 18 into eqs 4 6 and 17 and rewrite them in the following convenient form 19 c σ b t σ f t σ o t v b n x m i b t ϕ x j f t 0 where c is the influence coefficient matrix in which c i j carries the influencing information from the j th source panel to the control point of the i th panel through solving eq 19 the source strength values for all fluid boundaries σ b t σ f t σ o t t at time t are obtained the vertical velocity of the fluid particle on the free surface at time t is expressed as follows 20 v f z x j f t m 1 n i 1 n m b z s m i b σ m i b ln r d s x j 1 n j f z s j f σ j f ln r d s x k 1 n k b z s k o σ k o ln r d s x the wave elevation η and velocity potential ϕ at the free surface are updated with respect to the kinematic condition eq 3 and the dynamic condition eq 4 by the 3rd order adams bashforth scheme thus at time t δ t we have 21 η t δ t η t δ t 12 23 v f z t 16 v f z t δ t 5 v f z t 2 δ t 22 ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t 12 23 η t 16 g η t δ t 5 g η t 2 δ t where δ t is the time step with the above time stepping processes the source strength values σ m i b σ j f and σ k o at all time steps can be obtained consequently the velocity potential all over the fluid domain can be calculated by eq 16 therefore the diffracted potential ϕ d x z t and radiated potential ϕ r x z t are obtained by use of the present rsm still in conjunction with bernoulli s equation the diffracted force f d t and radiated force f r t are calculated by integrating the pressure over the wet surfaces by application of fourier transformation the diffracted forces on the n bodies are expressed as 23 f d f d e i ω t 2 t 0 0 t 0 f d t cos ω t d t i 2 t 0 0 t 0 f d t sin ω t d t e i ω t where t 0 is the period of the body motion similar with the single body situation by utilizing fourier transformation the radiated forces can be decomposed into two componential forces i e the added mass

f r t sin ω t d t 3 4 coupled motion equation in this subsection the coupled motion equation of this multi rigid body system over variable bathymetry is constructed recalling the multi rigid body dynamic equation eq 9 and components of the external forces eq 10 we have 27 m δ c δ k δ f s t a f i n f d f r the hydrostatic restoring force f s t a is the product of the hydrostatic restoring matrix k and the displacement vector δ and expressed as 28 f s t a k δ substituting the incident force eq 15 the diffracted force eq 23 the radiated force eq 24 and the hydrostatic restoring force eq 28 into the multi rigid body dynamic equation eq 27 we have 29 m a δ c c δ k k δ f i n e i ω t f d e i ω t in the frequency domain like the external wave forces the motion or displacement column δ is also assumed to vary periodically 30 δ δ e i ω t therefore eq 29 can be rewritten by separating the time t thus we have the coupled motion equation in the frequency domain 31 ω 2 m a i ω c c k k δ f i n f d through solving this coupled motion equation the hydroelastic responses of the floating structure are obtained note that the structural damping c is always significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic added damping c thus can be neglected 4 convergence of the hybrid technique in this section convergence of the hybrid technique is studied by comparison against published data for a two dimensional problem associated with the flat seabed condition note that the main difference between the flat seabed problem and the sloping seabed problem lies in the incident wave potential since all the non propagating modes the second term in eq 12 induced by the sloping seabed would vanish with respect to the flat seabed condition riyansyah et al 2010 studied hydroelastic responses of a two dimensional floating structure over a flat seabed in regular waves and this specific example is again solved herein by the hybrid technique proposed in this work parameters of the two dimensional floating structure is listed in table 1 the water depth is h l 15 hydroelastic responses including the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force obtained by the present hybrid technique are compared with those calculated by riyansyah et al 2010 in their work the minimum incident wavelength was set as λ 0 2 l thus λ 0 2 l is selected here to carry out the convergence study for the number of modules n since hydroelastic responses exhibit more fluctuations in shorter incident waves fig 4 gives the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over a flat seabed in the incident wave λ 0 2 l for different number of modules it is observed that more accurate results can be obtained with larger number of modules however the computational cost would dramatically increase as the number of modules increases as can be seen in these curves 20 modules can give sufficiently accurate predictions thus the number of modules n 20 is used for subsequent analyses moreover two other incident waves with wavelengths λ 0 3 l and 0 4 l are considered to ascertain whether the hybrid technique can be utilized in a wide range of incident waves fig 5 describes the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over a flat seabed in incident waves λ 0 3 l and 0 4 l it can be seen that results by the hybrid technique are in good agreement with those obtained by riyansyah et al 2010 thereby giving a limited degree of validation of the proposed hybrid technique 5 results and discussions in this section hydroelastic responses of the floating structure in section 4 over sloping seabeds are investigated the sloping seabed is divided into three parts i e the left semi infinite part the middle sloping part with the horizontal length l s l and the right semi infinite part among them the two semi infinite parts have constant but possibly different water depths denoted as h l and h r for the left and the right parts respectively see fig 6 the average water depth is denoted as h a the relation between the sloping angle β and water depths is given by h l h a tan β l s 2 and h r h a tan β l s 2 to preliminarily investigate effects of the sloping seabed on hydroelastic responses of the two dimensional floating structure in the frequency domain two sets of cases involving the varying sloping angle β and the varying average water depth h a are performed by the proposed hybrid technique in the former set of cases the sloping angle varies when average water depth h a is assumed to be fixed while in the latter set β is fixed but h a takes a varying value case by case 5 1 effects by the sloping angle of the seabed on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure to investigate effects of the sloping angle on the hydroelastic responses of the floating structure a set of sloping seabeds with sloping angles from tan β 0 30 to 3 30 with an interval of δ tan β 1 30 are considered in the numerical cases tan β 0 represents the flat seabed case the average water depth of all cases in this set is fixed at h a 0 15 l fig 7 describes the vertical displacement along the floating structure over a flat seabed tan β 0 and sloping seabeds with three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 it can be seen that in fig 7 a for the frequency ω 0 2 the sloping seabed angle has significant effects on the vertical displacement of the floating structure especially in the leeward side x 0 5 causing the vertical displacement to increase in value with the increase of the sloping angle β in fig 7 b and c for frequencies ω 0 4 and 0 6 the vertical displacements are slightly influenced by the sloping seabed although the effects still grow with the rise of the sloping angle while for frequency ω 0 8 the effects by the sloping seabed are notably small a possible reason for this phenomenon is that the scattering effects by the sloping seabed on short waves are smaller than that on long waves figs 8 and 9 respectively show the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over a flat seabed tan β 0 and sloping seabeds with three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 similar effects as that of vertical displacement are observed by the sloping seabed on the two force components thus not discussed again the above observations may suggest that effects of the sloping seabed are large in low frequency ranges to ascertain this inference cases with incident wave frequencies from ω 0 2 to 1 with an interval of δ ω 0 05 are carried out by the present hybrid technique as can be seen in the previous results see figs 7 9 hydroelastic responses are significantly affected by the sloping seabed at some parts of the floating structure in waves with certain frequencies then the responses of the section at x 0 8 l of the floating structure is selected to illustrate the influencing level of the sloping seabed before proceeding to the further investigation three relative influence factors i d ω x h a β i m ω x h a β and i s ω x h a β are introduced to denote the influencing degree on hydroelastic responses at section x by the sloping seabed the subscripts d m and s represent the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force respectively for instance i d ω x h a β denotes 32 i d ω x h a β δ β ω x h a δ 0 ω x h a 1 where δ β ω x h a and δ 0 ω x h a represent the vertical displacement at section x of the floating structure over a sloping seabed with the sloping angle β and a flat seabed with the same average water depth h a respectively fig 10 a b and c respectively show the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over a flat seabed tan β 0 and sloping seabeds with three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 taking the vertical displacement as an example in the frequency range ω 0 6 the sloping seabed imposes obvious effects on it but above this frequency value the effects become minor similar trends can be seen for the bending moment and the shear force which further confirms that the sloping seabed affects the three types of hydroelastic responses in a similar manner fig 11 a b and c respectively give the relative influence factors for vertical displacement i d bending moment i m and shear force i s at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over sloping seabeds with the average water depth h a 0 15 l and three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 comparing results in figs 10 and 11 it can be seen that although the absolute influence by the sloping seabed seems not large the relative influence may be significant particularly in low frequencies 5 2 effects by the sloping seabed in varying average water depths on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure in the earlier study of sloping seabed effects the average water depth h a is fixed to investigate effects of the sloping seabed on the hydroelastic responses of the floating structure in varying average water depths numerical cases are further performed by the proposed hybrid technique fig 12 shows the vertical displacement along the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and two sloping angles tan β 0 and 1 10 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 for the frequency ω 0 2 effects of the sloping seabed on the vertical displacement decrease dramatically with the increase of the average water depth especially in the leeward side x 0 5 of the floating structure although effects are still obvious for the average water depth h a 0 45 l one reason for the effects decline is that the wave energy density generally decreases with the increase of the average water depth for frequencies ω 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 effects of the sloping seabed are still obvious when h a 0 15 l but become very small in average water depths h a 0 30 l and 0 45 l figs 13 and 14 respectively show the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and two sloping angles tan β 0 and 1 10 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 similar conclusions as that of the vertical displacement can be drawn through observation from the curves the section at x 0 8 l of the floating structure is still taken as an example to study the influencing level of the sloping seabed in different average water depths fig 15 a b and c respectively show the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and two sloping angles tan β 0 and 1 10 in the wave frequency range from ω 0 2 to1 with an interval of 0 05 from these curves it can be seen that for the average water depth h a 0 15 l in the wave frequency range ω 0 6 the absolute difference of hydroelastic responses between the flat and sloping seabed conditions are obvious and for the average water depth h a 0 30 l the difference becomes very small when it comes to h a 0 45 l the difference seems to be notably insignificant fig 16 shows the corresponding relative influence factors including i d i m and i s at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and a sloping angle tan β 1 10 it can be observed that relative influence factors generally decline with the increases of the wave frequency and the average water depth through comparison with results in fig 15 it can be found that the relative influence may be significant in low frequencies even though the absolute influence seems to be small especially for the case with deep average water depth h a 0 45 l the present evidences indicate that effects of the sloping seabed on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure decrease with the increase of the average water depth and are generally large in low frequencies 6 conclusions in this paper a hybrid technique is developed combining the dmm lu et al 2016 emm tsai et al 2011 and the further extended rsm feng et al 2017 to investigate two dimensional hydroelastic responses of floating structures over variable bathymetry comparisons with published data riyansyah et al 2010 concerning the flat seabed provide a limited degree of validation of the present hybrid technique two sets of cases involving the varying sloping angles of the seabed and the varying average water depths are carried out by the proposed technique to investigate effects of the sloping seabed on hydroelastic responses of a floating structure the following conclusions can be drawn from the obtained results effects by the sloping seabed on the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure are similar effects on the hydroelastic responses exhibit an increase trend with the increase of the sloping angle an increase of the average water depth leads to a decrease of effects on hydroelastic responses effects of the sloping seabed are generally large in the incident wave of low frequencies in the present cases effects are larger in the leeward side with shallower water depth than that in the windward side with deeper water depth of the floating

22008,this paper proposes a hybrid technique combining the discrete modules method dmm lu et al 2016 the eigenfunction matching method emm tsai et al 2011 and a further extended rankine source method rsm to treat the two dimensional hydroelastic problem of floating structures over variable bathymetry in the hybrid technique dmm is employed to discrete a floating structure into a set of rigid modules connected by elastic beams with equivalent deformation conditions of the structure the incident wave potential over variable bathymetry without the presence of floating structures is obtained by emm a rankine source method developed by feng et al 2017 is further extended to gain the diffracted and radiated wave potentials with the discreted multi rigid modules over variable bathymetry a coupled model for the hydroelasticity of floating structures over variable bathymetry can be established by substituting the external wave loads exerted by the obtained incident diffracted and radiated potentials into the multi rigid body dynamic equation by dmm in the frequency domain the convergence of the hybrid technique is validated through a good agreement against published data riyansyah et al 2010 for hydroelastic responses of a two dimensional floating structure over a flat seabed effects of sloping seabeds on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure are preliminarily investigated by the present hybrid technique keywords hydroelastic response eigenfunction matching method discrete modules method rankine source method a hybrid technique 1 introduction floating structures with large dimensions and relatively small structural rigidities such as very large floating structures vlfss have apparent flexible body responses rather than just rigid body movements in waves thereby significantly relying on accurate hydroelastic analyses of the floating structures over realistic bathymetries ding et al 2017 in the past several decades development of hydroelasticity theory can be divided into four phases i e 2d linear theory 2d nonlinear theory 3d linear theory and 3d nonlinear theory chen et al 2006 now this theory has been widely employed to predict motions wave loads and sectional forces of elastic floating bodies in deep and shallow seabed conditions the water depth in most publications is assumed to be constant that is practically valid when the depth variation is small or in deep sea where the varying seabed topography has little effects on hydrodynamic responses of floating bodies however when floating structures are deployed in complicated seabed environments such as islands or coastal regions hydroelastic responses of floating bodies would be quite different from that in constant bathymetry the main cause of the differences is that waves would be scattered by the undulating seabed which would not take place in the flat seabed condition in this connection there had been many researches focused on hydroelastic wave body interactions over realistic seabed conditions athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 used the variational formulation and derived a consistent coupled mode system ccms to deal with linear wave propagations over a bed of arbitrary and consistent topography by including a sloping bottom mode the neumann condition on the sea bottom was satisfied afterwards based on the idea of the sloping bottom mode they developed a creative three dimensional green s function for linear water wave over variable bathymetry belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 in 2005 they further extended ccms and applied their method to hydroelastic analyses of large floating bodies of shallow draught lying over variable bathymetry regions belibassakis 2005 however the computation of the green s function based on the idea of ccms is always complicated and time consuming besides kyoung et al 2005 adopted finite element method fem based on the variational formulation in the fluid domain to calculate the sea bottom effects song et al 2005 employed the boundary element method bem solving the finite water depth green function to investigate hydrodynamic responses of a vlfs lying over uneven sea bottom and found that effects of the undulating seabed could not be neglected in the long incident wave length and in the shallow water depth however in their work water depths at infinity in all directions are assumed to be a same constant tian et al 2014 proposed a new wave spectrum assuming that waves at different locations have different spectral forms wave directions and correlated phases to represent the non uniform incident wave environment in their work bem was also employed to calculate the diffracted and radiated potentials by distributing sources in the complex seabed profile a direct coupled method was established by ding et al 2017 to analyze hydroelastic responses of floating bodies over undulating seabed in their method the fluid domain was divided into the outer and the inner regions where boussinesq equations and rankine source method rsm were respectively employed to solve the wave propagation problem the continuity relations between the two regions were fulfilled through matching wave elevations and distribution of velocities at vertical interfaces wei et al 2017 introduced a second fixed body on the seabed to represent the cylindrical bottom in the diffraction theory and conducted simulations by commercial codes like wamit although buchner 2006 had suggested that refraction and interference effects were too strong and could affect wave exciting forces on floating bodies in an incorrect way by using this method in addition a larger size and smoother edges of the second body could not improve the situation it should also be noted that this second body method cannot be directly applied to the problem of different water depths at infinity in the present work inspired by the work of 3 16 and 11 a hybrid technique combining emm dmm and a further extended rsm is proposed to treat the two dimensional frequency domain hydroelastic problem of floating structures lying over variable bathymetry 3 developed the bem technique to perform hydrodynamic analyses of a single body over variable bathymetry in their work the incident wave potential was solved by ccms proposed in athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 and the diffracted radiated potential was treated by the green s function brought up in belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 different from their work the incident wave field in this work is generated by emm proposed by tsai et al 2011 which can be applied in arbitrary seabed conditions unlike ccms requires a twice continuously differentiable seabed curve dmm was proposed by lu et al 2016 to turn the hydroelastic problem into a multi rigid body problem to analyze elastic behaviors of the vlfs and was further applied to the problem of a complicated sea environment wei et al 2017 in this paper we employ dmm combining with rsm to deal with the diffracted radiated problem of elastic floating structures over variable bathymetry in this paper the two dimensional floating structure is assumed to be a thin layer at the free surface and modeled as an elastic beam with zero thickness and zero draft for simplicity which is always supposed to be reasonable for a vlfs a general bathymetry is assumed and characterized by a depth function h x joining two semi infinite regions with constant water depths although nonlinear effects are of specific importance as in the study of slamming or large amplitude motions the solution of the linear problem still provides valuable information serving as the basis of weakly nonlinear models belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 in this connection the present problem is formulated within the framework of linear water wave and elastic beam theory under the assumption of small amplitude waves and small beam deflections the rest of this paper is organized as follows the mathematical model of a two dimensional hydroelastic problem over variable bathymetry is formulated in section 2 section 3 gives a detailed description of a hybrid technique to treat the present problem convergence study of the proposed hybrid technique is given in section 4 then section 5 presents numerical cases to investigate the effects of sloping seabed parameters on frequency domain hydroelastic responses of a floating structure finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 problem formulation in this paper a two dimensional problem concerning the hydroelastic behavior of a floating structure with a total length l over varying bathymetry is considered the problem is formulated in cartesian coordinates x z see fig 1 with its origin at left most point on the undisturbed floating structure the x axis is horizontal and z axis pointing upwards the incident wave travels from x to x note that we assume the wavelength in the left semi infinite region to be the incident wavelength λ as the wavelength varies with the varying bathymetry the seabed shows an arbitrary one dimensional variation in the middle region which lies between two regions of constant but possibly different water depths the water depth is given by 1 h x h l x x l h x x l x x r h r x x r where h l and h r denote the water depths of the left and right semi infinite domain respectively the fluid domain investigated here is bounded below by the seabeds τ 1 τ 2 and τ 3 and bounded top by the free water surfaces τ 4 τ 6 and the fluid structure interface τ 5 the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and its flow is assumed to be irrotational the wave amplitude is assumed to be sufficiently small thus the linear wave theory can be utilized the floating structure is modeled as a elastic beam with zero thickness and zero draft and is allowed to move freely in the vertical direction and would always be in contact with the fluid based on the above assumptions fluid motion can be described by a time domain velocity potential ϕ re φ e i ω t which must satisfy the laplace equation 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 where t is time ω is the wave frequency obviously φ is the frequency domain complex velocity potential and ψ φ e i ω t is the time domain complex velocity potential and they also both satisfy the laplace equation the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface conditions are expressed respectively by 3 η t ϕ z 0 o n τ 4 a n d τ 6 and 4 ϕ t g η 0 o n τ 4 a n d τ 6 where g is the gravity acceleration after substituting eq 4 into eq 3 and separation by time t a linear free surface condition in the frequency domain can be derived 5 φ z ω 2 g φ 0 o n τ 4 a n d τ 6 no flow conditions on seabed gives 6 ϕ n 0 o n τ 1 τ 2 a n d τ 3 where n is the unit normal vector with respect to the rigid seabed on the fluid structure interface i e the wet surfaces no flow penetrating boundary condition can be expressed as 7 ϕ n w t t o n τ 5 where n is the unit normal vector on the wet surface w re δ δ is the time domain complex vertical displacement along the floating structure since both ends of the floating beam are free the shear force and the bending moment must be equal to zero thus we have 8 3 w x 3 0 a n d 2 w x 2 0 x l 2 a n d x l 2 3 a hybrid technique in this section a hybrid technique is proposed to solve the two dimensional hydroelastic problem of floating structures over variable bathymetry when considering the structure domain following the work by lu et al 2016 the present technique adopts dmm to turn the hydroelastic problem into a multi rigid body problem and the continuous displacement along the floating structure is approximated by that of discrete points representing the equivalent centers of all bodies when it comes to the fluid domain the velocity potential can be divided into the incident diffracted and radiated potentials yielding the corresponding wave forces respectively emm is utilized here to take the scattering effects on the incident wave by the undulating seabed into consideration for floating structures over variable bathymetry traditional commercial codes like wamit or hydrostar employing free surface green s function cannot be used to solve the diffraction and radiation problems in order to deal with this problem feng et al 2016 2017 developed a new source distribution scheme for rsm to determine the interaction between a single body and the wave over a sloping seabed in this paper this method is further extended to generate the diffracted and radiated potentials for multi rigid bodies over sloping seabed this section can be divided into 4 subsections and organized as follows in the 1st subsection the multi body dynamic equation is constructed by utilizing dmm followed by section 3 2 where the incident wave potential over variable bathymetry is generated by emm in the 3rd subsection the diffracted and radiated potentials of the multi rigid body over variable bathymetry are obtained by used of rsm in the final subsection the incident diffracted and radiated forces derived by use of bernoulli s equation are substituted into the multi body dynamic motion equation thus forming the coupled model for the hydroelasticity of floating structures over variable bathymetry 3 1 discrete modules method discrete modules method dmm proposed by lu et al 2016 is used in this paper and briefly reviewed in this subsection the main idea of dmm is to discrete the floating structure into a set of rigid modules which are connected by elastic beams indicating that the hydroelastic problem is turned into a multi rigid body problem according to dmm euler bernoulli beam theory is employed to simulate the elastic beam connection at the equivalent center o m of adjacent modules ensuring the deformation continuity of the entire floating structure the floating structure is discretized into n rigid modules which indicates that n 1 beam elements are distributed to connect the modules in order as shown in fig 2 in accordance with finite element method and newton s second law the multi rigid body dynamic equation of the floating structure under external loads is established by 9 m δ c δ k δ f where m is the mass matrix of the floating structure c is the structural damping matrix f refers to the external wave load in the complex form including hydrostatic restoring force f s t a and the hydrodynamic forces which can be divided into the incident force f i n the diffracted force f d and the radiated force f r i e 10 f f s t a f i n f d f r δ δ and δ are respectively the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors for all freedoms of the multi rigid body system k is the entire structural stiffness matrix assembled with the stiffness matrix of all beam elements when considering the multi rigid body dynamic equation eq 9 it can be solved only if the quantity of f is known therefore the aim of the following subsections is to determine all the force components in eq 10 3 2 eigenfunction matching method the incident wave potential associated with the propagation of water waves over variable bathymetry regions without the presence of floating structures could be conveniently obtained by means of eigenfunction matching method emm in this method the seabed profile under consideration is approximated by a sequence of flat shelves separated by abrupt steps and solution of water problem on each shelf is established in terms of eigenfunctions through separation of variables although neumann condition on the seabed cannot be fully satisfied because of the artificial discontinuities bottom corners introduced in step like approximation predictions of wave propagation by emm tsai et al 2011 2014 show very good agreements with ccms and a semi analytical method by porter and porter 2000 therefore emm is employed here to determine the incident wave over an arbitrary seabed profile as shown in fig 3 the seabed is approximated by m flat shelves with water depth h m in the interval from x x m 1 to x x m by separation of time with incident potential ψ i n φ i n e i ω t the frequency domain incident potential φ i n over all the fluid domain can be expressed by 11 φ i n φ i n 1 x x 1 φ i n m x m 1 x x m φ i n m x m 1 x through separation of variables with the laplace equation the frequency domain incident wave on the m th shelf can be expressed as 12 φ i n m c m 1 e i k m 1 x x m d m 1 e i k m 1 x x m 1 z m 1 n 2 c m n e k m n x x m d m n e k m n x x m 1 z m n 13 z m 1 cosh k m 1 z h m cosh k m 1 h m z m n cos k m n z h m cos k m n h m n 2 3 4 14 k m 1 tanh k m 1 h m ω 2 g k m n tan k m n h m ω 2 g n 2 3 4 the above expressions in eq 12 of incident wave potential have satisfied the bottom and free surface conditions to calculate the coefficients c m n and d m n in eq 12 the solutions on adjacent shelves should be matched conservation of mass and momentum requires that the normal velocity and fluid pressure should be continuous on the vertical interfaces by satisfying these conditions in a least square manner linear equations are constructed details of the algorithms have already been discussed by tsai et al 2011 2014 therefore not repeated here consequently the incident wave potential φ i n x z all over the fluid domain is obtained the incident wave forces on all bodies can be calculated by integrating the incident wave pressure obtained by use of bernoulli s equation it is assumed that the incident force f i n varies periodically with the frequency ω 15 f i n f i n e i ω t 3 3 rankine source method numerical computation processes of rsm to deal with a single body problem have been fully illustrated by feng et al 2016 2017 however these processes could not be directly applied in a multi rigid body problem hence rsm is extended here to solve the diffracted and radiated potentials of the multi rigid body problem the problem on the time domain diffracted or radiated potential ϕ x t re ψ x t can be treated by rsm based on gauss divergence theorem accordingly the integral representations of ϕ is given in the following form 16 ϕ x t m 1 n s m b σ b ln r d s x s f σ f ln r d s x s o σ o ln r d s x where n is the number of the bodies x x z is the control point located arbitrarily in the fluid domain x x z is the source point r x x is the distance between the control and source points s m b is the wet surface of the m th body s f is the free surface and s o represents the seabed σ b σ f and σ o are the corresponding source strengths for the bodies the free surface and the seabed respectively on the wet surface of the bodies we have 17 ϕ n v b n where n is the unit normal vector on the present fluid boundaries and v b n represents the normal velocity of the fluid particle for the diffraction or radiation problem boundaries of the fluid field are discretized by panels with constant source strength assumed in each panel thus eq 16 is approximated by 18 ϕ x t m 1 n i 1 n m b s m i b σ m i b ln r d s x j 1 n j f s j f σ j f ln r d s x k 1 n k b s k o σ k o ln r d s x where s m i b is the i th panel of the m th body n m b is the number of panels on the m th body control points on fluid boundaries are denoted as x m i b x j f and x k o for the bodies the free surface and the seabed respectively substitute eq 18 into eqs 4 6 and 17 and rewrite them in the following convenient form 19 c σ b t σ f t σ o t v b n x m i b t ϕ x j f t 0 where c is the influence coefficient matrix in which c i j carries the influencing information from the j th source panel to the control point of the i th panel through solving eq 19 the source strength values for all fluid boundaries σ b t σ f t σ o t t at time t are obtained the vertical velocity of the fluid particle on the free surface at time t is expressed as follows 20 v f z x j f t m 1 n i 1 n m b z s m i b σ m i b ln r d s x j 1 n j f z s j f σ j f ln r d s x k 1 n k b z s k o σ k o ln r d s x the wave elevation η and velocity potential ϕ at the free surface are updated with respect to the kinematic condition eq 3 and the dynamic condition eq 4 by the 3rd order adams bashforth scheme thus at time t δ t we have 21 η t δ t η t δ t 12 23 v f z t 16 v f z t δ t 5 v f z t 2 δ t 22 ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t 12 23 η t 16 g η t δ t 5 g η t 2 δ t where δ t is the time step with the above time stepping processes the source strength values σ m i b σ j f and σ k o at all time steps can be obtained consequently the velocity potential all over the fluid domain can be calculated by eq 16 therefore the diffracted potential ϕ d x z t and radiated potential ϕ r x z t are obtained by use of the present rsm still in conjunction with bernoulli s equation the diffracted force f d t and radiated force f r t are calculated by integrating the pressure over the wet surfaces by application of fourier transformation the diffracted forces on the n bodies are expressed as 23 f d f d e i ω t 2 t 0 0 t 0 f d t cos ω t d t i 2 t 0 0 t 0 f d t sin ω t d t e i ω t where t 0 is the period of the body motion similar with the single body situation by utilizing fourier transformation the radiated forces can be decomposed into two componential forces i e the added mass force and damping force 24 f r f r e i ω t a δ c δ where a and c are the added mass and damping matrix respectively they are expressed as 25 a 2 a ω 2 t 0 0 t 0 f r t cos ω t d t 26 c 2 a ω t 0 0 t 0 f r t sin ω t d t 3 4 coupled motion equation in this subsection the coupled motion equation of this multi rigid body system over variable bathymetry is constructed recalling the multi rigid body dynamic equation eq 9 and components of the external forces eq 10 we have 27 m δ c δ k δ f s t a f i n f d f r the hydrostatic restoring force f s t a is the product of the hydrostatic restoring matrix k and the displacement vector δ and expressed as 28 f s t a k δ substituting the incident force eq 15 the diffracted force eq 23 the radiated force eq 24 and the hydrostatic restoring force eq 28 into the multi rigid body dynamic equation eq 27 we have 29 m a δ c c δ k k δ f i n e i ω t f d e i ω t in the frequency domain like the external wave forces the motion or displacement column δ is also assumed to vary periodically 30 δ δ e i ω t therefore eq 29 can be rewritten by separating the time t thus we have the coupled motion equation in the frequency domain 31 ω 2 m a i ω c c k k δ f i n f d through solving this coupled motion equation the hydroelastic responses of the floating structure are obtained note that the structural damping c is always significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic added damping c thus can be neglected 4 convergence of the hybrid technique in this section convergence of the hybrid technique is studied by comparison against published data for a two dimensional problem associated with the flat seabed condition note that the main difference between the flat seabed problem and the sloping seabed problem lies in the incident wave potential since all the non propagating modes the second term in eq 12 induced by the sloping seabed would vanish with respect to the flat seabed condition riyansyah et al 2010 studied hydroelastic responses of a two dimensional floating structure over a flat seabed in regular waves and this specific example is again solved herein by the hybrid technique proposed in this work parameters of the two dimensional floating structure is listed in table 1 the water depth is h l 15 hydroelastic responses including the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force obtained by the present hybrid technique are compared with those calculated by riyansyah et al 2010 in their work the minimum incident wavelength was set as λ 0 2 l thus λ 0 2 l is selected here to carry out the convergence study for the number of modules n since hydroelastic responses exhibit more fluctuations in shorter incident waves fig 4 gives the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over a flat seabed in the incident wave λ 0 2 l for different number of modules it is observed that more accurate results can be obtained with larger number of modules however the computational cost would dramatically increase as the number of modules increases as can be seen in these curves 20 modules can give sufficiently accurate predictions thus the number of modules n 20 is used for subsequent analyses moreover two other incident waves with wavelengths λ 0 3 l and 0 4 l are considered to ascertain whether the hybrid technique can be utilized in a wide range of incident waves fig 5 describes the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over a flat seabed in incident waves λ 0 3 l and 0 4 l it can be seen that results by the hybrid technique are in good agreement with those obtained by riyansyah et al 2010 thereby giving a limited degree of validation of the proposed hybrid technique 5 results and discussions in this section hydroelastic responses of the floating structure in section 4 over sloping seabeds are investigated the sloping seabed is divided into three parts i e the left semi infinite part the middle sloping part with the horizontal length l s l and the right semi infinite part among them the two semi infinite parts have constant but possibly different water depths denoted as h l and h r for the left and the right parts respectively see fig 6 the average water depth is denoted as h a the relation between the sloping angle β and water depths is given by h l h a tan β l s 2 and h r h a tan β l s 2 to preliminarily investigate effects of the sloping seabed on hydroelastic responses of the two dimensional floating structure in the frequency domain two sets of cases involving the varying sloping angle β and the varying average water depth h a are performed by the proposed hybrid technique in the former set of cases the sloping angle varies when average water depth h a is assumed to be fixed while in the latter set β is fixed but h a takes a varying value case by case 5 1 effects by the sloping angle of the seabed on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure to investigate effects of the sloping angle on the hydroelastic responses of the floating structure a set of sloping seabeds with sloping angles from tan β 0 30 to 3 30 with an interval of δ tan β 1 30 are considered in the numerical cases tan β 0 represents the flat seabed case the average water depth of all cases in this set is fixed at h a 0 15 l fig 7 describes the vertical displacement along the floating structure over a flat seabed tan β 0 and sloping seabeds with three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 it can be seen that in fig 7 a for the frequency ω 0 2 the sloping seabed angle has significant effects on the vertical displacement of the floating structure especially in the leeward side x 0 5 causing the vertical displacement to increase in value with the increase of the sloping angle β in fig 7 b and c for frequencies ω 0 4 and 0 6 the vertical displacements are slightly influenced by the sloping seabed although the effects still grow with the rise of the sloping angle while for frequency ω 0 8 the effects by the sloping seabed are notably small a possible reason for this phenomenon is that the scattering effects by the sloping seabed on short waves are smaller than that on long waves figs 8 and 9 respectively show the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over a flat seabed tan β 0 and sloping seabeds with three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 similar effects as that of vertical displacement are observed by the sloping seabed on the two force components thus not discussed again the above observations may suggest that effects of the sloping seabed are large in low frequency ranges to ascertain this inference cases with incident wave frequencies from ω 0 2 to 1 with an interval of δ ω 0 05 are carried out by the present hybrid technique as can be seen in the previous results see figs 7 9 hydroelastic responses are significantly affected by the sloping seabed at some parts of the floating structure in waves with certain frequencies then the responses of the section at x 0 8 l of the floating structure is selected to illustrate the influencing level of the sloping seabed before proceeding to the further investigation three relative influence factors i d ω x h a β i m ω x h a β and i s ω x h a β are introduced to denote the influencing degree on hydroelastic responses at section x by the sloping seabed the subscripts d m and s represent the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force respectively for instance i d ω x h a β denotes 32 i d ω x h a β δ β ω x h a δ 0 ω x h a 1 where δ β ω x h a and δ 0 ω x h a represent the vertical displacement at section x of the floating structure over a sloping seabed with the sloping angle β and a flat seabed with the same average water depth h a respectively fig 10 a b and c respectively show the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over a flat seabed tan β 0 and sloping seabeds with three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 taking the vertical displacement as an example in the frequency range ω 0 6 the sloping seabed imposes obvious effects on it but above this frequency value the effects become minor similar trends can be seen for the bending moment and the shear force which further confirms that the sloping seabed affects the three types of hydroelastic responses in a similar manner fig 11 a b and c respectively give the relative influence factors for vertical displacement i d bending moment i m and shear force i s at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over sloping seabeds with the average water depth h a 0 15 l and three sloping angles tan β 1 30 2 30 and 3 30 comparing results in figs 10 and 11 it can be seen that although the absolute influence by the sloping seabed seems not large the relative influence may be significant particularly in low frequencies 5 2 effects by the sloping seabed in varying average water depths on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure in the earlier study of sloping seabed effects the average water depth h a is fixed to investigate effects of the sloping seabed on the hydroelastic responses of the floating structure in varying average water depths numerical cases are further performed by the proposed hybrid technique fig 12 shows the vertical displacement along the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and two sloping angles tan β 0 and 1 10 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 for the frequency ω 0 2 effects of the sloping seabed on the vertical displacement decrease dramatically with the increase of the average water depth especially in the leeward side x 0 5 of the floating structure although effects are still obvious for the average water depth h a 0 45 l one reason for the effects decline is that the wave energy density generally decreases with the increase of the average water depth for frequencies ω 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 effects of the sloping seabed are still obvious when h a 0 15 l but become very small in average water depths h a 0 30 l and 0 45 l figs 13 and 14 respectively show the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and two sloping angles tan β 0 and 1 10 in different incident wave frequencies a ω 0 2 b ω 0 4 c ω 0 6 and d ω 0 8 similar conclusions as that of the vertical displacement can be drawn through observation from the curves the section at x 0 8 l of the floating structure is still taken as an example to study the influencing level of the sloping seabed in different average water depths fig 15 a b and c respectively show the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and two sloping angles tan β 0 and 1 10 in the wave frequency range from ω 0 2 to1 with an interval of 0 05 from these curves it can be seen that for the average water depth h a 0 15 l in the wave frequency range ω 0 6 the absolute difference of hydroelastic responses between the flat and sloping seabed conditions are obvious and for the average water depth h a 0 30 l the difference becomes very small when it comes to h a 0 45 l the difference seems to be notably insignificant fig 16 shows the corresponding relative influence factors including i d i m and i s at x 0 8 l of the floating structure over sloping seabeds with three average water depths h a 0 15 l 0 30 l and 0 45 l and a sloping angle tan β 1 10 it can be observed that relative influence factors generally decline with the increases of the wave frequency and the average water depth through comparison with results in fig 15 it can be found that the relative influence may be significant in low frequencies even though the absolute influence seems to be small especially for the case with deep average water depth h a 0 45 l the present evidences indicate that effects of the sloping seabed on hydroelastic responses of the floating structure decrease with the increase of the average water depth and are generally large in low frequencies 6 conclusions in this paper a hybrid technique is developed combining the dmm lu et al 2016 emm tsai et al 2011 and the further extended rsm feng et al 2017 to investigate two dimensional hydroelastic responses of floating structures over variable bathymetry comparisons with published data riyansyah et al 2010 concerning the flat seabed provide a limited degree of validation of the present hybrid technique two sets of cases involving the varying sloping angles of the seabed and the varying average water depths are carried out by the proposed technique to investigate effects of the sloping seabed on hydroelastic responses of a floating structure the following conclusions can be drawn from the obtained results effects by the sloping seabed on the vertical displacement the bending moment and the shear force along the floating structure are similar effects on the hydroelastic responses exhibit an increase trend with the increase of the sloping angle an increase of the average water depth leads to a decrease of effects on hydroelastic responses effects of the sloping seabed are generally large in the incident wave of low frequencies in the present cases effects are larger in the leeward side with shallower water depth than that in the windward side with deeper water depth of the floating

22009,numerous multi body coupled systems are adopted in offshore operations to improve the accommodation environment and work efficiency the current loads on a multi body system are complex due to environmental sheltering and greatly affect operation safety and feasibility this paper presents experimental studies on current loads particularly the longitudinal and transverse forces acting on two side by side semi submersibles in a wind tunnel the influences of separation distance spacing ratio shape of columns and draft of production platform on current loads are investigated when the accommodation platform is upstream the twin body interference can generally increase the longitudinal force acting on the vessel and decrease the transverse force the shielding effect appears when the vessel is downstream significantly decreasing the mean transverse load coefficient by up to 80 when separation distance decreases the interference becomes more distinct and there is nearly a linear relationship between distance and force reduction once the accommodation platform turns and is shielded the reduction in mean load coefficients becomes more noticeable as the spacing ratio decreases the shielding effect is insensitive to drafts except for the 90 the production platform with square columns has greater interferences about 1 2 1 8 times than that with cylindrical columns keywords

and gas industry the demand for offshore operations has greatly increased nowadays multi body systems are widely used for drilling platform installations and offloading operations in practical engineering applications service vessels provide support for different forms of offshore platforms for example a production platform with the tender assisted drilling tad vessel choi et al 2018 a service vessel with an offshore wind turbine könig et al 2017 and an fpso with a flotel kunkyebe and georgiev 2015 or shuttle tanker shivaji ganesan and sen 2016 the multi body system significantly extends working capability and improves accommodation conditions and it has become more widely used in the offshore industry environmental excitations such as waves currents and winds may cause large movements or load responses of floating structures and can even lead to accidents moan 1985 since operation safety is always the first priority a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic responses of offshore structures is essential the dynamic responses of a single floating body in harsh seas have been well studied such as vortex induced motions vim liu et al 2017 green water phenomenon qin et al 2017 moonpool resonance guo et al 2017 global motions and wave slamming loads bennett et al 2014 the multi body hydrodynamics involve interactions between different bodies which makes the problem more complex compared to that of a single body case the hydrodynamic interaction between two bodies can be induced by the diffraction and radiation waves feng et al 2017 as well as the current loads koop 2016 for the multi body wave interaction it can be mostly solved well in the context of potential theory pessoa et al 2015 and pessoa et al 2016 studied the first order wave frequency and the second order slow drift motions of two side by side vessels by applying the three dimensional diffraction theory large relative motions were identified at the low frequency range the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is also adopted for some nonlinear problems such as gap resonance li and zhang 2016 hydrodynamic interference due to current action involve viscous effects and vortical flow patterns a bluff body immerged in fluid is susceptible to the oscillating hydrodynamic force arising from alternating eddies or vortices shedding downstream from one side of the structure to the other such vortical flow patterns will cause vortex induced vibration viv for small scale structures for example mooring lines risers or subsea cables the large volume offshore floating units may suffer vim a phenomenon identified as lock in can pose threats to safe and reliable operations and severely affect the fatigue life of risers and mooring systems cheng et al 2011 liu et al 2016 for a two platform system the current interference is more complex it directly influences the dynamic distance between structures this is because the current cause large slow varying motions of the platform due to the small damping in low frequency region relative motions between two floating platforms are of great concern in terms of personal transfer by a gangway or oil offloading by connecting pipelines dong et al 2019 the connection may also apply additional loads on the production platform leading to a large offset that may threaten the safety of riser system hwang et al 2017 empirical formulas numerical simulations and experiments are typical approaches to estimate the current loads acting on the offshore platforms koop et al 2011 croonenborghs et al 2013 the adoption of empirical coefficients is relatively simple the widely used oil companies international marine forum 1994 coefficients are based on experimental data with similar vessels performed by the maritime research institute netherlands marin however whether these data are applicable to arbitrary hull shapes is unclear another usable dataset is the esdu data sheet 80025 which provides empirical formulations based on wind tunnel tests for various shapes s c et al 2016 in recent years the cfd method has become more widely used and is more flexible than empirical approach the environmental loads on a lng carrier fathi et al 2010 koop 2015 the current loads on a complex semi submersible geometry in a uniform flow croonenborghs et al 2013 and the high fidelity fluid structure interaction simulations that consider the influence of aero hydrodynamic coupling for a floating offshore wind turbine tran and kim 2017 have all been solved using cfd methods experiments which can be conducted by towing tests in water basins wind tunnel tests and water channel tests are also commonly used for quantifying current loads on offshore structures cho et al 2018 niklas and pruszko 2019 used the data obtained by towing tests for a ship to validate the results of full scale cfd silumations hwang et al 2017 studied the current load acting on semi submersible in a wind tunnel and developed a floated plate to lift the model off the floor to reduce the effect of boundary layer grown from the tunnel floor hu et al 2019 carried out a series of tests in a high speed cavitation water channel to study the unsteady hydrodynamic loads on a tension leg platform tlp at high reynolds number to ensure that the flow patterns of tests are consistent with the full scale the current drag of flng hull obtained from towing tests and wind tunnel experiments was compared by huang et al 2016 the differences indicated that the wind tunnel floor boundary layers have obvious effects on the results the above mentioned estimation methods were also compared and accessed by vaz et al 2009 and ottens et al 2009 though the empirical formulation is straightforward it is a fair initial estimate in terms of speed quality and complexity but it produces errors that generally overestimate the loads leading to a more conservative design koop et al 2011 the current loads on several typical offshore structures have been successfully calculated by the cfd method koop and bereznitski 2011 calculated the current loads on a semi submersible in both model and full scales demonstrating the uncertainty caused by scale effect it is valuable to have cfd results prior to model tests to access the range of expected forces and potential errors in experiments in general model tests are believed to be reliable and often considered to be the benchmark niklas and pruszko 2019 experimental results are expected to verify the cfd computations these experiments should be replicated several times for a more reliable statistical analysis previous studies are mainly focused on single body cases there have been only a few attempts to quantify the current loads of two body coupled offshore systems while taking shielding effects into account fucatu and nishimoto 2003 2004 illuminati et al 2009 proposed a tentative empirical model of current wake effects between an fpso and shuttle tanker the fpso hull was firstly considered fixed in space and the disturbed current velocity field was computed by cfd method then the hydrodynamic forces on the shuttle ship were calculated using the local cross flow method yuck et al 2007 performed towing tests of two side by side moored vessels under different arrangements the current loads in the multi body case changed significantly compared to the single body case and the sheltering effect was clearly observed koop 2016 2019 conducted numerical and experimental research on similar objects finding significant reduction of the current forces when the downstream vessel is positioned in the wake of another vessel these studies on side by side configuration were conducted for ship shaped vessels to have a better understanding of current interference or the shielding effect this study investigates the loads on two side by side semi submersibles using wind tunnel tests the effects of separation distance column spacing and shape as well as the draft of main production platform are conducted this paper is arranged as follows the experimental set up of wind tunnel tests are detailed in section 2 section 3 shows the validation for current loads on a single platform and the published results the uncertainty analysis for force measurements is evaluated in section 4 then the mean and fluctuating streamwise and transverse forces for different separation distances column spacings column shapes and drafts are discussed in section 5 the conclusions are summarized in section 6 this study contributes to the understanding of force analysis and the design of multi body offshore platforms 2 experimental set ups there are several relevant laws for model tests related to the similarities of geometry kinematics and dynamics dynamic similarity requires a relatively high velocity in model tests to ensure consistent flow patterns at full scale the measurements of the current loads on offshore structures are usually carried out in a towing tank or water tunnel with a free surface however the maximum velocity of a water tunnel cannot meet the reynolds law requirement the tests are carried out in a high speed wind tunnel to reach a high reynolds number of 1 97e 05 though the free surface is neglected the maximum current velocity in the gulf of mexico gom and the south china sea may not exceed 2 5 m s even in the 100 year return period sheikh and bbrown 2010 thus the froude numbers f r u g d for offshore platforms are small in most cases i e f r 0 18 for a platform featured with columns with a diameter of 20 m the free surface effect can be neglected and simplified as a wall at such a low froude number for a single offshore structure tan et al 2013 liu 2016 holland et al 2017 it is assumed that this conclusion is also true for two body systems in this paper 2 1 wind tunnel the experiment is performed in a closed circuit wind tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university china as shown in fig 1 the wind tunnel has two test sections one is the large test section low speed test section 6 m wide 3 5 m high 14 m long and a top wind velocity of 20 m s equipped with an automatic roughness element lifting device it can simulate different velocity profiles of atmospheric boundary layer by adjusting the heights of roughness elements the other is a small test section high speed test section 3 m wide 2 5m high 16 m long and a top wind velocity of 60 m s equipped with two 2 m diameter turntables there is no roughness element in this test section and the floor of it is flat which is mainly used for uniform flow cases the experiments are carried out in the high speed test section the flow is generated by a fan driven by a 1000 kw motor after the wind flows out from the low speed test section see fig 1 it enters corner4 in which flow deflectors are installed to ensure that the airflow changes direction without separation then the wind flows into stable chamber1 where rectifiers such as honeycombs and damping screens are adopted to reduce the turbulence intensity and make the velocity distribution more uniform finally the airflow enters the high speed test section through the contraction region before the experiments the vertical profile of flow velocity in the test section is measured under two different reference velocities u r e f as illustrated in fig 2 where z is the hight above wind tunnel floor u is the measured velocity at corresponding z the converged thickness of wind tunnel boundary layer is about 300 mm at which the u u r e f has reached to 0 99 for both two reference velocities corresponding turbulence intensities i u i u σ u u σ u and u are the standard deviation and mean value of the flow velocity respectively at z 300 mm are also recorded that is 0 47 and 0 37 for u r e f 35 and 40 m s respectively 2 2 models the multi body system in this study consists of two semi submersibles as shown in fig 7 one is the production platform pp and the other is for accommodation and support purposes since the accommodation platform ap will provide services for various forms of main vessels different separation distances d spacing ratios a l production platform column shapes and drafts t are considered all the models in this paper with basic parameters are listed in table 1 where d is the minimum spacing between the pontoons of two platforms see fig 7 the spacing ratio of columns is defined as a l where a is the side length or diameter of columns and l is the center to center distance between two adjacent columns it should be noted that the p p v c s production vessel model is not a conventional form of semi submersible it features an octagonal annular pontoon with four variable cross section vcs columns and its parameters are listed in table 2 table 3 lists the detailed main dimensions of the accommodation platform model a p to ensure accurate geometric profiles the models are 3d printed hollow structures using plastic materials with a 3 mm wall thickness to maintain their stiffness in high velocities and the model surface is covered with resin paint the connecting parts are also strengthened during installation the scale ratio is set to 1 200 the blockage ratio will vary with the incidence angle and draft the maximum value is 1 90 for all headings and drafts in a twin platform coupled case satisfying the requirement recommended by günter 1983 the a p and p p v c s models are showed in fig 3 2 3 wind tunnel arrangement the schemes of the experimental set ups for single body cases are illustrated in fig 4 a and b the testing apparatus is installed on the front turntable the major drawback of wind tunnel tests for measuring current loads is the boundary layer at the wind tunnel floor in order to avoid boundary layer effects a testbed is contrived to deploy the model outside of the boundary layer of velocity field grown from the tunnel floor as hwang et al 2017 did this testbed consists of four legs with adjustable heights and a circular aluminum al alloy plate with a diameter of 1 7 m see fig 5 a and c the height of the plate s top surface is 400 mm which exceeds the wind tunnel boundary layer thickness about 300 mm as mentioned in section 2 1 this plate is 5 mm in thickness in order to reduce the flow separation and disturbance to the flow field the testbed is made with thin leading edge a circular board 1 5 m in diameter 2 cm in thickness is fixed under the al alloy plate for reinforcement and to ensure flatness there also is a round hole in the center of the plates used for connecting the six component load cell model and lower connectors the whole testbed is fixed on the turntable by the legs and can rotate synchronously the model is inversely mounted on the testbed and subjected to wind in the direction of the x axis since the model columns cannot be directly connected to the load cell a 3 mm al alloy plate is adopted the model is fixed to the plate by screws at each column and the plate is connected with the load cell there is a 2 mm distance 0 68 of the p p v c s model height between the bottom of the plate and the top of the testbed to ensure that there is no contact with the testbed which would affect the force measurements the lower part of the load cell is fixed to the rotating mechanism in the test section by utilizing a strong connection there is a cylindrical plastic cover outside the balance to keep the wind from acting on the load cell see fig 5 b a distance about 1 cm is maintained between the inner wall of the cover and the load cell to avoid contact between them it should be noted that although the al alloy plate is polished quite smooth and its edge is chamfered a new boundary layer will inevitably generate on it the vertical profile of flow velocity above the plate at the plate center is shown in fig 6 where h is the height from the plate top surface the boundary layer thickness generated on the al alloy plate is about 10 mm which results in the difference between actual test conditions and the uniform flow assumption the measured velocity profile is approximately 3 10 relative to the platform draft please pay attention that it introduces biases to the measured load coefficients two right handed coordinate systems are defined in fig 4 the global coordinate system o x y z is fixed in the test section the x axis and y axis of the local coordinate system are along the longitudinal and transverse sections of the model respectively with the z axis pointing upwards θ is the current incidence angle when the turntable is in the initial position the two coordinate systems are identical θ 0 the current load measurements for two platforms are completed twice due to the limitation of the internal structure of the test section for one coupled case assuming that the two testing platforms in the coupled case are model a and b a is firstly mounted at the center of the testbed for force measurements model b is fixed at the corresponding position of the testbed according to the specified separation distance and without load cell as shown in fig 4 c after measuring the forces acting on model a the two platforms interchange their positions to record the loads on model b at the second time the two tests must ensure a consistent wind environment and relative positions of the models fig 7 provides a snapshot of the measurement for the a p p p c 0 35 coupled system in which a p is the testing model and d is the separation distance defined as the nearest distance between the pontoons of the two platforms in the present study the instantaneous wind speed of the flow field is measured by a pitot tube a high sensitivity force moment load cell cl yb 14q 30k manufactured by sinocera piezotronics inc is utilized to measure the dynamic wind loads acting on the model it can capture the six component loads including the three forces f x f y and f z along the x y and z axes respectively and corresponding moments m x m y and m z about each axis in local coordinates the amplified output signals from load cell are measured simultaneously and collected at a 50 hz sampling rate the duration of each tested case is at least 60 s for the steady input flow 2 4 force coefficients the load coefficients are defined as follows 1 c f x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 a f 2 c f y f y 1 2 ρ u 2 a s and 3 c m z m z 1

uniform flow under different incidence angles θ 0 90 for single body cases and θ 90 90 for twin body cases with a 15 interval the test program for a two platform system can be referred to table 4 and the single platform cases include tests for each model to table 1 before the tests the installation of the models and load cell are checked and calibrated the load cell is calibrated through the way of multiple loading in one direction and the calibration curves are determined by linear fitting fig 8 shows the calibration curves for f x and f y indicating that the sensor has good linearity in the range of low amplitude to ensure the same flow in model tests as in full scale it is necessary to ensure re number similarity for practical purposes the flow field in model tests needs to reach the turbulent region after which the re number has little effect on force coefficients of tested models the corresponding re number is generally considered as the critical re number through the tests with a series of different flow speeds the critical re number can be determined and corresponding wind speed can be calculated accordingly to ensure the re number during tests would be sufficiently high to avoid severe scale effects the above process is re number test during which the mean force coefficients under different flow velocities u are compared for single platform cases c f x under 0 and c f y under 90 are considered for two platform cases c f y under 90 is also included fig 9 illustrates the re test results for the a p model when it is alone for the c f x under 0 and c f y under 90 cases where the flow reaches a steady state when re 1 41e 05 u 25 m s a high flow velocity is usually adopted if the test conditions permit ren et al 2012 thus the testing flow velocity is 40 m s re 1 97e 05 and the relative error of force coefficients measured at 40 m s re 1 97e 05 and 45 m s re 2 22e 05 is less than 3 similar results for the p p v c s model in a p p p v c s coupled case are elucidated in fig 10 the flow forces on p p v c s converge when re 2 01e 05 u 25 m s and 35 m s re 2 81e 05 is chosen as the testing speed 3 validation to assess the reliability of the experiments the current loads acting on a single platform p p s 0 35 40 m draft square ring pontoon with four square columns are firstly measured the measurements are compared with the published results on a semi submersible which is also featured with a square ring pontoon and four square columns from hwang et al 2017 and li et al 2018 as summarized in table 5 the mean force coefficients obtained from the present paper differ from the published results by 1 7 11 0 indicating that the present experimental set ups are reliable small discrepancies may have been caused by the different experimental or numerical conditions such as blockage ratio turbulence intensity and boundary layer thickness iungo et al 2012 wang et al 2012 for a clearer comparison fig 11 compares the experimental mean current loads between hwang et al 2017 and this paper p p s 0 35 alone case on a semi submersible platform with same column shapes the results from this experiment generally agree well with those of the literature the mean longitudinal force coefficient c f x reaches its maximum at 30 and the maximum c f y appears at 60 4 uncertainty analysis an uncertainty analysis is performed to assess the reliability and fluctuations of the measurements the time series of flow velocity u for the a p alone cases are plotted in fig 12 u fluctuates slightly around the specified testing velocity 40 m s at the model scale showing that the input wind speed is fairly stable fig 13 shows the time histories and histograms of the original force coefficients c f x and c f y on a p both for the model alone and coupled with p p v c s cases are illustrated the abscissas of probability density pd histograms have subtracted the corresponding mean values though the steady uniform flow is modeled during tests the instantaneous current force coefficients are unsteady with random fluctuations this instability also becomes more severe when another platform is nearby compare fig 13 a b c and d the p p v c s model makes the flow velocity over the a p model shift in a wider range indicating that the a p model has a higher chance of experiencing instantaneous flow speeds that deviate more from the mean consistent with the results from tian et al 2019 the instantaneous force coefficients for both the platform alone and coupled cases also fit well with the gaussian distribution figs 14 and 15 summarize the fluctuations of the filtered force coefficients data for both two platform coupled cases and one single case θ 90 and 90 are the arrangements that the measured model is upstream and downstream respectively θ 0 is the case that the two models are arranged side by side m is taken to be the absolute value of real mean and u is the standard deviation the maximum relative uncertainty u m is 4 22 which is derived from the case 03 for all two platform coupled cases when the measured model is downstream the load fluctuations are larger than that of upstream this phenomenon known as wake induced vibration wiv is particularly significant in case 03 the reason is that the downstream structure is immersed in a disturbed flow region created by the wake of upstream body assi et al 2010 the unsteady vortex structure interactions can make the downstream model have a higher probability to experience flow speeds far away from the mean value leading to more unstable forces by comparing the results of single and two body cases the current loads on the model when it is downstream θ 90 in a coupled configuration suffers more obvious fluctuations than corresponding single body case it should be pointed out that only the time averaged values are presented and discussed in the following sections 5 results and discussion 5 1 effects of separation distances d the separation distances d have a direct influence on the interference levels in a twin body coupled system the variations of mean current force coefficients on a p and p p v c s models with d 10 m 30 m and 50 m are compared in fig 16 when a p is upstream θ 90 0 c f x is generally larger but c f y is smaller than the a p alone results it indicates that the nearby body increases the longitudinal force f x and reduces the transverse force f y on the front platform the diminishing effect on c f y is most significant at θ 90 p p v c s is right behind a p c f y is reduced by the twin body interference up to 31 6 d l 0 19 and 20 5 d l 0 96 respectively with decreasing d the twin body interference becomes more apparent when a p and p p v c s are side by side θ 0 c f x is still larger than that for single a p case revealing that the side vessel p p v c s has significant interference on the current forces of a p it can even increase c f x up to about 30 when d l 0 19 when a p goes behind the p p v c s θ 0 90 c f x is amplified by the interaction conversely this amplification effect on c f x diminishes with d l decreasing from 0 96 to 0 58 for c f y it is distinctly less than that for a p alone case when θ 30 90 due to the shielding effect from p p v c s as expected the sheltering increases as d decreases it is most significant at θ 90 when a p is completely blocked by the upstream p p v c s however the twin body interference is insensitive to d at this point all of the c f y are almost 80 less than the single body results it should be noted that the maximum c f x either in single or twin body arrangements is at θ 15 not 0 the reason is that the incident flow area is the largest at this incidence angle fig 17 a and b illustrates the percentage of c f x and c f y relative to the single platform measurements as functions of d only the results at some critical incidence angles are shown here it can be found that the effects of d in the range of 10 m 50 m and the load coefficients approximately have a linear relationship between them in most cases 2 for the loads on p p v c s see fig 16 c and d when p p v c s is upstream θ 90 0 the nearby body decreases the longitudinal force f x on the front platform this is opposite to the results of the previously mentioned case when a p is upstream the reason is the different sizes of the two platforms the incident flow area of p p v c s is about three times that of a p from θ 45 to 0 c f x is gradually close to the result of p p v c s alone case and only differences less than 10 exist since only part of the rear platform is in the wake of p p v c s due to the incidence angle producing a weaker disturbance as for the influences of different d it only appears to be slightly evident at θ 60 15 as for c f y the coupled case results are generally consistent with the single platform measurements when p p v c s settles into the wake of a p θ 0 90 there is little discrepancy of c f x between single and twin platform arrangements the difference is greater than 5 only at θ 45 and 60 with d l 0 23 that is 8 6 and 6 8 respectively the shielding effects on c f y are also observed however it is not as remarkable as the sheltering from p p v c s to a p the maximum reduction of c f y is 25 8 at θ 75 with d l 0 23 while it is about 80 for a p it means that a p has less interference to p p v c s due to the difference in size a near linear influence of d on c f y also exists which can be referred to fig 17 c 5 2 effects of column spacing ratios a l we further compare the results from the cases that a p is coupled with different pps with varying column spacing ratios a l 0 25 0 30 and 0 35 as shown in fig 18 the drafts of all the three pps are 40 m the general variation trends of c f x and c f y measured from a coupled case are consistent with fig 16 a and b the effects of a l are negligible when a p locates windward the twin body interaction can increase c f x by about 17 at θ 15 c f y is reduced by about 20 30 at θ 90 45 when a p and pp are side by side the amplification effect on c f x by the side platform becomes more significant as a l increases c f x are magnified by 10 5 16 0 and 17 7 with a l increasing from 0 25 to 0 35 the columns get closer to the platform center as a l increases it augments the difficulty of wind flow passing through the columns which leads to greater interference once θ 15 the shielding effect on both c f x and c f y appears as a p gradually settling into the shadow of the upstream platform the sheltering is quite remarkable on c f y and it gets more significant as a l decreases in most cases see fig 19 b it should be noted that an exception occurs at θ 90 when the two platforms are aligned the shielding effect appears to be more prominent as a l increases the l of a p is 52 00 m and that of p p s 0 25 p p s 0 30 and p p s 0 35 are 57 14 m 66 66 m and 80 00 m respectively under this tandem arrangement of the two platforms l of p p s 0 25 is closest to that of a p leading to a wider shadow for a p columns 5 3 effects of drafts t the incident flow area of platform is directly related to the draft which has evident effects on the current loads interaction in a two body coupled system fig 20 illustrates the relationship between the draft of pp and mean current loads on model a p when a p is upstream p p s 0 35 with the minimum draft t 20 m has the weakest effect on c f x and c f y especially that c f x is quite close to the results of a p alone case the pp with a large draft will cause more significant interferences to a p however there is not much difference between the measurements of t 40 m and t 60 m which is around 5 for c f x and less than 3 for c f y in the range of incidence angle governed by f y the maximum and minimum reduction of c f y by two body interference are 32 1 θ 45 t 60 m and 15 7 θ 90 t 20 m respectively when a p is sheltered by the front structure the shielding effect is most significant in the case of t 20 m for c f x while this effect on c f y is not sensitive to t in most cases only the results of t 20 m at θ 90 show the greatest interaction because not only the columns but also the pontoons of the front pp will provide shelter for a p as the two platforms own a same draft the maximum and minimum reduction of c f y reach up to 61 2 θ 90 t 20 m and 33 2 θ 45 t 60 m respectively table 6 reveals that the upstream structure has a considerable effect on reducing current loads acting on the downstream accommodation platform 5 4 effects of column shapes to have a better understanding of the influences of column shapes on twin body interference the current load coefficients on model a p in the case that it is coupled with p p s 0 35 square columns and p p c 0 35 cylindrical columns are compared in fig 21 the drafts of the two pps are both 40 m and the separation distance is 30 m corresponding relative changes of c f x and c f y compared to the results of single body case are also plotted generally the interference effect as well as the sheltering from platform with square columns is more evident than that with cylindrical columns the magnifying effect from the downstream pp with square columns on c f x is about 1 2 1 4 times that with cylindrical columns which can be seen from fig 21 c for example c f x increases by 25 0 square and 17 7 cylindrical at θ 30 and the corresponding augments at θ 15 are 17 5 square and 14 5 cylindrical as for c f y the results measured from the cases of square and cylindrical columns differ by about 1 8 times except for θ 90 at which c f y decreases by 20 7 square and 17 1 cylindrical however c f x on a p when it enters into the shadow zone shows less discrepancy with the single body results especially that there are less than 5 differences between the measurements of single and twin platform configurations in the case of circular columns generally the interaction effects of the two different column shapes on c f y vary by about 1 2 1 4 times in the sheltered zone at θ 75 the reduction of c f y by the upstream pp is 54 9 square and 41 5 cylindrical respectively 6 concluding remarks in this paper the mean current load coefficients c f x and c f y on two coupled semi submersibles are measured in the wind tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university the influences of separation distance d between two platforms spacing ratio a l column shape and draft t of the production platform are investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the interference on current loads must be considered for a twin body coupled system when the accommodation platform a p is upstream the rear pp will increase the longitudinal force f x up to 14 and decrease the transverse force f y up to 32 on it when the two vessels are arranged side by side c f x on a p is still amplified by the side platform when a p enters the wake of pp the sheltering appears making c f y diminish distinctively which can reach up to about 80 2 with decreasing separation distance d the twin body interference on c f x and c f y becomes more significant the reduction of load coefficients generally has a linear relationship with d 3 the effects of pp column spacing a l on c f x and c f y are negligible when a p is upstream however when a p gets downstream the reduction of c f x and c f y becomes evident with decreasing a l while this trend is contrary at θ 90 the two platforms are aligned 4 when a p is upstream the production platform with a large draft has more powerful interference to c f x and c f y on a p the shielding effect on current loads is insensitive to t except for θ 90 at which the sheltering of t 20 m is superior to that of the t 40 m and t 60 m cases 5 the interference and shielding effect on current loads of a p by the production platform with square columns is more significant about 1 2 1 8 times than that with cylindrical columns credit authorship contribution statement qing dong writing original draft data curation investigation visualization jianmin

22009,numerous multi body coupled systems are adopted in offshore operations to improve the accommodation environment and work efficiency the current loads on a multi body system are complex due to environmental sheltering and greatly affect operation safety and feasibility this paper presents experimental studies on current loads particularly the longitudinal and transverse forces acting on two side by side semi submersibles in a wind tunnel the influences of separation distance spacing ratio shape of columns and draft of production platform on current loads are investigated when the accommodation platform is upstream the twin body interference can generally increase the longitudinal force acting on the vessel and decrease the transverse force the shielding effect appears when the vessel is downstream significantly decreasing the mean transverse load coefficient by up to 80 when separation distance decreases the interference becomes more distinct and there is nearly a linear relationship between distance and force reduction once the accommodation platform turns and is shielded the reduction in mean load coefficients becomes more noticeable as the spacing ratio decreases the shielding effect is insensitive to drafts except for the 90 the production platform with square columns has greater interferences about 1 2 1 8 times than that with cylindrical columns keywords

and gas industry the demand for offshore operations has greatly increased nowadays multi body systems are widely used for drilling platform installations and offloading operations in practical engineering applications service vessels provide support for different forms of offshore platforms for example a production platform with the tender assisted drilling tad vessel choi et al 2018 a service vessel with an offshore wind turbine könig et al 2017 and an fpso with a flotel kunkyebe and georgiev 2015 or shuttle tanker shivaji ganesan and sen 2016 the multi body system significantly extends working capability and improves accommodation conditions and it has become more widely used in the offshore industry environmental excitations such as waves currents and winds may cause large movements or load responses of floating structures and can even lead to accidents moan 1985 since operation safety is always the first priority a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic responses of offshore structures is essential the dynamic responses of a single floating body in harsh seas have been well studied such as vortex induced motions vim liu et al 2017 green water phenomenon qin et al 2017 moonpool resonance guo et al 2017 global motions and wave slamming loads bennett et al 2014 the multi body hydrodynamics involve interactions between different bodies which makes the problem more complex compared to that of a single body case the hydrodynamic interaction between two bodies can be induced by the diffraction and radiation waves feng et al 2017 as well as the current loads koop 2016 for the multi body wave interaction it can be mostly solved well in the context of potential theory pessoa et al 2015 and pessoa et al 2016 studied the first order wave frequency and the second order slow drift motions of two side by side vessels by applying the three dimensional diffraction theory large relative motions were identified at the low frequency range the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is also adopted for some nonlinear problems such as gap resonance li and zhang 2016 hydrodynamic interference due to current action involve viscous effects and vortical flow patterns a bluff body immerged in fluid is susceptible to the oscillating hydrodynamic force arising from alternating eddies or vortices shedding downstream from one side of the structure to the other such vortical flow patterns will cause vortex induced vibration viv for small scale structures for example mooring lines risers or subsea cables the large volume offshore floating units may suffer vim a phenomenon identified as lock in can pose threats to safe and reliable operations and severely affect the fatigue life of risers and mooring systems cheng et al 2011 liu et al 2016 for a two platform system the current interference is more complex it directly influences the dynamic distance between structures this is because the current cause large slow varying motions of the platform due to the small damping in low frequency region relative motions between two floating platforms are of great concern in terms of personal transfer by a gangway or oil offloading by connecting pipelines dong et al 2019 the connection may also apply additional loads on the production platform leading to a large offset that may threaten the safety of riser system hwang et al 2017 empirical formulas numerical simulations and experiments are typical approaches to estimate the current loads acting on the offshore platforms koop et al 2011 croonenborghs et al 2013 the adoption of empirical coefficients is relatively simple the widely used oil companies international marine forum 1994 coefficients are based on experimental data with similar vessels performed by the maritime research institute netherlands marin however whether these data are applicable to arbitrary hull shapes is unclear another usable dataset is the esdu data sheet 80025 which provides empirical formulations based on wind tunnel tests for various shapes s c et al 2016 in recent years the cfd method has become more widely used and is more flexible than empirical approach the environmental loads on a lng carrier fathi et al 2010 koop 2015 the current loads on a complex semi submersible geometry in a uniform flow croonenborghs et al 2013 and the high fidelity fluid structure interaction simulations that consider the influence of aero hydrodynamic coupling for a floating offshore wind turbine tran and kim 2017 have all been solved using cfd methods experiments which can be conducted by towing tests in water basins wind tunnel tests and water channel tests are also commonly used for quantifying current loads on offshore structures cho et al 2018 niklas and pruszko 2019 used the data obtained by towing tests for a ship to validate the results of full scale cfd silumations hwang et al 2017 studied the current load acting on semi submersible in a wind tunnel and developed a floated plate to lift the model off the floor to reduce the effect of boundary layer grown from the tunnel floor hu et al 2019 carried out a series of tests in a high speed cavitation water channel to study the unsteady hydrodynamic loads on a tension leg platform tlp at high reynolds number to ensure that the flow patterns of tests are consistent with the full scale the current drag of flng hull obtained from towing tests and wind tunnel experiments was compared by huang et al 2016 the differences indicated that the wind tunnel floor boundary layers have obvious effects on the results the above mentioned estimation methods were also compared and accessed by vaz et al 2009 and ottens et al 2009 though the empirical formulation is straightforward it is a fair initial estimate in terms of speed quality and complexity but it produces errors that generally overestimate the loads leading to a more conservative design koop et al 2011 the current loads on several typical offshore structures have been successfully calculated by the cfd method koop and bereznitski 2011 calculated the current loads on a semi submersible in both model and full scales demonstrating the uncertainty caused by scale effect it is valuable to have cfd results prior to model tests to access the range of expected forces and potential errors in experiments in general model tests are believed to be reliable and often considered to be the benchmark niklas and pruszko 2019 experimental results are expected to verify the cfd computations these experiments should be replicated several times for a more reliable statistical analysis previous studies are mainly focused on single body cases there have been only a few attempts to quantify the current loads of two body coupled offshore systems while taking shielding effects into account fucatu and nishimoto 2003 2004 illuminati et al 2009 proposed a tentative empirical model of current wake effects between an fpso and shuttle tanker the fpso hull was firstly considered fixed in space and the disturbed current velocity field was computed by cfd method then the hydrodynamic forces on the shuttle ship were calculated using the local cross flow method yuck et al 2007 performed towing tests of two side by side moored vessels under different arrangements the current loads in the multi body case changed significantly compared to the single body case and the sheltering effect was clearly observed koop 2016 2019 conducted numerical and experimental research on similar objects finding significant reduction of the current forces when the downstream vessel is positioned in the wake of another vessel these studies on side by side configuration were conducted for ship shaped vessels to have a better understanding of current interference or the shielding effect this study investigates the loads on two side by side semi submersibles using wind tunnel tests the effects of separation distance column spacing and shape as well as the draft of main production platform are conducted this paper is arranged as follows the experimental set up of wind tunnel tests are detailed in section 2 section 3 shows the validation for current loads on a single platform and the published results the uncertainty analysis for force measurements is evaluated in section 4 then the mean and fluctuating streamwise and transverse forces for different separation distances column spacings column shapes and drafts are discussed in section 5 the conclusions are summarized in section 6 this study contributes to the understanding of force analysis and the design of multi body offshore platforms 2 experimental set ups there are several relevant laws for model tests related to the similarities of geometry kinematics and dynamics dynamic similarity requires a relatively high velocity in model tests to ensure consistent flow patterns at full scale the measurements of the current loads on offshore structures are usually carried out in a towing tank or water tunnel with a free surface however the maximum velocity of a water tunnel cannot meet the reynolds law requirement the tests are carried out in a high speed wind tunnel to reach a high reynolds number of 1 97e 05 though the free surface is neglected the maximum current velocity in the gulf of mexico gom and the south china sea may not exceed 2 5 m s even in the 100 year return period sheikh and bbrown 2010 thus the froude numbers f r u g d for offshore platforms are small in most cases i e f r 0 18 for a platform featured with columns with a diameter of 20 m the free surface effect can be neglected and simplified as a wall at such a low froude number for a single offshore structure tan et al 2013 liu 2016 holland et al 2017 it is assumed that this conclusion is also true for two body systems in this paper 2 1 wind tunnel the experiment is performed in a closed circuit wind tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university china as shown in fig 1 the wind tunnel has two test sections one is the large test section low speed test section 6 m wide 3 5 m high 14 m long and a top wind velocity of 20 m s equipped with an automatic roughness element lifting device it can simulate different velocity profiles of atmospheric boundary layer by adjusting the heights of roughness elements the other is a small test section high speed test section 3 m wide 2 5m high 16 m long and a top wind velocity of 60 m s equipped with two 2 m diameter turntables there is no roughness element in this test section and the floor of it is flat which is mainly used for uniform flow cases the experiments are carried out in the high speed test section the flow is generated by a fan driven by a 1000 kw motor after the wind flows out from the low speed test section see fig 1 it enters corner4 in which flow deflectors are installed to ensure that the airflow changes direction without separation then the wind flows into stable chamber1 where rectifiers such as honeycombs and damping screens are adopted to reduce the turbulence intensity and make the velocity distribution more uniform finally the airflow enters the high speed test section through the contraction region before the experiments the vertical profile of flow velocity in the test section is measured under two different reference velocities u r e f as illustrated in fig 2 where z is the hight above wind tunnel floor u is the measured velocity at corresponding z the converged thickness of wind tunnel boundary layer is about 300 mm at which the u u r e f has reached to 0 99 for both two reference velocities corresponding turbulence intensities i u i u σ u u σ u and u are the standard deviation and mean value of the flow velocity respectively at z 300 mm are also recorded that is 0 47 and 0 37 for u r e f 35 and 40 m s respectively 2 2 models the multi body system in this study consists of two semi submersibles as shown in fig 7 one is the production platform pp and the other is for accommodation and support purposes since the accommodation platform ap will provide services for various forms of main vessels different separation distances d spacing ratios a l production platform column shapes and drafts t are considered all the models in this paper with basic parameters are listed in table 1 where d is the minimum spacing between the pontoons of two platforms see fig 7 the spacing ratio of columns is defined as a l where a is the side length or diameter of columns and l is the center to center distance between two adjacent columns it should be noted that the p p v c s production vessel model is not a conventional form of semi submersible it features an octagonal annular pontoon with four variable cross section vcs columns and its parameters are listed in table 2 table 3 lists the detailed main dimensions of the accommodation platform model a p to ensure accurate geometric profiles the models are 3d printed hollow structures using plastic materials with a 3 mm wall thickness to maintain their stiffness in high velocities and the model surface is covered with resin paint the connecting parts are also strengthened during installation the scale ratio is set to 1 200 the blockage ratio will vary with the incidence angle and draft the maximum value is 1 90 for all headings and drafts in a twin platform coupled case satisfying the requirement recommended by günter 1983 the a p and p p v c s models are showed in fig 3 2 3 wind tunnel arrangement the schemes of the experimental set ups for single body cases are illustrated in fig 4 a and b the testing apparatus is installed on the front turntable the major drawback of wind tunnel tests for measuring current loads is the boundary layer at the wind tunnel floor in order to avoid boundary layer effects a testbed is contrived to deploy the model outside of the boundary layer of velocity field grown from the tunnel floor as hwang et al 2017 did this testbed consists of four legs with adjustable heights and a circular aluminum al alloy plate with a diameter of 1 7 m see fig 5 a and c the height of the plate s top surface is 400 mm which exceeds the wind tunnel boundary layer thickness about 300 mm as mentioned in section 2 1 this plate is 5 mm in thickness in order to reduce the flow separation and disturbance to the flow field the testbed is made with thin leading edge a circular board 1 5 m in diameter 2 cm in thickness is fixed under the al alloy plate for reinforcement and to ensure flatness there also is a round hole in the center of the plates used for connecting the six component load cell model and lower connectors the whole testbed is fixed on the turntable by the legs and can rotate synchronously the model is inversely mounted on the testbed and subjected to wind in the direction of the x axis since the model columns cannot be directly connected to the load cell a 3 mm al alloy plate is adopted the model is fixed to the plate by screws at each column and the plate is connected with the load cell there is a 2 mm distance 0 68 of the p p v c s model height between the bottom of the plate and the top of the testbed to ensure that there is no contact with the testbed which would affect the force measurements the lower part of the load cell is fixed to the rotating mechanism in the test section by utilizing a strong connection there is a cylindrical plastic cover outside the balance to keep the wind from acting on the load cell see fig 5 b a distance about 1 cm is maintained between the inner wall of the cover and the load cell to avoid contact between them it should be noted that although the al alloy plate is polished quite smooth and its edge is chamfered a new boundary layer will inevitably generate on it the vertical profile of flow velocity above the plate at the plate center is shown in fig 6 where h is the height from the plate top surface the boundary layer thickness generated on the al alloy plate is about 10 mm which results in the difference between actual test conditions and the uniform flow assumption the measured velocity profile is approximately 3 10 relative to the platform draft please pay attention that it introduces biases to the measured load coefficients two right handed coordinate systems are defined in fig 4 the global coordinate system o x y z is fixed in the test section the x axis and y axis of the local coordinate system are along the longitudinal and transverse sections of the model respectively with the z axis pointing upwards θ is the current incidence angle when the turntable is in the initial position the two coordinate systems are identical θ 0 the current load measurements for two platforms are completed twice due to the limitation of the internal structure of the test section for one coupled case assuming that the two testing platforms in the coupled case are model a and b a is firstly mounted at the center of the testbed for force measurements model b is fixed at the corresponding position of the testbed according to the specified separation distance and without load cell as shown in fig 4 c after measuring the forces acting on model a the two platforms interchange their positions to record the loads on model b at the second time the two tests must ensure a consistent wind environment and relative positions of the models fig 7 provides a snapshot of the measurement for the a p p p c 0 35 coupled system in which a p is the testing model and d is the separation distance defined as the nearest distance between the pontoons of the two platforms in the present study the instantaneous wind speed of the flow field is measured by a pitot tube a high sensitivity force moment load cell cl yb 14q 30k manufactured by sinocera piezotronics inc is utilized to measure the dynamic wind loads acting on the model it can capture the six component loads including the three forces f x f y and f z along the x y and z axes respectively and corresponding moments m x m y and m z about each axis in local coordinates the amplified output signals from load cell are measured simultaneously and collected at a 50 hz sampling rate the duration of each tested case is at least 60 s for the steady input flow 2 4 force coefficients the load coefficients are defined as follows 1 c f x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 a f 2 c f y f y 1 2 ρ u 2 a s and 3 c m z m z 1 2 ρ u 2 a s l o a where c f x c f y and c m z are the longitudinal force transverse force and yaw moment coefficients respectively the above equations define instantaneous values and give the discrete average values 4 c f x 1 n i 1 n c f x i 5 c f y 1 n i 1 n c f y i and 6 c m z 1 n i 1 n c m z i where n is the total number of sampling data points the reference reynolds number re in this paper is 7 r e u l ν where l is the side length or diameter of the column and ν is the air kinematic viscosity ν 1 66 e 05 m2 s at 35 c 2 5 test program the present experiments are carried out in a steady uniform flow under different incidence angles θ 0 90 for single body cases and θ 90 90 for twin body cases with a 15 interval the test program for a two platform system can be referred to table 4 and the single platform cases include tests for each model to table 1 before the tests the installation of the models and load cell are checked and calibrated the load cell is calibrated through the way of multiple loading in one direction and the calibration curves are determined by linear fitting fig 8 shows the calibration curves for f x and f y indicating that the sensor has good linearity in the range of low amplitude to ensure the same flow in model tests as in full scale it is necessary to ensure re number similarity for practical purposes the flow field in model tests needs to reach the turbulent region after which the re number has little effect on force coefficients of tested models the corresponding re number is generally considered as the critical re number through the tests with a series of different flow speeds the critical re number can be determined and corresponding wind speed can be calculated accordingly to ensure the re number during tests would be sufficiently high to avoid severe scale effects the above process is re number test during which the mean force coefficients under different flow velocities u are compared for single platform cases c f x under 0 and c f y under 90 are considered for two platform cases c f y under 90 is also included fig 9 illustrates the re test results for the a p model when it is alone for the c f x under 0 and c f y under 90 cases where the flow reaches a steady state when re 1 41e 05 u 25 m s a high flow velocity is usually adopted if the test conditions permit ren et al 2012 thus the testing flow velocity is 40 m s re 1 97e 05 and the relative error of force coefficients measured at 40 m s re 1 97e 05 and 45 m s re 2 22e 05 is less than 3 similar results for the p p v c s model in a p p p v c s coupled case are elucidated in fig 10 the flow forces on p p v c s converge when re 2 01e 05 u 25 m s and 35 m s re 2 81e 05 is chosen as the testing speed 3 validation to assess the reliability of the experiments the current loads acting on a single platform p p s 0 35 40 m draft square ring pontoon with four square columns are firstly measured the measurements are compared with the published results on a semi submersible which is also featured with a square ring pontoon and four square columns from hwang et al 2017 and li et al 2018 as summarized in table 5 the mean force coefficients obtained from the present paper differ from the published results by 1 7 11 0 indicating that the present experimental set ups are reliable small discrepancies may have been caused by the different experimental or numerical conditions such as blockage ratio turbulence intensity and boundary layer thickness iungo et al 2012 wang et al 2012 for a clearer comparison fig 11 compares the experimental mean current loads between hwang et al 2017 and this paper p p s 0 35 alone case on a semi submersible platform with same column shapes the results from this experiment generally agree well with those of the literature the mean longitudinal force coefficient c f x reaches its maximum at 30 and the maximum c f y appears at 60 4 uncertainty analysis an uncertainty analysis is performed to assess the reliability and fluctuations of the measurements the time series of flow velocity u for the a p alone cases are plotted in fig 12 u fluctuates slightly around the specified testing velocity 40 m s at the model scale showing that the input wind speed is fairly stable fig 13 shows the time histories and histograms of the original force coefficients c f x and c f y on a p both for the model alone and coupled with p p v c s cases are illustrated the abscissas of probability density pd histograms have subtracted the corresponding mean values though the steady uniform flow is modeled during tests the instantaneous current force coefficients are unsteady with random fluctuations this instability also becomes more severe when another platform is nearby compare fig 13 a b c and d the p p v c s model makes the flow velocity over the a p model shift in a wider range indicating that the a p model has a higher chance of experiencing instantaneous flow speeds that deviate more from the mean consistent with the results from tian et al 2019 the instantaneous force coefficients for both the platform alone and coupled cases also fit well with the gaussian distribution figs 14 and 15 summarize the fluctuations of the filtered force coefficients data for both two platform coupled cases and one single case θ 90 and 90 are the arrangements that the measured model is upstream and downstream respectively θ 0 is the case that the two models are arranged side by side m is taken to be the absolute value of real mean and u is the standard deviation the maximum relative uncertainty u m is 4 22 which is derived from the case 03 for all two platform coupled cases when the measured model is downstream the load fluctuations are larger than that of upstream this phenomenon known as wake induced vibration wiv is particularly significant in case 03 the reason is that the downstream structure is immersed in a disturbed flow region created by the wake of upstream body assi et al 2010 the unsteady vortex structure interactions can make the downstream model have a higher probability to experience flow speeds far away from the mean value leading to more unstable forces by comparing the results of single and two body cases the current loads on the model when it is downstream θ 90 in a coupled configuration suffers more obvious fluctuations than corresponding single body case it should be pointed out that only the time averaged values are presented and discussed in the following sections 5 results and discussion 5 1 effects of separation distances d the separation distances d have a direct influence on the interference levels in a twin body coupled system the variations of mean current force coefficients on a p and p p v c s models with d 10 m 30 m and 50 m are compared in fig 16 when a p is upstream θ 90 0 c f x is generally larger but c f y is smaller than the a p alone results it indicates that the nearby body increases the longitudinal force f x and reduces the transverse force f y on the front platform the diminishing effect on c f y is most significant at θ 90 p p v c s is right behind a p c f y is reduced by the twin body interference up to 31 6 d l 0 19 and 20 5 d l 0 96 respectively with decreasing d the twin body interference becomes more apparent when a p and p p v c s are side by side θ 0 c f x is still larger than that for single a p case revealing that the side vessel p p v c s has significant interference on the current forces of a p it can even increase c f x up to about 30 when d l 0 19 when a p goes behind the p p v c s θ 0 90 c f x is amplified by the interaction conversely this amplification effect on c f x diminishes with d l decreasing from 0 96 to 0 58 for c f y it is distinctly less than that for a p alone case when θ 30 90 due to the shielding effect from p p v c s as expected the sheltering increases as d decreases it is most significant at θ 90 when a p is completely blocked by the upstream p p v c s however the twin body interference is insensitive to d at this point all of the c f y are almost 80 less than the single body results it should be noted that the maximum c f x either in single or twin body arrangements is at θ 15 not 0 the reason is that the incident flow area is the largest at this incidence angle fig 17 a and b illustrates the percentage of c f x and c f y relative to the single platform measurements as functions of d only the results at some critical incidence angles are shown here it can be found that the effects of d in the range of 10 m 50 m and the load coefficients approximately have a linear relationship between them in most cases 2 for the loads on p p v c s see fig 16 c and d when p p v c s is upstream θ 90 0 the nearby body decreases the longitudinal force f x on the front platform this is opposite to the results of the previously mentioned case when a p is upstream the reason is the different sizes of the two platforms the incident flow area of p p v c s is about three times that of a p from θ 45 to 0 c f x is gradually close to the result of p p v c s alone case and only differences less than 10 exist since only part of the rear platform is in the wake of p p v c s due to the incidence angle producing a weaker disturbance as for the influences of different d it only appears to be slightly evident at θ 60 15 as for c f y the coupled case results are generally consistent with the single platform measurements when p p v c s settles into the wake of a p θ 0 90 there is little discrepancy of c f x between single and twin platform arrangements the difference is greater than 5 only at θ 45 and 60 with d l 0 23 that is 8 6 and 6 8 respectively the shielding effects on c f y are also observed however it is not as remarkable as the sheltering from p p v c s to a p the maximum reduction of c f y is 25 8 at θ 75 with d l 0 23 while it is about 80 for a p it means that a p has less interference to p p v c s due to the difference in size a near linear influence of d on c f y also exists which can be referred to fig 17 c 5 2 effects of column spacing ratios a l we further compare the results from the cases that a p is coupled with different pps with varying column spacing ratios a l 0 25 0 30 and 0 35 as shown in fig 18 the drafts of all the three pps are 40 m the general variation trends of c f x and c f y measured from a coupled case are consistent with fig 16 a and b the effects of a l are negligible when a p locates windward the twin body interaction can increase c f x by about 17 at θ 15 c f y is reduced by about 20 30 at θ 90 45 when a p and pp are side by side the amplification effect on c f x by the side platform becomes more significant as a l increases c f x are magnified by 10 5 16 0 and 17 7 with a l increasing from 0 25 to 0 35 the columns get closer to the platform center as a l increases it augments the difficulty of wind flow passing through the columns which leads to greater interference once θ 15 the shielding effect on both c f x and c f y appears as a p gradually settling into the shadow of the upstream platform the sheltering is quite remarkable on c f y and it gets more significant as a l decreases in most cases see fig 19 b it should be noted that an exception occurs at θ 90 when the two platforms are aligned the shielding effect appears to be more prominent as a l increases the l of a p is 52 00 m and that of p p s 0 25 p p s 0 30 and p p s 0 35 are 57 14 m 66 66 m and 80 00 m respectively under this tandem arrangement of the two platforms l of p p s 0 25 is closest to that of a p leading to a wider shadow for a p columns 5 3 effects of drafts t the incident flow area of platform is directly related to the draft which has evident effects on the current loads interaction in a two body coupled system fig 20 illustrates the relationship between the draft of pp and mean current loads on model a p when a p is upstream p p s 0 35 with the minimum draft t 20 m has the weakest effect on c f x and c f y especially that c f x is quite close to the results of a p alone case the pp with a large draft will cause more significant interferences to a p however there is not much difference between the measurements of t 40 m and t 60 m which is around 5 for c f x and less than 3 for c f y in the range of incidence angle governed by f y the maximum and minimum reduction of c f y by two body interference are 32 1 θ 45 t 60 m and 15 7 θ 90 t 20 m respectively when a p is sheltered by the front structure the shielding effect is most significant in the case of t 20 m for c f x while this effect on c f y is not sensitive to t in most cases only the results of t 20 m at θ 90 show the greatest interaction because not only the columns but also the pontoons of the front pp will provide shelter for a p as the two platforms own a same draft the maximum and minimum reduction of c f y reach up to 61 2 θ 90 t 20 m and 33 2 θ 45 t 60 m respectively table 6 reveals that the upstream structure has a considerable effect on reducing current loads acting on the downstream accommodation platform 5 4 effects of column shapes to have a better understanding of the influences of column shapes on twin body interference the current load coefficients on model a p in the case that it is coupled with p p s 0 35 square columns and p p c 0 35 cylindrical columns are compared in fig 21 the drafts of the two pps are both 40 m and the separation distance is 30 m corresponding relative changes of c f x and c f y compared to the results of single body case are also plotted generally the interference effect as well as the sheltering from platform with square columns is more evident than that with cylindrical columns the magnifying effect from the downstream pp with square columns on c f x is about 1 2 1 4 times that with cylindrical columns which can be seen from fig 21 c for example c f x increases by 25 0 square and 17 7 cylindrical at θ 30 and the corresponding augments at θ 15 are 17 5 square and 14 5 cylindrical as for c f y the results measured from the cases of square and cylindrical columns differ by about 1 8 times except for θ 90 at which c f y decreases by 20 7 square and 17 1 cylindrical however c f x on a p when it enters into the shadow zone shows less discrepancy with the single body results especially that there are less than 5 differences between the measurements of single and twin platform configurations in the case of circular columns generally the interaction effects of the two different column shapes on c f y vary by about 1 2 1 4 times in the sheltered zone at θ 75 the reduction of c f y by the upstream pp is 54 9 square and 41 5 cylindrical respectively 6 concluding remarks in this paper the mean current load coefficients c f x and c f y on two coupled semi submersibles are measured in the wind tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university the influences of separation distance d between two platforms spacing ratio a l column shape and draft t of the production platform are investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the interference on current loads must be considered for a twin body coupled system when the accommodation platform a p is upstream the rear pp will increase the longitudinal force f x up to 14 and decrease the transverse force f y up to 32 on it when the two vessels are arranged side by side c f x on a p is still amplified by the side platform when a p enters the wake of pp the sheltering appears making c f y diminish distinctively which can reach up to about 80 2 with decreasing separation distance d the twin body interference on c f x and c f y becomes more significant the reduction of load coefficients generally has a linear relationship with d 3 the effects of pp column spacing a l on c f x and c f y are negligible when a p is upstream however when a p gets downstream the reduction of c f x and c f y becomes evident with decreasing a l while this trend is contrary at θ 90 the two platforms are aligned 4 when a p is upstream the production platform with a large draft has more powerful interference to c f x and c f y on a p the shielding effect on current loads is insensitive to t except for θ 90 at which the sheltering of t 20 m is superior to that of the t 40 m and t 60 m cases 5 the interference and shielding effect on current loads of a p by the production platform with square columns is more significant about 1 2 1 8 times than that with cylindrical columns credit authorship contribution statement qing dong writing original draft data curation investigation visualization jianmin
