15830,robust ceramic membranes presented attractive features of easy cleaning and excellent stability compared to polymeric membranes nevertheless their inherent relationships between the membrane microstructures and separation properties are not completely clear in this work we established a quantitative structure property model using α al2o3 membrane on account of the theory of filtrated cake to predict the effects of membrane structure controlled factors i e α al2o3 particle size and layer thickness on separation performances i e solute rejection and water permeance the simulation results show that membrane pore size mainly depends upon α al2o3 particle size rather than the layer thickness when the microstructure of top layer in a double layer asymmetric ceramic membrane is fixed there exists optimum particle size and layer thickness that constitute the support layer to achieve maximum water permeance for a triple layer ceramic membrane a similar matching relationship exists between top layer and intermediate layer indicating that the intermediate layer has a vital role in determining water permeance while the bottom layer has little effect on overall separation property finally the upper bound tradeoff relationship between permeance and selectivity is further established for the α al2o3 membrane this study reveals the structure property relationship of ceramic membrane and provides insights into performance enhancement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membranes structure property relationship mathematical model upper bound tradeoff optimal matching 1 introduction ceramic membranes exhibited great promise for challenging wastewater treatment process because of their inherent advantages of chemical and thermal stability li et al 2020a tian et al 2018 they are generally prepared with nano oxide materials e g al2o3 zro2 tio2 etc through sintering process to form an asymmetric structure comprising bottom layer intermediate layer and top layer chen et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 among these metallic oxides alumina is often chosen as the starting material owing to its low cost and high purity li et al 2020b nevertheless low permselectivity and membrane fouling are main issues of ceramic membranes in wastewater treatment these challenges can be addressed through the optimization of the ceramic membrane structure which is associated with the diameter of oxide particles sun et al 2018 each layer thickness wu et al 2019 and sintering process wang et al 2019 etc a thinner 0 5 mm alumina ceramic membrane with small pores 0 1 μm exhibited high permeate flux 2300 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and excellent oil retention efficiency 99 for the purification of oil water emulsion yu et al 2020 moreover the increase of the sintering temperature can enhance the mechanical strength of ceramic membrane which is more conducive to the treatment of strong corrosive wastewater li et al 2019 in general the separation properties are generally constrained by the upper bound appearing on a permeability selectivity tradeoff plot which is related to membrane structures a clear permeability selectivity tradeoff relationship for ceramic membrane is therefore beneficial to comprehend its potential wastewater treatment applications the permeability selectivity tradeoff relationships have been well established for polymeric membranes yang et al 2019 but much less studied for ceramic membranes to elucidate the upper bound tradeoff relationship and realize optimum filtration efficiency the crucial factor is a deeper understanding relating the ceramic membrane structures to membrane separation properties considering the huge elapsed time for collecting the experimental data of different membrane structures it would be useful to establish a mathematical model for predicting the structure controlled factors in membrane preparation influencing on the separation properties for instance a modified model based on hagen poiseuille and resistance in series equations was applied to reveal the pollution characteristics dashtban kenari and barbeau 2017 for manganese and iron removal in drinking water purification it was found that the fouling process starts with pore blockage accompanied by the cake formation at a subsequent stage in addition frederic et al studied the development of local fouling and its influence on the local flux distribution along a tubular double layer ceramic membrane by coupling computational fluid dynamics with darcy s equation frederic et al 2018 an interesting phenomenon was that high permeability ratio between bottom layer and top layer is beneficial to generate a uniform local flux distribution thereby mitigating the membrane fouling in water treatment most of these studies focused on predicting membrane performance and less attention has been devoted to understanding how transport modeling can guide the design and fabrication of ceramic membranes the major challenge is the lack of a suitable integrated model linking fabrication parameters of membranes to their properties to maximize the permselectivity of ceramic membrane in the wastewater treatment an integrated transport model was established in this study to link the structure controlled factors i e particle size and layer thickness to the separation properties i e permeance and selectivity of α al2o3 membrane on the basis of cake filtrated theory by integrating both the diffusive flows and convective furthermore we give a qualitative picture of the structure property relationship to dissect the restrictive relation between multilayer structures of asymmetric ceramic membrane and then present its permeability selectivity trade off rule that could serve as an excellent baseline for evaluating the design accuracy of ceramic membrane preparation 2 theoretical simulations the construction of ceramic membrane generally contains top separating layer intermediate layer and bottom supported layer fig 1 assuming that each layer with varying thicknesses is comprised of the spherical alumina particles with uniform sizes the size of deposited particle should be greater than the average pore size of support to decrease filtration resistance for achieving optimum separation performance as a result the microstructure of each layer of a ceramic membrane was controlled by varying particle size and layer thickness 2 1 simulation of the pure water permeance of ceramic membrane the key to evaluate the ceramic membrane performance is to quantify the mass of filtrated water i e permeance in this study each uncompressible layer of ceramic membrane is composed of spherical α alumina particles based on a sintering process and only point contacts exist between particles in adjacent layers tien and bai 2003 thus the bottom layer intermediate layer and top layer of ceramic membrane can be assumed as three independent cake layers consequently the water permeance of ceramic membrane can be obtained by using the cake filtration theory the total resistance r t of ceramic membrane is calculated by the sum of each resistance existed in bottom layer r 1 intermediate layer r 2 and top layer r 3 hence the permeate flux j can be formulated by darcy s law as follows 1 j δ p μ r t δ p μ r 1 r 2 r 3 where δ p represents the hydraulic pressure μ stands for the water viscosity 1 0 10 3 p a r 1 r 2 and r 3 denote the resistances obtained from bottom layer intermediate layer and top layer respectively generally the resistance of each layer is calculated in accordance with the corresponding specific resistance α and layer thickness l liu et al 2012 in addition considering the alumina particles would be deformed during the sintering procedure li et al 2006 thus the resistance of each layer of ceramic membrane r can be evaluated by the modified carman kozeny c k equation zhang et al 2013 2 r α l k 1 ε 2 d p 2 ε 2 l where α represents the corresponding specific resistance l denotes the layer thickness k is the empirical constant coefficient which is determined by particle shape and particle surface roughness hwang et al 2006 d p is the particle size that constituted each layer ε represents the porosity and can be estimated by the shortest distance between two neighbor particles d as follows 3 ε 1 1 ε 0 d p d p d 3 where ε 0 is the porosity of the most compact cake and its value generally ranged from 0 38 to 0 40 hwang et al 1998 the shortest distance between two neighboring particles d is calculated by force analysis in the following section 2 1 1 therefore the total water permeate flux can be formulated by combining eqs 1 3 as follows 4 j δ p μ α 1 l 1 α 2 l 2 α 3 l 3 where subscripts of 1 2 and 3 represent the bottom layer intermediate layer and top layer respectively 2 1 1 simplified static force analysis for neighboring alumina particles for ceramic membrane in the absence of external force the neighboring particles are static and fixed hence only the interparticle forces containing van der waals force fv and electrostatic force fe constrain the particle packing process thus the structure parameters of ceramic membrane would be calculated based on the static force analysis of interparticle force van der waals force the van der waals potential vv between two equal sized alumina particles with a diameter of d p can be given as follow 5 v v a h d p 12 d 1 c d λ ln 1 λ c d where a h denotes the hamaker constant λ represents the characteristic wavelength for the interaction which is identified as about 100 nm hwang et al 1998 in this work the alumina layer is so compact that the neighboring particles cannot slip or roll down randomly thereby the shortest distance between two equal sized particles d is much smaller than the particle diameter dp sonntag et al 1987 thus the constant c equals to 5 32 hwang et al 1998 and the van der waals force fv is formulated by differentiating v v in relation to d as follow 6 f v v v d a h d p 12 d 2 1 1 1 λ c d electrostatic force an appropriate assumption is that of constant charge on the alumina particle surface thus the potential between two equal sized particles can be expressed as follows 7 v e π e 0 e r d p ψ 2 ln 1 e x p κ d where e 0 represents absolute permittivity of free space 8 85 10 12 c 2 j 1 m 1 e r is the dielectric constant of the fluid among particles ψ is the stern potential and can be replaced by zeta potential ξ for most conditions κ represents the reciprocal of double layer thickness and can be calculated as follows hunter and chan 1987 8 κ e 2 n i 0 z i 2 e 0 e r k b t 1 2 where e denotes the electrical charge 1 6 10 19 c n i 0 and z i 2 are the number of ions per unit volume in the bulk solution and valence of ions of type i respectively k b denotes the boltzmann constant and t is the kelvin temperature then the electrostatic force can be obtained by differentiating eq 8 in relation to d 9 f e v e d π e 0 e r d p κ ψ 2 1 e x p κ d 1 1 thus the shortest gap between the adjacent particles d can be calculated by utilizing the static force balance under the pseudo steady state i e f v f e the parameter d will be used to calculate porosity ε in eq 3 and then the water permeate flux j and membrane average pore size rm are calculated using eqs 4 and 11 respectively it can be seen in eq 10 that the parameter d presents a negative correlation with fe hence the improvement of fe i e increasing the ionic strength or decreasing the ph huisman et al 1998 would lead to the reduction of d and thus affect the separation properties furthermore the membrane material properties i e particle size dp and surface charge ξ have a great influence on the parameters vv and ve based on eqs 5 and 7 which in turn affect the value of parameter d this model is therefore applicable to the membrane made of other types of materials 2 2 membrane average pore size the membrane average pore size r m can be obtained on the basic of guerout elford ferry equation jafari et al 2020 10 r m 2 9 1 75 ε a v 8 μ l j ε a v δ p where l is the thickness of ceramic membrane for the multilayer ceramic membrane the average porosity εav is regarded as an arithmetic mean of each layer porosity with following equation chen et al 2006 11 ε a v ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 3 where subscripts of 1 2 and 3 represent the bottom layer intermediate layer and top layer respectively 2 3 simulation of the solute rejection the solute rejection r can be given in accordance to the model of bowen and welfoot by considering the convective k c and diffusive k d flows blumenschein et al 2016 12 r 1 k c y φ 1 1 k c y φ e x p p e where y refers to the self defined dimensionless solute function φ is the partition coefficient and p e denotes the modified peclet number the calculations of these parameters are given as follows respectively 13 y k d d ℜ t v s 8 η r p 2 14 φ 1 λ 2 15 p e k c y r p 2 8 η k d d δ p where the factor d stands for the diffusion coefficient η describes the solvent viscosity ℜ denotes the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature in kelvin v s stands for the solute molar volume and r p means the radius of pore size based on the model of bowen et al 1997 the hindrance factors k c a n d k d are associated with to the ratio of solute radius to pore radius λ thus the hindrance factors can be expressed as 16 k c 2 φ 1 0 054 λ 0 988 λ 2 0 441 λ 3 17 k d 1 2 3 λ 1 154 λ 2 0 224 λ 3 it can be seen in eqs 10 17 that the solute rejection has a dependency on the ratio of solute radius to pore radius once the average pore size is fixed the solute rejection can be easily obtained furthermore the average pore size is intrinsic property of the membrane and is independent of the solute size therefore it is logical to use average pore size to describe the separation properties of ceramic membrane 2 4 upper bound tradeoff relationship the upper bound can be calculated in accordance to the permeance p and separation factor s both two parameters are given as follows mehta and zydney 2005 18 p j δ p 19 s 1 1 r in this study all the simulation works were carried out with a matlab software mathworks usa see section s1 in the supporting information to assure modest mechanical strength and permeability of ceramic membrane the range of thickness and pore size of bottom layer are generally 1 10 mm and 1 5 μm respectively das et al 2016 nishihora et al 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 model verification the simulated water permeance and average pore size as a function of the particle diameter and layer thickness are presented in fig 2 the simulated water permeance has a reasonable agreement with the experimental results obtained from literatures fig 2b see detailed data in table s2 of supporting information the discrepancy may be attributed to the non uniform size distribution of particles used for fabrication of ceramic membrane das and maiti 1999 as expected both water permeance and average pore size enhanced with increasing particle diameter fig 2a the reason is that larger particles would increase gap between neighboring particles i e larger d in eq 2 and thus resulting in an enhanced membrane porosity and a reduced mass transfer resistance liu et al 2012 in contrast increasing layer thickness from 1 mm to 9 mm facilitates a dramatic reduction of permeance from 36000 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 to 4000 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 but exhibits almost no impact on average pore size with about 1 2 μm fig 2b this interesting phenomenon is attributed to the fact that a remarkable increase in resistance at elevated layer thickness i e larger r 1 in eq 1 results in a decrease of permeance however layer thickness presents no significant influence on the membrane porosity on the strength of eq 2 as a result the average pore size changed slightly owing to the combined effect between increasing layer thickness i e larger l in eq 10 and decreasing permeance i e less j in eq 10 the contour plot map further confirms that the water permeance of ceramic membrane is influenced by the synergy of layer thickness and particle diameter whereas its average pore size is mainly dependent on particle diameter fig 2c d to maximize water permeance and narrow pore size the particle diameter of 3 μm and layer thickness of 1 mm were chose as structure controlled factors of bottom support layer to construct the double layer triple layer ceramic membrane in the following studies 3 2 assessing the separation properties in a double layer ceramic membrane ceramic membranes generally consist of a multilayer structure for enhancement of the solute rejection in this section we thus explore the separation properties of an asymmetric double layer ceramic membrane the impacts of top layer structure controlled parameters i e particle diameter and top layer thickness on the water permeance and average pore size of an asymmetric double layer ceramic membrane are illustrated in fig 3 consistent with expectations the water permeance and average pore size improved with the enhancement of particle diameter and the reduction of top layer thickness fig 3a and b as presented in fig 3c and d higher water permeance 1600 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and larger average pore size 0 35 μm can be attained at the right lower corner of the plot where particle diameter is larger than 1 8 μm and layer thickness is less than 8 μm moderately decreasing the particle diameter 1 6 μm and simultaneously increasing layer thickness 10 μm would generate the pronounced decreases of both water permeance 400 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and pore size 0 2 μm as shown in the higher left corner of the plot these results demonstrated that any slight variation of top layer structure would exhibit a marked impact on water permeance we further evaluate the role of bottom layer structure in determination of the overall properties of a double layer ceramic membrane unlike the monotonic trend observed in the top layer both water permeance and average pore size initially increased and then reached a plateau with increasing particle diameter fig 4 a increasing the layer thickness leads to a monotonic decrease of average pore size whereas to a dramatic reduction of water permeance after a stable stage fig 4b the plateau of water permeance and average pore size are attributed to the dominance of the top layer structure in overall performance of membrane in accordance to eqs 1 and 3 once the particle diameter that constitutes the bottom layer exceeds a certain value or bottom layer is below a certain thickness the resistance of bottom layer can be neglected compared to that of top layer i e r 1 r 3 thereby the water permeance will reach a plateau the average pore size also follows a similar trend based on eq 10 moreover the plateau of water permeance and average pore size depends strongly on the particle diameter and layer thickness respectively fig 4c d these observations indicated that once a microstructure of top layer is fixed there exists optimum particle size and layer thickness that constitute the bottom support layer to achieve maximum water permeance in other words blindly decreasing bottom layer thickness and enlarging particle diameter would not improve water permeance but impair the mechanical strength of ceramic membrane therefore we further assessed the variation of critical particle diameter that constitutes bottom layer with bottom layer thickness at different structure controlled factors of top layer fig 4e f it can be noted that the critical particle diameter enhanced with increasing layer thickness according to eq 2 the resistance is directly proportional to the layer thickness but varies inversely with the square of particle size thus increasing layer thickness results in an increase of the resistance while enhancing particle size decreases the resistance to maintain the optimum membrane permeance the resistance of bottom layer must be constant based on eq 1 hence increasing bottom layer thickness should be accompanied with an increment of particle size this formed matching line in fig 4e f represents critical values of particle diameter and layer thickness above this line the separation property of ceramic membrane could not be altered increasing particle diameter that constitutes top layer results in a shift of matching line towards upper direction fig 4e indicating better performance of the ceramic membrane by using larger particles to fabricate bottom support layer however the matching line shifts towards lower direction as increasing top layer thickness fig 4f demonstrating that smaller particles that constitute the bottom layer are preferred to match the thicker top active layer therefore the establishment of the matching relationship between top layer and bottom layer can guide the fabrication of excellent ceramic membranes to maximize the water permeance 3 3 assessing the separation properties in a triple layer ceramic membrane an additional dense and thin top layer deposited on a double layer ceramic membrane to form an asymmetrical triple layer structure which could significantly enhance solute rejection nevertheless the inherent matching relationship among each layer of a triple layer asymmetrical ceramic membrane is still unclear thus we systematically investigated the structure controlled factors influencing on the separation properties in a triple layer asymmetrical ceramic membrane fig 5 shows a dependency of separation properties on particle diameter and layer thickness in top layer while fixing intermediate layer and bottom layer microstructures continuous reduction of water permeance and average pore size were observed with increasing top layer thickness fig 5b as the increase of particle diameter the permeance and average pore size increased gradually and tend to approach the plateau eventually fig 5a such a trend is similar to the case in a double layer ceramic membrane fig 5a indicating also existence of a matching relationship between top layer and intermediate layer in a triple layer ceramic membrane the corresponding matching line of top layer structure shifts slightly outwards when the diameter of particle that constitutes intermediate layer increases from 1 7 μm to 2 5 μm fig 5c while it shifts inwards when the intermediate layer thickness increases from 10 μm to 20 μm fig 5d this matching line follows a similar trend with that observed in the double layer structure in fig 4e f these interesting observations indicate that the intermediate layer not only functions as a transition to preclude the fine powders from permeating through the support but also determines the design of bottom support layer and top selective layer for maximizing water permeance the average pore size of membrane is controlled by the dense layer surface while the water permeance is determined by the overall resistance of membrane liu et al 2021 majouli et al 2011 hence the microstructures of both intermediate and bottom layers principally influence on the water permeance the bottom layer thickness and the particle size of the intermediate layer were tailored to study their effect on water transport fig 6 the results showed that the water flow can be accelerated by increasing the particle size of the intermediate layer and decreasing the bottom layer thickness furthermore the intermediate layer presents a higher resistance to water transport than the bottom layer and therefore has a greater influence on water permeance it also can be seen that the structure of intermediated layer is of more significance on the water permeance due to its higher resistance in comparison with the bottom layer for instance with a fixed top layer the resistance of intermediate layer consisting of a particle size of 1 7 μm and a layer thickness of 10 μm 3 88 1 0 11 m 1 is much larger than that of bottom layer consisting of a particle size of 3 μm and a layer thickness of 1 mm 1 01 1 0 10 m 1 therefore a reasonable reduction in the resistance of intermediated layer benefits the enhancement of water permeance preparation of a thin and crack free intermediate layer on the bottom support is crucial to fully unleash optimal performance of ceramic membrane 4 implication the structure property relationship of ceramic membrane has been systematically discussed in current study however the use of any synthetic membrane generally suffers from a permeance selectivity trade off relation to explicitly discuss and address this challenge the inherent tradeoff relationship of α al2o3 ceramic membrane was established based on the proposed model as shown in fig 7 selectivity given as separation factor 1 1 r decreases dramatically with increasing water permeance i e increasing particle size that constitutes top layer at a fixed top layer thickness to verify the established tradeoff line the data of membrane pore size selected from previous studies are within the simulation conditions i e 0 1 0 2 μm it can be observed that all data points exhibit an intensity just below the established upper bound trade off line see detailed data in table s3 of supporting information this tradeoff is ascribed to the fact that on the basis of eqs 1 3 increasing particle size can intensify the porosity and reduce the total membrane resistance resulting in an enhancement of the permeance however an increment of particle size can increase the average pore size eq 10 and thus reduce the ratio of the solute radius to that of membrane pore λ implying the decrement of hindrance factors k c and k d eqs 15 and 17 on the other hand the distinction between mf uf and nanofiltration nf ceramic membrane is the types and sizes of prepared particles thus this developed model is also applicable to nf ceramic membrane due to the structural similarity to break through the trade off line the use of porous nanomaterials in the ceramic membrane is an effective way for improving both selectivity and permeance li et al 2020a park et al 2017 werber et al 2016 for example a zeolitic imidazolate framework zif 8 with narrow six membered ring pores was used to fabricate top separation layer allowing effective retention of hydrated ions while maintaining high water permeance bux et al 2009 ewis et al 2021 li et al 2020a 2018 zhu et al 2016 successfully prepared a composite ceramic membrane by immobilization of zif 8 into the separation layer with a high water permeance i e 10 8 kg m 2 h 1 and a high ion retention over 99 8 however the commercial applications still faced challenges of tedious production and long term instability owing to the presence of defects and low mechanical strength rojas and horcajada 2020 in addition to the development of advanced nanomaterials another feasible way to exceed the upper bound is the structural optimization of the ceramic membrane if the top layer is ideally uniform and dense a reduction in top layer thickness can effectively enhance permeance without sacrificing selectivity lau et al 2015 werber et al 2016 however with the decrease of top layer thickness the resulting mass loss of top layer after sintering process will become more serious in such case the solute selectivity would be easily sacrificed owing to the generated defect resulted from the weak adherence between bottom layer and top layer feng et al 2007 use of a thin and uniform intermediate layer between top layer and bottom layer can effectively mitigate this phenomenon kattula et al 2015 it has been proven that a high permeability interlayer for polymeric membrane can be sandwiched between the polyamide layer and the porous substrate to enhance the overall membrane properties due to the gutter effect sun et al 2021 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless most studies focus on how to design a thin and dense top layer whereas overlook the role of intermediate layer in the enhancement of ceramic membrane performance that has been confirmed in current study the structural optimization of intermediate layer thus should be explicitly considered in the future design of a triple layer ceramic membrane 5 conclusions a model on the basis of the cake filtrated theory was expanded to predict the structure property relationship of an asymmetric ceramic membrane which was verified by the experimental results obtained from literatures this modeling work demonstrates for the first time an existence of matching relationship between adjacent layers of ceramic membrane it means that when a microstructure of top layer is fixed in a double layer ceramic membrane there exist an optimum particle size and the corresponding layer thickness those constitute the support layer to achieve maximum water permeance the optimum particle diameter in the bottom layer increased with increasing the diameter of particle in the top layer or decreasing the thickness of top layer a similar trend of the matching relationship between top layer and intermediate layer in a triple layer ceramic membrane could also be observed confirming the critical role of intermediate layer in determining the design of bottom support layer and top selective layer furthermore an upper bound permeance selectivity tradeoff relationship of a α al2o3 membrane was established to unleash the potential of the use of porous nanomaterials and a defect free intermediate layer towards simultaneous enhancements in both water permeance and selectivity our work systematically dissects the inherent structure property relationship of ceramic membrane and provides significant guidance for its performance enhancement

distance between two equal sized particles d is much smaller than the particle diameter dp sonntag et al 1987 thus the constant c equals to 5 32 hwang et al 1998 and the van der waals force fv is formulated by differentiating v v in relation to d as follow 6 f v v v d a h d p 12 d 2 1 1 1 λ c d electrostatic force an appropriate assumption is that of constant charge on the alumina particle surface thus the potential between two equal sized particles can be expressed as follows 7 v e π e 0 e r d p ψ 2 ln 1 e x p κ d where e 0 represents absolute permittivity of free space 8 85 10 12 c 2 j 1 m 1 e r is the dielectric constant of the fluid among particles ψ is the stern potential and can be replaced by zeta potential ξ for most conditions κ represents the reciprocal of double layer thickness and can be calculated as follows hunter and chan 1987 8 κ e 2 n i 0 z i 2 e 0 e r k b t 1 2 where e denotes the electrical charge 1 6 10 19 c n i 0 and z i 2 are the number of ions per unit volume in the bulk solution and valence of ions of type i respectively k b denotes the boltzmann constant and t is the kelvin temperature then the electrostatic force can be obtained by differentiating eq 8 in relation to d 9 f e v e d π e 0 e r d p κ ψ 2 1 e x p κ d 1 1 thus the shortest gap between the adjacent particles d can be calculated by utilizing the static force balance under the pseudo steady state i e f v f e the parameter d will be used to calculate porosity ε in eq 3 and then the water permeate flux j and membrane average pore size rm are calculated using eqs 4 and 11 respectively it can be seen in eq 10 that the parameter d presents a negative correlation with fe hence the improvement of fe i e increasing the ionic strength or decreasing the ph huisman et al 1998 would lead to the reduction of d and thus affect the separation properties furthermore the membrane material properties i e particle size dp and surface charge ξ have a great influence on the parameters vv and ve based on eqs 5 and 7 which in turn affect the value of parameter d this model is therefore applicable to the membrane made of other types of materials 2 2 membrane average pore size the membrane average pore size r m can be obtained on the basic of guerout elford ferry equation jafari et al 2020 10 r m 2 9 1 75 ε a v 8 μ l j ε a v δ p where l is the thickness of ceramic membrane for the multilayer ceramic membrane the average porosity εav is regarded as an arithmetic mean of each layer porosity with following equation chen et al 2006 11 ε a v ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 3 where subscripts of 1 2 and 3 represent the bottom layer intermediate layer and top layer respectively 2 3 simulation of the solute rejection the solute rejection r can be given in accordance to the model of bowen and welfoot by considering the convective k c and diffusive k d flows blumenschein et al 2016 12 r 1 k c y φ 1 1 k c y φ e x p p e where y refers to the self defined dimensionless solute function φ is the partition coefficient and p e denotes the modified peclet number the calculations of these parameters are given as follows respectively 13 y k d d ℜ t v s 8 η r p 2 14 φ 1 λ 2 15 p e k c y r p 2 8 η k d d δ p where the factor d stands for the diffusion coefficient η describes the solvent viscosity ℜ denotes the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature in kelvin v s stands for the solute molar volume and r p means the radius of pore size based on the model of bowen et al 1997 the hindrance factors k c a n d k d are associated with to the ratio of solute radius to pore radius λ thus the hindrance factors can be expressed as 16 k c 2 φ 1 0 054 λ 0 988 λ 2 0 441 λ 3 17 k d 1 2 3 λ 1 154 λ 2 0 224 λ 3 it can be seen in eqs 10 17 that the solute rejection has a dependency on the ratio of solute radius to pore radius once the average pore size is fixed the solute rejection can be easily obtained furthermore the average pore size is intrinsic property of the membrane and is independent of the solute size therefore it is logical to use average pore size to describe the separation properties of ceramic membrane 2 4 upper bound tradeoff relationship the upper bound can be calculated in accordance to the permeance p and separation factor s both two parameters are given as follows mehta and zydney 2005 18 p j δ p 19 s 1 1 r in this study all the simulation works were carried out with a matlab software mathworks usa see section s1 in the supporting information to assure modest mechanical strength and permeability of ceramic membrane the range of thickness and pore size of bottom layer are generally 1 10 mm and 1 5 μm respectively das et al 2016 nishihora et al 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 model verification the simulated water permeance and average pore size as a function of the particle diameter and layer thickness are presented in fig 2 the simulated water permeance has a reasonable agreement with the experimental results obtained from literatures fig 2b see detailed data in table s2 of supporting information the discrepancy may be attributed to the non uniform size distribution of particles used for fabrication of ceramic membrane das and maiti 1999 as expected both water permeance and average pore size enhanced with increasing particle diameter fig 2a the reason is that larger particles would increase gap between neighboring particles i e larger d in eq 2 and thus resulting in an enhanced membrane porosity and a reduced mass transfer resistance liu et al 2012 in contrast increasing layer thickness from 1 mm to 9 mm facilitates a dramatic reduction of permeance from 36000 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 to 4000 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 but exhibits almost no impact on average pore size with about 1 2 μm fig 2b this interesting phenomenon is attributed to the fact that a remarkable increase in resistance at elevated layer thickness i e larger r 1 in eq 1 results in a decrease of permeance however layer thickness presents no significant influence on the membrane porosity on the strength of eq 2 as a result the average pore size changed slightly owing to the combined effect between increasing layer thickness i e larger l in eq 10 and decreasing permeance i e less j in eq 10 the contour plot map further confirms that the water permeance of ceramic membrane is influenced by the synergy of layer thickness and particle diameter whereas its average pore size is mainly dependent on particle diameter fig 2c d to maximize water permeance and narrow pore size the particle diameter of 3 μm and layer thickness of 1 mm were chose as structure controlled factors of bottom support layer to construct the double layer triple layer ceramic membrane in the following studies 3 2 assessing the separation properties in a double layer ceramic membrane ceramic membranes generally consist of a multilayer structure for enhancement of the solute rejection in this section we thus explore the separation properties of an asymmetric double layer ceramic membrane the impacts of top layer structure controlled parameters i e particle diameter and top layer thickness on the water permeance and average pore size of an asymmetric double layer ceramic membrane are illustrated in fig 3 consistent with expectations the water permeance and average pore size improved with the enhancement of particle diameter and the reduction of top layer thickness fig 3a and b as presented in fig 3c and d higher water permeance 1600 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and larger average pore size 0 35 μm can be attained at the right lower corner of the plot where particle diameter is larger than 1 8 μm and layer thickness is less than 8 μm moderately decreasing the particle diameter 1 6 μm and simultaneously increasing layer thickness 10 μm would generate the pronounced decreases of both water permeance 400 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and pore size 0 2 μm as shown in the higher left corner of the plot these results demonstrated that any slight variation of top layer structure would exhibit a marked impact on water permeance we further evaluate the role of bottom layer structure in determination of the overall properties of a double layer ceramic membrane unlike the monotonic trend observed in the top layer both water permeance and average pore size initially increased and then reached a plateau with increasing particle diameter fig 4 a increasing the layer thickness leads to a monotonic decrease of average pore size whereas to a dramatic reduction of water permeance after a stable stage fig 4b the plateau of water permeance and average pore size are attributed to the dominance of the top layer structure in overall performance of membrane in accordance to eqs 1 and 3 once the particle diameter that constitutes the bottom layer exceeds a certain value or bottom layer is below a certain thickness the resistance of bottom layer can be neglected compared to that of top layer i e r 1 r 3 thereby the water permeance will reach a plateau the average pore size also follows a similar trend based on eq 10 moreover the plateau of water permeance and average pore size depends strongly on the particle diameter and layer thickness respectively fig 4c d these observations indicated that once a microstructure of top layer is fixed there exists optimum particle size and layer thickness that constitute the bottom support layer to achieve maximum water permeance in other words blindly decreasing bottom layer thickness and enlarging particle diameter would not improve water permeance but impair the mechanical strength of ceramic membrane therefore we further assessed the variation of critical particle diameter that constitutes bottom layer with bottom layer thickness at different structure controlled factors of top layer fig 4e f it can be noted that the critical particle diameter enhanced with increasing layer thickness according to eq 2 the resistance is directly proportional to the layer thickness but varies inversely with the square of particle size thus increasing layer thickness results in an increase of the resistance while enhancing particle size decreases the resistance to maintain the optimum membrane permeance the resistance of bottom layer must be constant based on eq 1 hence increasing bottom layer thickness should be accompanied with an increment of particle size this formed matching line in fig 4e f represents critical values of particle diameter and layer thickness above this line the separation property of ceramic membrane could not be altered increasing particle diameter that constitutes top layer results in a shift of matching line towards upper direction fig 4e indicating better performance of the ceramic membrane by using larger particles to fabricate bottom support layer however the matching line shifts towards lower direction as increasing top layer thickness fig 4f demonstrating that smaller particles that constitute the bottom layer are preferred to match the thicker top active layer therefore the establishment of the matching relationship between top layer and bottom layer can guide the fabrication of excellent ceramic membranes to maximize the water permeance 3 3 assessing the separation properties in a triple layer ceramic membrane an additional dense and thin top layer deposited on a double layer ceramic membrane to form an asymmetrical triple layer structure which could significantly enhance solute rejection nevertheless the inherent matching relationship among each layer of a triple layer asymmetrical ceramic membrane is still unclear thus we systematically investigated the structure controlled factors influencing on the separation properties in a triple layer asymmetrical ceramic membrane fig 5 shows a dependency of separation properties on particle diameter and layer thickness in top layer while fixing intermediate layer and bottom layer microstructures continuous reduction of water permeance and average pore size were observed with increasing top layer thickness fig 5b as the increase of particle diameter the permeance and average pore size increased gradually and tend to approach the plateau eventually fig 5a such a trend is similar to the case in a double layer ceramic membrane fig 5a indicating also existence of a matching relationship between top layer and intermediate layer in a triple layer ceramic membrane the corresponding matching line of top layer structure shifts slightly outwards when the diameter of particle that constitutes intermediate layer increases from 1 7 μm to 2 5 μm fig 5c while it shifts inwards when the intermediate layer thickness increases from 10 μm to 20 μm fig 5d this matching line follows a similar trend with that observed in the double layer structure in fig 4e f these interesting observations indicate that the intermediate layer not only functions as a transition to preclude the fine powders from permeating through the support but also determines the design of bottom support layer and top selective layer for maximizing water permeance the average pore size of membrane is controlled by the dense layer surface while the water permeance is determined by the overall resistance of membrane liu et al 2021 majouli et al 2011 hence the microstructures of both intermediate and bottom layers principally influence on the water permeance the bottom layer thickness and the particle size of the intermediate layer were tailored to study their effect on water transport fig 6 the results showed that the water flow can be accelerated by increasing the particle size of the intermediate layer and decreasing the bottom layer thickness furthermore the intermediate layer presents a higher resistance to water transport than the bottom layer and therefore has a greater influence on water permeance it also can be seen that the structure of intermediated layer is of more significance on the water permeance due to its higher resistance in comparison with the bottom layer for instance with a fixed top layer the resistance of intermediate layer consisting of a particle size of 1 7 μm and a layer thickness of 10 μm 3 88 1 0 11 m 1 is much larger than that of bottom layer consisting of a particle size of 3 μm and a layer thickness of 1 mm 1 01 1 0 10 m 1 therefore a reasonable reduction in the resistance of intermediated layer benefits the enhancement of water permeance preparation of a thin and crack free intermediate layer on the bottom support is crucial to fully unleash optimal performance of ceramic membrane 4 implication the structure property relationship of ceramic membrane has been systematically discussed in current study however the use of any synthetic membrane generally suffers from a permeance selectivity trade off relation to explicitly discuss and address this challenge the inherent tradeoff relationship of α al2o3 ceramic membrane was established based on the proposed model as shown in fig 7 selectivity given as separation factor 1 1 r decreases dramatically with increasing water permeance i e increasing particle size that constitutes top layer at a fixed top layer thickness to verify the established tradeoff line the data of membrane pore size selected from previous studies are within the simulation conditions i e 0 1 0 2 μm it can be observed that all data points exhibit an intensity just below the established upper bound trade off line see detailed data in table s3 of supporting information this tradeoff is ascribed to the fact that on the basis of eqs 1 3 increasing particle size can intensify the porosity and reduce the total membrane resistance resulting in an enhancement of the permeance however an increment of particle size can increase the average pore size eq 10 and thus reduce the ratio of the solute radius to that of membrane pore λ implying the decrement of hindrance factors k c and k d eqs 15 and 17 on the other hand the distinction between mf uf and nanofiltration nf ceramic membrane is the types and sizes of prepared particles thus this developed model is also applicable to nf ceramic membrane due to the structural similarity to break through the trade off line the use of porous nanomaterials in the ceramic membrane is an effective way for improving both selectivity and permeance li et al 2020a park et al 2017 werber et al 2016 for example a zeolitic imidazolate framework zif 8 with narrow six membered ring pores was used to fabricate top separation layer allowing effective retention of hydrated ions while maintaining high water permeance bux et al 2009 ewis et al 2021 li et al 2020a 2018 zhu et al 2016 successfully prepared a composite ceramic membrane by immobilization of zif 8 into the separation layer with a high water permeance i e 10 8 kg m 2 h 1 and a high ion retention over 99 8 however the commercial applications still faced challenges of tedious production and long term instability owing to the presence of defects and low mechanical strength rojas and horcajada 2020 in addition to the development of advanced nanomaterials another feasible way to exceed the upper bound is the structural optimization of the ceramic membrane if the top layer is ideally uniform and dense a reduction in top layer thickness can effectively enhance permeance without sacrificing selectivity lau et al 2015 werber et al 2016 however with the decrease of top layer thickness the resulting mass loss of top layer after sintering process will become more serious in such case the solute selectivity would be easily sacrificed owing to the generated defect resulted from the weak adherence between bottom layer and top layer feng et al 2007 use of a thin and uniform intermediate layer between top layer and bottom layer can effectively mitigate this phenomenon kattula et al 2015 it has been proven that a high permeability interlayer for polymeric membrane can be sandwiched between the polyamide layer and the porous substrate to enhance the overall membrane properties due to the gutter effect sun et al 2021 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless most studies focus on how to design a thin and dense top layer whereas overlook the role of intermediate layer in the enhancement of ceramic membrane performance that has been confirmed in current study the structural optimization of intermediate layer thus should be explicitly considered in the future design of a triple layer ceramic membrane 5 conclusions a model on the basis of the cake filtrated theory was expanded to predict the structure property relationship of an asymmetric ceramic membrane which was verified by the experimental results obtained from literatures this modeling work demonstrates for the first time an existence of matching relationship between adjacent layers of ceramic membrane it means that when a microstructure of top layer is fixed in a double layer ceramic membrane there exist an optimum particle size and the corresponding layer thickness those constitute the support layer to achieve maximum water permeance the optimum particle diameter in the bottom layer increased with increasing the diameter of particle in the top layer or decreasing the thickness of top layer a similar trend of the matching relationship between top layer and intermediate layer in a triple layer ceramic membrane could also be observed confirming the critical role of intermediate layer in determining the design of bottom support layer and top selective layer furthermore an upper bound permeance selectivity tradeoff relationship of a α al2o3 membrane was established to unleash the potential of the use of porous nanomaterials and a defect free intermediate layer towards simultaneous enhancements in both water permeance and selectivity our work systematically dissects the inherent structure property relationship of ceramic membrane and provides significant guidance for its performance enhancement

15831,elemental sulfur s0 based autotrophic denitrification sad has gained intensive attention in the treatment of secondary effluent for its low cost high efficiency and good stability however in practice the supplementary addition of limestone is necessary to balance the alkalinity consumption during sad operation which increases water hardness and reduces the effective reaction volume in this study a coupled sulfur and electrode driven autotrophic denitrification sead process was proposed with superior nitrate removal performance less accumulation of sulfate and self balance of acidity alkalinity capacity by regulating the applied voltage the dual channel electron supply from s0 and electrodes made the nitrate removal rate constant k in the sead process 3 7 5 1 and 1 4 3 5 times higher than that of the single electrode and sulfur driven systems respectively the s contributed to 75 3 83 1 of nitrate removal and the sulfate yield during sead 5 67 6 26 mg so4 2 mg no3 n was decreased by 17 25 compared with sad the s0 particle and electrode both as active bio carriers constructed collaborative denitrification communities and functional genes pseudomonas ralstonia and brevundimonas were the dominant denitrifying genera in s0 particle biofilm while pseudomonas chryseobacterium pantoea and comamonas became dominant denitrifying genera in the cathode biofilm the narg z h y i v nxra b napa b nirs k norb c and nosz were potential functional genes for efficient nitrate reduction during the sead process metagenomic sequencing indicated that s0 as an electron donor has greater potential for complete denitrification than the electrode these findings revealed the potential of sead for acting as a highly efficient post denitrification process image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment sulfur autotrophic denitrification electrode microbial community structure denitrification metabolic process metagenomics 1 introduction nitrate no3 the most stable nitrogen species in the aerobic environment is a ubiquitous contaminant in the aquatic environment which is the main cause of eutrophication and imposes severe threats to public health ward et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluents are an important source of nitrate pollution in the aquatic environment carrey et al 2021 therefore nitrogen discharge standards for wwtps are becoming more stringent hendriks and langeveld 2017 conventionally heterotrophic denitrification is widely adopted to further remove residual nitrate from the effluent of secondary treatment facilities liu et al 2021 however this process requires the dosing of organic carbon which not only increases the operation cost and the complexity of the control system but also raises the risks of secondary pollution huang et al 2019 in this context autotrophic denitrification driven by inorganic electron donors is more favored attempts have been made to employ various electron rich compounds e g hydrogen gas h2 sulfides or reduced iron species as electron donors to drive autotrophic denitrification di capua et al 2019 among a variety of inorganic electron donors elemental sulfur s0 is of particular interest because of its low cost high efficiency good stability in water and good biocompatibility di capua et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the empirical equation represents the s0 based autotrophic denitrification sad process is shown in eq 1 1 55 s 50 no 3 38 h 2 o 20 c o 2 4 nh 4 4 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 25 n 2 55 so 4 2 64 h as depicted in eq 1 there are two drawbacks of the sad process one is the generation of sulfate and the other is the production of protons according to the stoichiometry of sad eq 1 the reduction of every 1 mg no3 n consumes 4 57 mg alkalinity and generates 7 54 mg sulfate sahinkaya et al 2014 to cope with these drawbacks in practice limestone is often employed in the sad system to buffer the ph di capua et al 2019 currently the sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification slad system has been used to enhance nitrate removal from secondary effluent li et al 2020 however the limestone supplementation increases the hardness of the treated water li et al 2016b in addition limestone does not participate in the denitrification process as an electron donor which makes the limestone occupied volume inactive and consequently reduces the volumetric nitrate removal capacity of the reactor zhu et al 2019 alternatively electrode driven denitrification employing electrodes as an electron donor by bioelectrochemical systems bess has emerged as another feasible approach for nitrate removal wang et al 2015 in principle denitrification can be achieved on the surface of bes biocathode either directly by continuously supplied electrons from the external circuit or by h2 produced via the electrolysis of water ding et al 2018 which are described as follow 2 2 no 3 6 h 5 e 0 5 n 2 3 h 2 o 3 2 h 2 e h 2 4 2 no 3 5 h 2 5 04 h 0 16 nh 4 0 8 c o 2 0 16 c 5 h 7 o 2 n n 2 7 28 h 2 o interestingly as shown in eqs 2 4 the bes based denitrification is a proton consuming process if we integrate the bes with the sad it would be possible to mitigate the proton production i e acidity increase in the sad process and thus buffer the ph to facilitate microbial growth wang et al 2019 in this way the use of limestone can be omitted and the problems associated with the limestone dosage are avoided another expected advantage is less sulfate production as part of the nitrate removal will proceed via the electrode driven denitrification route in previous studies combining the sad process with hydrogenotrophic denitrification processes based on abiotic water electrolysis has shown effectiveness in ph buffering and reducing sulfate production wang et al 2019 wang and qu 2003 however a high external voltage range 1 8 3 5 v was required to drive abiotic water electrolysis which is significantly higher than hydrogen generation at bes biocathode 0 2 0 8 v and regarded as resource over consumption katuri et al 2019 hence bes biocathode held the possibility to serve as a sustainable and energy conserving wayout to enhance the sad process in this study a coupled sulfur and electrode driven autotrophic denitrification sead process was developed in an s0 particle filled bes biocathode the denitrification performance in the sead process was studied under the varied applied voltage and compared with the sad and the bes systems in terms of nitrate removal rate n intermediates distribution and ph variation the roles and fate of sulfur in the sead process were analyzed by examining the sulfur mass balance the 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing were employed to reveal the composition and distribution of denitrifying bacteria and key functional genes and the denitrification metabolism process in the sead process in summary our work opens an appealing avenue for enhanced nitrate removal from secondary effluent with superior performance the self balance of acidity alkalinity capacity and less accumulation of sulfate 2 materials and methods 2 1 system construction a schematic diagram of the sead system is shown in fig s1 typically each reactor consisted of two chambers with an identical effective volume of 70 ml which were separated by a cation exchange membrane cem ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international u s two circular carbon cloths 5 cm in diameter were connected in parallel to serve as the cathode while graphite fiber brushes 3 cm in both diameter and length toho tenax co ltd japan were employed as the

activity were obtained subsequently the performance of the reactors was investigated at varied voltages 0 3 v 0 5 v and 0 7 v to demonstrate the synergy between the sad and the bes in the sead system the following control experiments were performed in i bes systems where the constant voltage was applied in parallel and without s0 particle addition ii sad systems where s0 particles were added and

achieving the detection limit of 0 05 ppm for n2o the morphology of the biofilm attached to electrodes and s0 particles was characterized using ultra high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su8010 hitachi japan the pretreatment protocol of biofilm morphology analysis was described previously huang et al 2018 electron balances of s0 oxidation and nitrate reduction were conducted by assuming s0 transforming to so4 2 6 electrons donated for each s and s2o3 2 2 electrons donated for each s and nitrate transforming to no2 2 electrons accepted for each n and n2 5

majorbio com 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of nitrate removal as shown in fig 1 and table 1 the nitrate removal in sad bes and sead processes fit well with the first order kinetics r2 0

sead process were 3 7 5 1 times that of the bes operated at the same voltage and were 1 4 3 5 times that of the sad system operated with the same amount of s0 particles revealing the significant synergy in the sead process further the varied applied voltage significantly affected the nitrate removal performance in the sead process fig 1 and table 1 with the increase of applied voltage the nitrate removal efficiency of the sead and bes process also increased the current of the sead process exhibited similar trends at the voltages of 0 3 v 0 5 v and 0 7 v the currents started at the relatively high levels of 1 23 1 59 and 2 13 ma and tended to be stable around 0 16 0 23 and 0 18 ma after 24 h respectively fig s2 it was speculated that the metabolic activity of electroactive microorganisms decreased as the nitrate concentration decreased resulting in a decrease in the current su et al 2019 in principle the higher the applied voltage the higher the electron supply rate of the cathode which contributes to the improvement of nitrate removal efficiency kondaveeti and min 2013 zhang et al 2014 in addition with the increase of applied voltage in the sead process the increase in h consumption rate of the cathode enhanced the ph buffering capacity of the system which might be another promoting factor for nitrate removal 3 2 change of ph value and accumulation of denitrification intermediates as shown in fig 2 a the ph of the sad system decreased from 7 36 to 6 38 within 12 h due to the generation of protons sahinkaya et al 2014 in the bes biocathode system the acidity would be consumed in the process of electrode driven denitrification cheng et al 2012 which caused the ph increase of the bes catholyte it was obvious that the ph fluctuation of the sead process was smaller than those of the sad and bes processes indicating the capability of the sead process in buffering the ph in particular the applied voltage of 0 5 v achieved a ph change of less than 5 and a nitrate removal rate of 82 7 within 4 h k of 0 512 0 052 h 1 which was considered to be the optimal voltage taking into account nitrate removal ph buffering and energy consumption fig 2a and table 1 nitrite no2 n is a key intermediate product in the biological denitrification process and its concentration showed a similar trend of first increasing and then decreasing in all three systems fig 2b however the maximum concentration and the retention time of nitrite were significantly different specifically the peak nitrite concentration in the bes process was 1 35 1 72 times that of the sead process operated at the same applied voltage and the peak concentration of nitrite occurred later in the bes process than in the sead process in comparison the peak concentration of nitrite in the sad process was higher than that in the sead process due to the ph drop qian et al 2019 it has been reported that sufficient electron donors for denitrification can reduce the accumulation of nitrite pan et al 2013 therefore the sead process could lease the accumulation of nitrite during denitrification which might be ascribed to the dual channel electron supply from both the s0 and the electrodes as well as the suitable ph value in the sead process in addition for sead and bes systems as the applied voltage increased the peak value of nitrite accumulation tended to decrease which can be explained by that the increased applied voltage enhanced the dissimilatory nitrite reduction kondaveeti and min 2013 zhang et al 2014 as shown in fig s3 compared with the bes process with the same voltage the accumulation concentration of n2o in the sead process was reduced by 10 5 12 8 in addition the accumulation of n2o in the sead process was also lower than that in the sad process although the greenhouse gas n2o exerts 6 0 of global warming denitrification is the sole sink that removes n2o from the biosphere shao et al 2022 therefore a stronger ability of the sead process to convert n2o to n2 is beneficial to reducing n2o driven greenhouse warming 3 3 sulfate production the sulfate production rate during nitrate removal in the sead process 5 67 6 26 mg so4 2 mg no3 n was less than that in the sad system 7 61 mg so4 2 mg no3 n fig 3 the sulfate production in the sad was close to the theoretical value of 7 54 mg so4 2 mg no3 n sahinkaya et al 2014 it was shown that the sead process could decrease sulfate production during nitrate removal which was beneficial to control the sulfate discharge this was possibly attributed to the fact that part of the nitrate removal did not proceed via the sad pathway generally the nitrate concentration in secondary effluents of domestic wwtps would not exceed 30 mg l ma et al 2020 correspondingly it can be calculated that the maximum sulfate production in the sead process for the treatment of secondary effluent will be 187 8 mg l which is even lower than the 250 mg l limits for sulfate in drinking water zhu et al 2019 therefore the sulfate generated in the sead process for enhanced nitrate removal from secondary effluent would not interfere with its reuse and compliance discharge the re addition amount of s can be determined according to the consumption of elemental sulfur which is calculated as ms q t c β where q indicates the amount of wastewater treated in the reactor per day m3 d t indicates the continuous operation time d c indicates the no3 n concentration difference between the influent and effluent mg l β indicates a stoichiometric coefficient of 2 5 a maximum of 2 5 g s0 is required to fully convert 1 g no3 n to n2 here electron balances were conducted to better understand the sulfur transformation and sead working mechanism huang et al 2018 in the sead process s0 was still the main source of electrons for denitrification at the voltages of 0 3 v 0 5 v and 0 7 v accounting for 83 1 79 2 and 75 3 of the electrons consumed in the denitrification process therefore it could be concluded that the cathode was an auxiliary electron donor for the denitrification process and the contribution of the cathode to denitrification increased with the increase of the applied voltage it was worth mentioning that no noteworthy sulfide 1 mg l production was observed in the sead process at all three tested voltages within 12 h while the nitrate removal efficiency could reach 93 9 100 table 1 and fig s4 in principle the h2 threshold concentration δg0 value and redox potential of nitrate reduction no3 n2 were 0 05 nm 240 kj mol and 0 79 v respectively correspondingly the h2 threshold concentration δg0 value and redox potential of sulfate reduction so4 2 hs were 1 15 nm 38 kj mol and 0 22 v respectively löffler et al 1999 those data demonstrate that in comparison with sulfate reduction the denitrification process is more thermodynamically favorable carlson et al 2015 therefore the sead process has excellent selectivity towards avoiding the generation of toxic intermediate sulfur metabolites 3 4 microbial community structure and function in the sead process the sem images reveal that biofilms were formed on the surfaces of the cathode and s0 particles in the sead process fig s5 the cathode continuously supplied electrons to the microbes resulting in the enrichment of microorganisms on its surface fig s5 a the sad microbes used s0 as an electron donor for denitrification resulting in obvious depressions and erosion voids on the surface of sulfur particles fig s5 b the 16s rrna gene based illumina miseq sequencing was adopted to further study the bacterial community structures in the sead process detailed information on the dominating phyla and classes was illustrated in supplementary data fig s6 which demonstrated the spatial variation of the microbial composition within the sead process at the genus level the dominant bacteria in s0 particle and cathode biofilms were derived from the anaerobic sludge of wastewater treatment plants which have been reported to perform denitrification processes in previous studies on wastewater table s2 the abundance of pseudomonas in the sulfur particle biofilm 15 59 was significantly higher than that in the cathode biofilm 6 72 fig 4 pseudomonas is a common facultative denitrifying bacteria which can use both organic electron donors and inorganic electron donors e g elemental sulfur reduced sulfur compounds and reduced iron compounds chen et al 2013 di capua et al 2019 pokorna and zabranska 2015 in addition pseudomonas was confirmed to be able to perform denitrification in the cathode and the efficient denitrification performance was achieved by inoculating its pure bacteria or enrichment solution zhang et al 2014 therefore it can be inferred that pseudomonas could be possibly the major functional genus in the sead process ralstonia was reported to possess the function of autotrophic denitrification cramm 2009 downing and nerenberg 2007 and its abundance in sulfur particle biofilm 8 93 was higher than that in cathode biofilms 2 93 and the suspended biomass 0 31 in addition both desulfovibrio and brevundimonas were identified denitrifiers dalsgaard and bak 1994 khanongnuch et al 2019 and their relative abundance in the sulfur particle biofilm 2 25 and 2 46 was higher than both the cathode biofilms 1 18 and 0 73 and the suspended biomass 1 63 and 0 69 compared to the sulfur particle biofilm and the suspended biomass more chryseobacterium 8 62 pantoea 7 17 comamonas 3 22 achromobacter 3 59 asaia 4 10 mesorhizobium 3 20 and acinetobacter 2 38 were enriched in the cathode biofilm chryseobacterium can use nitrate as the final electron acceptor for metabolism and be also previously found to be significantly enriched in various biocathodes park et al 2006 park and lee 2019 zhu et al 2017 pantoea sp was previously found to be the most abundant functional bacteria in the electrode biofilm of a denitrifying bes reactor chun et al 2012 comamonas are species of electroactive denitrifying bacteria and the efficient denitrification efficiency of comamonas denitrificans using an electrode as electron donors has been confirmed by pure culture experiment xing et al 2010 achromobacter is a common denitrifying bacterium and its obvious enrichment at the biocathode was also reported in a previous study su et al 2018 the enrichment of mesorhizobium was also found in the electrode biofilm in the case of nitrate containing groundwater treatment by bes biocathode nguyen et al 2016 acinetobacter is capable of denitrification which has been reported to be able to obtain electrons from the electrode and was the dominant bacteria on the carbon fiber cathode of two compartment bes rabaey et al 2008 rosenbaum et al 2011 3 5 key functional genes and metabolic pathways metagenomic sequencing was further performed to elucidate the genomic potential for the metabolism of the microbial consortium in cathode biofilms and sulfur particle biofilms the relative abundance of functional genes affiliated with four kegg level 2 categories including energy metabolism carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites showed the same trend among the cathode biofilm and sulfur particle biofilm fig 5 a at kegg level 3 oxidative phosphorylation carbon fixation nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism were the abundant functional pathways affiliated to energy metabolism which played important roles in autotrophic denitrification further kegg annotation indicates that nitrate reductase e c 1 7 99 and 1 9 6 1 nitrite reductase e c 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 4 encoded by corresponding functional genes were involved in denitrification metabolism in the sulfur electrode autotrophic denitrification system fig 5b for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite various nitrogen metabolic genes with a high abundance were detected including narg z h y i v nxra b and napa b fig 5c it was noteworthy that the abundance of napa and napb in cathode biofilm was 2 11 and 6 07 times that in s0 particle biofilm the cytochrome nitrate reductase napa and napb were also electron transfer subunits which were critical to the denitrification process of electroactive biofilms delgado et al 2019 li et al 2016a nirs and nirk were two key functional genes in nitrite reduction and the activity nirs gene was not affected by ph but that of the nirk gene was huang et al 2019 therefore the acidic microzones on the surface of sulfur particles resulted in the abundance of nirk gene in s0 particle biofilm only being 31 8 of that in cathode biofilm while the abundance of nirs in sulfur particle biofilm was 39 9 higher than that in cathode biofilm fig 5c it was reported that nirs and nirk could substitute each other xu et al 2020 which might be a possible mechanism for the enhanced denitrification of the sead process it was particularly worth mentioning that sulfur particle biofilm enriched a higher abundance of norb norc and nosz genes than cathode biofilm which was consistent with the fact that the sad process achieved higher nitrate removal efficiency than the bes process fig 1 and table 1 the results indicated that elemental sulfur as an electron donor has greater potential for complete denitrification than the electrode 3 6 a concept model for the working mechanism in the sead process based on the performance and the corresponding microbial information the working mechanism of nitrate removal by coupling sulfur driven and electrode driven autotrophic denitrification during the sead process was proposed as shown in fig 6 the dual channel electron supply from s0 and electrodes accelerated the denitrification process the sad process contributed 75 3 83 1 of nitrate removal in the sead process while the cathode was an auxiliary electron donor the lower sulfate yield of the sead than the sad process was ascribed to the electrode driven autotrophic denitrification besides the s0 particle and electrode both acted as biological carriers for denitrifying bacteria which contributed to the formation of the collaborative denitrification communities and functional genes on the sulfur particle and cathode the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas ralstonia and brevundimonas etc that use elemental sulfur as an electron donor were selectively enriched in the sulfur particle biofilms the cathode biofilm was dominated by electroactive denitrifying bacteria such as pseudomonas chryseobacterium and comamonas the enrichment of genes for nitrate reductase e c 1 7 99 and 1 9 6 1 nitrite reductase e c 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 4 in cathode biofilm and sulfur particle biofilm supported the denitrification function of the sead process in addition the h generated during the sad process could be consumed by the biocathode and improve the metabolic activity of the biocathode liu et al 2019 logan et al 2008 the stable ph of the sead process could be conveniently realized by regulating the applied voltage instead of supplying limestone which increased the volumetric nitrate removal capacity of the reactor zhu et al 2019 therefore the multi pathway synergistic effects between sulfur autotrophic denitrification and biocathode denitrification enhanced the nitrate removal from wastewater in practical application electrode modules can be implanted into conventional sad biofilter to form sead biofilter and the s0 re addition can be conducted with reference to the sad biofilter wang et al 2021 the biofilm growing on the s0 beads might contribute to the bed clogging of the sead biofilter which may be resolved by a reasonable backwash operation wang et al 2021 the main technical challenge for scaling up the sead process is the requirement for a high electrode packing density while increasing the capacity of the sad reaction zone to maximize the denitrification performance to prevent the decay of the volumetric power densities a large specific surface area of the electrode should be maintained during the sead process from the lab to the pilot scale further research on electrode modification electrode module design power management system and reactor configuration is needed in addition the sead process needs to be demonstrated in treating real wastewater at a pilot scale and shows sufficient nitrate removal performance to provide a way forward for the implementation of the process therefore the operating parameters e g reaction time applied voltage s0 particle size backwash strategy and filler replacement of the pilot scale sead process should be investigated further conducting the economical assessment of continuously operating sead biofilter is meaningful for promoting the sead process the sead process may be economically feasible in operation by reducing the operational cost including the s consumption fee sludge treatment fee electricity fee etc of a scaled up sead biofilter through rational design and optimization 4 conclusions a novel sead process was proposed with superior nitrate removal performance less accumulation of sulfate and self balance of acidity alkalinity capacity by regulating the applied voltage the dual channel electron supply from s0 and electrodes made the nitrate removal rate constant k in the sead process 3 7 5 1 and 1 4 3 5 times higher than that of the single electrode and sulfur driven systems respectively the s contributed to 75 3 83 1 of nitrate removal and the sulfate yield during sead 5 67 6 26 mg so4 2 mg no3 n was decreased by 17 25 compared with sad the s0 particle and electrode both as active bio carriers constructed collaborative denitrification communities and functional genes pseudomonas ralstonia and brevundimonas were the dominant denitrifying genera in s0 particle biofilm while pseudomonas chryseobacterium pantoea and comamonas became the dominant denitrifying genera in the cathode biofilm the narg z h y i v nxra b napa b nirs k norb c and nosz were potential functional genes for efficient nitrate reduction during the sead process metagenomic sequencing indicated s0 as an electron donor has greater potential for complete denitrification than the electrode declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15831,elemental sulfur s0 based autotrophic denitrification sad has gained intensive attention in the treatment of secondary effluent for its low cost high efficiency and good stability however in practice the supplementary addition of limestone is necessary to balance the alkalinity consumption during sad operation which increases water hardness and reduces the effective reaction volume in this study a coupled sulfur and electrode driven autotrophic denitrification sead process was proposed with superior nitrate removal performance less accumulation of sulfate and self balance of acidity alkalinity capacity by regulating the applied voltage the dual channel electron supply from s0 and electrodes made the nitrate removal rate constant k in the sead process 3 7 5 1 and 1 4 3 5 times higher than that of the single electrode and sulfur driven systems respectively the s contributed to 75 3 83 1 of nitrate removal and the sulfate yield during sead 5 67 6 26 mg so4 2 mg no3 n was decreased by 17 25 compared with sad the s0 particle and electrode both as active bio carriers constructed collaborative denitrification communities and functional genes pseudomonas ralstonia and brevundimonas were the dominant denitrifying genera in s0 particle biofilm while pseudomonas chryseobacterium pantoea and comamonas became dominant denitrifying genera in the cathode biofilm the narg z h y i v nxra b napa b nirs k norb c and nosz were potential functional genes for efficient nitrate reduction during the sead process metagenomic sequencing indicated that s0 as an electron donor has greater potential for complete denitrification than the electrode these findings revealed the potential of sead for acting as a highly efficient post denitrification process image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment sulfur autotrophic denitrification electrode microbial community structure denitrification metabolic process metagenomics 1 introduction nitrate no3 the most stable nitrogen species in the aerobic environment is a ubiquitous contaminant in the aquatic environment which is the main cause of eutrophication and imposes severe threats to public health ward et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluents are an important source of nitrate pollution in the aquatic environment carrey et al 2021 therefore nitrogen discharge standards for wwtps are becoming more stringent hendriks and langeveld 2017 conventionally heterotrophic denitrification is widely adopted to further remove residual nitrate from the effluent of secondary treatment facilities liu et al 2021 however this process requires the dosing of organic carbon which not only increases the operation cost and the complexity of the control system but also raises the risks of secondary pollution huang et al 2019 in this context autotrophic denitrification driven by inorganic electron donors is more favored attempts have been made to employ various electron rich compounds e g hydrogen gas h2 sulfides or reduced iron species as electron donors to drive autotrophic denitrification di capua et al 2019 among a variety of inorganic electron donors elemental sulfur s0 is of particular interest because of its low cost high efficiency good stability in water and good biocompatibility di capua et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the empirical equation represents the s0 based autotrophic denitrification sad process is shown in eq 1 1 55 s 50 no 3 38 h 2 o 20 c o 2 4 nh 4 4 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 25 n 2 55 so 4 2 64 h as depicted in eq 1 there are two drawbacks of the sad process one is the generation of sulfate and the other is the production of protons according to the stoichiometry of sad eq 1 the reduction of every 1 mg no3 n consumes 4 57 mg alkalinity and generates 7 54 mg sulfate sahinkaya et al 2014 to cope with these drawbacks in practice limestone is often employed in the sad system to buffer the ph di capua et al 2019 currently the sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification slad system has been used to enhance nitrate removal from secondary effluent li et al 2020 however the limestone supplementation increases the hardness of the treated water li et al 2016b in addition limestone does not participate in the denitrification process as an electron donor which makes the limestone occupied volume inactive and consequently reduces the volumetric nitrate removal capacity of the reactor zhu et al 2019 alternatively electrode driven denitrification employing electrodes as an electron donor by bioelectrochemical systems bess has emerged as another feasible approach for nitrate removal wang et al 2015 in principle denitrification can be achieved on the surface of bes biocathode either directly by continuously supplied electrons from the external circuit or by h2 produced via the electrolysis of water ding et al 2018 which are described as follow 2 2 no 3 6 h 5 e 0 5 n 2 3 h 2 o 3 2 h 2 e h 2 4 2 no 3 5 h 2 5 04 h 0 16 nh 4 0 8 c o 2 0 16 c 5 h 7 o 2 n n 2 7 28 h 2 o interestingly as shown in eqs 2 4 the bes based denitrification is a proton consuming process if we integrate the bes with the sad it would be possible to mitigate the proton production i e acidity increase in the sad process and thus buffer the ph to facilitate microbial growth wang et al 2019 in this way the use of limestone can be omitted and the problems associated with the limestone dosage are avoided another expected advantage is less sulfate production as part of the nitrate removal will proceed via the electrode driven denitrification route in previous studies combining the sad process with hydrogenotrophic denitrification processes based on abiotic water electrolysis has shown effectiveness in ph buffering and reducing sulfate production wang et al 2019 wang and qu 2003 however a high external voltage range 1 8 3 5 v was required to drive abiotic water electrolysis which is significantly higher than hydrogen generation at bes biocathode 0 2 0 8 v and regarded as resource over consumption katuri et al 2019 hence bes biocathode held the possibility to serve as a sustainable and energy conserving wayout to enhance the sad process in this study a coupled sulfur and electrode driven autotrophic denitrification sead process was developed in an s0 particle filled bes biocathode the denitrification performance in the sead process was studied under the varied applied voltage and compared with the sad and the bes systems in terms of nitrate removal rate n intermediates distribution and ph variation the roles and fate of sulfur in the sead process were analyzed by examining the sulfur mass balance the 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing were employed to reveal the composition and distribution of denitrifying bacteria and key functional genes and the denitrification metabolism process in the sead process in summary our work opens an appealing avenue for enhanced nitrate removal from secondary effluent with superior performance the self balance of acidity alkalinity capacity and less accumulation of sulfate 2 materials and methods 2 1 system construction a schematic diagram of the sead system is shown in fig s1 typically each reactor consisted of two chambers with an identical effective volume of 70 ml which were separated by a cation exchange membrane cem ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international u s two circular carbon cloths 5 cm in diameter were connected in parallel to serve as the cathode while graphite fiber brushes 3 cm in both diameter and length toho tenax co ltd japan were employed as the anode the detailed pretreatment process of electrode material was described in a previous study chen et al 2019a the interval between two carbon cloths in the cathode chamber was filled with elemental sulfur s0 particles 0 3 0 8 cm in diameter 99 purity sinopec co ltd china to a porosity of 37 the cathode and s0 particles were separated by a porous silicone sheet to prevent any possible cathodic reduction of s0 as depicted in eq 1 a maximum of 2 5 g s0 is required to fully convert 1 g no3 n to n2 and the theoretical mass of s consumed for completely removing nitrate in the cathode chamber was 3 9 mg the mass of s0 added in the cathode compartment could be calculated as follows 70 ml 63 2 07 g cm3 91 3 g which can drive the reactor to carry out more than 20 000 batches 91 3 g 3 9 mg a

to current according to ohm law all potentials were reported to a standard hydrogen electrode she 2 2 system acclimation and operation both chambers of the sead system were inoculated with 10 ml anaerobic activated sludge taiping wastewater treatment plant harbin china before inoculation the sludge was sparged with nitrogen gas overnight and kept in a sealed plastic bucket for three days the applied nitrate concentration was 60 mg no3 n l and the catholyte contained kno3 434 mg l nahco3 200 mg l na2hpo4 12h2o 10 mg l wolfe vitamin solution 1 ml l and wolfe trace element solution 0 5 ml l the detailed compositions of wolfe s mineral and vitamin solution were shown in table s1 the initial catholyte ph was adjusted to 7 2 0 2 by adding 1 mol l hcl or 1 mol l naoh solution the anolyte contained sodium acetate 0 82 g l phosphate buffered saline pbs 5 mm ph 7 wolfe vitamin solution 1 ml l and wolfe trace element solution 0 5 ml l all reactors were acclimated with a constant applied voltage of 0 3 v and the reaction solution was replaced every 72 h in the acclimation phase the reactors were considered to be successfully started up until the stable current and denitrification activity were obtained subsequently the performance of the reactors was investigated at varied voltages 0 3 v 0 5 v and 0 7 v to demonstrate the synergy between the sad and the bes in the sead system the following control experiments were performed in i bes systems where the constant voltage was applied in parallel and without s0 particle addition ii sad systems where s0 particles were added and without power supply all experiments under different conditions were performed in triplicate at an ambient temperature of 25 3 c 2 3 analytical methods and calculations the concentrations of nitrate

flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the ph and temperature of the reaction solutions were measured using a multi parameter portable meter multi 3320 wtw germany the concentration of sulfide in water was determined based on the submethyl blue spectrophotometric method gb t 16489 1996 china water samples were collected from the reactor daily and analyzed immediately before anion analysis all water samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered through a 0 22 mm millipore filter nitrous oxide n2o was determined with 200 μl of headspace by gas chromatography agilent 7890b usa achieving the detection limit of 0 05 ppm for n2o the morphology of the biofilm attached to electrodes and s0 particles was characterized using ultra high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su8010 hitachi japan the pretreatment protocol of biofilm morphology analysis was described previously huang et al 2018 electron balances of s0 oxidation and nitrate reduction were conducted by assuming s0 transforming to so4 2 6 electrons donated for each s and s2o3 2 2 electrons donated for each s and nitrate transforming to no2 2 electrons accepted for each n and n2 5 electrons accepted for each n the removal efficiency of nitrate e t was calculated using eq 5 nitrate removal kinetics under different conditions were fit by the apparent first order reaction model

represents rate constant h 1 2 4 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing biomass on s0 particle and cathode surfaces and in suspensions was taken from the triplicate sead reactors for 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing specifically the cathode and s0 particles were first washed with sterile water in a vortex shaker respectively subsequently the obtained biomass solution after removing the cathode and s0 particle were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min to collect the biomass precipitates in the same way the planktonic biomass was obtained by centrifuging the catholyte the powersoil dna isolation kit powersoil mobio usa was used for dna extraction according to the manufacturer s instructions due to a mistake in extracting dna from one of the triplicate reactors only two successful replicates of the microbial samples were available for subsequent sequencing the concentration and purity of the extracted dna were examined by a spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa dna samples were sent for pcr amplification using bacterial fused primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat for the region of the 16s rrna gene chen et al 2019b metagenomic

taxonomic classification have been described in previous studies chen et al 2022 li et al 2021 the data on microbial diversity and metagenomics were analyzed on the majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of nitrate removal as shown in fig 1 and table 1 the nitrate removal in sad bes and sead processes fit well with the first order kinetics r2 0 980 0 996 the e12h and the rate constant value k followed the order of sead 93 9 e12h 100 0 290 h 1 k 0 733 h 1 sad e12h 86 9 k 0 210 h 1 bes 62 1 e12h 77 1 0 078 h 1 k 0 143 h 1 the k values of the sead process were 3 7 5 1 times that of the bes operated at the same voltage and were 1 4 3 5 times that of the sad system operated with the same amount of s0 particles revealing the significant synergy in the sead process further the varied applied voltage significantly affected the nitrate removal performance in the sead process fig 1 and table 1 with the increase of applied voltage the nitrate removal efficiency of the sead and bes process also increased the current of the sead process exhibited similar trends at the voltages of 0 3 v 0 5 v and 0 7 v the currents started at the relatively high levels of 1 23 1 59 and 2 13 ma and tended to be stable around 0 16 0 23 and 0 18 ma after 24 h respectively fig s2 it was speculated that the metabolic activity of electroactive microorganisms decreased as the nitrate concentration decreased resulting in a decrease in the current su et al 2019 in principle the higher the applied voltage the higher the electron supply rate of the cathode which contributes to the improvement of nitrate removal efficiency kondaveeti and min 2013 zhang et al 2014 in addition with the increase of applied voltage in the sead process the increase in h consumption rate of the cathode enhanced the ph buffering capacity of the system which might be another promoting factor for nitrate removal 3 2 change of ph value and accumulation of denitrification intermediates as shown in fig 2 a the ph of the sad system decreased from 7 36 to 6 38 within 12 h due to the generation of protons sahinkaya et al 2014 in the bes biocathode system the acidity would be consumed in the process of electrode driven denitrification cheng et al 2012 which caused the ph increase of the bes catholyte it was obvious that the ph fluctuation of the sead process was smaller than those of the sad and bes processes indicating the capability of the sead process in buffering the ph in particular the applied voltage of 0 5 v achieved a ph change of less than 5 and a nitrate removal rate of 82 7 within 4 h k of 0 512 0 052 h 1 which was considered to be the optimal voltage taking into account nitrate removal ph buffering and energy consumption fig 2a and table 1 nitrite no2 n is a key intermediate product in the biological denitrification process and its concentration showed a similar trend of first increasing and then decreasing in all three systems fig 2b however the maximum concentration and the retention time of nitrite were significantly different specifically the peak nitrite concentration in the bes process was 1 35 1 72 times that of the sead process operated at the same applied voltage and the peak concentration of nitrite occurred later in the bes process than in the sead process in comparison the peak concentration of nitrite in the sad process was higher than that in the sead process due to the ph drop qian et al 2019 it has been reported that sufficient electron donors for denitrification can reduce the accumulation of nitrite pan et al 2013 therefore the sead process could lease the accumulation of nitrite during denitrification which might be ascribed to the dual channel electron supply from both the s0 and the electrodes as well as the suitable ph value in the sead process in addition for sead and bes systems as the applied voltage increased the peak value of nitrite accumulation tended to decrease which can be explained by that the increased applied voltage enhanced the dissimilatory nitrite reduction kondaveeti and min 2013 zhang et al 2014 as shown in fig s3 compared with the bes process with the same voltage the accumulation concentration of n2o in the sead process was reduced by 10 5 12 8 in addition the accumulation of n2o in the sead process was also lower than that in the sad process although the greenhouse gas n2o exerts 6 0 of global warming denitrification is the sole sink that removes n2o from the biosphere shao et al 2022 therefore a stronger ability of the sead process to convert n2o to n2 is beneficial to reducing n2o driven greenhouse warming 3 3 sulfate production the sulfate production rate during nitrate removal in the sead process 5 67 6 26 mg so4 2 mg no3 n was less than that in the sad system 7 61 mg so4 2 mg no3 n fig 3 the sulfate production in the sad was close to the theoretical value of 7 54 mg so4 2 mg no3 n sahinkaya et al 2014 it was shown that the sead process could decrease sulfate production during nitrate removal which was beneficial to control the sulfate discharge this was possibly attributed to the fact that part of the nitrate removal did not proceed via the sad pathway generally the nitrate concentration in secondary effluents of domestic wwtps would not exceed 30 mg l ma et al 2020 correspondingly it can be calculated that the maximum sulfate production in the sead process for the treatment of secondary effluent will be 187 8 mg l which is even lower than the 250 mg l limits for sulfate in drinking water zhu et al 2019 therefore the sulfate generated in the sead process for enhanced nitrate removal from secondary effluent would not interfere with its reuse and compliance discharge the re addition amount of s can be determined according to the consumption of elemental sulfur which is calculated as ms q t c β where q indicates the amount of wastewater treated in the reactor per day m3 d t indicates the continuous operation time d c indicates the no3 n concentration difference between the influent and effluent mg l β indicates a stoichiometric coefficient of 2 5 a maximum of 2 5 g s0 is required to fully convert 1 g no3 n to n2 here electron balances were conducted to better understand the sulfur transformation and sead working mechanism huang et al 2018 in the sead process s0 was still the main source of electrons for denitrification at the voltages of 0 3 v 0 5 v and 0 7 v accounting for 83 1 79 2 and 75 3 of the electrons consumed in the denitrification process therefore it could be concluded that the cathode was an auxiliary electron donor for the denitrification process and the contribution of the cathode to denitrification increased with the increase of the applied voltage it was worth mentioning that no noteworthy sulfide 1 mg l production was observed in the sead process at all three tested voltages within 12 h while the nitrate removal efficiency could reach 93 9 100 table 1 and fig s4 in principle the h2 threshold concentration δg0 value and redox potential of nitrate reduction no3 n2 were 0 05 nm 240 kj mol and 0 79 v respectively correspondingly the h2 threshold concentration δg0 value and redox potential of sulfate reduction so4 2 hs were 1 15 nm 38 kj mol and 0 22 v respectively löffler et al 1999 those data demonstrate that in comparison with sulfate reduction the denitrification process is more thermodynamically favorable carlson et al 2015 therefore the sead process has excellent selectivity towards avoiding the generation of toxic intermediate sulfur metabolites 3 4 microbial community structure and function in the sead process the sem images reveal that biofilms were formed on the surfaces of the cathode and s0 particles in the sead process fig s5 the cathode continuously supplied electrons to the microbes resulting in the enrichment of microorganisms on its surface fig s5 a the sad microbes used s0 as an electron donor for denitrification resulting in obvious depressions and erosion voids on the surface of sulfur particles fig s5 b the 16s rrna gene based illumina miseq sequencing was adopted to further study the bacterial community structures in the sead process detailed information on the dominating phyla and classes was illustrated in supplementary data fig s6 which demonstrated the spatial variation of the microbial composition within the sead process at the genus level the dominant bacteria in s0 particle and cathode biofilms were derived from the anaerobic sludge of wastewater treatment plants which have been reported to perform denitrification processes in previous studies on wastewater table s2 the abundance of pseudomonas in the sulfur particle biofilm 15 59 was significantly higher than that in the cathode biofilm 6 72 fig 4 pseudomonas is a common facultative denitrifying bacteria which can use both organic electron donors and inorganic electron donors e g elemental sulfur reduced sulfur compounds and reduced iron compounds chen et al 2013 di capua et al 2019 pokorna and zabranska 2015 in addition pseudomonas was confirmed to be able to perform denitrification in the cathode and the efficient denitrification performance was achieved by inoculating its pure bacteria or enrichment solution zhang et al 2014 therefore it can be inferred that pseudomonas could be possibly the major functional genus in the sead process ralstonia was reported to possess the function of autotrophic denitrification cramm 2009 downing and nerenberg 2007 and its abundance in sulfur particle biofilm 8 93 was higher than that in cathode biofilms 2 93 and the suspended biomass 0 31 in addition both desulfovibrio and brevundimonas were identified denitrifiers dalsgaard and bak 1994 khanongnuch et al 2019 and their relative abundance in the sulfur particle biofilm 2 25 and 2 46 was higher than both the cathode biofilms 1 18 and 0 73 and the suspended biomass 1 63 and 0 69 compared to the sulfur particle biofilm and the suspended biomass more chryseobacterium 8 62 pantoea 7 17 comamonas 3 22 achromobacter 3 59 asaia 4 10 mesorhizobium 3 20 and acinetobacter 2 38 were enriched in the cathode biofilm chryseobacterium can use nitrate as the final electron acceptor for metabolism and be also previously found to be significantly enriched in various biocathodes park et al 2006 park and lee 2019 zhu et al 2017 pantoea sp was previously found to be the most abundant functional bacteria in the electrode biofilm of a denitrifying bes reactor chun et al 2012 comamonas are species of electroactive denitrifying bacteria and the efficient denitrification efficiency of comamonas denitrificans using an electrode as electron donors has been confirmed by pure culture experiment xing et al 2010 achromobacter is a common denitrifying bacterium and its obvious enrichment at the biocathode was also reported in a previous study su et al 2018 the enrichment of mesorhizobium was also found in the electrode biofilm in the case of nitrate containing groundwater treatment by bes biocathode nguyen et al 2016 acinetobacter is capable of denitrification which has been reported to be able to obtain electrons from the electrode and was the dominant bacteria on the carbon fiber cathode of two compartment bes rabaey et al 2008 rosenbaum et al 2011 3 5 key functional genes and metabolic pathways metagenomic sequencing was further performed to elucidate the genomic potential for the metabolism of the microbial consortium in cathode biofilms and sulfur particle biofilms the relative abundance of functional genes affiliated with four kegg level 2 categories including energy metabolism carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites showed the same trend among the cathode biofilm and sulfur particle biofilm fig 5 a at kegg level 3 oxidative phosphorylation carbon fixation nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism were the abundant functional pathways affiliated to energy metabolism which played important roles in autotrophic denitrification further kegg annotation indicates that nitrate reductase e c 1 7 99 and 1 9 6 1 nitrite reductase e c 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 4 encoded by corresponding functional genes were involved in denitrification metabolism in the sulfur electrode autotrophic denitrification system fig 5b for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite various nitrogen metabolic genes with a high abundance were detected including narg z h y i v nxra b and napa b fig 5c it was noteworthy that the abundance of napa and napb in cathode biofilm was 2 11 and 6 07 times that in s0 particle biofilm the cytochrome nitrate reductase napa and napb were also electron transfer subunits which were critical to the denitrification process of electroactive biofilms delgado et al 2019 li et al 2016a nirs and nirk were two key functional genes in nitrite reduction and the activity nirs gene was not affected by ph but that of the nirk gene was huang et al 2019 therefore the acidic microzones on the surface of sulfur particles resulted in the abundance of nirk gene in s0 particle biofilm only being 31 8 of that in cathode biofilm while the abundance of nirs in sulfur particle biofilm was 39 9 higher than that in cathode biofilm fig 5c it was reported that nirs and nirk could substitute each other xu et al 2020 which might be a possible mechanism for the enhanced denitrification of the sead process it was particularly worth mentioning that sulfur particle biofilm enriched a higher abundance of norb norc and nosz genes than cathode biofilm which was consistent with the fact that the sad process achieved higher nitrate removal efficiency than the bes process fig 1 and table 1 the results indicated that elemental sulfur as an electron donor has greater potential for complete denitrification than the electrode 3 6 a concept model for the working mechanism in the sead process based on the performance and the corresponding microbial information the working mechanism of nitrate removal by coupling sulfur driven and electrode driven autotrophic denitrification during the sead process was proposed as shown in fig 6 the dual channel electron supply from s0 and electrodes accelerated the denitrification process the sad process contributed 75 3 83 1 of nitrate removal in the sead process while the cathode was an auxiliary electron donor the lower sulfate yield of the sead than the sad process was ascribed to the electrode driven autotrophic denitrification besides the s0 particle and electrode both acted as biological carriers for denitrifying bacteria which contributed to the formation of the collaborative denitrification communities and functional genes on the sulfur particle and cathode the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas ralstonia and brevundimonas etc that use elemental sulfur as an electron donor were selectively enriched in the sulfur particle biofilms the cathode biofilm was dominated by electroactive denitrifying bacteria such as pseudomonas chryseobacterium and comamonas the enrichment of genes for nitrate reductase e c 1 7 99 and 1 9 6 1 nitrite reductase e c 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase e c 1 7 2 4 in cathode biofilm and sulfur particle biofilm supported the denitrification function of the sead process in addition the h generated during the sad process could be consumed by the biocathode and improve the metabolic activity of the biocathode liu et al 2019 logan et al 2008 the stable ph of the sead process could be conveniently realized by regulating the applied voltage instead of supplying limestone which increased the volumetric nitrate removal capacity of the reactor zhu et al 2019 therefore the multi pathway synergistic effects between sulfur autotrophic denitrification and biocathode denitrification enhanced the nitrate removal from wastewater in practical application electrode modules can be implanted into conventional sad biofilter to form sead biofilter and the s0 re addition can be conducted with reference to the sad biofilter wang et al 2021 the biofilm growing on the s0 beads might contribute to the bed clogging of the sead biofilter which may be resolved by a reasonable backwash operation wang et al 2021 the main technical challenge for scaling up the sead process is the requirement for a high electrode packing density while increasing the capacity of the sad reaction zone to maximize the denitrification performance to prevent the decay of the volumetric power densities a large specific surface area of the electrode should be maintained during the sead process from the lab to the pilot scale further research on electrode modification electrode module design power management system and reactor configuration is needed in addition the sead process needs to be demonstrated in treating real wastewater at a pilot scale and shows sufficient nitrate removal performance to provide a way forward for the implementation of the process therefore the operating parameters e g reaction time applied voltage s0 particle size backwash strategy and filler replacement of the pilot scale sead process should be investigated further conducting the economical assessment of continuously operating sead biofilter is meaningful for promoting the sead process the sead process may be economically feasible in operation by reducing the operational cost including the s consumption fee sludge treatment fee electricity fee etc of a scaled up sead biofilter through rational design and optimization 4 conclusions a novel sead process was proposed with superior nitrate removal performance less accumulation of sulfate and self balance of acidity alkalinity capacity by regulating the applied voltage the dual channel electron supply from s0 and electrodes made the nitrate removal rate constant k in the sead process 3 7 5 1 and 1 4 3 5 times higher than that of the single electrode and sulfur driven systems respectively the s contributed to 75 3 83 1 of nitrate removal and the sulfate yield during sead 5 67 6 26 mg so4 2 mg no3 n was decreased by 17 25 compared with sad the s0 particle and electrode both as active bio carriers constructed collaborative denitrification communities and functional genes pseudomonas ralstonia and brevundimonas were the dominant denitrifying genera in s0 particle biofilm while pseudomonas chryseobacterium pantoea and comamonas became the dominant denitrifying genera in the cathode biofilm the narg z h y i v nxra b napa b nirs k norb c and nosz were potential functional genes for efficient nitrate reduction during the sead process metagenomic sequencing indicated s0 as an electron donor has greater potential for complete denitrification than the electrode declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15832,investigating the influence mechanism of drying wetting cycles on the availability and mobility of heavy metals in sediment from the perspective of the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter dom may gain a new understanding but little current information exists here we used spectral technologies high resolution mass spectrometry and elemental stoichiometry method to trace the change rules of the molecular composition of dom in the riparian sediment of the river results showed that the drying wetting cycles could benefit the degradation of labile fractions e g proteins aliphatics and lipids of dom and retain the fractions with high aromaticity and molecular size e g lignin the decrease in the availability of cd after drying wetting alternation processes was highly related to these changes in dom composition however the availability of zn and cu remained almost unchanged which probably resulted from the release and depletion of n and s in sediment derived dom under drying wetting alternation conditions as for cr its exchangeable fraction was unchanged during the drying wetting alternation process likely due to its high stability in the sediment these results have implications on the environmental geochemical cycling of heavy metals in the riparian sediment with frequent drying wetting alternation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter drying wetting cycle heavy metals molecular composition sediment 1 introduction sediments in the riparian zone are an essential living place and food source for benthic organisms in the water thus it has high ecological value however the riparian zone of the river is also vulnerable to pollution e g heavy metal pollution due to the toxicity and bioaccumulation in the food chain heavy metals in the riparian sediment have a significant threat to the aquatic ecological environment the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals are controlled by various environmental factors such as redox state ph minerals and dissolved organic matter dom chen et al 2021 honma et al 2016 jin et al 2021 dom is one of the most active fractions in sediment it is rich in active functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl phenol thiol and amino which can form complexes with heavy metals chen et al 2021 xu et al 2018 for example the carboxyl groups in dom can form bidentate carboxylic cu complexes with cu huang et al 2021 dom also can directly bind with metal ions in sediments through a series of reactions such as ion exchange adsorption flocculation and precipitation aiken et al 2011 borggaard et al 2019 additionally dom can indirectly affect the environmental behaviors of heavy metals by reacting with the minerals in sediment chassé et al 2015 coward et al 2018 qu et al 2019 riedel et al 2013 therefore dom is of great importance for the biogeochemical cycling of heavy metals in sediment the riparian zone a seasonally flooded bottomland is the transitional region between river and land where sediment acts as the primary source and sink of dom bren 1993 jiang et al 2018 during the drying wetting cycles the exchange behaviors between exogenous and endogenous dom will occur at the water sediment interface franklin et al 2020 additionally the drying wetting cycles can cause the alternation of the redox potential and the microbial communities in sediment thus changing the composition and structure of dom in sediments warren 2014 these phenomena also suggest that the drying wetting cycles can make the dom in the riparian sediment different from that in the ordinary water and sediment the composition and structure of dom are essential for the interaction between dom and heavy metals aiken et al 2011 ding et al 2021 due to the high heterogeneity and diversity of dom the binding sites of dom to different metals and the binding sequence and intensity of organic functional groups in dom to heavy metals were various therefore we hypothesize that the dynamic changes of dom characteristics induced by the drying wetting cycles will dramatically affect the environmental behaviors of heavy metals in the riparian sediment many previous studies have explored the interaction between heavy metals and sediment derived dom on the one hand some studies mainly focus on the relationship between mental ions and sediment derived dom chassé and ohno 2016 chen et al 2021 he et al 2019 for example it was reported that high cd pollution observed in a eutrophic lake was caused by the complexation of cd with sediment derived dom chen et al 2021 on the other hand some works pay more attention to the binding mechanism of sediment derived dom with heavy metals wen et al 2018 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2015 for example previous studies pointed that the binding potential of cu with the high molecular weight dom released from sediment was much higher than that with low molecular weight dom xu et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to the impacts of molecular characterization of dom on the availability of heavy metals during drying wetting cycles in sediment additionally many excellent studies are dealing with the effects of physicochemical characteristics including eh ph doc concentration sulfate and mineral changing under the drying wetting cycles on the chemical speciation of heavy metals dewey et al 2021 ponting et al 2021 shaheen et al 2016 2014 for example eh changing can cause a change in the valence state of redox sensitive elements e g as and cr directly affecting their solubility shaheen et al 2016 moreover it has been reported that sulfate formation can effectively control the availability of heavy metals under continuous flooding conditions dewey et al 2021 weber et al 2009 however few studies have revealed the influence mechanism of the drying wetting cycles on the availability of heavy metals in the sediment from the perspective of dom molecular composition additionally the high heterogeneity of sediment derived dom makes it even more challenging therefore the main objective of this work is to clarify the mechanism of the availability changing of heavy metals in riparian sediment with drying wetting cycles from the perspective of dom molecular composition electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi fticr ms can provide high resolution and reliable molecular formula information on hundreds of individual compounds in complex dom huang et al 2021 to achieve this goal the variation rule of the molecular composition of sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles was deeply explored by combining with esi fticr ms spectral technologies and elemental stoichiometry method the bcr the community bureau of reference sequential extraction method was applied to determine the speciation of the heavy metals in riparian sediment the exchangeable fraction is often used to characterize the availability of heavy metals finally the relationship between the molecular composition of sediment derived dom and the exchangeable fraction of heavy metals was analyzed via the pearson s correlation analysis this relationship can extend our knowledge of the environmental geochemical behavior of heavy metals in the riparian sediment characterized by drying wetting alternation 2 materials and methods 2 1 incubation experiments sediment samples 0 20 cm were taken from xiangjiang river 28 37 18 n 112 48 24 e in hunan province china the collected sediment was freeze dried ground 2 mm and thoroughly mixed to ensure homogeneity for physicochemical properties table s1 analyses and incubation experiments five hundred grams of the sediment in 300 mesh nylon bags were placed in plexiglass columns height 10 cm diameter 10 cm with 10 circular holes in the bottom and side walls fig 1 the sediment samples were maintained at 70 of water holding capacity whc and incubated in darkness at 25 c for 5 d to activate the existing microbial communities li et al 2019 muhammad et al 2014 then three plexiglass columns of sediments were taken out as a control group a series of covered 5 l glass beakers were used for wetting incubation the rest plexiglass columns were placed in 5 l glass beakers 10 cm water layer over the surface sediment during wetting cultivation nitrogen was charged every two days for 20 min to ensure that the dissolved oxygen content in the water was less than 0 5 mg l 1 after wetting incubation all samples were incubated for another 7 d at 50 of whc all of the plexiglass columns were incubated at 25 c in the dark sediment moisture was monitored during the incubation period by periodically weighing the columns after 7d of drying incubation a cycle of drying wetting was established there were three cycles over 42 d three plexiglass columns of sediments were taken at 0 7 14 21 28 35 and 42 d 2 2 extraction of sediment derived dom all incubated samples were air dried ground sieved 60 mesh and then used for dom extraction the extraction procedure was performed at 25 c the solid liquid ratio of sediment to ultrapure milli q water was set at 1 10 w v these mixtures were shaken at 220 rpm for 24 h and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min xu et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and then stored at 4 c until further analysis the dom concentration of sediment was expressed as the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration li et al 2019 which was measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan 2 3 spectral analysis uv vis spectra of dom samples were obtained via a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan with a 1 cm quartz cuvette the wavelength scanning range was 200 600 nm the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 suva260 suva280 and the spectral slope ratio sr were used as indicators of the aromaticity hydrophobicity humification degree and molecular weight of dom respectively huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 win et al 2018 the suva254 suva260 and suva280 were calculated as the ratio of the uv absorption at 254 260 and 280 nm to the doc concentration respectively huang et al 2019 win et al 2018 sr reported here for the intervals of 275 295 nm s275 295 and 350 400 nm s350 400 were calculated using linear regression of the log transformed a spectrum helms et al 2008 eem spectra of the dom samples were measured through a fluorescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan before eem measurement the doc concentrations of dom samples were diluted to 8 mg c l 1 to reduce the inner filter effects wu et al 2012 the scan rate was set as 1200 nm min 1 the excitation and emission wavelength ranges were set as 200 500 nm sampling interval 5 nm and 250 600 nm sampling interval 2 nm respectively the slit widths were 5 nm 2 4 don and dop determination the dom samples were analyzed through a discrete chemistry auto analyzer smartchem 140 ams italy we calculated the dissolved organic nitrogen don content of sediment via subtracting the inorganic nitrogen content no3 n and nh4 n from the total dissolved nitrogen tdn content xie et al 2020 the dissolved organic phosphorus dop content was calculated via subtracting the soluble reactive phosphorus srp content from the total dissolved phosphorus tdp content chaves et al 2021 this method may produce errors in indicator measuring and data analysis however it may be feasible from a qualitative point of view 2 5 esi fticr ms analysis the seven dom samples during the drying wetting alternation process were used for esi fticr ms analysis before analysis these dom samples need to be desalted according to a purification process of huang et al 2020 the molecular composition of purified samples was measured at the dalian institute of chemical physics chinese academy of sciences using a bruker 15t fticr ms bruker daltonics bremen germany the parameters of fticr ms equipped with electrospray ionization esi source in negative ion mode were also set syringe infusion 2 0 μl min 1 ion accumulation time 0 5 s mass range m z 200 700 molecular formula assignment was done via the trfu algorithm based on the formula criteria of 5 c 50 1 o n 4 s 2 p 2 0 o c 1 2 and 0 3 h c 2 5 within 1 0 ppm fu et al 2020 valle et al 2018 xu et al 2016 additionally the range of the double bond equivalent dbe minus o value was between 10 and 10 in this work herzsprung et al 2014 the identified molecular formulas are shown in supporting information si it should be mentioned that the formula assignment for the components like chon2p1 chos1p1 chon2s1p2 are still not fully understood and rather challenging in this work there are relatively few of them the calculation of modified aromaticity index aimod dbe and nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc can be found in si s1 2 6 chemical speciation analysis of heavy metals the bcr sequential extraction procedure was applied to determine the contents of heavy metals speciation forms in sediment the extraction procedure was performed according to the method described in the report of qureshi et al 2020 there are four fractions of heavy metals including the exchangeable fraction exc reducible fraction red oxidizable fraction oxi and residual fraction res the contents of heavy metals in each of fractions were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer 7900 icp ms agilent usa 2 7 statistical analysis parallel factor analysis parafac of eem spectra was performed using the dom fluor toolbox http www models life ku dk in matlab r2012b mathworks natick ma following the procedures described by stedmon and bro 2008 prior to parafac analysis the raman and rayleigh scatters of the 21 eems were eliminated bahram et al 2006 pearson s correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationships between the dom parameters doc suva254 suva260 suva280 sr c1 c2 c3 doc don don dop doc dop cho chon cho n s p containing lignins proteins aliphatics lipids unsaturated hydrocarbons tannins carbohydrates condensed aromatics aimod and the exchangeable fraction of heavy metals which was performed with origin pro 2021b 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition changes of sediment derived dom during drying wetting cycles 3 1 1 spectral characteristics uv vis spectral characteristics of sediment derived dom during the alternate drying wetting periods are shown in fig 2 the levels of the suva254 suva260 and suva280 after three drying wetting cycles were significantly higher than that before incubation p 0 05 note that a sharp increase in these spectral indices was observed after 14 d this finding reflected that the drying wetting treatment was favorable for the composition of sediment derived dom becoming more aromatic hydrophobic and humified additionally the sr value exhibited a downtrend during incubation of sediment indicating that the drying wetting cycles are likely to form high molecular weight dom these phenomena may suggest that the simple labile fractions were preferentially utilized or and transformed to aromatic carbon structures by microorganisms under drying wetting cycles these results demonstrated that the aromatic hydrophobic and high molecular weight fractions of sediment derived dom could be selectively preserved and formed under cyclic drying wetting environments as shown in fig s1 three individual fluorescent components in sediment derived dom under drying wetting alternation were identified through the parafac model component c1 ex em 250 420 nm corresponded to terrestrial humic like substance zhou et al 2020 component c2 ex em 220 280 330 380 nm and component c3 ex em 220 250 270 290 nm resembled tryptophan like substance and tyrosine like substance respectively huang et al 2019 yamashita et al 2008 as judging by the peak excitation and emission wavelengths component c1 exhibited higher aromaticity and molecular size than components c2 and c3 during incubation of sediment the fluorescence intensity of component c1 increased from 23 2 0 5 to 35 9 0 4 while that of components c2 and c3 reduced by 3 and 10 respectively fig 3 therefore drying wetting alternation cycles could benefit the degradation of labile fractions in dom and the formation of fractions with high aromaticity and molecular size which agreed well with the observation from uv vis spectra 3 1 2 elemental stoichiometric characteristics dom stoichiometry can reflect the characteristics of the organic compounds present which in turn reflecting the ease with which bacteria can degrade organic matter zakem and levine 2019 the stoichiometry of sediment derived dom is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a the doc don ratios ranged from 40 32 3 29 to 72 68 1 15 which gradually increasing during drying wetting cycles p 0 05 this result was probably due to the n2o emissions and mineralization of n by microbial action under drying wetting alternation miller et al 2005 yang et al 2016 the overall trend of both doc dop and don dop ratios was downward during drying wetting cycles p 0 05 fig 4b and c this agrees well with the earlier study by ding et al 2019 who found that drying wetting cycles can promote the mobilization and release of p from the sediment to the overlying water through porewater exchange compared with wetting treatments the drying treatments had higher doc don ratios and lower doc dop ratios and don dop ratios as shown in fig 4d the doc contents in the sediment after drying treatment were consistently lower than that after wetting in multiple drying wetting cycles this finding suggests that drying treatment could benefit the degradation of sediment derived dom overall the changes of c n and p pool in sediment derived dom revealed that the microorganism could maintain active under drying wetting alternation conditions the drying wetting cycles can enhance the degradation of sediment derived dom but this degradation behavior can be appropriately mitigated by wetting treatment 3 1 3 molecular characterization to further explore the effect of drying wetting alternation on the molecular characteristics of sediment derived dom the detailed composition differences during the drying wetting alternation process were analyzed by esi fticr ms the overall trend of the number of identified formulas was upward during the drying wetting cycles additionally the h c ratio decreased with the drying wetting alternation process whereas o c ratio dbe and average nosc increased accordingly these phenomena implied that the drying wetting alternation process could enhance the molecular complexity and the recalcitrance of sediment derived dom van krevelen diagrams in fig 5 show pronounced differences in chemical compositions of sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles the different colors in these figures represent different formula subgroups including cho chon cho n s p containing compounds the cho compounds were of the greatest abundance 41 0 63 1 in sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles the proportion of cho compounds increased fig 6 a meanwhile the cho compound in sediment derived dom 0d had the lowest average nosc among the four formula subgroups table s3 on the contrary the proportion of cho n s compounds and the proportion of n and s decreased during the drying wetting cycles fig 6a table s2 the relative abundance of p containing compounds and the proportion of p increased at the initial stage and gradually declined with the extension of incubation time these phenomena could result from the consumption of microbially labile organic matter by microorganisms thus enhancing the mobilization and release of n and s into a free state ding et al 2019a liao et al 2020 the lignin compounds were the most dominant type in all sediment derived dom samples during the drying wetting alternation the relative abundance of lignin compounds in sediment derived dom increased from 41 9 to 68 2 and that of condensed aromatic compounds risen from 0 4 to 7 3 fig 6b the lignin compounds and condensed aromatic compounds have rich aromatic structures to better understand the change trends of the aromaticity of sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles we determined the aromaticity index based on the fticr ms data as shown in fig 6c the relative abundances of aromatic ai 0 5 and condensed aromatic structures ai 0 66 increased during the drying wetting cycles which is consistent with the observation from suva254 in contrast the relative abundance of proteins aliphatics and lipids compounds dropped from 27 2 to 12 4 and from 23 5 to 1 7 respectively these suggest that the drying wetting cycles are likely to facilitate aromatization of sediment derived dom but to reduce the proteins and lipids compounds the molecular composition changes in sediment derived dom confirmed the observations from its spectral and elemental stoichiometric characteristics these findings lead us to conclude that the stability of sediment derived dom may enhance after drying wetting cycles due to the degradation of labile organic matter and the reservation of high aromatic organic matter 3 2 changes in chemical speciation of heavy metals during drying wetting cycles the proportion of the heavy metals in four fractions before and after drying wetting cycles of sediment is shown in fig 7 it was found that cr in the sediment mainly existed in the oxidizable and residual forms a total of 67 indicating that cr was easily adsorbed by organic matter and sulfide and more stable after three drying wetting cycles its speciation distribution had hardly changed as for cu its proportions in the three fractions except for the exchangeable fraction were accordingly altered to different extents after drying wetting cycles the proportions of cu in the reducible fraction declined from 38 1 4 to 33 1 9 while that in oxidizable and residual fractions increased from 18 0 8 to 20 0 6 and from 30 0 9 to 33 1 3 respectively the residual fraction of heavy metals is referred to as the inert part which generally does not involve in chemical reactions and is relatively stable despite environmental changes qureshi et al 2020 this suggests that cu could gradually stabilize by mainly controlling its oxidizable and residual fractions under drying wetting cycles in contrast the residual fraction of zn was decreased by 4 which was transformed to the other three fractions this phenomenon indicated that the drying wetting cycles could increase the mobility and bioavailability of zn the relative distribution of the exchangeable fraction of zn fluctuated slightly during the drying wetting cycles in the original sediment the proportion of cd in the exchangeable fraction was 49 1 0 in accordance with some findings in dongting lake wen et al 2016 after drying wetting cycles the relative distribution of cd in the exchangeable fraction was decreased by 20 meanwhile that in the reducible and oxidizable fractions was increased by 10 and 6 respectively as compared with the other three fractions the exchangeable fraction of heavy metals exhibited higher solubility and mobility thus the drying wetting cycles contributed to the transformation of cd from the exchangeable fraction to the reducible and the oxidizable fractions resulting in higher stability overall the four fractions of cr cu zn and cd displayed different change trends during the drying wetting cycles this could be attributed to the unique affinity of heavy metals to the diverse composition in sediment and the different sensitivity of different heavy metals to environmental changes ponting et al 2021 shaheen et al 2014 one unanticipated finding was that the exchangeable fraction of cd showed higher sensibility to the drying wetting cycles of sediment than that of cr zn and cu the exchangeable fraction mainly refers to the metal which can be weakly electrostatic absorbed on the sediment surface or can be precipitated or coprecipitated with the carbonates present in sediment huang et al 2015 which represents the speciation with highest availability relative to the other three speciation the contents of this fraction were often used for characterization the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals in sediment 3 3 relationships between sediment derived dom composition and availability of heavy metals dom was valued as a significant factor affecting the availability and mobility of heavy metals li et al 2019 pan et al 2016 to further explore the effects of the compositional features of dom on the availability of heavy metals during drying wetting cycles pearson s correlation analysis was performed using the different compositions of dom for accounting for changes in the exchangeable fraction of heavy metals fig 8 we observed weak correlations between the exchangeable fraction of cr and dom compositions the exchangeable cr were positively correlated with the suva254 suva260 and suva280 but negatively correlated with the doc concentration these findings implied that the availability of cr was controlled by the doc contents and aromaticity of sediment derived dom this work found that the drying wetting alternation cycles could enhance the aromaticity of sediment derived dom however the cr in the sediment mainly exists in the oxidizable and residual fractions with high stability therefore the availability of cr changed slightly during the drying wetting alternation process as for zn the exchangeable fraction had a positive correlation with doc concentration and cho n s compounds but was negatively correlated with cho and chon compounds this suggested that the availability of zn was controlled by the doc contents the behavior of n and s of sediment derived dom as for cu the exchangeable cu was positively correlated with don dop but negatively correlated with doc don these findings implied that the behavior of n in sediment derived dom under the drying wetting alternation conditions microbial consumption could promote nitrification and denitrification thus resulting in the n depletion from dom quan et al 2020 it may enhance the complexation of heavy metals with dom while it may also promote the release of heavy metal ions from dom bolan et al 2014 rinklebe et al 2016 such process could explain the finding that the exchangeable fraction of zn and cu were unchanged during drying wetting cycles as for cd the doc contents had a strong positive correlation with exchangeable cd the suva254 suva260 suva280 chon compounds condensed aromatics aimod 0 5 and aimod 0 66 had a strong negative correlation with exchangeable cd these results indicated that the aromatic and hydrophobic compositions in sediment derived dom had a profound effect on the exchangeable fraction of cd in this work we found that drying wetting alternation cycles enhanced these properties of sediment derived dom it was reported that aromatic and hydrophobic substances were the dominant cd chelators li et al 2019 wen et al 2022 additionally these fractions in dom had a higher affinity to minerals ding et al 2019b lv et al 2016 hence the complex of heavy metals with dom could be better bound to minerals reducing the mobility of cd therefore lower availability of cd was observed after the drying wetting alternation cycles in summary our results suggested that the availability of cr were unchanged during the drying wetting cycles due to its own stability in the sediment although the availability of cr is related to the aromaticity of sediment derived dom the exchangeable fraction of zn and cu remained almost unchanged during the drying wetting cycles mainly relating to the release and depletion of n and s in sediment derived dom additionally the exchangeable fraction of cd was mainly related to the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of sediment derived dom the retention of dom with high aromatic and hydrophobic fractions during drying and wetting cycles was help to the binding of such organic matter with heavy metals and clay minerals in sediment consequently the availability of cd in sediment was reduced after the drying wetting cycles 4 conclusion this study improved our understanding of the influence mechanism of the drying wetting cycles on the mobility and availability of heavy metals in riparian sediment from the perspective of the dom molecular composition the results showed that the relative abundance of the strongly aromatic and high molecular weight components e g lignin and the cho compounds in sediment derived dom were increased during drying wetting alternation nevertheless the availability of zn and cu were unchanged during the drying wetting alternation process this phenomenon may be related to the release and depletion of n and s in sediment derived dom although the availability of cr was closely linked to the aromaticity of dom its availability remained unchanged due to the high stability of cr in the sediment interestingly the increase of high aromaticity and molecular weight components in sediment derived dom contributed to reducing the availability of cd this suggested that the complex formed by dom and cd binding may be bound to the minerals in the

15832,investigating the influence mechanism of drying wetting cycles on the availability and mobility of heavy metals in sediment from the perspective of the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter dom may gain a new understanding but little current information exists here we used spectral technologies high resolution mass spectrometry and elemental stoichiometry method to trace the change rules of the molecular composition of dom in the riparian sediment of the river results showed that the drying wetting cycles could benefit the degradation of labile fractions e g proteins aliphatics and lipids of dom and retain the fractions with high aromaticity and molecular size e g lignin the decrease in the availability of cd after drying wetting alternation processes was highly related to these changes in dom composition however the availability of zn and cu remained almost unchanged which probably resulted from the release and depletion of n and s in sediment derived dom under drying wetting alternation conditions as for cr its exchangeable fraction was unchanged during the drying wetting alternation process likely due to its high stability in the sediment these results have implications on the environmental geochemical cycling of heavy metals in the riparian sediment with frequent drying wetting alternation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter drying wetting cycle heavy metals molecular composition sediment 1 introduction sediments in the riparian zone are an essential living place and food source for benthic organisms in the water thus it has high ecological value however the riparian zone of the river is also vulnerable to pollution e g heavy metal pollution due to the toxicity and bioaccumulation in the food chain heavy metals in the riparian sediment have a significant threat to the aquatic ecological environment the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals are controlled by various environmental factors such as redox state ph minerals and dissolved organic matter dom chen et al 2021 honma et al 2016 jin et al 2021 dom is one of the most active fractions in sediment it is rich in active functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl phenol thiol and amino which can form complexes with heavy metals chen et al 2021 xu et al 2018 for example the carboxyl groups in dom can form bidentate carboxylic cu complexes with cu huang et al 2021 dom also can directly bind with metal ions in sediments through a series of reactions such as ion exchange adsorption flocculation and precipitation aiken et al 2011 borggaard et al 2019 additionally dom can indirectly affect the environmental behaviors of heavy metals by reacting with the minerals in sediment chassé et al 2015 coward et al 2018 qu et al 2019 riedel et al 2013 therefore dom is of great importance for the biogeochemical cycling of heavy metals in sediment the riparian zone a seasonally flooded bottomland is the transitional region between river and land where sediment acts as the primary source and sink of dom bren 1993 jiang et al 2018 during the drying wetting cycles the exchange behaviors between exogenous and endogenous dom will occur at the water sediment interface franklin et al 2020 additionally the drying wetting cycles can cause the alternation of the redox potential and the microbial communities in sediment thus changing the composition and structure of dom in sediments warren 2014 these phenomena also suggest that the drying wetting cycles can make the dom in the riparian sediment different from that in the ordinary water and sediment the composition and structure of dom are essential for the interaction between dom and heavy metals aiken et al 2011 ding et al 2021 due to the high heterogeneity and diversity of dom the binding sites of dom to different metals and the binding sequence and intensity of organic functional groups in dom to heavy metals were various therefore we hypothesize that the dynamic changes of dom characteristics induced by the drying wetting cycles will dramatically affect the environmental behaviors of heavy metals in the riparian sediment many previous studies have explored the interaction between heavy metals and sediment derived dom on the one hand some studies mainly focus on the relationship between mental ions and sediment derived dom chassé and ohno 2016 chen et al 2021 he et al 2019 for example it was reported that high cd pollution observed in a eutrophic lake was caused by the complexation of cd with sediment derived dom chen et al 2021 on the other hand some works pay more attention to the binding mechanism of sediment derived dom with heavy metals wen et al 2018 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2015 for example previous studies pointed that the binding potential of cu with the high molecular weight dom released from sediment was much higher than that with low molecular weight dom xu et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to the impacts of molecular characterization of dom on the availability of heavy metals during drying wetting cycles in sediment additionally many excellent studies are dealing with the effects of physicochemical characteristics including eh ph doc concentration sulfate and mineral changing under the drying wetting cycles on the chemical speciation of heavy metals dewey et al 2021 ponting et al 2021 shaheen et al 2016 2014 for example eh changing can cause a change in the valence state of redox sensitive elements e g as and cr directly affecting their solubility shaheen et al 2016 moreover it has been reported that sulfate formation can effectively control the availability of heavy metals under continuous flooding conditions dewey et al 2021 weber et al 2009 however few studies have revealed the influence mechanism of the drying wetting cycles on the availability of heavy metals in the sediment from the perspective of dom molecular composition additionally the high heterogeneity of sediment derived dom makes it even more challenging therefore the main objective of this work is to clarify the mechanism of the availability changing of heavy metals in riparian sediment with drying wetting cycles from the perspective of dom molecular composition electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi fticr ms can provide high resolution and reliable molecular formula information on hundreds of individual compounds in complex dom huang et al 2021 to achieve this goal the variation rule of the molecular composition of sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles was deeply explored by combining with esi fticr ms spectral technologies and elemental stoichiometry method the bcr the community bureau of reference sequential extraction method was applied to determine the speciation of the heavy metals in riparian sediment the exchangeable fraction is often used to characterize the availability of heavy metals finally the relationship between the molecular composition of sediment derived dom and the exchangeable fraction of heavy metals was analyzed via the pearson s correlation analysis this relationship can extend our knowledge of the environmental geochemical behavior of heavy metals in the riparian sediment characterized by drying wetting alternation 2 materials and methods 2 1 incubation experiments sediment samples 0 20 cm were taken from xiangjiang river 28 37 18 n 112 48 24 e in hunan province china the collected sediment was freeze dried ground 2 mm and thoroughly mixed to ensure homogeneity for physicochemical properties table s1 analyses and incubation experiments five hundred grams of the sediment in 300 mesh nylon bags were placed in plexiglass columns height 10 cm diameter 10 cm with 10 circular holes in the bottom and side walls fig 1 the sediment samples were maintained at 70 of water holding capacity whc and incubated in darkness at 25 c for 5 d to activate the existing microbial communities li et al 2019 muhammad et al 2014 then three plexiglass columns of sediments were taken out as a control group a series of covered 5 l glass beakers were used for wetting incubation the rest plexiglass columns were placed in 5 l glass beakers 10 cm water layer over the surface sediment during wetting cultivation nitrogen

all of the plexiglass columns were incubated at 25 c in the dark sediment moisture was monitored during the incubation period by periodically weighing the columns after 7d of drying incubation a cycle of drying wetting was established there were three cycles over 42 d three plexiglass columns of sediments were taken at 0 7 14 21 28 35 and 42 d 2 2 extraction of sediment derived dom all incubated samples were air dried ground sieved 60 mesh and then used for dom extraction the extraction procedure was performed at 25 c the solid liquid ratio of sediment to ultrapure milli q water was set at 1 10 w v these mixtures were shaken at 220 rpm for 24 h and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min xu et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and then stored at 4 c until further analysis the dom concentration of sediment was expressed as the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration li et al 2019 which was measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan 2 3 spectral analysis uv vis spectra of dom samples were obtained via a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan with a 1 cm quartz cuvette the wavelength scanning range was 200 600 nm the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 suva260 suva280 and the spectral slope ratio sr were used as indicators of the aromaticity hydrophobicity humification degree and molecular weight of dom respectively huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 win et al 2018 the suva254 suva260 and suva280 were calculated as the ratio of the uv absorption at 254 260 and 280 nm to the doc concentration respectively huang et al 2019 win et al 2018 sr reported here for the intervals of 275 295 nm s275 295 and 350 400 nm s350 400 were calculated using linear regression of the log transformed a spectrum helms et al 2008 eem spectra of the dom samples were measured through a fluorescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan before eem measurement the doc

as 200 500 nm sampling interval 5 nm and 250 600 nm sampling interval 2 nm respectively the slit widths were 5 nm 2 4 don and dop determination the dom samples were analyzed through a discrete chemistry auto analyzer smartchem 140 ams italy we calculated the dissolved organic nitrogen don content of sediment via subtracting the inorganic nitrogen content no3 n and nh4 n from the total dissolved nitrogen tdn content xie et al 2020 the dissolved organic phosphorus dop content was calculated via subtracting the soluble reactive phosphorus srp content from the total dissolved phosphorus tdp content chaves et al 2021 this method may produce errors in indicator measuring and data analysis however it may be feasible from a qualitative point of view 2 5 esi fticr ms analysis the seven dom samples during the drying wetting alternation process were used for esi fticr ms analysis before analysis these dom samples need to be desalted according to a purification process of

2016 additionally the range of the double bond equivalent dbe minus o value was between 10 and 10 in this work herzsprung et al 2014 the identified molecular formulas are shown in supporting information si it should be mentioned that the formula assignment for the components like chon2p1 chos1p1 chon2s1p2 are still not fully understood and rather challenging in this work there are relatively few of them the calculation of modified aromaticity index aimod dbe and nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc can be found in si s1 2 6 chemical speciation analysis of heavy metals the bcr sequential extraction procedure was applied to determine the contents of heavy metals speciation forms in sediment the extraction procedure was performed according to the method described in the report of qureshi et al 2020 there are four fractions of heavy metals including the exchangeable fraction exc reducible fraction red oxidizable fraction oxi and residual fraction res the contents of heavy metals in each of fractions were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer 7900 icp ms agilent usa 2 7 statistical analysis parallel factor analysis parafac of eem spectra

heavy metals which was performed with origin pro 2021b 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition changes of sediment derived dom during drying wetting cycles 3 1 1 spectral characteristics uv vis spectral characteristics of sediment derived dom during the alternate drying wetting periods are shown in fig 2 the levels of the suva254 suva260 and suva280 after three drying wetting cycles were significantly higher than that before incubation p 0 05 note that a sharp increase in these spectral indices was observed after 14 d this finding reflected that the drying wetting treatment was favorable for the composition of sediment derived dom becoming more aromatic hydrophobic and humified additionally the sr value exhibited a downtrend during incubation of sediment indicating that the drying wetting cycles are likely to form high molecular weight dom these phenomena may suggest that the simple labile fractions were preferentially utilized or and transformed to aromatic carbon structures by microorganisms under drying wetting cycles these results demonstrated that the aromatic hydrophobic and high molecular weight fractions of sediment derived dom could be selectively preserved and formed under cyclic drying wetting environments as shown in fig s1 three individual fluorescent components in sediment derived dom under drying wetting alternation were identified through the parafac model component c1 ex em 250 420 nm corresponded to terrestrial humic like substance zhou et al 2020 component c2 ex em 220 280 330 380 nm and component c3 ex em 220 250 270 290 nm resembled tryptophan like substance and tyrosine like substance respectively huang et al 2019 yamashita et al 2008 as judging by the peak excitation and emission wavelengths component c1 exhibited higher aromaticity and molecular size than components c2 and c3 during incubation of sediment the fluorescence intensity of component c1 increased from 23 2 0 5 to 35 9 0 4 while that of components c2 and c3 reduced by 3 and 10 respectively fig 3 therefore drying wetting alternation cycles could benefit the degradation of labile fractions in dom and the formation of fractions with high aromaticity and molecular size which agreed well with the observation from uv vis spectra 3 1 2 elemental stoichiometric characteristics dom stoichiometry can reflect the characteristics of the organic compounds present which in turn reflecting the ease with which bacteria can degrade organic matter zakem and levine 2019 the stoichiometry of sediment derived dom is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a the doc don ratios ranged from 40 32 3 29 to 72 68 1 15 which gradually increasing during drying wetting cycles p 0 05 this result was probably due to the n2o emissions and mineralization of n by microbial action under drying wetting alternation miller et al 2005 yang et al 2016 the overall trend of both doc dop and don dop ratios was downward during drying wetting cycles p 0 05 fig 4b and c this agrees well with the earlier study by ding et al 2019 who found that drying wetting cycles can promote the mobilization and release of p from the sediment to the overlying water through porewater exchange compared with wetting treatments the drying treatments had higher doc don ratios and lower doc dop ratios and don dop ratios as shown in fig 4d the doc contents in the sediment after drying treatment were consistently lower than that after wetting in multiple drying wetting cycles this finding suggests that drying treatment could benefit the degradation of sediment derived dom overall the changes of c n and p pool in sediment derived dom revealed that the microorganism could maintain active under drying wetting alternation conditions the drying wetting cycles can enhance the degradation of sediment derived dom but this degradation behavior can be appropriately mitigated by wetting treatment 3 1 3 molecular characterization to further explore the effect of drying wetting alternation on the molecular characteristics of sediment derived dom the detailed composition differences during the drying wetting alternation process were analyzed by esi fticr ms the overall trend of the number of identified formulas was upward during the drying wetting cycles additionally the h c ratio decreased with the drying wetting alternation process whereas o c ratio dbe and average nosc increased accordingly these phenomena implied that the drying wetting alternation process could enhance the molecular complexity and the recalcitrance of sediment derived dom van krevelen diagrams in fig 5 show pronounced differences in chemical compositions of sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles the different colors in these figures represent different formula subgroups including cho chon cho n s p containing compounds the cho compounds were of the greatest abundance 41 0 63 1 in sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles the proportion of cho compounds increased fig 6 a meanwhile the cho compound in sediment derived dom 0d had the lowest average nosc among the four formula subgroups table s3 on the contrary the proportion of cho n s compounds and the proportion of n and s decreased during the drying wetting cycles fig 6a table s2 the relative abundance of p containing compounds and the proportion of p increased at the initial stage and gradually declined with the extension of incubation time these phenomena could result from the consumption of microbially labile organic matter by microorganisms thus enhancing the mobilization and release of n and s into a free state ding et al 2019a liao et al 2020 the lignin compounds were the most dominant type in all sediment derived dom samples during the drying wetting alternation the relative abundance of lignin compounds in sediment derived dom increased from 41 9 to 68 2 and that of condensed aromatic compounds risen from 0 4 to 7 3 fig 6b the lignin compounds and condensed aromatic compounds have rich aromatic structures to better understand the change trends of the aromaticity of sediment derived dom during the drying wetting cycles we determined the aromaticity index based on the fticr ms data as shown in fig 6c the relative abundances of aromatic ai 0 5 and condensed aromatic structures ai 0 66 increased during the drying wetting cycles which is consistent with the observation from suva254 in contrast the relative abundance of proteins aliphatics and lipids compounds dropped from 27 2 to 12 4 and from 23 5 to 1 7 respectively these suggest that the drying wetting cycles are likely to facilitate aromatization of sediment derived dom but to reduce the proteins and lipids compounds the molecular composition changes in sediment derived dom confirmed the observations from its spectral and elemental stoichiometric characteristics these findings lead us to conclude that the stability of sediment derived dom may enhance after drying wetting cycles due to the degradation of labile organic matter and the reservation of high aromatic organic matter 3 2 changes in chemical speciation of heavy metals during drying wetting cycles the proportion of the heavy metals in four fractions before and after drying wetting cycles of sediment is shown in fig 7 it was found that cr in the sediment mainly existed in the oxidizable and residual forms a total of 67 indicating that cr was easily adsorbed by organic matter and sulfide and more stable after three drying wetting cycles its speciation distribution had hardly changed as for cu its proportions in the three fractions except for the exchangeable fraction were accordingly altered to different extents after drying wetting cycles the proportions of cu in the reducible fraction declined from 38 1 4 to 33 1 9 while that in oxidizable and residual fractions increased from 18 0 8 to 20 0 6 and from 30 0 9 to 33 1 3 respectively the residual fraction of heavy metals is referred to as the inert part which generally does not involve in chemical reactions and is relatively stable despite environmental changes qureshi et al 2020 this suggests that cu could gradually stabilize by mainly controlling its oxidizable and residual fractions under drying wetting cycles in contrast the residual fraction of zn was decreased by 4 which was transformed to the other three fractions this phenomenon indicated that the drying wetting cycles could increase the mobility and bioavailability of zn the relative distribution of the exchangeable fraction of zn fluctuated slightly during the drying wetting cycles in the original sediment the proportion of cd in the exchangeable fraction was 49 1 0 in accordance with some findings in dongting lake wen et al 2016 after drying wetting cycles the relative distribution of cd in

performed using the different compositions of dom for accounting for changes in the exchangeable fraction of heavy metals fig 8 we observed weak correlations between the exchangeable fraction of cr

15833,iron electrocoagulation is designed for sustainable high efficiency and high flexibility water purification applications recent advances reported that hydroxyl radicals oh based oxidative transformation of organic contaminants can occur in iron electrocoagulation however there is still a lack of mechanistic understanding the production of oh in bicarbonate electrolyte which presents a critical knowledge gap in the optimization of iron electrocoagulation technology towards practical application combined with contaminant degradation radical quenching experiments and spectroscopic techniques we found that oh was produced at rate of 16 1 μm h 1 during 30 ma iron electrocoagulation in bicarbonate electrolyte through activation of o2 by fe ii under ph neutral conditions high yield of oh occurred at ph 8 5 likely due to high adsorbed fe ii that can activate o2 to enhance oh production mössbauer and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements substantiated that fe ii adsorbed lepidocrocite was the dominant solid fe ii species at ph 8 5 a process based kinetic modeling was developed to describe the dynamic of oh production fe ii oxidation and contaminant degradation processes in iron electrocoagulation findings of this study extend the functionality of electrocoagulation from phase separation to oh based advanced oxidation process which provides a new perspective

groundwater with simple design and operation bae et al 2022 bicudo et al 2021 heffron et al 2019b kim et al 2021 pan et al 2017 tian et al 2018 iron electrocoagulation has long been considered as a phase separation technology heavy metals cao et al 2017 organics zhu et al 2005 and colloids hakizimana et al 2017 were typically found to be removed by the mechanisms of adsorption coprecipitation physical enmeshment charge neutralization and complexation in addition reductive transformation mechanism can also occur in iron electrocoagulation for its effective reduction of high valence heavy

production of reactive oxidizing species particularly oh in the context of environmental application previous studies applying iron electrocoagulation have mainly focused on the demonstration of the effect of operational variables on contaminant removal performance and the production of solid products baran et al 2018 govindan et al 2020 maher et al 2019 and these have not attempted to explore the kinetics and mechanims of oh production although our recent work provided substantial knowledge on the oxidizing capacity of an iron electrocoagulation system for organic contaminant transformation these studies were conducted using simple sulfate and chloride based electrolyte solutions qian et al 2019 to our knowledge iron electrocoagulation had not previously been revealed for oh production in electrolyte composition containing bicarbonate bicarbonate is a major anion of groundwater in many locations around the world aghazadeh and mogaddam 2010 gan et al 2014 sappa et al 2014 stamatis et al 2006 sun and liu 2010 in addition bicarbonate has a significant impact on the interaction of fe ii and o2 king 1998 as expected the fe ii o2 reactions in iron electrocoagulation play a pivotal role in the formation of oh as their interaction is a prerequisite for oh production eqs 1 4 it is foreseeable that the presence of bicarbonate could alter fe ii speciation and subsequent fe ii oxidation and molecular oxygen activation affecting the yield of oh production and contaminant transformation understanding the dynamics of oh and fe speciation using direct measurements alone is challenging due to rapid rates of oh and fe ii oxidation under ambient conditions dynamic simulation model is a quantitative tool for integrating complex data sets and providing their quantitative interpretations in a reaction based framework pham and waite 2008 steefel et al 2005 previous studies developed a highly constrained dynamic model that could identify as iii oxidation and removal mechanism in iron electrocoagulation across a range of operating conditions delaire et al 2017 li et al 2012 our recent work established a kinetic model in an iron electrocoagulation system to predict fe ii oxidation and oh production under various experimental conditions qian et al 2019 however these models either consider solely dissolved fe ii contributing to oh production or lack the state of the art formalisms to cope with contaminant transformation building on our recent works qian et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the objective of this study was to fundamentally investigate the production mechanism of oh in iron electrocoagulation systems in bicarbonate electrolyte in pursuit of this objective we first examined the oxidative transformation of a probe pollutant i e aniline and quantified the oh using benzoate as a probe we then used a combination of wet chemistry and spectroscopic techniques to identify the reaction intermediates and fe species generated in iron electrocoagulation at different ph we ultimately developed a process based kinetic modeling to describe oh production fe ii oxidation and contaminant degradation processes in iron electrocoagulation knowledge gained from this study provided important insights into the oh production in iron electrocoagulation which is critical for predicting contaminant transformation when

bicarbonate electrolyte we first investigated the production of oh by evaluating the oxidative transformation of a refractory organic contaminant aniline by electrocoagulation under the conditions of 10 mm nahco3 and ph 8 5 note that the electrolysis was performed during the entire 240 min at 2 5 ma cm 2 fig 1 a we found that 39 1 of aniline was removed in an oxic electrocoagulation system within 240 min fig 1a during the oxic electrocoagulation o2 from air dissolves spontaneously into the solution that could oxidize fe ii generated from the anode do rapidly dropped from initial 8 5 0 2 mg l to 4 7 0 2 mg l within 30 min and then remained stable for the remainder of the experiment fig s2 this indicates an equilibrium achieved between the atmospheric o2 influx and consumption of fe ii oxidation in contrast an insignificant abatement 5 of aniline was obtained in the anoxic electrocoagulation suggesting the necessity of do for aniline abatement and insignificant adsorption on the precipitates control experiments indicated that coagulation using fe iii salts removed 5 of aniline fig 1a further ruling out the significant contribution of adsorption and co precipitation mechanisms to aniline removal however the removal percentage of aniline was 8 by fe ii dosing and further improved to 22 as the addition divided by 8 times fig 1a at ph 8 5 the rate of fe ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen was fast with half lives on the order of few minutes these results indicated that the reaction of fe ii with molecular oxygen might be important for aniline removal and that the multiple additions of fe ii improved the efficiency hplc analysis suggested more peaks appeared for the aniline degradation samples during electrocoagulation compared to initial aniline solution fig 1b a careful inspection of the retention times with standard compounds indicated the formation of p aminophenol p benzoquinone and benzidine fig 1b the formation of these degradation intermediates could be recognized as an evidence of oh attacking brillas et al 1998 to clarify the nature of reactive oxidants several probe compounds were used to quench the degradation of aniline fig 1c in addition to oh interactions between fe ii and o2 may produce an array of other reactive oxidants that include o2 h2o2 and fe iv o keenan and sedlak 2008 quenching experiments have been extensively utilized to distinguish the species of dominant reactive oxidants during the oxidation processes fang et al 2013 keenan and sedlak 2008 maher et al 2019 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2015 sod has been used as an o2 scavenger in the electrochemical system kim et al 2021 wang et al 2015 however the inhibitory effect of sod on the degradation of aniline was found to be insignificant about 19 abatement during the iron electrocoagulation fig 1c the addition of sod rapidly catalyzes the dismutation of o2 into h2o2 and o2 eq 7 mccormick and thomason 1978 thus we suggest that o2 may not be the main oxidant for aniline 7 2 o 2 2 h s o d h 2 o 2 o 2 we also investigated the degradation of aniline in electrocoagulation by employing excess 2 propanol and ethanol previous studies suggested that 2 propanol can be regarded as a selective probe for oh while ethanol reacts with oh and fe iv o to form acetaldehyde keenan and sedlak 2008 aniline degradation decreased from 39 to 9 in the presence of both ethanol and 2 propanol fig 1c suggesting that the main oxidant for aniline was presumably to be oh compared to oh fe iv o is a weaker oxidant as indicated by the lower oxidizing ability standard reduction potential for fe iv o fe iii 2 0 v she versus oh h2o 2 8 v she and lower second order rate constant for organic compounds k 8 0 101 to 3 105 m 1 s 1 versus 109 m 1 s 1 jacobsen et al 1998 qian et al 2019 while fe iv o was reported to be the key reactive species for as iii oxidation in iron electrocoagulation li et al 2012 our recent work provided compelling evidence that organic degradation was most likely induced by oh qian et al 2019 to further confirm the oh production we used benzoate to quantify the dynamic of oh produced in iron electrocoagulation this is because oxidation of benzoic acid to p hba can be utilized as a probe reaction due to its weak adsorption on fe precipitates and slow further oxidation by oh qian et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the rate of cumulative oh concentration reached about 16 1 μm h 1 at ph 8 5 fig 2 a which is much higher than the values of 11 2 μm h 1 at ph 7 0 in a nacl na2so4 electrolyte qian et al 2019 interestingly the cumulative oh was well correlated with the degradation of aniline r2 0 90 fig 2b corroborating the domination of oh for aniline degradation as a complement to oh measurements esr dmpo spin trapping experiments provided further evidence supporting the production of oh during iron electrocoagulation as the esr spectrums showed 1 2 2 1 characteristic peak of dmpooh hyperfine couplings αn αh 14 9 that was in line with the spectra of the fenton reaction fig 2c 3 2 mechanism of hydroxyl radical production a role of h2o2 theoretically h2o2 may be produced through either two electron dioxygen reduction o2 h2o2 on cathode kim et al 2021 or one electron molecular oxygen activation consecutive one electron transfer o2 o2 h2o2 pathways wang et al 2015 to distinguish the relative contribution of these pathways the anode chamber and cathode chamber were separated by a salt bridge in a divided electrocoagulation system fig s3 results illustrated that no h2o2 detected in the cathode chamber while the instantaneous h2o2 concentration increased to approximately 1 4 μm at 3 h in the anode chamber fig 3 these observations demonstrated that one electron molecular oxygen activation pathway was the main source of h2o2 during iron electrocoagulation as one of the ros generated from the fe ii o2 reactions h2o2 itself could not oxidize aniline fig s4 but acting as one of the key intermediates for oh production in the iron electrocoagulation system b effect of ph it has been reported that the production of oh in the reaction of fe ii species with o2 and the subsequent organic oxidation strongly depend on solution ph katsoyiannis et al 2008 we thus examined the influence of ph on aniline degradation oh production and fe ii species we interestingly found that the removal of aniline after 240 min reaction was increased from 19 to 24 and to 39 as the solution ph increased from 6 5 to 7 5 and to 8 5 respectively fig s5 we chose the low end ph 6 5 and high end ph 8 5 conditions to explore the mechanism of oh production the observation of aniline oxidation was quantitatively consistent with the production of oh as shown in fig 4 a where cumulative oh at ph 8 5 was almost double of that at ph 6 5 similar to our observations previous studies also found that the greater oxidation efficiency of as iii and mn ii occurred at ph 8 5 compared to 6 5 during iron electrocoagulation in bicarbonate electrolytes li et al 2012 van genuchten and pena 2017 however a decrease of oh yield was reported in the homogeneous fenton reaction as the solution ph was increased from 7 0 to 8 0 qian et al 2019 these observations may reflect the different generation mechanism of reactive oxidants the effect of bicarbonate on the fe ii oxidation and oh production during iron electrocoagulation will be dissucussed later the dissolved fe ii concentration was increased to 8 3 mg l within 30 min and then gradually decreased to 0 8 mg l at ph 6 5 whereas essentially no fe remained as dissolved fe ii detection limit 0 03 mg l for all samples at ph 8 5 fig 4b in stark contrast the adsorbed fe ii at ph 8 5 inceased to 5 3 7 1 mg l after 30 min almost double of that at ph 6 5 fig 4c during the iron electrocoagulation oxidation of fe2 produced from the iron anode led to the formation of fe iii oxyhydroxides e g α and γ feooh at ph 6 5 the dissolved fe ii accumulated initially and then decreased in the later period due to accelerated oxidation by feooh tamura et al 1980 tanneru and chellam 2012 at ph 8 5 the oxidation of fe ii in bicarbonate solution was fast with a half life of about 1 min kim et al 2021 king 1998 millero et al 1987 the fast rate of fe ii adsorption on feooh resulted in the undetectable fe2 in the solution at ph 8 5 liger et al 1999 vikesland and valentine 2002 since the oxidation rate of adsorbed fe ii increased with increasing feooh concentration tamura et al 1980 the fast fe ii oxidation limited its accumulation on the surface of feooh in the later stage of the reactions fig 4d illustrated a linear correlation between the cumulative oh and oxidized fe ii at both ph 6 5 and 8 5 as expected the correlation slope at ph 6 5 8 1 0 1 μm oh per mm fe was much lower than that at ph 8 5 14 7 1 8 μm oh per mm fe the slope at ph 8 5 indicates the yield of 14 7 μm oh upon oxygenation of 1 mm fe ii this value is higher than previous electrocoagulation systems using na2so4 nacl as electrolyte showing a correlation slope of 10 7 at ph 7 0 qian et al 2019 further comparison shows that the yield of oh upon fe ii oxygenation reported in our study is similar to prior studies using reduced clay minerals under ph neutral conditions cheng et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 pointing to the critical role of fe ii oxidation for oh production in the iron electrocoagulation systems c effet of bicarbonate to reveal the role of bicarbonate the generation of oh in different electrolytes nahco3 na2so4 nacl was explored fig 5 a for the three electrolytes the order of oh production was nahco3 na2so4 nacl the most striking result was that more than twice as high oh production in nahco3 compared to those in na2so4 and nacl at ph 8 5 consistent with the production of oh great promotion of aniline removal was also observed for the bicarbonate electrolyte fig s7 such high oh production in bicarbonate may be attributed to the enhanced oxidation and surface complexation of fe ii by carbonate as shown in fig s8a the main specie of fe ii was fe2 at ph 6 5 while the dominated fe ii species included fe co3 aq fe co3 oh and fe co3 2 2 at ph 8 5 for comparison fe2 dominated the fe ii species across the ph range of 6 5 8 5 for na2so4 and nacl electrolytes figs s8b c the rate of fe ii oxidation by molecular oxygen can be boosted by the complexation of carbonate as the estimated rate constants follow k fe co3 2 2 k fe co3 oh k feoh k fe2 king 1998 pham and waite 2008 this notion is further supported by the low dissolved fe2 concentrations observed in bicarbonate electrolyte compared to na2so4 and nacl electrolytes fig 5b at a high ph fe ii oxidation rate was predominantly controlled by the oxidation of fe co3 2 2 and fe co3 oh pham and waite 2008 it has been reported that the high reactivity of fe co3 2 2 facilitated the electron transfer from fe ii to o2 caldeira et al 2010 pham and waite 2008 furthermore the carbonate species can cover a large fraction of sorption sites on feooh and the coverage increased with increasing ph from 6 to 9 appelo et al 2002 villalobos and leckie 2001 the enrichment of carbonate decreased the surface charge of feooh evans et al 1979 which could enhance the sorption of fe ii by the formation of fe ii carbonate ternary complexes on feooh solids vikesland and valentine 2002 thus the formation of high reactive adsorbed fe ii carbonate complexes might contribute to the high yields of oh in bicarbonate electrolyte at ph 8 5 d characterization of iron solid species recent advances proposed that the adsorbed fe ii on feooh solids could be an important molecular oxygen activation pathway for oh production qian et al 2019 to confirm the presence of adsorbed fe ii in our study the solid fe particles formed during electrocoagulation was characterized by xrd tem mössbauer and xps xrd patterns showed that the dominant iron minerals formed at ph 8 5 was lepidocrocite fig s9 consistent with our previous study at comparable conditions pan et al 2017 tem images exhibited a hedgehog like structure that was similar to lepidocrocite formed at ph 8 5 in bicarbonate electrolyte fig s10 mössbauer spectra collected at ph 6 5 fig 6 a exhibited a prominent fe iii sextet consistent with goethite latta et al 2012 which suggests a thorough oxidation of fe ii in the precipitates dubrawski et al 2015 govindan et al 2020 for the solid samples collected at ph 8 5 however deconvoluting the mössbauer spectra only lead to a new fe iii sextet table s9 as reflected by center shift cs 0 50 mm s hyperfine field h 43 1 t and a broad collapsed feature cs 0 65 mm s h 29 5 t fig 6b the fe iii sextet which was comprised of 55 of the total area could be assigned to lepidocrocite cheng et al 2020 in coincidence with the xrd measurements fig s9 comparison of the collapsed feature parameter cs 0 65 mm s with previous reports in the reference notini et al 2018 suggested that the collapsed feature was possibly due to the presence of adsorbed fe ii to gain further insights into the surface fe ii species xps was used to indentify the iron oxides generated during the iron electrocoagulation at ph 6 5 and 8 5 as shown in fig 6c and fig s11 the fe 2p3 2 spectra of ph 8 5 and ph 6 5 both had a board peak near 711 0 ev suggesting mainly surface fe iii species qiu et al 2017 based on the results of mössbauer spectra surface fe iii species were fitted by goethite α feooh and lepidocrocite γ feooh with multiple peak structures in the fe 2p3 2 spectra of ph 8 5 and ph 6 5 respectively biesinger et al 2011 in addition two peaks at 708 3 ev and 709 3 ev full wide at half maximum fwhm value of both 1 2 ev were figured out in the fe 2p3 2 spectra which could be assigned to a fe ii o specie grosvenor et al 2004 mcintyre and zetaruk 1977 the o 1 s spectra collected at ph 8 5 was fitted well by two peaks at 530 0 ev and 531 5 ev fig 6d ascribed to lattice oxygen binding with fe fe o and oh bonding respectively ai et al 2013 mcintyre and zetaruk 1977 the content of fe ii o specie from the 60 min sample collected at ph 8 5 9 1 was almost double of that at ph 6 5 4 7 in fe 2p3 2 spectra table s10 similarly much higher precentage of fe o specie was observed for sample collected at ph 8 5 in o 1 s spectra tables s11 the c 1 s spectra showed a higher peak at 288 9 ev for sample collected at ph 8 5 compared to ph 6 5 fig s12 suggesting a higher content of co3 species on the surface heuer and stubbins 1999 these observations corroborated the surface complexation of fe ii and carbonate on feooh taken together both mössbauer and xps measurements provided direct evidence for the dominant of adsorbed fe ii at ph 8 5 during the iron electrocoagulation process we expected that the activation of o2 by fe ii adsorbed on feooh may be a pivotal mechanism responsible for oh production in the iron electrocoagulation systems which is supported by our recent work showing that lepidocrocite sorbed fe ii particles dominated oh production using nacl na2so4 electrolytes in iron electrocoagulation qian et al 2019 3 3 process based kinetic modeling according to the above mechanisms uncovered for oh production a process based kinetic modeling was further used to provide additional insights into the dynamic processes affecting chemical species transformation first the kinetic model was evaluated for the dynamics of fe ii oxidation and oh production in iron electrocoagulation simulation results were overall matched with the observed results for oh dissolved fe ii and adsorbed fe ii at ph 6 5 and 8 5 figs 4a c among the reaction networks the steps for one electron transfer to yield superoxide reactions 2 and 9 in table s2 were identified as the rate limiting step pham and waite 2008 qian et al 2019 so the rate constants k2 and k9 were the slowest the k2 0 25 m 1s 1 was higher than the value reported in sulfate and chloride system qian et al 2019 which further suggests the acceleration of fe ii oxidation in the presence of bicarbonate in addition the rate constants of k2 k3 k4 k5 k9 k10 k11 and k12 were higher at ph 8 5 than that at ph 6 5 which is consistent with the high oxidation rate of fe ii observed at high ph to further investigate the relative contributions of dissolved fe ii and adsorbed fe ii to oh and other possible reactive oxidants i e h2o2 and o2 production at different ph conditions a system mass balance was performed simulation results showed that adsorbed fe ii was the predominant contributor to reactive oxidants production at different ph conditions at ph 6 5 and 8 5 the adsorbed fe ii contributed 82 7 and 87 4 of oh production respectively while the dissolved fe ii contributed slightly fig s13 additionally adsorbed fe ii at ph 8 5 contributed to oh production more than that at ph 6 5 these results also suggest that adsorbed fe ii oxidation was predominant at a high ph with progressive adsorbed fe ii generation in iron electrocoagulation taken together model simulations confirmed that oh can be produced through fe ii oxygenation which is consistent with experimental observations that adsorbed fe ii oxidation contributed to oh production under conditions tested the developed kinetic model also provides insight into aniline degradation as the first step we performed a simulation of aniline degradation that did not consider a competitive effect of bicarbonate the model failed to capture the aniline concentrations over the entire simulation period data not shown alternatively we considered a new degradation formulation by adding a co3 2 competition term into the rate expression of aniline equation 8 in table s3 fig 1a clearly shows a good agreement between the observed and simulated results for aniline degradation suggesting the improvement of the model s capability to simulate the observed aniline concentrations although high concentration of bicarbonate competes with contaminants for the oh our observation also showed promotion of oh production by bicarbonate the combination effect still enabled the treatment efficiency in bicarbonate electrolyte higher than other systems fig s7 we acknowledge that the introduction of a co3 2 competition term may not adequately describe the compex effect of bicarbonate future modeling studies could address additional complexity by considering a more detailed chemical reaction network and identifying controlling effects i e promotion and competition effects 4 conclusion this study to our knowledge is the first to provide new mechanism evidence for the presence of advanced oxidation phenomena during the treatment of organic pollutants in iron electrocoagulation using bicarbonate electrolyte we demonstrated that organic pollutant could be oxidized by oh generated through activation of o2 during iron electrocoagulation in bicarbonate electrolyte at ph 6 5 8 5 high oxidizing capacity of iron electrocoagulation occurred at ph 8 5 in bicarbonate the production of oh in bicarbonate was much higher than that in na2so4 and nacl at ph 8 5 enhanced oh production can be attributed to the enhanced oxidation and surface complexation of fe ii by bicarbonate the dynamic of oh production fe ii oxidation and contaminant degradation processes in bicarbonate at ph 6 5 and 8 5 can be described by a process based kinetic modeling both experimental and simulation results shed light on the importance of adsorbed fe ii on oh production under the tested experimental conditions application of iron electrocoagulation system would be promising for micropollutants removal from groundwater with alkalescent bicarbonate e g karst groundwater the oxidizing capacity of iron electrocoagulation systems would be regulated by optimizing the operation conditions and electrode configuration the combination of iron electrocoagulation with electro fenton process and renewable photovoltaic technology provides new perspective to develop

15833,iron electrocoagulation is designed for sustainable high efficiency and high flexibility water purification applications recent advances reported that hydroxyl radicals oh based oxidative transformation of organic contaminants can occur in iron electrocoagulation however there is still a lack of mechanistic understanding the production of oh in bicarbonate electrolyte which presents a critical knowledge gap in the optimization of iron electrocoagulation technology towards practical application combined with contaminant degradation radical quenching experiments and spectroscopic techniques we found that oh was produced at rate of 16 1 μm h 1 during 30 ma iron electrocoagulation in bicarbonate electrolyte through activation of o2 by fe ii under ph neutral conditions high yield of oh occurred at ph 8 5 likely due to high adsorbed fe ii that can activate o2 to enhance oh production mössbauer and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements substantiated that fe ii adsorbed lepidocrocite was the dominant solid fe ii species at ph 8 5 a process based kinetic modeling was developed to describe the dynamic of oh production fe ii oxidation and contaminant degradation processes in iron electrocoagulation findings of this study extend the functionality of electrocoagulation from phase separation to oh based advanced oxidation process which provides a new perspective

production of reactive oxidizing species particularly oh in the context of environmental application previous studies applying iron electrocoagulation have mainly focused on the demonstration of the effect of operational variables on contaminant removal performance and the production of solid products baran et al 2018 govindan et al 2020 maher et al 2019 and these have not attempted to explore the kinetics and mechanims of oh production although our recent work provided substantial knowledge on the oxidizing capacity of an iron electrocoagulation system for organic contaminant transformation these studies were conducted using simple sulfate and chloride based electrolyte solutions qian et al 2019 to our knowledge iron electrocoagulation had not previously been revealed for oh production in electrolyte composition containing bicarbonate bicarbonate is a major anion of groundwater in many locations around the world aghazadeh and mogaddam 2010 gan et al 2014 sappa et al 2014 stamatis et al 2006 sun and liu 2010 in addition bicarbonate has a significant impact on the interaction of fe ii and o2 king 1998 as expected the fe ii o2 reactions in iron electrocoagulation play a pivotal role in the formation of oh as their interaction is a prerequisite for oh production eqs 1 4 it is foreseeable that the presence of bicarbonate could alter fe ii speciation and subsequent fe ii oxidation and molecular oxygen activation affecting the yield of oh production and contaminant transformation understanding the dynamics of oh and fe speciation using direct measurements alone is challenging due to rapid rates of oh and fe ii oxidation under ambient conditions dynamic simulation model is a quantitative tool for integrating complex data sets and providing their quantitative interpretations in a reaction based framework pham and waite 2008 steefel et al 2005 previous studies developed a highly constrained dynamic model that could identify as iii oxidation and removal mechanism in iron electrocoagulation across a range of operating conditions delaire et al 2017 li et al 2012 our recent work established a kinetic model in an iron electrocoagulation system to predict fe ii oxidation and oh production under various experimental conditions qian et al 2019 however these models either consider solely dissolved fe ii contributing to oh production or lack the state of the art formalisms to cope with contaminant transformation building on our recent works qian et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the objective of this study was to fundamentally investigate the production mechanism of oh in iron electrocoagulation systems in bicarbonate electrolyte in pursuit of this objective we first examined the oxidative transformation of a probe pollutant i e aniline and quantified the oh using benzoate as a probe we then used a combination of wet chemistry and spectroscopic techniques to identify the reaction intermediates and fe species generated in iron electrocoagulation at different ph we ultimately developed a process based kinetic modeling to describe oh production fe ii oxidation and contaminant degradation processes in iron electrocoagulation knowledge gained from this study provided important insights into the oh production in iron electrocoagulation which is critical for predicting contaminant transformation when

bicarbonate electrolyte we first investigated the production of oh by evaluating the oxidative transformation of a refractory organic contaminant aniline by electrocoagulation under the conditions of 10 mm nahco3 and ph 8 5 note that the electrolysis was performed during the entire 240 min at 2 5 ma cm 2 fig 1 a we found that 39 1 of aniline was removed in an oxic electrocoagulation system within 240 min fig 1a during the oxic electrocoagulation o2 from air dissolves spontaneously into the solution that could oxidize fe ii generated from the anode do rapidly dropped from initial 8 5 0 2 mg l to 4 7 0 2 mg l within 30 min and then remained stable for the remainder of the experiment fig s2 this indicates an equilibrium achieved between the atmospheric o2 influx and consumption of fe ii oxidation in contrast an insignificant abatement 5 of aniline was obtained in the anoxic electrocoagulation suggesting the necessity of do for aniline abatement and insignificant adsorption on the precipitates control experiments indicated that coagulation using fe iii salts removed 5 of aniline fig 1a further ruling out the significant contribution of adsorption and co precipitation mechanisms to aniline removal however the removal percentage of aniline was 8 by fe ii dosing and further improved to 22 as the addition divided by 8 times fig 1a at ph 8 5 the rate of fe ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen was fast with half lives on the order of few minutes these results indicated that the reaction of fe ii with molecular oxygen might be important for aniline removal and that the multiple additions of fe ii improved the efficiency hplc analysis suggested more peaks appeared for the aniline degradation samples during electrocoagulation compared to initial aniline solution fig 1b a careful inspection of the retention times with standard compounds indicated the formation of p aminophenol p benzoquinone and benzidine fig 1b the formation of these degradation intermediates could be recognized as an evidence of oh attacking brillas et al 1998 to clarify the nature of reactive oxidants several probe compounds were used to quench the degradation of aniline fig 1c in addition to oh interactions between fe ii and o2 may produce an array of other reactive oxidants that include o2 h2o2 and fe iv o keenan and sedlak 2008 quenching experiments have been extensively utilized to distinguish the species of dominant reactive oxidants during the oxidation processes fang et al 2013 keenan and sedlak 2008 maher et al 2019 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2015 sod has been used as an o2 scavenger in the electrochemical system kim et al 2021 wang et al 2015 however the inhibitory effect of sod on the degradation of aniline was found to be insignificant about 19 abatement during the iron electrocoagulation fig 1c the addition of sod rapidly catalyzes the dismutation of o2 into h2o2 and o2 eq 7 mccormick and thomason 1978 thus we suggest that o2 may not be the main oxidant for aniline 7 2 o 2 2 h s o d h 2 o 2 o 2 we also investigated the degradation of aniline in electrocoagulation by employing excess 2 propanol and ethanol previous studies suggested that 2 propanol can be regarded as a selective probe for oh while ethanol reacts with oh and fe iv o to form acetaldehyde keenan and sedlak 2008 aniline degradation decreased from 39 to 9 in the presence of both ethanol and 2 propanol fig 1c suggesting that the main oxidant for aniline was presumably to be oh compared to oh fe iv o is a weaker oxidant as indicated by the lower oxidizing ability standard reduction potential for fe iv o fe iii 2 0 v she versus oh h2o 2 8 v she and lower second order rate constant for organic compounds k 8 0 101 to 3 105 m 1 s 1 versus 109 m 1 s 1 jacobsen et al 1998 qian et al 2019 while fe iv o was reported to be the key reactive species for as iii oxidation in iron electrocoagulation li et al 2012 our recent work provided compelling evidence that organic degradation was most likely induced by oh qian et al 2019 to further confirm the oh production we used benzoate to quantify the dynamic of oh produced in iron electrocoagulation this is because oxidation of benzoic acid to p hba can be utilized as a probe reaction due to its weak adsorption on fe precipitates and slow further oxidation by oh qian et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the rate of cumulative oh concentration reached about 16 1 μm h 1 at ph 8 5 fig 2 a which is much higher than the values of 11 2 μm h 1 at ph 7 0 in a nacl na2so4 electrolyte qian et al 2019 interestingly the cumulative oh was well correlated with the degradation of aniline r2 0 90 fig 2b corroborating the domination of oh for aniline degradation as a complement to oh measurements esr dmpo spin trapping experiments provided further evidence supporting the production of oh during iron electrocoagulation as the esr spectrums showed 1 2 2 1 characteristic peak of dmpooh hyperfine couplings αn αh 14 9 that was in line with the spectra of the fenton reaction fig 2c 3 2 mechanism of hydroxyl radical production a role of h2o2 theoretically h2o2 may be produced through either two electron dioxygen reduction o2 h2o2 on cathode kim et al 2021 or one electron molecular oxygen activation consecutive one electron transfer o2 o2 h2o2 pathways wang et al 2015 to distinguish the relative contribution of these pathways the anode chamber and cathode chamber were separated by a salt bridge in a divided electrocoagulation system fig s3 results illustrated that no h2o2 detected in the cathode chamber while the instantaneous h2o2 concentration increased to approximately 1 4 μm at 3 h in the anode chamber fig 3 these observations demonstrated that one electron molecular oxygen activation pathway was the main source of h2o2 during iron electrocoagulation as one of the ros generated from the fe ii o2 reactions h2o2 itself could not oxidize aniline fig s4 but acting as one of the key intermediates for oh production in the iron electrocoagulation system b effect of ph it has been reported that the production of oh in the reaction of fe ii species with o2 and the subsequent organic oxidation strongly depend on solution ph katsoyiannis et al 2008 we thus examined the influence of ph on aniline degradation oh production and fe ii species we interestingly found that the removal of aniline after 240 min reaction was increased from 19 to 24 and to 39 as the solution ph increased from 6 5 to 7 5 and to 8 5 respectively fig s5 we chose the low end ph 6 5 and high end ph 8 5 conditions to explore the mechanism of oh production the observation of aniline oxidation was quantitatively consistent with the production of oh as shown in fig 4 a where cumulative oh at ph 8 5 was almost double of that at ph 6 5 similar to our observations previous studies also found that the greater oxidation efficiency of as iii and mn ii occurred at ph 8 5 compared to 6 5 during iron electrocoagulation in bicarbonate electrolytes li et al 2012 van genuchten and pena 2017 however a decrease of oh yield was reported in the homogeneous fenton reaction as the solution ph was increased from 7 0 to 8 0 qian et al 2019 these observations may reflect the different generation mechanism of reactive oxidants the effect of bicarbonate on the fe ii oxidation and oh production during iron electrocoagulation will be dissucussed later the dissolved fe ii concentration was increased to 8 3 mg l within 30 min and then gradually decreased to 0 8 mg l at ph 6 5 whereas essentially no fe remained as dissolved fe ii detection limit 0 03 mg l for all samples at ph 8 5 fig 4b in stark contrast the adsorbed fe ii at ph 8 5 inceased to 5 3 7 1 mg l after 30 min almost double of that at ph 6 5 fig 4c during the iron electrocoagulation oxidation of fe2 produced from the iron anode led to the formation of fe iii oxyhydroxides e g α and γ feooh at ph 6 5 the dissolved fe ii accumulated initially and then decreased in the later period due to accelerated oxidation by feooh tamura et al 1980 tanneru and chellam 2012 at ph 8 5 the oxidation of fe ii in bicarbonate solution was fast with a half life of about 1 min kim et al 2021 king 1998 millero et al 1987 the fast rate of fe ii adsorption on feooh resulted in the undetectable fe2 in the solution at ph 8 5 liger et al 1999 vikesland and valentine 2002 since the oxidation rate of adsorbed fe ii increased with increasing feooh concentration tamura et al 1980 the fast fe ii oxidation limited its accumulation on the surface of feooh in the later stage of the reactions fig 4d illustrated a linear correlation between the cumulative oh and oxidized fe ii at both ph 6 5 and 8 5 as expected the correlation slope at ph 6 5 8 1 0 1 μm oh per mm fe was much lower than that at ph 8 5 14 7 1 8 μm oh per mm fe the slope at ph 8 5 indicates the yield of 14 7 μm oh upon oxygenation of 1 mm fe ii this value is higher than previous electrocoagulation systems using na2so4 nacl as electrolyte showing a correlation slope of 10 7 at ph 7 0 qian et al 2019 further comparison shows that the yield of oh upon fe ii oxygenation reported in our study is similar to prior studies using reduced clay minerals under ph neutral conditions cheng et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 pointing to the critical role of fe ii oxidation for oh production in the iron electrocoagulation systems c effet of bicarbonate to reveal the role of bicarbonate the generation of oh in different electrolytes nahco3 na2so4 nacl was explored fig 5 a for the three electrolytes the order of oh production was nahco3 na2so4 nacl the most striking result was that more than twice as high oh production in nahco3 compared to those in na2so4 and nacl at ph 8 5 consistent with the production of oh great promotion of aniline removal was also observed for the bicarbonate electrolyte fig s7 such high oh production in bicarbonate may be attributed to the enhanced oxidation and surface complexation of fe ii by carbonate as shown in fig s8a the main specie of fe ii was fe2 at ph 6 5 while the dominated fe ii species included fe co3 aq fe co3 oh and fe co3 2 2 at ph 8 5 for comparison fe2 dominated the fe ii species across the ph range of 6 5 8 5 for na2so4 and nacl electrolytes figs s8b c the rate of fe ii oxidation by molecular oxygen can be boosted by the complexation of carbonate as the estimated rate constants follow k fe co3 2 2 k fe co3 oh k feoh k fe2 king 1998 pham and waite 2008 this notion is further supported by the low dissolved fe2 concentrations observed in bicarbonate electrolyte compared to na2so4 and nacl electrolytes fig 5b at a high ph fe ii oxidation rate was predominantly controlled by the oxidation of fe co3 2 2 and fe co3 oh pham and waite 2008 it has been reported that the high reactivity of fe co3 2 2 facilitated the electron transfer from fe ii to o2 caldeira et al 2010 pham and waite 2008 furthermore the carbonate species can cover a large fraction of sorption sites on feooh and the coverage increased with increasing ph from 6 to 9 appelo et al 2002 villalobos and leckie 2001 the enrichment of carbonate decreased the surface charge of feooh evans et al 1979 which could enhance the sorption of fe ii by the formation of fe ii carbonate ternary complexes on feooh solids vikesland and valentine 2002 thus the formation of high reactive adsorbed fe ii carbonate complexes might contribute to the high yields of oh in bicarbonate electrolyte at ph 8 5 d characterization of iron solid species recent advances proposed that the adsorbed fe ii on feooh solids could be an important molecular oxygen activation pathway for oh production qian et al 2019 to confirm the presence of adsorbed fe ii in our study the solid fe particles formed during electrocoagulation was characterized by xrd tem mössbauer and xps xrd patterns showed that the dominant iron minerals formed at ph 8 5 was lepidocrocite fig s9 consistent with our previous study at comparable conditions pan et al 2017 tem images exhibited a hedgehog like structure that was similar to lepidocrocite formed at ph 8 5 in bicarbonate electrolyte fig s10 mössbauer spectra collected at ph 6 5 fig 6 a exhibited a prominent fe iii sextet consistent with goethite latta et al 2012 which suggests a thorough oxidation of fe ii in the precipitates dubrawski et al 2015 govindan et al 2020 for the solid samples collected at ph 8 5 however deconvoluting the mössbauer spectra only lead to a new fe iii sextet table s9 as reflected by center shift cs 0 50 mm s hyperfine field h 43 1 t and a broad collapsed feature cs 0 65 mm s h 29 5 t fig 6b the fe iii sextet which was comprised of 55 of the total area could be assigned to lepidocrocite cheng et al 2020 in coincidence with the xrd measurements fig s9 comparison of the collapsed feature parameter cs 0 65 mm s with previous reports in the reference notini et al 2018 suggested that the collapsed feature was possibly due to the presence of adsorbed fe ii to gain further insights into the surface fe ii species xps was used to indentify the iron oxides generated during the iron electrocoagulation at ph 6 5 and 8 5 as shown in fig 6c and fig s11 the fe 2p3 2 spectra of ph 8 5 and ph 6 5 both had a board peak near 711 0 ev suggesting mainly surface fe iii species qiu et al 2017 based on the results of mössbauer spectra surface fe iii species were fitted by goethite α feooh and lepidocrocite γ feooh with multiple peak structures in the fe 2p3 2 spectra of ph 8 5 and ph 6 5 respectively biesinger et al 2011 in addition two peaks at 708 3 ev and 709 3 ev full wide at half maximum fwhm value of both 1 2 ev were figured out in the fe 2p3 2 spectra which could be assigned to a fe ii o specie grosvenor et al 2004 mcintyre and zetaruk 1977 the o 1 s spectra collected at ph 8 5 was fitted well by two peaks at 530 0 ev and 531 5 ev fig 6d ascribed to lattice oxygen binding with fe fe o and oh bonding respectively ai et al 2013 mcintyre and zetaruk 1977 the content of fe ii o specie from the 60 min sample collected at ph 8 5 9 1 was almost double of that at ph 6 5 4 7 in fe 2p3 2 spectra table s10 similarly much higher precentage of fe o specie was observed for sample collected at ph 8 5 in o 1 s spectra tables s11 the c 1 s spectra showed a higher peak at 288 9 ev for sample collected at ph 8 5 compared to ph 6 5 fig s12 suggesting a higher content of co3 species on the surface heuer and stubbins 1999 these observations corroborated the surface complexation of fe ii and carbonate on feooh taken together both mössbauer and xps measurements provided direct evidence for the dominant of adsorbed fe ii at ph 8 5 during the iron electrocoagulation process we expected that the activation of o2 by fe ii adsorbed on feooh may be a pivotal mechanism responsible for oh production in the iron electrocoagulation systems which is supported by our recent work showing that lepidocrocite sorbed fe ii particles dominated oh production using nacl na2so4 electrolytes in iron electrocoagulation qian et al 2019 3 3 process based kinetic modeling according to the above mechanisms uncovered for oh production a process based kinetic modeling was further used to provide additional insights into the dynamic processes affecting chemical species transformation first the kinetic model was evaluated for the dynamics of fe ii oxidation and oh production in iron electrocoagulation simulation results were overall matched with the observed results for oh dissolved fe ii and adsorbed fe ii at ph 6 5 and 8 5 figs 4a c among the reaction networks the steps for one electron transfer to yield superoxide reactions 2 and 9 in table s2 were identified as the rate limiting step pham and waite 2008 qian et al 2019 so the rate constants k2 and k9 were the slowest the k2 0 25 m 1s 1 was higher than the value reported in sulfate and chloride system qian et al 2019 which further suggests the acceleration of fe ii oxidation in the presence of bicarbonate in addition the rate constants of k2 k3 k4 k5 k9 k10 k11 and k12 were higher at ph 8 5 than that at ph 6 5 which is consistent with the high oxidation rate of fe ii observed at high ph to further investigate the relative contributions of dissolved fe ii and adsorbed fe ii to oh and other possible reactive oxidants i e h2o2 and o2 production at different ph conditions a system mass balance was performed simulation results showed that adsorbed fe ii was the predominant contributor to reactive oxidants production at different ph conditions at ph 6 5 and 8 5 the adsorbed fe ii contributed 82 7 and 87 4 of oh production respectively while the dissolved fe ii contributed slightly fig s13 additionally adsorbed fe ii at ph 8 5 contributed to oh production more than that at ph 6 5 these results also suggest that adsorbed fe ii oxidation was predominant at a high ph with progressive adsorbed fe ii generation in iron electrocoagulation taken together model simulations confirmed that oh can be produced through fe ii oxygenation which is consistent with experimental observations that adsorbed fe ii oxidation contributed to oh production under conditions tested the developed kinetic model also provides insight into aniline degradation as the first step we performed a simulation of aniline degradation that did not consider a competitive effect of bicarbonate the model failed to capture the aniline concentrations over the entire simulation period data not shown alternatively we considered a new degradation formulation by adding a co3 2 competition term into the rate expression of aniline equation 8 in table s3 fig 1a clearly shows a good agreement between the observed and simulated results for aniline degradation suggesting the improvement of the model s capability to simulate the observed aniline concentrations although high concentration of bicarbonate competes with contaminants for the oh our observation also showed promotion of oh production by bicarbonate the combination effect still enabled the treatment efficiency in bicarbonate electrolyte higher than other systems fig s7 we acknowledge that the introduction of a co3 2 competition term may not adequately describe the compex effect of bicarbonate future modeling studies could address additional complexity by considering a more detailed chemical reaction network and identifying controlling effects i e promotion and competition effects 4 conclusion this study to our knowledge is the first to provide new mechanism evidence for the presence of advanced oxidation phenomena during the treatment of organic pollutants in iron electrocoagulation using bicarbonate electrolyte we demonstrated that organic pollutant could be oxidized by oh generated through activation of o2 during iron electrocoagulation in bicarbonate electrolyte at ph 6 5 8 5 high oxidizing capacity of iron electrocoagulation occurred at ph 8 5 in bicarbonate the production of oh in bicarbonate was much higher than that in na2so4 and nacl at ph 8 5 enhanced oh production can be attributed to the enhanced oxidation and surface complexation of fe ii by bicarbonate the dynamic of oh production fe ii oxidation and contaminant degradation processes in bicarbonate at ph 6 5 and 8 5 can be described by a process based kinetic modeling both experimental and simulation results shed light on the importance of adsorbed fe ii on oh production under the tested experimental conditions application of iron electrocoagulation system would be promising for micropollutants removal from groundwater with alkalescent bicarbonate e g karst groundwater the oxidizing capacity of iron electrocoagulation systems would be regulated by optimizing the operation conditions and electrode configuration the combination of iron electrocoagulation with electro fenton process and renewable photovoltaic technology provides new perspective to develop effective and sustainable green methods for water treatment we realize that the real groundwater environments are more complexed than the systems presented more work is ongoing to extend the framework

production io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv and so4 all participated in sdz removal oh played the major role in sdz removal and the dominant routine of oh production was io4 o2 h2o2 oh meanwhile s fe0 pi process could efficiently mineralize sdz and reduce the toxicity comparison with other pi activation approaches and sdz treatment techniques further demonstrated s fe0 was an efficient catalyst for pi

as a typical sulfonamide antibiotic has been widely used for prevention of bacterial infections sdz is frequently detected in natural fresh water ground water sediment and wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluent although concentration of sdz in different water bodies is ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 it can lead to high incidences of antibiotic resistance which causes great threats to ecosystems

by low recycle efficiency of fe2 sulfide modified zero valent iron s fe0 has been extensively investigated for activation of peroxides h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds etc and considered as a good catalyst for substituting fe2 due to the following reasons 1 s fe0 exhibits high reactivity 2 the reduced sulfur species include polysulfide sn 2 sulfate so4 2 sulfite so3 2 disulfide s2 2 and monosulfide s2 can guarantee the regeneration of fe2 3 the presence of sulfurs species can also alleviate fe0 passivation cai et al 2021 garcia et al 2021 xu et al 2020a the performance of s fe0 on pi activation has never been systematically investigated the presence of sulfurs might have multiple roles in enhancing the performance of s fe0 pi process including 1 improving the reactivity of s fe0 2 accelerating the regeneration of fe2 3 activating pi for pollutants removal therefore it is worthy to investigate the efficiency s fe0 pi process and the mechanism of enhanced pi activation by s

2004 sun et al reported that 1o2 can be produced in alkaline periodate solution and oh o2 and 1o2 are present in hydroxylamine pi system bokare and choi 2015 sun et al 2020 zong et al suggested that io3 oh o2 1o2 and feiv all produced in fe2 pi system zong et al 2021 therefore which reactive species produce in s fe0 pi system and the reason why different reactive species play different role in pollutants removal need to clarify in detail meanwhile which reaction paths dominate generation of different reactive species have not investigated clearly the present study first reports that periodate can be efficiently activated by s fe0 to achieve the rapid removal of various organic pollutants superior resistance to inorganic ions and nature organic matters excellent reusability for sdz removal and good performance for antibiotics removal in natural freshwater secondly periodate activation strengthening mechanism by s fe0 is proposed thirdly reaction paths dominating the generation of multiple reactive species and the reason why these reactive species play various roles in sdz removal are systematically confirmed lastly possible sdz degradation pathway and toxicity

to our previous research wang et al 2022b the light inhibition rate can be quantified according to the bioluminescence of the vibrio fischeri in original sdz solution and water samples treated by s fe0 pi at exposure time of 15 min the inhibition rate was considered as the toxic effect 2 6 density functional theory calculation the molecular structure of sdz was optimized by density functional theory dft at b3lyp 6 31g level via gaussian program frisch et al 2010 humphrey et al 1996 the charges distribution of sdz could be determined via quantum chemical calculations to analyze the reactive sites fievez et al 2008 dft calculations using the vasp package codes kresse and furthmüller 1996a b were performed to clarify the role of s and fe sites in pi adsorption and activation by comparing the adsorption energy for pi on the fe site of fe0 the s site and fe site of fes in addition the reaction paths and thermodynamics of fe2 pi system were performed by dft calculations to verify the formation and roles of different ros 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and applicability of s fe0 pi process for sdz removal to evaluate the performance of s fe0 pi process sdz removal efficiency in various systems were compared fig 1 a the sdz removal efficiencies obtained by various processes were in the order s fe0 pi 97 6 s fe0 20 9 fe2 pi 16 7 fes pi 8 1 fe3 pi 6 9 fes2 pi 5 7 pi 4 1 20 9 sdz could be removed by s fe0 which might be owing to the reactive species produced by oxygen reduction reaction the performance of pi activation by s fe for sdz removal was much better than other catalysts fe2 could activate pi quickly within 15 s while negligible sdz could be further removed after 15 s owing to the difficulty in regeneration of fe2 fe0 fes2 and fes all could activate pi for removing sdz but with lower efficiency which might because their lower reactivity s fe0 possessed high reactivity and the presence of sulfurs species could guarantee the recycle of fe2 inducing the amazing performance for sdz by activation of pi and 95 6 sdz could be removed within only 1 min the efficiency of sdz removal by s fe0 activating different oxidants including pms pds h2o2 and pi were also compared as depicted in fig 1b and fig s1 not only better sdz removal efficiency achieved in s fe0 pi system but also with lower fe leaching which could reduce secondary iron sludge pollution treatment costs fig 1c showed the good stability of s fe0 and 80 2 sdz still could be removed within 2 min after 7th run conventional cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 were chosen to investigate the effect of inorganic ions on sdz removal inorganic ions especially hco3 had significant inhibition on pollutants removal in oh and so4 based aops because these inorganic ions could react with oh and so4 forming less reactive species guan et al 2018 as depicted in fig 1d various inorganic ions had small effect on sdz removal in s fe0 pi system which might because multiple reactive species could be produced in the system and inorganic ions could not influence the productions some reactive species like feiv fig 1e and fig s2 depicted the various pollutants removal efficiency in fe0 pi system and s fe0 pi system rhb ttz bpa and ibu removal efficiency and value of k were 90 9 1 263 min 1 97 7 1 472 min 1 81 9 0 798 min 1 and 70 7 0 230 min 1 in s fe0 pi system respectively while rhb ttz bpa and ibu removal efficiency and value of k were only 51 5 0 361 min 1 52 6 0 219 min 1 10 1 0 045 min 1 and 7 2 0 035 min 1 in fe0 pi system respectively s fe0 pi process exhibited 2 5 20 1 folds enhancement for various pollutants removal compared with fe0 pi process performance for antibiotics treatment in natural freshwater by s fe0 pi process was also conducted fig 1d and fig 1f the detailed water quality indicators of natural freshwater is depicted in table s2 as depicted in fig 1d sdz could also be removed efficiently in the natural freshwater by s fe0 pi process with performance close to that in deionized water which might be due to its good resistance to coexisting inorganic ions antibiotics concentration in natural freshwater were generally ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 thus the treatment of 2 μm sdz about 500 μg l 1 in s fe0 pi system was conducted with 5 mg l and 25 μm dosage of s fe0 and pi it could found from fig 1f that sdz could be completely removed within 20 min by s fe0 pi process and the dissolved total fe ions was only 0 28 mg l 0 16 mg l fe3 and 0 12 mg l fe2 which was lower than the iii water quality standard 0 3 mg l fe2 produced from corrosion of s fe0 and fe2 could quickly react with pi forming reactive species and fe3 0 12 mg l fe2 could also be detected after reaction which also demonstrated the reduced sulfur species could guarantee the regeneration of fe2 in summary s fe0 pi process exhibited excellent performance for various pollutants removal good stability of s fe0 good adaptability to inorganic ions and efficient performance for antibiotics in natural freshwater 3 2 promotion pi activation mechanism of s fe0 3 2 1 characterization of s fe0 sem images and their edx mapping tests of fe0 and s fe0 before and after reaction 5 min were proposed in fig 2 a d and fig s3 it was clear found from fig 2a d that the surface of s fe0 after 5 min reaction was much rougher than that of fe0 demonstrating the better reactivity of s fe0 as depicted in fig s3 fe o and s elements distributed on the s fe0 surface indicating s was successfully loaded on fe0 and the content of fe o and s was 91 3 wt 7 7 wt and 1 0 wt meanwhile i element was also evenly distributed on s fe0 surface after reaction suggesting activation of pi might also be happened on s fe0 surface moreover ft ir fig s4 and xps fig s5 results further confirmed that i element was present on s fe0 surface after reaction 5 min the presence of i element might can improve the electrochemical characteristics of s fe0 thus accelerated its the electron transfer rate li et al 2017 no obvious other products except fe0 were detected in s fe0 before and after oxidation via xrd which might because the low concentration of these products inducing the difficulty in xrd detection wen et al 2022 fig s6 xps could detect the photoelectrons from the outer surface of 10 nm thus surface chemical compositions fe0 and s fe0 before and after reaction were further analyzed by xps as shown in the fe 2p spectra fig 2e the peak at binding energy of 707 ev was assigned to fe0 the peak would not be detected on the s fe0 which might because oxide layer formed during the preparation of s fe could cover fe0 the peak at binding energy of 711 ev was assigned to fe ii s suggesting the reaction between fe and s the percentage of fe ii s in s fe0 decreased little after reaction which also suggested the good stability of s fe0 the peaks at binding energy of 724 ev and 714 ev were assigned to fe iii o du et al 2016 the percentage of fe iii o in s fe0 was enhanced indicating the occur of s fe0 oxidation which in accordance with little decrease of percentage of fe ii s and the disappearance of peak of fe0 three peaks at binding energy of 530 531 and 532 ev in the o 1 s spectrum of s fe0 before and after reaction were assigned to the iron oxide oh group and h2o respectively fig 2f wang et al 2022a the percentage of iron oxide and oh group were enhanced implying the generation of iron oxide species the peaks at binding energy of 162 163 164 168 and 169 ev were assigned to s2 s2 2 sn 2 so3 2 and so4 2 respectively fig 2g deng et al 2021 the presence of sulfur species could affect the physical and chemical properties of fe0 resulting in better reactivity of s fe0 the percentage of so4 2 was enhanced after reaction suggesting sulfur species could participate in the oxidation reaction the detection of i 3d spectra also demonstrated that i element was present on s fe0 surface after reaction fig 2h the peaks at binding energy of 624 ev and 636 ev were assigned to io3 and the peaks at binding energy of 619 ev and 630 ev were assigned to i cheng et al 2020 the presence of sulfur species could affect the hydrophobicity and fe0 reactivity thus the contact angle and nyquist plot were conducted as shown in fig s7 the presence of s could increase the contact angle from 35 7 to 61 5 demonstrating more hydrophobicity of s fe0 a more hydrophobic property could increase the likelihood of contact between surface and h2o thus inhibited the passivation of surface and improved its lifetime and catalytic activity according to fig s8 the specific surface area of s fe0 7 9 m2 g was also higher than fe0 3 0 m2 g which also demonstrating good reactivity of s fe0 the major function of the s layer on fe0 surface should be inhibition of hydrogen production and improve the electron efficiency xu et al 2021 nyquist plot could reflect the electron efficiency and the arc size of nyquist plot was smaller reflected higher electron conductivity the arc sizes of s fe0 was smaller than that of fe0 which suggested the higher reactivity of s fe0 fig 2i 3 2 2 dft calculation to further elucidate the promotion pi activation mechanism by s fe0 dft calculations were performed to analyze the roles of s and fe sites on s fe0 in activating pi fig s9 fes was regarded as an excellent metallic conductor due to its lower band gap 0 1 ev and strong reductivity while fes2 has a higher band gap 0 95 ev than fes it is less reactive to pi and sdz xu et al 2021 thus fes was chosen as model in this study as depicted in fig s9a pi adsorption energy on fe0 was 0 101 ev dft calculations were used to simulate the apical adsorption model of pi on fe0 and fes respectively as showed in fig s9c and fig s9e pi adsorption energy on the s site on fes was 3 591 ev and the adsorption energy on the fe site on fes was the 7 547 ev fig s9b and fig s9d the results demonstrated fes formed on the fe0 surface by the sulfidation could reduce the pi adsorption energy thus enhanced the activation of pi for pollutants removal and the adsorption of pi on the fe site was more favorable than that on the s site 3 3 reactive species determination 3 3 1 role of multiple reactive species in sdz removal multiple reactive species io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv could be produced in the pi based aops according to eqs 1 9 and so4 might also be generated due to the presence of sulfur species in the s fe0 pi system epr experiments were conducted to analyze the possible production of reactive species in s fe0 pi system dong et al 2022 chen et al 2021b as depicted in fig 3 a dmpo oh dmpo so4 dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 adduct signals could be observed in s fe0 pi system suggesting oh so4 o2 and 1o2 could be produced in the s fe0 pi system pmso was selected to analyze whether feiv was present in s fe0 pi system because pmso could be converted to pmso2 by feiv oxidation rather than other reactive species wang et al 2020 as depicted in fig 3b negligible pmso could be oxidized by pi only and only a small amount of pmso could be oxidized in fe0 pi system while pmso could be oxidized rapidly with the production of pmso2 in s fe0 pi system fig s10 showed the yield of pmso2 was above 80 suggesting feiv could be produced in s fe0 pi system io3 could not be detected by conclusive methods the possible generation of io3 and the role of multiple reactive species in sdz removal were analyzed via scavenging experiments as depicted in fig 3c various inhibitors including tba meoh l his sod phenol and ki were selected to verify the role of various reactive species l his could quench 1o2 sod could quench o2 tba could quench oh cat could quench h2o2 meoh could quench oh so4 and fe iv phenol could quench oh so4 fe iv and io3 ki could quench both surface bound and aqueous reactive species bendjama et al 2018 pan et al 2020 tba could significantly inhibited the sdz removal and the removal efficiency decreased from 97 6 to 47 4 indicating oh contributed important role to sdz removal in s fe0 pi system 351 6 μm oh could be detected within 5 min which also verified the significant role of oh fig 3d meoh could further inhibited the sdz removal efficiency to 39 9 suggesting so4 and feiv also contributed minor role in sdz removal both epr experiments and quantitative determination of so4 fig 3e demonstrated a small amount of so4 could be produced inducing minor role in sdz removal feiv could be generated rapidly while its oxidation ability was much lower than oh made it less effective for sdz removal phenol could further inhibited sdz removal to 28 1 suggesting io3 also contributed minor for sdz removal l his and sod could inhibited sdz removal from 97 6 to 81 9 and 56 3 suggesting 1o2 and o2 also affected the sdz removal efficiency because they might affect the production of oh thus affected the pollutants removal efficiency the scavenging experiments by adding mixed inhibitors were also performed fig 3f depicted that sdz removal efficiency could decreased from 39 9 with only meoh inhibitor to 32 0 with meoh l his and 18 9 with meoh sod suggesting both 1o2 and o2 were the main reactive species and o2 participated more role than 1o2 in sdz removal fig 3c also showed that ki could inhibited the sdz removal efficiency to 37 7 which was close to 39 9 with meoh inhibitor demonstrating surface bound reactive species might play minor role in sdz removal in s fe0 pi system 3 3 2 dominant pathway of reactive species production io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv and so4 could be produced via various pathways thus the dominant pathway of various reactive species production were performed oh could be produced via eq 2 and eq 3 by the reaction between fe2 and h2o2 and fe2 and pi as depicted in fig 4 a about 80 μm h2o2 could be detected during the reaction in s fe0 pi system as shown in fig 4b sdz removal efficiency was 47 3 after adding cat which was same as the sdz removal efficiency after adding tba fig 4c also depicted that negligible oh could be detected after adding cat in s fe0 pi system epr experiments were further conducted to detect the variation of adduct signals intensity after adding different inhibitors in s fe0 pi system fig 4d showed that the intensity of dmpo oh in s fe0 pi system decreased significantly after adding cat and completely inhibited after adding tba these results could suggest that the reaction between fe2 and h2o2 eq 2 was the main dominant pathway for production of oh h2o2 could be produced via eq 7 by the reaction between o2 and h2o thus o2 production pathways also determinate the oh production pathway fig 4c and fig 4d showed that oh production and intensity of dmpo oh after adding sod were close to that after adding cat which also suggested that h2o2 was produced from o2 o2 could be generated via eq 4 eq 5 and eq 6 the reaction rate between fe3 and h2o2 was much lower than that between fe2 and h2o2 thus eq 5 was not the dominant o2 production pathway according to fig 4d fig 4e and fig s11 n2 exposure would not affect the production of oh o2 and performance of s fe0 pi system for sdz removal suggesting eq 4 was also not the dominant o2 production pathway therefore the reaction fe2 and pi eq 6 was the dominant o2 production pathway 1o2 could be produced via eq 7 and eq 8 as depicted in fig 4e the addition sod could significantly decrease the intensity of temp adduct signal suggesting 1o2 was mainly produced from o2 the contribution of eq 7 and eq 8 were hard to exactly differentiate and more efforts needed to differentiate their contribution for 1o2 production io3 could be produced by eq 1 and feiv could be produced via eq 9 so3 2 and s2 were the major sulfur species in the s fe0 according to the previous reports so4 was mainly produced via pi activation by s2 eq 12 wang et al 2021 as depicted in fig s12 38 9 sdz could be removed in s2 pi system and so4 was contributed important role in sdz removal in s2 pi system 12 s 2 4 io 4 h 2 o 4 io 3 so 4 reduced sulfur species accelerated the pi activation and radical generation by assisting fe2 regeneration sulfur species would not affect the reaction between fe2 and pi thus s fe0 pi and fe2 pi might share the same dominant routine of reactive species production therefore dft calculations between fe2 and pi were further performed to investigate possible dominant production pathway and the role of io3 oh o2 1o2 and feiv in pollutants removal from the point of thermodynamics and the model sketches were shown in fig s13 fig 4f showed the pi induced reaction pathway pi could direct react with fe2 to form io3 eq 1 oh eq 3 o2 eq 6 and feiv eq 9 and pi could react with o2 to form 1o2 eq 8 the energy barrier of reaction 1 3 6 8 9 was 12 4 107 0 134 0 111 7 and 42 6 kcal mol 1 respectively the relatively lower energy barrier for io3 and feiv production suggesting the io3 and feiv could be relatively easier produced by the pi oxidization directly fig 4g depicted the energy barrier for dominant pathway of various reactive species according to the above analysis io3 o2 and feiv dominant pathway was reaction 1 6 and 9 respectively oh dominant pathway was 6 7 2 1o2 could be produced via 6 7 and 6 8 the total energy barrier for 1o2 via 6 7 196 8 kcal mol 1 was lower than that of 6 8 245 7 kcal mol 1 suggesting the routine 6 7 was more likely to be the dominant pathway for 1o2 production than the routine 6 8 although oh production obtained relatively higher energy barrier than others while oh exhibited the larger oxidation ability inducing oh contributed significant role in sdz removal 3 4 sdz degradation pathway and toxicity assessment dft was adopted to calculate fukui index and sdz molecular charge distribution and the results were depicted in fig 5 a c and table s3 higher f0 values indicate that they are the preferred sites for radical reactions according to the calculation results 4n 5c 7c 8n 15n 16o 17o have high f0 suggesting they are the most active sites which are inclined to be attacked by reactive species the lumo orbital energy of sdz is 0 04703 a u the homo orbital energy is 0 21909 a u and the energy difference between lumo and homo represented as the energy gap egap is 0 17206 a u intermediates produced in the degradation of sdz in s fe0 pi system were also further identified by uplc ms table s4 fig s14 and the possible sdz degradation pathways were proposed in fig 5d nine intermediates could be detected namely 4 nitro n pyrimidin 2 yl benzenesulfonamide b e nitro 4 nitrophenyl sulfonamide methylene carbamic acid c sulfanilic acid d 2 aminopyrimidine e hydroxyl sulfanilic acid f 4 amino 2 3 5 trihydroxybenzenesulfonic acid g benzenesulfonic acid h 4 2 imino pyrimidine 1 2h yl aniline i and hydroxylated sdz j based on the detected intermediates and previous research findings three possible sdz degradation pathways were proposed 1 c n bond α position of sdz a was attacked by reactive species then oxidized to b b could be further oxidized to open the pyrimidine ring generating c 2 s n bond β position of a was attacked by reactive species extruding so2 to form d and e d could be further oxidized to f g and h and i could be produced by smiles type rearrangement of d and e 3 j could be produced by attacking the c n bond in the pyrimidine γ position from a duan et al 2020 ultimately these intermediates would be further oxidized to co2 and h2o toxicity assessment of transformation products is important for evaluating status of pollutants degradation as depicted in fig 6 a d and table s5 acute toxicity lc50 growth inhibition igc50 developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of these intermediates were predicted according to acute toxicity lc50 of these intermediates most of intermediates were less harmful than sdz except product c and j which were slightly higher harmful than sdz according to growth inhibition igc50 of these intermediates all intermediates were less harmful than sdz according to developmental toxicity of these intermediates most of intermediates were also less toxicity than except i which was slightly higher toxicity than sdz although mutagenicity value of intermediates were higher than sdz all of intermediates were negative the toxicity of pi is relatively low but possible generation of reactive iodine species i e i2 i3 and hoi contain potential environmental risks have raised great concerns in pi based aops therefore it is worthy to investigate iodine species production and evaluate the toxicity of the iodine species in s fe0 pi system as shown in fig 6e io3 generated with the consumption of pi and io3 is nontoxic iodine species as shown in fig 6f i2 and i3 were not detected in the s fe0 pi system using the starch colorimetric method as depicted in fig 6g 4 iodophenol 4 ip and 2 iodophenol 2 ip were also not detected suggesting that hoi was not produced these results indicated that s fe0 was incapable of converting pi to the low valence iodine species besides in order to further explore the toxicities of sdz solution before and after s fe0 pi treatment bioluminescent bacteria experiment and seed germination experiment were carried out fig 6h the inhibition rate of v fischeri in sdz solution dilute 1000 times before reaction was 18 24 however after 120 min reaction sdz was mostly mineralized resulting in the decrease of its toxicity dilute 1000 times 0 to v fischeri the germination photos of soybean after 7 days of cultivation were shown in insert pictures it can be seen that after 120 min degradation soybeans had longer buds therefore it can be concluded that s fe0 pi could also effectively alleviate the toxicity of actual wastewater moreover fig 6i showed that toc removal efficiency could achieve 71 5 overall s fe0 pi process was an environmental friendly approach for sdz removal which could efficiently mineralize sdz and reduce the toxicity 3 5 effect of reaction parameters 3 5 1 effect of s fe ratio as depicted in fig 7 a sdz removal efficiency within 5 min significantly improved from 9 5 to 97 6 with the s fe mol ratio increasing from 0 to 1 30 demonstrating the presence of sulfur species could significantly enhance the sdz removal efficiency s fe0 obtained better reactivity and the presence of sulfur species could reduce fe3 to fe2 thus improved the catalytic performance as can be seen in fig s15 more total dissolved fe ions and fe2 ions could be produced in with increase of s fe ratio excessive sulfur species would inhibit the sdz removal efficiency and only 20 8 sdz could be removed within 5 min at 1 5 s fe ratio excessive sulfur species could block the active sites of s fe0 due to the excessive iron sulfides deposited on s fe0 surface 3 5 2 effect of initial ph the effect of initial ph 3 7 on sdz removal in s fe0 pi system were also conducted fig 7b showed that the appropriate ph value of s fe0 pi process for sdz removal was acid condition and the sdz removal within 5 min was 97 6 89 6 65 2 42 7 and 21 0 at ph 3 4 5 6 and 7 high ph is not conducive to degradation due to the following reasons 1 low s fe0 reactivity 2 under alkaline conditions iron hydroxide precipitates such as fe oh 3 are formed to adhere to the surface of the catalyst and the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the catalyst inhibits its ability to activate io4 3 io4 is the dominant species in the oxidation system and the periodate in the solution mainly exists in the form of h2i2o10 4 as well as the oxidation potential decreases from 1 6 ev io4 to 0 7 ev as initial ph increased li et al 2022a the change in the form of periodate enhances the electrostatic repulsion with the negative charges on the catalyst surface and is not conducive to the interaction with the catalyst surface due to the low reactivity of s fe0 at high initial ph limited the production of fe2 then limited the pi activation efficiency to further clarified the key factor affecting the s fe0 pi process performance at different ph fe2 was added before reaction in s fe0 pi system at different ph as depicted in fig s16 sdz removal efficiency could enhance with addition of fe2 while sdz removal efficiency at ph 7 still much lower than that at ph 3 hence the optimal ph of s fe0 pi process treating sdz was ph 3 3 5 3 effect of s fe0 dosage as shown in fig 7c and fig 7d the effect of fe0 0 05 1 g l in fe0 pi system and s fe0 dosage 0 02 0 2 g l in s fe0 pi system on sdz removal were investigated the increase of fe0 and s fe0 dosage could significantly enhance the sdz removal efficiency in both fe0 pi and s fe0 pi systems the optimal fe0 dosage was 1 g l and the optimal s fe0 dosage was only 0 1 g l according to the results the optimal s fe0 dosage was much lower than the optimal fe0 dosage but with much higher sdz removal efficiency therefore sulfidation could reduce more than 90 fe0 dosage but obtained a higher sdz removal efficiency 3 5 4 effect of pi dosage the effect of pi dosage on sdz removal in fe0 pi and s fe0 pi systems were also conducted as shown in fig 7e and fig 7f the increase of pi dosage could also significantly enhance the sdz removal efficiency in both fe0 pi and s fe0 pi systems the optimal pi dosage was 5 mm in fe0 pi system and the optimal pi dosage was 1 mm in s fe0 pi system therefore s fe0 pi process could also reduce more than 80 pi dosage 3 6 reaction mechanism according to the above discussion a possible reaction mechanism in the s fe0 pi system was indicated in fig 8 sulfidation could improve the reactivity of fe0 thereby accelerating fe corrosion rate and the presence of sulfur species i e s2 so3 2 could enhance the regeneration of fe2 ling et al 2022 a large amount of fe2 could efficiently activate pi producing multiple reactive species for pollutants removal io3 and feiv could be produced directly by the reaction between fe2 and pi zong et al 2021 and so4 could be produced by the reaction between s2 and pi wang et al 2021 io3 feiv and so4 played minor role in sdz removal in the present system the dominant routine of o2 production was also the reaction between fe2 and pi then the dominant routine of 1o2 production was the generated o2 further reacted with h2o he et al 2022 o2 participated more role than 1o2 in sdz removal h2o2 could also be produced by the reaction between o2 and h2o then fe2 could catalyze h2o2 producing oh oh was the major role in sdz removal and the dominant routine of oh production was io4 o2 h2o2 oh 3 7 comparison of antibiotics degradation by different processes in order to further investigate the advantages of s fe0 activating pi and the performance of s fe0 pi system for removing antibiotics performance of different pi activation methods to remove pollutants and performance of various processes for removing sdz were compared as depicted in table 1 pi could be activated by uv fes i gac fe2 mno2 nfe0 ni n rgo cosa and sbc for various pollutants removal du et al 2020 lee et al 2014 li et al 2017 long et al 2021 wang et al 2021 xiao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 zong et al 2021 according to the comparison results the activation of pi by s fe0 was a relatively good method for pollutants removal and the value of k for pollutants removal was much higher than others pi activation approaches fe2 could also activate pi for sdz removal efficiently while the dosage of fe2 was 0 25 mm which would largely enhance reagents and secondary iron sludge pollution treatment costs the results also demonstrated the necessity of using s fe for pi activation as shown in table 2 various processes treating sdz such as discharge plasma uv cu2o bi bi2moo6 bc fe pds mos2 fe3 pms and etc were compared cai et al 2020 chen et al 2021a li et al 2020a 2021 ma et al 2021 niu et al 2021 xu et al 2020b s fe0 pi obtained 3 16 min 1 value of k and 71 5 toc removal efficiency for sdz treatment which also much higher than other techniques the comparison results demonstrated that the study process s fe0 pi was an efficient approach for sdz removal 4 conclusion in the present study s fe0 was used to activate pi for sdz removal s fe0 pi process could efficiently remove sdz and had superior resistance to inorganic ions and nature organic matters excellent reusability of s fe0 good applicability to different pollutants and good performance for antibiotics removal in nature fresh water sem xps ft ir contact angle nyquist plot and dft calculation were performed to illustrate the mechanism of efficient activation of pi by s fe0 io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv and so4 all participated in sdz removal oh played the major role in sdz removal and the dominant routine of oh production was io4 o2 h2o2 oh s fe0 pi process could also efficiently reduce the toxicity comparison results further

15834,in this work sulfide modified zero valent iron s fe0 was used to activate periodate io4 pi for sulfadiazine sdz removal 60 μm sdz could be completely removed within only 1 min by s fe0 pi process compared with other oxidants including h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds s fe0 activated pi exhibited better performance for sdz removal but with lower fe leaching compared with fe0 pi process s fe0 pi process could reduce more than 80 fe0 and pi dosage inorganic ions and nature organic matters had negligible effect on sdz removal in s fe0 pi system inducing its good sdz

could efficiently mineralize sdz and reduce the toxicity comparison with other pi activation approaches and sdz treatment techniques further demonstrated s fe0 was an efficient catalyst for pi activation and present study process was a promising approach for antibiotics removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfide modified zero valent iron periodate density functional theory reactive species 1 introduction nowadays antibiotics can be frequently detected in natural environment and have been potential risks to human health and ecosystems sulfadiazine sdz as a typical sulfonamide antibiotic has been widely used for prevention of bacterial infections sdz is frequently detected in natural fresh water ground water sediment and wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluent although concentration of sdz in different water bodies is ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 it can lead to high incidences of antibiotic resistance which causes great threats to ecosystems and public health zhao et al 2017 various approaches have been conducted for treatment of sdz including advance oxidation processes aops ion exchange biological treatment and adsorption cai et al 2020 manjunath et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 zhou et al 2016 aops have been considered as alternative approaches for wastewater treatment due to the production of reactive species li et al 2022b c tian et al 2022 periodate pi io4 based aops have recently raised increasing attention because multiple reactive species including iodate radical io3 hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 can be generated by the activation of pili et al 2022a pi can be activated by uv radiation hydroxylamine alkali and transition metals bokare and choi 2015 chia et al 2004 fang et al 2022 lee et al 2016 sun et al 2020 zong et al 2021 iron fe has been extensively investigated to activate oxidants due to its environmental benignity and cost effectiveness fe2 can activate pi generating io3 oh o2

by low recycle efficiency of fe2 sulfide modified zero valent iron s fe0 has been extensively investigated for activation of peroxides h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds etc and considered as a good catalyst for substituting fe2 due to the following reasons 1 s fe0 exhibits high reactivity 2 the reduced sulfur species include polysulfide sn 2 sulfate so4 2 sulfite so3 2 disulfide s2 2 and monosulfide s2 can guarantee the regeneration of fe2 3 the presence of sulfurs species can also alleviate fe0 passivation cai et al 2021 garcia et al 2021 xu et al 2020a the performance of s fe0 on pi activation has never been systematically investigated the presence of sulfurs might have multiple roles in enhancing the performance of s fe0 pi process including 1 improving the reactivity of s fe0 2 accelerating the regeneration of fe2 3 activating pi for pollutants removal therefore it is worthy to investigate the efficiency s fe0 pi process and the mechanism of enhanced pi activation by s fe0 multiple reactive species io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv contribute to pollutants removal in the pi based aops chia et al reported that io3 was the dominant reactive species for pollutants removal chia et al 2004 sun et al reported that 1o2 can be produced in alkaline periodate solution and oh o2 and 1o2 are present in hydroxylamine pi system bokare and choi 2015 sun et al 2020 zong et al suggested that io3 oh o2 1o2 and feiv all produced in fe2 pi system zong et al 2021 therefore which reactive species produce in s fe0 pi system and the reason why different reactive species play different role in pollutants removal need to clarify in detail meanwhile which reaction paths dominate generation of different reactive species have not investigated clearly the present study first reports that periodate can be efficiently activated by s fe0 to achieve the rapid removal of various organic pollutants superior resistance to inorganic ions and nature organic matters excellent reusability for sdz removal and good performance for antibiotics removal in natural freshwater secondly periodate activation strengthening mechanism by s fe0 is proposed thirdly reaction paths dominating the generation of multiple reactive species and the reason why these reactive species play various roles in sdz removal are systematically confirmed lastly possible sdz degradation pathway and toxicity

estimation software t e s t was applied to evaluate the toxicity of sdz and its degradation intermediates based on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar method guo et al 2022 the acute toxicity of fathead minnow and tetrahymena pyriformis developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of these organic compounds were selected as evaluation indicators total organic carbon toc of the reaction solution was measured using a toc analyzer analytik jena multi 3100 to test the effect of mineralization in addition the vibrio fischeri toxicity was tested using microtox model 500 analyzer according to our previous research wang et al 2022b the light inhibition rate can be quantified according to the bioluminescence of the vibrio fischeri in original sdz solution and water samples treated by s fe0 pi at exposure time of 15 min the inhibition rate was considered as the toxic effect 2 6 density functional theory calculation the molecular structure of sdz was optimized by density functional theory dft at b3lyp 6 31g level via gaussian program frisch et al 2010 humphrey et al 1996 the charges distribution of sdz could be determined via quantum chemical calculations to analyze the reactive sites fievez et al 2008 dft calculations using the vasp package codes kresse and furthmüller 1996a b were performed to clarify the role of s and fe sites in pi adsorption and activation by comparing the adsorption energy for pi on the fe site of fe0 the s site and fe site of fes in addition the reaction paths and thermodynamics of fe2 pi system were performed by dft calculations to verify the formation and roles of different ros 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and applicability of s fe0 pi process for sdz removal to evaluate the performance of s fe0 pi process sdz removal efficiency in various systems were compared fig 1 a the sdz removal efficiencies obtained by various processes were in the order s fe0 pi 97 6 s fe0 20 9 fe2 pi 16 7 fes pi 8 1 fe3 pi 6 9 fes2 pi 5 7 pi 4 1 20 9 sdz could be removed by s fe0 which might be owing to the reactive species produced by oxygen reduction reaction the performance of pi activation by s fe for sdz removal was much better than other catalysts fe2 could activate pi quickly within 15 s while negligible sdz could be further removed after 15 s owing to the difficulty in regeneration of fe2 fe0 fes2 and fes all could activate pi for removing sdz but with lower efficiency which might because their lower reactivity s fe0 possessed high reactivity and the presence of sulfurs species could guarantee the recycle of fe2 inducing the amazing performance for sdz by activation of pi and 95 6 sdz could be removed within only 1 min the efficiency of sdz removal by s fe0 activating different oxidants including pms pds h2o2 and pi were also compared as depicted in fig 1b and fig s1 not only better sdz removal efficiency achieved in s fe0 pi system but also with lower fe leaching which could reduce secondary iron sludge pollution treatment costs fig 1c showed the good stability of s fe0 and 80 2 sdz still could be removed within 2 min after 7th run conventional cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 were chosen to investigate the effect of inorganic ions on sdz removal inorganic ions especially hco3 had significant inhibition on pollutants removal in oh and so4 based aops because these inorganic ions could react with oh and so4 forming less reactive species guan et al 2018 as depicted in fig 1d various inorganic ions had small effect on sdz removal in s fe0 pi system which might because multiple reactive species could be produced in the system and inorganic ions could not influence the productions some reactive species like feiv fig 1e and fig s2 depicted the various pollutants removal efficiency in fe0 pi system and s fe0 pi system rhb ttz bpa and ibu removal efficiency and value of k were 90 9 1 263 min 1 97 7 1 472 min 1 81 9 0 798 min 1 and 70 7 0 230 min 1 in s fe0 pi system respectively while rhb ttz bpa and ibu removal efficiency and value of k were only 51 5 0 361 min 1 52 6 0 219 min 1 10 1 0 045 min 1 and 7 2 0 035 min 1 in fe0 pi system respectively s fe0 pi process exhibited 2 5 20 1 folds enhancement for various pollutants removal compared with fe0 pi process performance for antibiotics treatment in natural freshwater by s fe0 pi process was also conducted fig 1d and fig 1f the detailed water quality indicators of natural freshwater is depicted in table s2 as depicted in fig 1d sdz could also be removed efficiently in the natural freshwater by s fe0 pi process with performance close to that in deionized water which might be due to its good resistance to coexisting inorganic ions antibiotics concentration in natural freshwater were generally ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 thus the treatment of 2 μm sdz about 500 μg l 1 in s fe0 pi system was conducted with 5 mg l and 25 μm dosage of s fe0 and pi it could found from fig 1f that sdz could be completely removed within 20 min by s fe0 pi process and the dissolved total fe ions was only 0 28 mg l 0 16 mg l fe3 and 0 12 mg l fe2 which was lower than the iii water quality standard 0 3 mg l fe2 produced from corrosion of s fe0 and fe2 could quickly react with pi forming reactive species and fe3 0 12 mg l fe2 could also be detected after reaction which also demonstrated the reduced sulfur species could guarantee the regeneration of fe2 in summary s fe0 pi process exhibited excellent performance for various pollutants removal good stability of s fe0 good adaptability to inorganic ions and efficient performance for antibiotics in natural freshwater 3 2 promotion pi activation mechanism of s fe0 3 2 1 characterization of s fe0 sem images and their edx mapping tests of fe0 and s fe0 before and after reaction 5 min were proposed in fig 2 a d and fig s3 it was clear found from fig 2a d that the surface of s fe0 after 5 min reaction was much rougher than that of fe0 demonstrating the better reactivity of s fe0 as depicted in fig s3 fe o and s elements distributed on the s fe0 surface indicating s was successfully loaded on fe0 and the content of fe o and s was 91 3 wt 7 7 wt and 1 0 wt meanwhile i element was also evenly distributed on s fe0 surface after reaction suggesting activation of pi might also be happened on s fe0 surface moreover ft ir fig s4 and xps fig s5 results further confirmed that i element was present on s fe0 surface after reaction 5 min the presence of i element might can improve the electrochemical characteristics of s fe0 thus accelerated its the electron transfer rate li et al 2017 no obvious other products except fe0 were detected in s fe0 before and after oxidation via xrd which might because the low concentration of these products inducing the difficulty in xrd detection wen et al 2022 fig s6 xps could detect the photoelectrons from the outer surface of 10 nm thus surface chemical compositions fe0 and s fe0 before and after reaction were further analyzed by xps as shown in the fe 2p spectra fig 2e the peak at binding energy of 707 ev was assigned to fe0 the peak would not be detected on the s fe0 which might because oxide layer formed during the preparation of s fe could cover fe0 the peak at binding energy of 711 ev was assigned to fe ii s suggesting the reaction between fe and s the percentage of fe ii s in s fe0 decreased little after reaction which also suggested the good stability of s fe0 the peaks at binding energy of 724 ev and 714 ev were assigned to fe iii o du et al 2016 the percentage of fe iii o in s fe0 was enhanced indicating the occur of s fe0 oxidation which in accordance with little decrease of percentage of fe ii s and the disappearance of peak of fe0 three peaks at binding energy of 530 531 and 532 ev in the o 1 s spectrum of s fe0 before and after reaction were assigned to the iron oxide oh group and h2o respectively fig 2f wang et al 2022a the percentage of iron oxide and oh group were enhanced implying the generation of iron oxide species the peaks at binding energy of 162 163 164 168 and 169 ev were assigned to s2 s2 2 sn 2 so3 2 and so4 2 respectively fig 2g deng et al 2021 the presence of sulfur species could affect the physical and chemical properties of fe0 resulting in better reactivity of s fe0 the percentage of so4 2 was enhanced after reaction suggesting sulfur species could participate in the oxidation reaction the detection of i 3d spectra also demonstrated that i element was present on s fe0 surface after reaction fig 2h the peaks at binding energy of 624 ev and 636 ev were assigned to io3 and the peaks at binding energy of 619 ev and 630 ev were assigned to i cheng et al 2020 the presence of sulfur species could affect the hydrophobicity and fe0 reactivity thus the contact angle and nyquist plot were conducted as shown in fig s7 the presence of s could increase the contact angle from 35 7 to 61 5 demonstrating more hydrophobicity of s fe0 a more hydrophobic property could increase the likelihood of contact between surface and h2o thus inhibited the passivation of surface and improved its lifetime and catalytic activity according to fig s8 the specific surface area of s fe0 7 9 m2 g was also higher than fe0 3 0 m2 g which also demonstrating good reactivity of s fe0 the major function of the s layer on fe0 surface should be inhibition of hydrogen production and improve the electron efficiency xu et al 2021 nyquist plot could reflect the electron efficiency and the arc size of nyquist plot was smaller reflected higher electron conductivity the arc sizes of s fe0 was smaller than that of fe0 which suggested the higher reactivity of s fe0 fig 2i 3 2 2 dft calculation to further elucidate the promotion pi activation mechanism by s fe0 dft calculations were performed to analyze the roles of s and fe sites on s fe0 in activating pi fig s9 fes was regarded as an excellent metallic conductor due to its lower band gap 0 1 ev and strong reductivity while fes2 has a higher band gap 0 95 ev than fes it is less reactive to pi and sdz xu et al 2021 thus fes was chosen as model in this study as depicted in fig s9a pi adsorption energy on fe0 was 0 101 ev dft calculations were used to simulate the apical adsorption model of pi on fe0 and fes respectively as showed in fig s9c and fig s9e pi adsorption energy on the s site on fes was 3 591 ev and the adsorption energy on the fe site on fes was the 7 547 ev fig s9b and fig s9d the results demonstrated fes formed on the fe0 surface by the sulfidation could reduce the pi adsorption energy thus enhanced the activation of pi for pollutants removal and the adsorption of pi on the fe site was more favorable than that on the s site 3 3 reactive species determination 3 3 1 role of multiple reactive species in sdz removal multiple reactive species io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv could be produced in the pi based aops according to eqs 1 9 and so4 might also be generated due to the presence of sulfur species in the s fe0 pi system epr experiments were conducted to analyze the possible production of reactive species in s fe0 pi system dong et al 2022 chen et al 2021b as depicted in fig 3 a dmpo oh dmpo so4 dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 adduct signals could be observed in s fe0 pi system suggesting oh so4 o2 and 1o2 could be produced in the s fe0 pi system pmso was selected to analyze whether feiv was present in s fe0 pi system because pmso could be converted to pmso2 by feiv oxidation rather than other reactive species wang et al 2020 as depicted in fig 3b negligible pmso could be oxidized by pi only and only a small amount of pmso could be oxidized in fe0 pi system while pmso could be oxidized rapidly with the production of pmso2 in s fe0 pi system fig s10 showed the yield of pmso2 was above 80 suggesting feiv could be produced in s fe0 pi system io3 could not be detected by conclusive methods the possible generation of io3 and the role of multiple reactive species in sdz removal were analyzed via scavenging experiments as depicted in fig 3c various inhibitors including tba meoh l his sod phenol and ki were selected to verify the role of various reactive species l his could quench 1o2 sod could quench o2 tba could quench oh cat could quench h2o2 meoh could quench oh so4 and fe iv phenol could quench oh so4 fe iv and io3 ki could quench both surface bound and aqueous reactive species bendjama et al 2018 pan et al 2020 tba could significantly inhibited the sdz removal and the removal efficiency decreased from 97 6 to 47 4 indicating oh contributed important role to sdz removal in s fe0 pi system 351 6 μm oh could be detected within 5 min which also verified the significant role of oh fig 3d meoh could further inhibited the sdz removal efficiency to 39 9 suggesting so4 and feiv also contributed minor role in sdz removal both epr experiments and quantitative determination of so4 fig 3e demonstrated a small amount of so4 could be produced inducing minor role in sdz removal feiv could be generated rapidly while its oxidation ability was much lower than oh made it less effective for sdz removal phenol could further inhibited sdz removal to 28 1 suggesting io3 also contributed minor for sdz removal l his and sod could inhibited sdz removal from 97 6 to 81 9 and 56 3 suggesting 1o2 and o2 also affected the sdz removal efficiency because they might affect the production of oh thus affected the pollutants removal efficiency the scavenging experiments by adding mixed inhibitors were also performed fig 3f depicted that sdz removal efficiency could decreased from 39 9 with only meoh inhibitor to 32 0 with meoh l his and 18 9 with meoh sod suggesting both 1o2 and o2 were the main reactive species and o2 participated more role than 1o2 in sdz removal fig 3c also showed that ki could inhibited the sdz removal efficiency to 37 7 which was close to 39 9 with meoh inhibitor demonstrating surface bound reactive species might play minor role in sdz removal in s fe0 pi system 3 3 2 dominant pathway of reactive species production io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv and so4 could be produced via various pathways thus the dominant pathway of various reactive species production were performed oh could be produced via eq 2 and eq 3 by the reaction between fe2 and h2o2 and fe2 and pi as depicted in fig 4 a about 80 μm h2o2 could be detected during the reaction in s fe0 pi system as shown in fig 4b sdz removal efficiency was 47 3 after adding cat which was same as the sdz removal efficiency after adding tba fig 4c also depicted that negligible oh could be detected after adding cat in s fe0 pi system epr experiments were further conducted to detect the variation of adduct signals intensity after adding different inhibitors in s fe0 pi system fig 4d showed that the intensity of dmpo oh in s fe0 pi system decreased significantly after adding cat and completely inhibited after adding tba these results could suggest that the reaction between fe2 and h2o2 eq 2 was the main dominant pathway for production of oh h2o2 could be produced via eq 7 by the reaction between o2 and h2o thus o2 production pathways also determinate the oh production pathway fig 4c and fig 4d showed that oh production and intensity of dmpo oh after adding sod were close to that after adding cat which also suggested that h2o2 was produced from o2 o2 could be generated via eq 4 eq 5 and eq 6 the reaction rate between fe3 and h2o2 was much lower than that between fe2 and h2o2 thus eq 5 was not the dominant o2 production pathway according to fig 4d fig 4e and fig s11 n2 exposure would not affect the production of oh o2 and performance of s fe0 pi system for sdz removal suggesting eq 4 was also not the dominant o2 production pathway therefore the reaction fe2 and pi eq 6 was the dominant o2 production pathway 1o2 could be produced via eq 7 and eq 8 as depicted in fig 4e the addition sod could significantly decrease the intensity of temp adduct signal suggesting 1o2 was mainly produced from o2 the contribution of eq 7 and eq 8 were hard to exactly differentiate and more efforts needed to differentiate their contribution for 1o2 production io3 could be produced by eq 1 and feiv could be produced via eq 9 so3 2 and s2 were the major sulfur species in the s fe0 according to the previous reports so4 was mainly produced via pi activation by s2 eq 12 wang et al 2021 as depicted in fig s12 38 9 sdz could be removed in s2 pi system and so4 was contributed important role in sdz removal in s2 pi system 12 s 2 4 io 4 h 2 o 4 io 3 so 4 reduced sulfur species accelerated the pi activation and radical generation by assisting fe2 regeneration sulfur species would not affect the reaction between fe2 and pi thus s fe0 pi and fe2 pi might share the same dominant routine of reactive species production therefore dft calculations between fe2 and pi were further performed to investigate possible dominant production pathway and the role of io3 oh o2 1o2 and feiv in pollutants removal from the point of thermodynamics and the model sketches were shown in fig s13 fig 4f showed the pi induced reaction pathway pi could direct react with fe2 to form io3 eq 1 oh eq 3 o2 eq 6 and feiv eq 9 and pi could react with o2 to form 1o2 eq 8 the energy barrier of reaction 1 3 6 8 9 was 12 4 107 0 134 0 111 7 and 42 6 kcal mol 1 respectively the relatively lower energy barrier for io3 and feiv production suggesting the io3 and feiv could be relatively easier produced by the pi oxidization directly fig 4g depicted the energy barrier for dominant pathway of various reactive species according to the above analysis io3 o2 and feiv dominant pathway was reaction 1 6 and 9 respectively oh dominant pathway was 6 7 2 1o2 could be produced via 6 7 and 6 8 the total energy barrier for 1o2 via 6 7 196 8 kcal mol 1 was lower than that of 6 8 245 7 kcal mol 1 suggesting the routine 6 7 was more likely to be the dominant pathway for 1o2 production than the routine 6 8 although oh production obtained relatively higher energy barrier than others while oh exhibited the larger oxidation ability inducing oh contributed significant role in sdz removal 3 4 sdz degradation pathway and toxicity assessment dft was adopted to calculate fukui index and sdz molecular charge distribution and the results were depicted in fig 5 a c and table s3 higher f0 values indicate that they are the preferred sites for radical reactions according to the calculation results 4n 5c 7c 8n 15n 16o 17o have high f0 suggesting they are the most active sites which are inclined to be attacked by reactive species the lumo orbital energy of sdz is 0 04703 a u the homo orbital energy is 0 21909 a u and the energy difference between lumo and homo represented as the energy gap egap is 0 17206 a u intermediates produced in the degradation of sdz in s fe0 pi system were also further identified by uplc ms table s4 fig s14 and the possible sdz degradation pathways were proposed in fig 5d nine intermediates could be detected namely 4 nitro n pyrimidin 2 yl benzenesulfonamide b e nitro 4 nitrophenyl sulfonamide methylene carbamic acid c sulfanilic acid d 2 aminopyrimidine e hydroxyl sulfanilic acid f 4 amino 2 3 5 trihydroxybenzenesulfonic acid g benzenesulfonic acid h 4 2 imino pyrimidine 1 2h yl aniline i and hydroxylated sdz j based on the detected intermediates and previous research findings three possible sdz degradation pathways were proposed 1 c n bond α position of sdz a was attacked by reactive species then oxidized to b b could be further oxidized to open the pyrimidine ring generating c 2 s n bond β position of a was attacked by reactive species extruding so2 to form d and e d could be further oxidized to f g and h and i could be produced by smiles type rearrangement of d and e 3 j could be produced by attacking the c n bond in the pyrimidine γ position from a duan et al 2020 ultimately these intermediates would be further oxidized to co2 and h2o toxicity assessment of transformation products is important for evaluating status of pollutants degradation as depicted in fig 6 a d and table s5 acute toxicity lc50 growth inhibition igc50 developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of these intermediates were predicted according to acute toxicity lc50 of these intermediates most of intermediates were less harmful than sdz except product c and j which were slightly higher harmful than sdz according to growth inhibition igc50 of these intermediates all intermediates were less harmful than sdz according to developmental toxicity of these intermediates most of intermediates were also less toxicity than except i which was slightly higher toxicity than sdz although mutagenicity value of intermediates were higher than sdz all of intermediates were negative the toxicity of pi is relatively low but possible generation of reactive iodine species i e i2 i3 and hoi contain potential environmental risks have raised great concerns in pi based aops therefore it is worthy to investigate iodine species production and evaluate the toxicity of the iodine species in s fe0 pi system as shown in fig 6e io3 generated with the consumption of pi and io3 is nontoxic iodine species as shown in fig 6f i2 and i3 were not detected in the s fe0 pi system using the starch colorimetric method as depicted in fig 6g 4 iodophenol 4 ip and 2 iodophenol 2 ip were also not detected suggesting that hoi was not produced these results indicated that s fe0 was incapable of converting pi to the low valence iodine species besides in order to further explore the toxicities of sdz solution before and after s fe0 pi treatment bioluminescent bacteria experiment and seed germination experiment were carried out fig 6h the inhibition rate of v fischeri in sdz solution dilute 1000 times before reaction was 18 24 however after 120 min reaction sdz was mostly mineralized resulting in the decrease of its toxicity dilute 1000 times 0 to v fischeri the germination photos of soybean after 7 days of cultivation were shown in insert pictures it can be seen that after 120 min degradation soybeans had longer buds therefore it can be concluded that s fe0 pi could also effectively alleviate the toxicity of actual wastewater moreover fig 6i showed that toc removal efficiency could achieve 71 5 overall s fe0 pi process was an environmental friendly approach for sdz removal which could efficiently mineralize sdz and reduce the toxicity 3 5 effect of reaction parameters 3 5 1 effect of s fe ratio as depicted in fig 7 a sdz removal efficiency within 5 min significantly improved from 9 5 to 97 6 with the s fe mol ratio increasing from 0 to 1 30 demonstrating the presence of sulfur species could significantly enhance the sdz removal efficiency s fe0 obtained better reactivity and the presence of sulfur species could reduce fe3 to fe2 thus improved the catalytic performance as can be seen in fig s15 more total dissolved fe ions and fe2 ions could be produced in with increase of s fe ratio excessive sulfur species would inhibit the sdz removal efficiency and only 20 8 sdz could be removed within 5 min at 1 5 s fe ratio excessive sulfur species could block the active sites of s fe0 due to the excessive iron sulfides deposited on s fe0 surface 3 5 2 effect of initial ph the effect of initial ph 3 7 on sdz removal in s fe0 pi system were also conducted fig 7b showed that the appropriate ph value of s fe0 pi process for sdz removal was acid condition and the sdz removal within 5 min was 97 6 89 6 65 2 42 7 and 21 0 at ph 3 4 5 6 and 7 high ph is not conducive to degradation due to the following reasons 1 low s fe0 reactivity 2 under alkaline conditions iron hydroxide precipitates such as fe oh 3 are formed to adhere to the surface of the catalyst and the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the catalyst inhibits its ability to activate io4 3 io4 is the dominant species in the oxidation system and the periodate in the solution mainly exists in the form of h2i2o10 4 as well as the oxidation potential decreases from 1 6 ev io4 to 0 7 ev as initial ph increased li et al 2022a the change in the form of periodate enhances the electrostatic repulsion with the negative charges on the catalyst surface and is not conducive to the interaction with the catalyst surface due to the low reactivity of s fe0 at high initial ph limited the production of fe2 then limited the pi activation efficiency to further clarified the key factor affecting the s fe0 pi process performance at different ph fe2 was added before reaction in s fe0 pi system at different ph as depicted in fig s16 sdz removal efficiency could enhance with addition of fe2 while sdz removal efficiency at ph 7 still much lower than that at ph 3 hence the optimal ph of s fe0 pi process treating sdz was ph 3 3 5 3 effect of s fe0 dosage as shown in fig 7c and fig 7d the effect of fe0 0 05 1 g l in fe0 pi system and s fe0 dosage 0 02 0 2 g l in s fe0 pi system on sdz removal were investigated the increase of fe0 and s fe0 dosage could significantly enhance the sdz removal efficiency in both fe0 pi and s fe0 pi systems the optimal fe0 dosage was 1 g l and the optimal s fe0 dosage was only 0 1 g l according to the results the optimal s fe0 dosage was much lower than the optimal fe0 dosage but with much higher sdz removal efficiency therefore sulfidation could reduce more than 90 fe0 dosage but obtained a higher sdz removal efficiency 3 5 4 effect of pi dosage the effect of pi dosage on sdz removal in fe0 pi and s fe0 pi systems were also conducted as shown in fig 7e and fig 7f the increase of pi dosage could also significantly enhance the sdz removal efficiency in both fe0 pi and s fe0 pi systems the optimal pi dosage was 5 mm in fe0 pi system and the optimal pi dosage was 1 mm in s fe0 pi system therefore s fe0 pi process could also reduce more than 80 pi dosage 3 6 reaction mechanism according to the above discussion a possible reaction mechanism in the s fe0 pi system was indicated in fig 8 sulfidation could improve the reactivity of fe0 thereby accelerating fe corrosion rate and the presence of sulfur species i e s2 so3 2 could enhance the regeneration of fe2 ling et al 2022 a large amount of fe2 could efficiently activate pi producing multiple reactive species for pollutants removal io3 and feiv could be produced directly by the reaction between fe2 and pi zong et al 2021 and so4 could be produced by the reaction between s2 and pi wang et al 2021 io3 feiv and so4 played minor role in sdz removal in the present system the dominant routine of o2 production was also the reaction between fe2 and pi then the dominant routine of 1o2 production was the generated o2 further reacted with h2o he et al 2022 o2 participated more role than 1o2 in sdz removal h2o2 could also be produced by the reaction between o2 and h2o then fe2 could catalyze h2o2 producing oh oh was the major role in sdz removal and the dominant routine of oh production was io4 o2 h2o2 oh 3 7 comparison of antibiotics degradation by different processes in order to further investigate the advantages of s fe0 activating pi and the performance of s fe0 pi system for removing antibiotics performance of different pi activation methods to remove pollutants and performance of various processes for removing sdz were compared as depicted in table 1 pi could be activated by uv fes i gac fe2 mno2 nfe0 ni n rgo cosa and sbc for various pollutants removal du et al 2020 lee et al 2014 li et al 2017 long et al 2021 wang et al 2021 xiao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 zong et al 2021 according to the comparison results the activation of pi by s fe0 was a relatively good method for pollutants removal and the value of k for pollutants removal was much higher than others pi activation approaches fe2 could also activate pi for sdz removal efficiently while the dosage of fe2 was 0 25 mm which would largely enhance reagents and secondary iron sludge pollution treatment costs the results also demonstrated the necessity of using s fe for pi activation as shown in table 2 various processes treating sdz such as discharge plasma uv cu2o bi bi2moo6 bc fe pds mos2 fe3 pms and etc were compared cai et al 2020 chen et al 2021a li et al 2020a 2021 ma et al 2021 niu et al 2021 xu et al 2020b s fe0 pi obtained 3 16 min 1 value of k and 71 5 toc removal efficiency for sdz treatment which also much higher than other techniques the comparison results demonstrated that the study process s fe0 pi was an efficient approach for sdz removal 4 conclusion in the present study s fe0 was used to activate pi for sdz removal s fe0 pi process could efficiently remove sdz and had superior resistance to inorganic ions and nature organic matters excellent reusability of s fe0 good applicability to different pollutants and good performance for antibiotics removal in nature fresh water sem xps ft ir contact angle nyquist plot and dft calculation were performed to illustrate the mechanism of efficient activation of pi by s fe0 io3 oh o2 1o2 feiv and so4 all participated in sdz removal oh played the major role in sdz removal and the dominant routine of oh production was io4 o2 h2o2 oh s fe0 pi process could also efficiently reduce the toxicity comparison results further
