10165,the current scientific evidence shows that phosphorus p appears to mitigate the adverse effects derived from water deficit stress however the efficiency of wheat in the use of both components have been not addressed the objective of this study was to investigate the combined effect of p and water limiting conditions over phosphorus utilization efficiency pute and water use efficiency wue to categorize different wheat genotypes ten wheat genotypes including old current and advanced lines were screened for their ability to utilize phosphorus p and water plants were grown under controlled conditions on an andisol with soil p concentration of 4 mg p kg 1 inadequate p 4 p which was enriched to 30 mg p kg 1 adequate p 30 p irrigation was applied at two levels adequate irrigation w1 and 30 of w1 inadequate irrigation w2 wheat was grown until end of its phenological cycle the inadequate p and water produced a long delay on plant development especially on early vegetative stages as expected the genotypes showed differences in their growth development p accumulation and yield in response to inadequate p and water conditions the lowest performance in terms of plant growth development and yield was observed when both the p and water restrictions were applied genotypic differences were observed in terms of utilization of p and water on this basis wheat genotypes were grouped into three and four classes for pute wue respectively the most efficient genotype for all the conditions was fritz which obtained the highest score in the consolidated ranking for pute and wue on the contrary kirón was the most inefficient genotype a strong correlation 85 was observed between pute and wue which could enable the future selection of co adapted wheat genotypes efficient in the utilization of p and water keywords genotypic difference germplasm phosphorus deficit drought water deficit stress 1 introduction global food security is threatened by both the rapid increase in human population and the abrupt changes in the climate lesk et al 2016 drought and nutrient scarcity have become the most important limiting factors to crop production and food security cong et al 2020 fahad et al 2017a the reduction of precipitation and the modification of rainfall pattern are causing widespread water deficits around the world producing negative impacts on plant growth physiology and reproduction which in turn cause a substantial decline in crop yield fahad et al 2017b additionally the availability of soil nutrients for plant growth is influenced by water availability likewise agricultural water demand and use are influenced by nutrients supply sadras et al 2010 currently agriculture practices have become dependent on the use of fertilizers without which global food production would be reduced by a half bruinsma 2017 unlike nitrogen which can be biologically and industrially fixed from the atmospheric source a virtually infinite reservoir the dependency on phosphate fertilizers is unsustainable as it is manufactured from phosphate rocks that has finite stocks cong et al 2020 nevertheless estimates of the global phosphorus p reserves vary widely recent reassessments suggest that they may be exhausted even within this century fixen and johnston 2012 johnston et al 2014 although p is a key element required for normal plant development it has low mobility in soils resulting in poor uptake by plants thereby reducing growth and yield sadras et al 2010 previous studies suggest that p availability affects root system architecture rsa and p deficiency will exacerbate water stress by shifting root deployment from deep to shallow roots sardans and peñuelas 2012 thus the application of p fertilizers to p deficient soils stimulates a series of physiological morphological and biochemical adjustments in plants that play an important role over water stress adaptation faustino et al 2013 although p supply exerts an important role on plant performance under water deficit stress the overall low p availability in agricultural soils is one of the major constraints for crop production worldwide cong et al 2020 roberts and johnston 2015 therefore to improve crop production and ensure food security under climate change scenario it will be crucial to enhance p fertilization management through the implementation of new agronomic strategies and or the utilization of p efficient genotypes van de wiel et al 2016 while the first option increases operational costs and requires more technology that is often not accessible to farmers the use of p use efficient genotypes would provide benefits to both high and low input systems cong et al 2020 in this context there are several calculation methods relevant for the discussion of crop p efficiency in general the p use efficiency pue is defined as the plant s ability to produce biomass or yield at a given p supply richardson et al 2011 pue can be divided into p acquisition efficiency pae and p utilization efficiency pute boucho et al 2019 de souza campos et al 2019 sandaña and pinochet 2014 pae refers to the ability of crops to extract p from soils in order to produce higher biomass with lower input whereas pute involves optimization of harvest index while reducing plant p demand and or enhancing its internal utilization recycling irfan et al 2020 however the contribution of pute to p crop efficiency varies with crop species and environmental conditions including water deficit stress condition in this regard waraich et al 2011 stated that a proper plant p management can play a crucial role for enhancing water use efficiency wue and plant performance is mainly a p driven effect rather than water deficit stress however the combined effects of p under wue have rarely been studied wheat triticum aestivum l is the third most cultivated crop in the world and consumes much more p fertilizer than rice and maize food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2007 it has been projected that annual world wheat demand will increase a 43 by 2050 fao 2011 as a consequence of climate change wheat growing area have been reduced to about 15 without climate change mitigation policies up to 60 of the current wheat growing area will face severe water shortage events by the end of this century trnka et al 2019 thus a major challenge for wheat production improvement is to plan for future climate change scenarios including water deficit stress which will be exacerbated by p inadequacy recently a data set based on more than 1700 simulation models indicated a negative impact of climate change on wheat yield in different regions around the globe including usa if no adaptation measures are considered challinor et al 2014 however the same data set predicted a yield increase between 8 and 15 if more effective climate change adapted wheat genotypes are developed efficient wheat genotypes adapted to inadequate p and water conditions should be evaluated to generate phenotyping data as a priority need to crop modeling germeier and unger 2019 in addition wheat breeders will need to use newly generated phenotyping information on water and p use efficiencies to integrate desirable traits into existing genotypes or advanced material lines to improve wheat productivity in areas with limited amounts of p and water blum 2009 therefore identification and screening of wheat genotypes responsible for p efficiency is a pre requisite for such exploitation of genetic variation van de wiel et al 2016 nevertheless there is insufficient knowledge about the selection of efficient wheat genotypes subjected to a combined effect of p and water deficiency the objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of inadequate p and water conditions over pute and wue for the selection co adapted wheat genotypes for plant breeding 2 materials and methods ten wheat genotypes including ancient and current genotypes as well as some advanced lines were used to evaluate pute and wue table 1 the genotypes were selected based on previous information developed by the wheat breeding program of the instituto de investigaciones agropecuarias inia as well as the reports of vázquez et al 2012 sandaña and pinochet 2014 and seguel et al 2017 an agricultural volcanic soil barros arana series medial mesic typic

2 v v sodium hypochlorite for 15 min and sown in 7 l soil polythene lined plastic pots 20 20 25 centimeters after germination the plants were thinned to four plants per pot nitrogen n and potassium k were added at an equivalent dose of 220 kg n ha 1 split into 3 applications whereas 120 kg k2o ha 1 were applied at plant establishment urea and potassium sulfate were used as a source for n and k respectively the soil was mixed thoroughly after fertilizer application there were two irrigation treatments w1 adequate irrigation and 30 of water applied to w1 w2 inadequate irrigation the irrigation water applied for w1 was determined using the concept of total available soil water taw mm soil water depletion fraction p and readily available soil water raw mm in this study a value of p

from frequency domain reflectometry fdr sensor data raw flow rate of the emitters and irrigation efficiency was determined for irrigation time the amount of irrigation water was defined by the drippers flow rate netafim ltd tel aviv israel for treatments w1 and w2 pressure compensating button drippers were used in each pot with a discharge of 4 0 and 1 2 l h respectively soil water

using a datalogger zl6 meter group inc usa fig 1 volumetric moisture sensors were previously calibrated on the basis of physical properties of soil table 2 following the method proposed by lópez olivari and ortega klose 2020 plants were grown under semi controlled conditions in a greenhouse 16 8 h light dark photo period with windows open in order to emulate field conditions but prohibiting rain water wheat phenological stages were recorded during the entire growth period using feekes scale large 1954 wheat plants were harvested at maturity stage feekes growth stage number 11 4 and grains were removed manually shoots and roots were washed with milli q water after separation roots shoots and grains were oven dried in a forced air oven at 70 c for 48 h followed by weighing samples

hanson 1950 phosphorus uptake was calculated by multiplying p concentration and biomass of shoots roots or grains phosphorus utilization efficiency and wue were calculated according to the following equations pute mg square gy per μ g p grain yield grain p concentration mg g x 1000 bilal et al 2018 wue g pot l 1 grain yield water applied meena et al 2019 2 2 categorization of wheat genotypes for pute and wue two different method will be used to categorize and select wheat according to their pute and wue 2 2 1 method 1 wheat genotypes were classified into 3 categories as proposed by osborne and rengel 2002 and aziz et al 2011 i efficient e ii medium m iii inefficient i genotypes were assigned as efficient if their pute or wue mean was higher to the mean plus standard deviation of the total population of genotypes evaluated μ sd medium if their mean was between μ sd and μ sd and inefficient if their pute or wue mean was less than the mean minus standard deviation of the entire population μ sd the score assigned was 3 to efficient e 2 to medium m and 1 to inefficient i genotypes in the respective parameters cumulative score was calculated as the sum of the individual scores of different parameters of each genotype 2 2 2 method 2 wheat genotypes were classified into four categories i efficient and responsive er ii efficient and non responsive enr iii inefficient but responsive ir and iv inefficient and non responsive inr according to bilal et al 2018 efficient refers to genotypes having a grain yield higher than their mean and responsive refers to genotypes having pue and or wue higher than their average and vice versa cumulative score was calculated as the sum of the individual scores of different parameters of each genotype 2 3 statistical analyses the experiment was conducted in a split plot arrangement in a completely randomized design the irrigation treatments were the main plot 2 irrigation levels w1 and w2 and the soil p concentrations were the sub plot factor 2 p levels p4 and p30 the experiment was conducted with three replicates per treatment n 120 the means of the replicates of each treatment were compared by one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test at a probability p level of 0 05 pearson correlation were uses to evaluate the relation of pute and wue the normality of the residuals and variance homoscedasticity were tested by the shapiro wilk s and levene s tests before anova 3 results the physical properties of volcanic soil were related to the organic matter om content the values of bulk density ρ b field capacity fc wilting point wp organic matter om and ph were 0 76 mg m 3 0 58 cm3 cm 3 0 38 cm3 cm 3 20 and 5 8 respectively table 1 presenting a high water retention and with high physical and mechanical stability casanova et al 2013 on the other hand all the analyzed variables in the experiment changed significantly p 0 01 for the plant genotype g and phosphorus treatment pt with strong interactions between both factors g x pt table 3 the irrigation treatments it influenced most of the variables with the exception of root shoot ratio and p concentration in grain however it showed smaller effects on experimental variance compared to the pts which is evidenced by their low f values few significant interactions were observed between g x it as well as among the other factors evaluated g x it x pt however positive interactions p 0 01 among pute and wue were observed in all the variables evaluated tables 3 and 8 3 1 effect of phosphorus and water limiting conditions on wheat phenology growth and yield production 3 1 1 plant phenology the wheat genotypes showed differences in their growth and development in response to p and water limiting conditions table 4 the inadequate p condition produced a long delay in the plant development which were clearly evidenced on early growth stages figs s1 s10 supplementary material in particular the number of days required to reach the leaf sheaths strongly erected feekes state 5 f5 was delayed by 40 days in genotype fritz to 105 days in tukán and dollinco under inadequate p condition figs s8 s5 and s3 respectively this effect was even more evident when both the water and the p stress were simultaneously imposed w2 p4 the number of days required to reach f5 was delayed by 60 127 days figs s1 s10 the inadequate irrigation w2 produced a growth delay by a mean of 4 9 21 8 days in the wheat genotypes subjected to p4 and p30 treatments respectively to reach the leaf sheaths strongly erected stage the growth delay subsequently delayed the reproductive stage figs s1 s10 low p condition delayed reproductive stage by 10 and 20 days under adequate and inadequate water conditions respectively mean of ten genotypes figs s1 s10 3 1 2 plant growth and yield wheat genotypes varied in their response to inadequate p and water conditions in terms of plant growth traits and yield component parameters table 4 the lowest plant growth and yield was observed when the combination of p and water restrictions were applied w2 p4 the adequate p concentration and inadequate irrigation w2 p30 increased the plant growth by 2 5 and 6 5 times for shoots and roots respectively table s2 supplementary document this effect was more apparent for the adequate p and adequate irrigation w1 p30 and plant growth increased by 3 2 and 7 times for shoots and roots respectively table s2 unlike p30 treatments p4 treatment did not result in difference in shoot biomass production either in w1 or w2 treatments table s2 in p30 treatment the most responsive genotypes were kirón and lanco conversely fritz and tukán were the least responsive in terms of shoot biomass table s2 fritz showed a high root biomass production under inadequate water and p conditions w2 p4 when p concentration was increased w2 p30 this genotype had the lowest root growth in that the relevant group table s2 under adequate water and p conditions w1 p30 the genotype dollinco showed the highest root biomass production whereas fritz showed the lowest root biomass table s2 3 2 phosphorus in plant tissues both the concentration and the uptake of p by plants were negatively affected by inadequate p and water condition table s3 compared to w2 p4 treatment adequate p condition increased the shoot p concentration by 2 5 and 3 2 times in both w2 and w1 respectively a similar trend was observed by the adequate water condition w2 which increased shoot p concentration by 1 5 and 1 9 times higher than that of p4 and p30 treatments respectively both in comparison to w2 p4 table s3 for inadequate water and inadequate p conditions i e w2 p4 treatment the genotypes lanco maxwell and kirón showed the highest shoot p concentration and p uptake when the p supply level was high w2 p30 kirón had exhibited the highest shoot p concentration which was more noticeable under adequate water conditions i e w1 p30 treatment table s3 moreover under an adequate water condition kirón showed the highest shoot p uptake either in p4 or p30 treatments conversely the lowest shoot p concentration and p uptake were generally observed in fritz table s3 the inadequate water and inadequate p neither affected the root p concentration nor the root p uptake table s3 in w2 p30 w1 p4 and w1 p30 the highest root p concentration was found in the genotypes maxwell advanced line 338 and tukán respectively table s3 3 3 categorization of genotypes for phosphorus and water use efficiency 3 3 1 method 1 the genotypes varied in their p and water use efficiency under all the conditions tables 3 and 4 the most efficient genotype for pute and wue was fritz tables 5 6 and 7 figs 2 and 3 which achieved the maximum score in all the treatments applied table 7 the second place was taken by tukán which was also very efficient in the utilization of p and water at the lowest soil p concentrations p4 in both the w1 and the w2 treatments tables 5 and 6 figs 2 and 3 however this genotype did not show a similar response at high p concentrations p30 tables 5 and 6 figs 2 and 3 most of the remaining genotypes were ranked as medium for pue and wue figs 2 and 3 among them highlighted rupanco and maxwell obtaining 18 points as total score table 7 by contrast kirón reached the lowest score under all the experimental treatments table 7 3 3 2 method 2 the genotypes were categorized into four groups based on their pute and wue status efficient and responsive er inefficient and responsive ir inefficient and non responsive inr and efficient and non responsive enr figs 4 and 5 for w2 treatments fritz tukán and rupanco were categorized as er under both the p4 and the p30 treatments but kirón lanco dollinco and chevignon were inr for w1 treatment tukán fritz maxwell and chevignon were classified as er under the p4 treatment however under p30 rancofén was the most prominent er genotype for pute fig 4 for w2 treatments the most outstanding inr genotypes were kirón lanco and dollinco fig 4 in case of wue the genotypes were distributed mainly into two groups er and inr for w2 treatment fritz tukán and rupanco were er under both the p4 and the p30 treatments kirón lanco dollinco and chevignon were categorized as inr fig 5 for w1 p4 treatment fritz tukán chevignon and maxwell were grouped as er but kirón lanco and the advanced line 338 were inr 4 discussion for the successful breeding of new wheat genotypes adapted to inadequate p and water conditions previous phenotyping information about different plant genotypes should be available for breeders several studies have showed substantial genotypic variation among wheat genotypes to utilize p which made their selection possible on the basis of high pute bilal et al 2018 irfan et al 2020 osborne and rengel 2002 on the other hand information is scarce in terms of the evaluation categorization and or selection of genotypes based on wue although fletcher et al 2018 and nakhforoosh et al 2016 screened wheat genotypes for water deficit stress adaptation these studies did not evaluate the phenotypic plasticity to water stress under increased irrigated condition on the other hand waraich et al 2011 stated that p plays a crucial role in enhancing wue but their work was largely theoretical several research studies have demonstrated a positive role of p in promoting physiological morphological and biochemical adjustments that improved the water stress tolerance e g faustino et al 2013 jin et al 2006 tariq et al 2017 teng et al 2013 however these studies did not evaluate the relationship between pute and wue actually to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluated the combined effect of inadequate p and water conditions on pute and wue for wheat genotypes in our study we found differences among wheat genotypes under inadequate p and water conditions and a strong positive correlation between pute and wue as observed under all the conditions table 8 the correlation between pute and wue enabled the categorization and the selection of co adapted wheat genotypes efficient in the utilization of p and water the wheat genotypes displayed different responses to p and water deficient conditions in terms of plant growth phenological traits p concentration and yield tables 3 and 4 figs s1 s10 it is well documented that inadequate p and water conditions affect plant growth and metabolism in most plant species including wheat cong et al 2020 wiel et al 2016 phosphorous and water deficiency decrease photosynthesis synthesis of carbohydrates cell division and cell elongation thereby adversely affecting development of wheat genotypes table 4 ahadiyat et al 2014 campbell and sage 2006 cong et al 2020 jones et al 2005 vance et al 2003 this detrimental effect was evident in the long delay in development of wheat genotypes subjected to inadequate p and water conditions especially at early vegetative stages figs s1 s10 moreover inadequate p and or water supply also decreased the grain yield and yield component parameters such as the number of spikes and spikelet spike weight and weight of 1000 seeds table 4 in agreement with previous reports gutiérrez boem and thomas 1998 seguel et al 2017 wang et al 2013 the wheat genotypes exhibited significant variation in the ability to take up and utilize p and water under low and adequate levels table s2 and s3 this genotypic variation enables the categorization and selection of p efficient genotypes with high pute and wue bilal et al 2018 gahoonia and nielsen 2004 korkmaz et al 2009 lynch 2007 however plant beneficial traits e g architecture of roots biochemical and microbial traits among others that allow to acquire and utilize more p and water are often depressed by increased p and water supply covacevich et al 2007 nagy et al 2006 teng et al 2013 thus the selection of wheat genotypes whose pute and wue mechanisms are not depressed under high p and water conditions is desirable since such genotypes could use more residual p and thereby require less p fertilizer as stated by lynch 2007 an ideal p efficient genotype should have relatively high yield potential in infertile soils of low input agroecosystems but should require low amount of p fertilizer in high input agroecosystems our findings indicate that the plant ability to produce high amount of biomass or the plant capacity to take up high amounts of p and water does not always make them efficient which confirm the report of osborne and rengel 2002 for example kirón produced high amount of biomass and taken up high amount of p in shoots and roots particularly at adequate p and irrigations but it was the most inefficient genotype for pute and wue tables 5 6 and 7 moreover kirón was also inefficient and non responsive to adequate p and irrigations figs 3 and 4 breeding for pute and or wue was were not aimed at the development of this genotype it was developed for acid soils and provides excellent yield on andisols near to 12 9 ton ha 1 jobet et al 2019 in contrast fritz had the lowest shoot and root biomass and p uptake in the entire group table s2 but it was the most efficient genotype for pute and wue at all the experimental conditions tables 5 and 6 figs 2 and 3 in fact fritz obtained the highest score for pute and wue table 7 which suggests that genotypes should be evaluated at the end of their growth cycle pontigo et al 2018 confirmed the efficiency of fritz for acquiring p through the development of several plant adaptive mechanisms such as increasing the antioxidant capacity and phenolics production however other specific plant adaptive strategies of this genotype to address inadequate p and water conditions remain unclear and deserve further investigations it is important to note the response of tukán which obtained the second highest score for pute and wue table 7 to inadequate p and water conditions tukán was previously described as sensitive to soil acidity and high concentrations of soil al seguel et al 2020 moreover de souza campos 2019 demonstrated that tukán exhibit a low phosphorus acquisition efficiency pae phosphorus efficiency is composed of both the acquisition pae and the utilization efficiency pute wang et al 2013 the pae refers to the ability of crops to extract p from soils in order to produce higher biomass with lower p input irfan et al 2020 plant s adaptive strategies to increase pae includes root morphologic changes plant microbe associations e g with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and some molecular traits e g expression of specific p transporters poirier and jung 2015 which could be diminished in tukán de souza campos et al 2019 however our results indicate that this genotype could have other adaptative strategies e g optimization of harvest index and lowering of grain p concentration table s2 and s3 together with a lowering of plant p demand thereby increasing higher internal utilization recycling irfan et al 2020 those mechanisms could be enhancing p utilization efficiency over p acquisition efficiency and this deserves further investigation interestingly significant improvement in the efficiency of p uptake and water use efficiency has not occurred in modern breeding two older wheat genotypes rancofén and rupanco released in 1983 and 2005 respectively hewstone 1983 hewstone and jobet 2005 were amongst the best performing wheat genotypes at all p and water supply conditions figs 1 and 2 however breeding programs around the world contributed to increase pute and wue even when not being direct objectives through indirect selection for higher yield xue et al 2014 5 conclusion this is the first study that evaluates the combined effect of limiting phosphorus concentration and irrigations in phosphorus utilization and water use efficiency and that at the same time performs a categorization of wheat genotypes by both components our results indicated that limiting conditions of phosphorus and water resulted in negative changes in wheat genotypes in terms of phenological and growth traits phosphorus accumulation in shoots roots and grains and also in yield parameters such detrimental effects were more dominated by low phosphorus concentrations in soil rather than inadequate water conditions the high correlations 85 between phosphorus utilization efficiency and water use efficiency indicated an interactive effect between both components a high genetic variability among the wheat genotypes was also observed for their phosphorus utilization and water the genotypes fritz tukán and maxwell were found to be efficient for utilizing phosphorus and water conversely kirón was not efficient and not responsive for phosphorus utilization and water use efficiency under most conditions therefore categorization of genotypes for phosphorus utilization efficiency and water use efficiency would allow breeders to select and develop new cultivars adapted to a range of agroecological conditions in respect to water and phosphorus availability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

2 v v sodium hypochlorite for 15 min and sown in 7 l soil polythene lined plastic pots 20 20 25 centimeters after germination the plants were thinned to four plants per pot nitrogen n and potassium k were added at an equivalent dose of 220 kg n ha 1 split into 3 applications whereas 120 kg k2o ha 1 were applied at plant establishment urea and potassium sulfate were used as a source for n and k respectively the soil was mixed thoroughly after fertilizer application there were two irrigation treatments w1 adequate irrigation and 30 of water applied to w1 w2 inadequate irrigation the irrigation water applied for w1 was determined using the concept of total available soil water taw mm soil water depletion fraction p and readily available soil water raw mm in this study a value of p

using a datalogger zl6 meter group inc usa fig 1 volumetric moisture sensors were previously calibrated on the basis of physical properties of soil table 2 following the method proposed by lópez olivari and ortega klose 2020 plants were grown under semi controlled conditions in a greenhouse 16 8 h light dark photo period with windows open in order to emulate field conditions but prohibiting rain water wheat phenological stages were recorded during the entire growth period using feekes scale large 1954 wheat plants were harvested at maturity stage feekes growth stage number 11 4 and grains were removed manually shoots and roots were washed with milli q water after separation roots shoots and grains were oven dried in a forced air oven at 70 c for 48 h followed by weighing samples

pute and wue two different method will be used to categorize and select wheat according to their pute and wue 2 2 1 method 1 wheat genotypes were classified into 3 categories as proposed by osborne and rengel 2002 and aziz et al 2011 i efficient e ii medium m iii inefficient i genotypes were assigned as efficient if their pute or wue mean was higher to the mean plus standard deviation of the total population of genotypes evaluated μ sd medium if their mean was between μ sd and μ sd and inefficient if their pute or wue mean was less than the mean minus standard deviation of the entire population μ sd the score assigned was 3 to efficient e 2 to medium m and 1 to inefficient i genotypes in the respective parameters cumulative score was calculated as the sum of the individual scores of different parameters of each genotype 2 2 2 method 2 wheat genotypes were classified into four categories i efficient and responsive er ii efficient and non responsive enr iii inefficient but responsive ir and iv inefficient and non responsive inr according to bilal et al 2018 efficient refers to genotypes having a grain yield higher than their mean and responsive refers to genotypes having pue and or wue higher than their average and vice versa cumulative score was calculated as the sum of the individual scores of different parameters of each genotype 2 3 statistical analyses the experiment was conducted in a split plot arrangement in a completely randomized design the irrigation treatments were the main plot 2 irrigation levels w1 and w2 and the soil p concentrations were the sub plot factor 2 p levels p4 and p30 the experiment was conducted with three replicates per treatment n 120 the means of the replicates of each treatment were compared by one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test at a probability p level of 0 05 pearson correlation were uses to evaluate the relation of pute and wue the normality of the residuals and variance homoscedasticity were tested by the shapiro wilk s and levene s tests before anova 3 results the physical properties of volcanic soil were related to the organic matter om content the values of bulk density ρ b field capacity fc wilting point wp organic matter om and ph were 0 76 mg m 3 0 58 cm3 cm 3 0 38 cm3 cm 3 20 and 5 8 respectively table 1 presenting a high water retention and with high physical and mechanical stability casanova et al 2013 on the other hand all the analyzed variables in the experiment changed significantly p 0 01 for the plant genotype g and phosphorus treatment pt with strong interactions between both factors g x pt table 3 the irrigation treatments it influenced most of the variables with the exception of root shoot ratio and p concentration in grain however it showed smaller effects on experimental variance compared to the pts which is evidenced by their low f values few significant interactions were observed between g x it as well as among the other factors evaluated g x it x pt however positive interactions p 0 01 among pute and wue were observed in all the variables evaluated tables 3 and 8 3 1 effect of phosphorus and water limiting conditions on wheat phenology growth and yield production 3 1 1 plant phenology the wheat genotypes showed differences in their growth and development in response to p and water limiting conditions table 4 the inadequate p condition produced a long delay in the plant development which were clearly evidenced on early growth stages figs s1 s10 supplementary material in particular the number of days required to reach the leaf sheaths strongly erected feekes state 5 f5 was delayed by 40 days in genotype fritz to 105 days in tukán and dollinco under inadequate p condition figs s8 s5 and s3 respectively this effect was even more evident when both the water and the p stress were simultaneously imposed w2 p4 the number of days required to reach f5 was delayed by 60 127 days figs s1 s10 the inadequate irrigation w2 produced a growth delay by a mean of 4 9 21 8 days in the wheat genotypes subjected to p4 and p30 treatments respectively to reach the leaf sheaths strongly erected stage the growth delay subsequently delayed the reproductive stage figs s1 s10 low p condition delayed reproductive stage by 10 and 20 days under adequate and inadequate water conditions respectively mean of ten genotypes figs s1 s10 3 1 2 plant growth and yield wheat genotypes varied in their response to inadequate p and water conditions in terms of plant growth traits and yield component parameters table 4 the lowest plant growth and yield was observed when the combination of p and water restrictions were applied w2 p4 the adequate p concentration and inadequate irrigation w2 p30 increased the plant growth by 2 5 and 6 5 times for shoots and roots respectively table s2 supplementary document this effect was more apparent for the adequate p and adequate irrigation w1 p30 and plant growth increased by 3 2 and 7 times for shoots and roots respectively table s2 unlike p30 treatments p4 treatment did not result in difference in shoot biomass production either in w1 or w2 treatments table s2 in p30 treatment the most responsive genotypes were kirón and lanco conversely fritz and tukán were the least responsive in terms of shoot biomass table s2 fritz showed a high root biomass production under inadequate water and p conditions w2 p4 when p concentration was increased w2 p30 this genotype had the lowest root growth in that the relevant group table s2 under adequate water and p conditions w1 p30 the genotype dollinco showed the highest root biomass production whereas fritz showed the lowest root biomass table s2 3 2 phosphorus in plant tissues both the concentration and the uptake of p by plants were negatively affected by inadequate p and water condition table s3 compared to w2 p4 treatment adequate p condition increased the shoot p concentration by 2 5 and 3 2 times in both w2 and w1 respectively a similar trend was observed by the adequate water condition w2 which increased shoot p concentration by 1 5 and 1 9 times higher than that of p4 and p30 treatments respectively both in comparison to w2 p4 table s3 for inadequate water and inadequate p conditions i e w2 p4 treatment the genotypes lanco maxwell and kirón showed the highest shoot p concentration and p uptake when the p supply level was high w2 p30 kirón had exhibited the highest shoot p concentration which was more noticeable under adequate water conditions i e w1 p30 treatment table s3 moreover under an adequate water condition kirón showed the highest shoot p uptake either in p4 or p30 treatments conversely the lowest shoot p concentration and p uptake were generally observed in fritz table s3 the inadequate water and inadequate p neither affected the root p concentration nor the root p uptake table s3 in w2 p30 w1 p4 and w1 p30 the highest root p concentration was found in the genotypes maxwell advanced line 338 and tukán respectively table s3 3 3 categorization of genotypes for phosphorus and water use efficiency 3 3 1 method 1 the genotypes varied in their p and water use efficiency under all the conditions tables 3 and 4 the most efficient genotype for pute and wue was fritz tables 5 6 and 7 figs 2 and 3 which achieved the maximum score in all the treatments applied table 7 the second place was taken by tukán which was also very efficient in the utilization of p and water at the lowest soil p concentrations p4 in both the w1 and the w2 treatments tables 5 and 6 figs 2 and 3 however this genotype did not show a similar response at high p concentrations p30 tables 5 and 6 figs 2 and 3 most of the remaining genotypes were ranked as medium for pue and wue figs 2 and 3 among them highlighted rupanco and maxwell obtaining 18 points as total score table 7 by contrast kirón reached the lowest score under all the experimental treatments table 7 3 3 2 method 2 the genotypes were categorized into four groups based on their pute and wue status efficient and responsive er inefficient and responsive ir inefficient and non responsive inr and efficient and non responsive enr figs 4 and 5 for w2 treatments fritz tukán and rupanco were categorized as er under both the p4 and the p30 treatments but kirón lanco dollinco and chevignon were inr for w1 treatment tukán fritz maxwell and chevignon were classified as er under the p4 treatment however under p30 rancofén was the most prominent er genotype for pute fig 4 for w2 treatments the most outstanding inr genotypes were kirón lanco and dollinco fig 4 in case of wue the genotypes were distributed mainly into two groups er and inr for w2 treatment fritz tukán and rupanco were er under both the p4 and the p30 treatments kirón lanco dollinco and chevignon were categorized as inr fig 5 for w1 p4 treatment fritz tukán chevignon and maxwell were grouped as er but kirón lanco and the advanced line 338 were inr 4 discussion for the successful breeding of new wheat genotypes adapted to inadequate p and water conditions previous phenotyping information about different plant genotypes should be available for breeders several studies have showed substantial genotypic variation among wheat genotypes to utilize p which made their selection possible on the basis of high pute bilal et al 2018 irfan et al 2020 osborne and rengel 2002 on the other hand information is scarce in terms of the evaluation categorization and or selection of genotypes based on wue although fletcher et al 2018 and nakhforoosh et al 2016 screened wheat genotypes for water deficit stress adaptation these studies did not evaluate the phenotypic plasticity to water stress under increased irrigated condition on the other hand waraich et al 2011 stated that p plays a crucial role in enhancing wue but their work was largely theoretical several research studies have demonstrated a positive role of p in promoting physiological morphological and biochemical adjustments that improved the water stress tolerance e g faustino et al 2013 jin et al 2006 tariq et al 2017 teng et al 2013 however these studies did not evaluate the relationship between pute and wue actually to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluated the combined effect of inadequate p and water conditions on pute and wue for wheat genotypes in our study we found differences among wheat genotypes under inadequate p and water conditions and a strong positive correlation between pute and wue as observed under all the conditions table 8 the correlation between pute and wue enabled the categorization and the selection of co adapted wheat genotypes efficient in the utilization of p and water the wheat genotypes displayed different responses to p and water deficient conditions in terms of plant growth phenological traits p concentration and yield tables 3 and 4 figs s1 s10 it is well documented that inadequate p and water conditions affect plant growth and metabolism in most plant species including wheat cong et al 2020 wiel et al 2016 phosphorous and water deficiency decrease photosynthesis synthesis of carbohydrates cell division and cell elongation thereby adversely affecting development of wheat genotypes table 4 ahadiyat et al 2014 campbell and sage 2006 cong et al 2020 jones et al 2005 vance et al 2003 this detrimental effect was evident in the long delay in development of wheat genotypes subjected to inadequate p and water conditions especially at early vegetative stages figs s1 s10 moreover inadequate p and or water supply also decreased the grain yield and yield component parameters such as the number of spikes and spikelet spike weight and weight of 1000 seeds table 4 in agreement with previous reports gutiérrez boem and thomas 1998 seguel et al 2017 wang et al 2013 the wheat genotypes exhibited significant variation in the ability to take up and utilize p and water under low and adequate levels table s2 and s3 this genotypic variation enables the categorization and selection of p efficient genotypes with high pute and wue bilal et al 2018 gahoonia and nielsen 2004 korkmaz et al 2009 lynch 2007 however plant beneficial traits e g architecture of roots biochemical and microbial traits among others that allow to acquire and utilize more p and water are often depressed by increased p and water supply covacevich et al 2007 nagy et al 2006 teng et al 2013 thus the selection of wheat genotypes whose pute and wue mechanisms are not depressed under high p and water conditions is desirable since such genotypes could use more residual p and thereby require less p fertilizer as stated by lynch 2007 an ideal p efficient genotype should have relatively high yield potential in infertile soils of low input agroecosystems but should require low amount of p fertilizer in high input agroecosystems our findings indicate that the plant ability to produce high amount of biomass or the plant capacity to take up high amounts of p and water does not always make them efficient which confirm the report of osborne and rengel 2002 for example kirón produced high amount of biomass and taken up high amount of p in shoots and roots particularly at adequate p and irrigations but it was the most inefficient genotype for pute and wue tables 5 6 and 7 moreover kirón was also inefficient and non responsive to adequate p and irrigations figs 3 and 4 breeding for pute and or wue was were not aimed at the development of this genotype it was developed for acid soils and provides excellent yield on andisols near to 12 9 ton ha 1 jobet et al 2019 in contrast fritz had the lowest shoot and root biomass and p uptake in the entire group table s2 but it was the most efficient genotype for pute and wue at all the experimental conditions tables 5 and 6 figs 2 and 3 in fact fritz obtained the highest score for pute and wue table 7 which suggests that genotypes should be evaluated at the end of their growth cycle pontigo et al 2018 confirmed the efficiency of fritz for acquiring p through the development of several plant adaptive mechanisms such as increasing the antioxidant capacity and phenolics production however other specific plant adaptive strategies of this genotype to address inadequate p and water conditions remain unclear and deserve further investigations it is important to note the response of tukán which obtained the second highest score for pute and wue table 7 to inadequate p and water conditions tukán was previously described as sensitive to soil acidity and high concentrations of soil al seguel et al 2020 moreover de souza campos 2019 demonstrated that tukán exhibit a low phosphorus acquisition efficiency pae phosphorus efficiency is composed of both the acquisition pae and the utilization efficiency pute wang et al 2013 the pae refers to the ability of crops to extract p from soils in order to produce higher biomass with lower p input irfan et al 2020 plant s adaptive strategies to increase pae includes root morphologic changes plant microbe associations e g with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and some molecular traits e g expression of specific p transporters poirier and jung 2015 which could be diminished in tukán de souza campos et al 2019 however our results indicate that this genotype could have other adaptative strategies e g optimization of harvest index and lowering of grain p concentration table s2 and s3 together with a lowering of plant p demand thereby increasing higher internal utilization recycling irfan et al 2020 those mechanisms could be enhancing p utilization efficiency over p acquisition efficiency and this deserves further investigation interestingly significant improvement in the efficiency of p uptake and water use efficiency has not occurred in modern breeding two older wheat genotypes rancofén and rupanco released in 1983 and 2005 respectively hewstone 1983 hewstone and jobet 2005 were amongst the best performing wheat genotypes at all p and water supply conditions figs 1 and 2 however breeding programs around the world contributed to increase pute and wue even when not being direct objectives through indirect selection for higher yield xue et al 2014 5 conclusion this is the first study that evaluates the combined effect of limiting phosphorus concentration and irrigations in phosphorus utilization and water use efficiency and that at the same time performs a categorization of wheat genotypes by both components our results indicated that limiting conditions of phosphorus and water resulted in negative changes in wheat genotypes in terms of phenological and growth traits phosphorus accumulation in shoots roots and grains and also in yield parameters such detrimental effects were more dominated by low phosphorus concentrations in soil rather than inadequate water conditions the high correlations 85 between phosphorus utilization efficiency and water use efficiency indicated an interactive effect between both components a high genetic variability among the wheat genotypes was also observed for their phosphorus utilization and water the genotypes fritz tukán and maxwell were found to be efficient for utilizing phosphorus and water conversely kirón was not efficient and not responsive for phosphorus utilization and water use efficiency under most conditions therefore categorization of genotypes for phosphorus utilization efficiency and water use efficiency would allow breeders to select and develop new cultivars adapted to a range of agroecological conditions in respect to water and phosphorus availability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10166,irrigation plays a fundamental role in sustanining the productivity of agricultural systems in the inland arid area of midwestern china deficit irrigation can help to balance yield outcome and water input few studies have investigated the impact of deficit irrigation on alfalfa performance which shows great differences from grain crops in water requirement and management strategy the study aimed to evaluate the effect of regulated deficit irrigation on forage yield and quality of alfalfa medicago sativa a three year trial was carried out with two irrigation systems flood irrigation fi and subsurface drip irrigation sdi and seven contrasting regulated irrigation treatments and alfalfa growth productivity and water use were measured under both irrigation systems alfalfa forage yield decreased with decreasing irrigation amount under whole stage irrigation while forage quality improved however the performance of alfalfa was different when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages compared with other deficit irrigation treatments regulated deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually led to a higher yield there was an exponential relationship between plant height and forage yield r2 0 62 for fi and r2 0 57 for sdi and a linear relationship between leaf area index and forage yield r2 0 56 for fi and r2 0 64 for sdi there was a negative correlation between forage yield and quality which was closer to some quadratic relationships therefore regulated deficit irrigation can help to achieve an ideal yield up to 34 9 t ha and quality in this area in the inland arid area of midwestern china subsurface drip irrigation showed a higher irrigation water use efficiency 13 8 84 4 kg ha mm than flood irrigation 10 8 66 6 kg ha mm for alfalfa production with limited water supply deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually maintained a higher forage yield compared to slightly stressed irrigation during the whole growth deficit irrigation at the branching stage led to more negative effect on forage yield compared to other single stages keywords lucerne dry matter yield forage quality irrigation water use efficiency flood irrigation subsurface drip irrigation regulated deficit irrigation 1 introduction more than half of the global agricultural area is facing drought challenges geng et al 2016 and drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production pelling et al 2004 irrigation plays a fundamental role in sustanining the productivity of agricultural systems in arid areas however scarce water resource in these areas requires more rationalized strategies to well manage irrigation in the agricultural production for example changing irrigation system reducing irrigation frequency and or amount etc the inland arid area of midwestern china has long been suffering from severe drought stress due to very low rainfall but very high evapotranspiration meng et al 2013 in recent years crop structure adjustment with more forage crops sown in this area has been used as a solution to sustain productivity under restricted water availability nevertheless well managed irrigation is still needed to sustain an ideal productivity of the forage including agricultural systems in this area and similar areas encountering similar challenges control of irrigation amount is critical to achieve better biomass accumulation and final yield of the crops excessive irrigation will not only waste water resources but also reduce growth and yield due to lodging or less tolerance to waterlogging saturated soils of the crops steduto 2012 in contrast deficit irrigation can save water but guarantee water supply at an exact time point which thus can well balance yield outcome and water input cui et al 2020 ors et al 2015 generally when total available water content of soil reduces to 50 60 crop growth and yield will be affected steduto 2012 therefore it is vital to accurately regulate the deficit degree of soil water availability through regulating irrigation for grain crops like maize zea mays and wheat triticum aestivum water deficit at the early stage of tillering and or grain filling will significantly affect the yield and quality farre and faci 2009 found that maize was most sensitive to water deficit at flowering stage which will significantly reduce grain yield passioura and angus 2010 found that tiller number was limited by early stage stress and the size and number of individual grains were reduced by post flowering stress it is difficult to make up for yield loss with the later water supply after suffering from water stress steduto 2012 differing from grain crops forage crops like alfalfa medicago sativa mainly produce the vegetative aboveground parts that are harvested as forage so the growth cycle is generally ended at the early flowering stage testa et al 2011 a midsummer deficit irrigation strategy can maintain the relatively high yield of early year and reduce irrigation amount during the summer hanson et al 2007 2008 frate et al 1991 found that the yields of a midsummer termination treatment were 65 71 of those under fully irrigated treatment while the yields recovered during next year when all treatments were full irrigated the response of alfalfa to water deficit was the most sensitive at the branching stage and the effect of water deficit on yield was the most significant at this stage cheng 2005 however the critical irrigation amount and time that the deficit irrigation is applied needs to be further explored flood irrigation has been used in most irrigated farms worldwide akbari et al 2018 saha 2010 and been replaced by other irrigation systems like subsurface drip irrigation due to easy operation low cost and traditional habit of farmers flood irrigation is still one of the main irrigation systems however flood irrigation is typically less efficient in using water gebremedhin 2015 maybe because of large amount of runoff percolation almarshadi and ismail 2011 many studies have shown that subsurface drip irrigation can reduce or eliminate irrigation runoff deep percolation and soil evaporation ali 2015 gebremedhin 2015 lamm et al 2012 roberts et al 2009 therefore this system shows great advantages even though there are still problems in practical application such as higher cost and possible salinization of surface soil onder et al 2005 roberts et al 2009 selim et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 the above two irrigation systems are applied in the arid areas of midwestern china however more and more restricted water supply has increasingly urged farmers to use some water saving system in agricultural irrigation deeper roots of forage crops usually lead to less water percolation than shallower roots of grain crops and greater coverage of forages than cereals may lead to reduced soil evaporation these traits may also lead to different water uses of forage and cereal crops and to various responses to the two systems we are still not sure how the two irrigation systems affect forage production in this area in china the importance of alfalfa has been largely increased in recent years feng et al 2016 especially in the arid and semi arid areas to meet the requirements of livestock husbandry and ecological restoration alfalfa is widely adaptive to natural precipitation but highly water consuming and very sensitive to water deficit almarshadi and ismail 2011 kuslu et al 2010 lamm et al 2012 in arid areas irrigation is an efficient strategy to guarantee great biomass production and high forage quality of alfalfa however more water supply usually leads to more dry matter yield but excessive irrigation would reduce the growth rate of alfalfa and lead to yield loss xiao et al 2015 in a suitable range increasing irrigation amount leads to increased evapotranspiration of alfalfa and dry matter accumulation of alfalfa increases linearly with the increasing evapotranspiration kuslu et al 2010 lamm et al 2012 cavero et al 2017 found that the dry matter yield and plant height of alfalfa increased linearly with the increasing irrigation amount while the n content decreased linearly in contrast lamm et al 2012 found that the annual dry matter yield barely changed with water deficit levels compared with 100 of plant evapotranspiration rates etr irrigation treatment alfalfa can be irrigated in 70 or 85 etr of sdi without reducing yield or quality lamm et al 2013 these implied that well regulated irrigation would less affect alfalfa productivity additionally water demand of alfalfa is different at different growth stages but there are few researches exploring effect of water deficit at various stages on growth and final yield the purpose of this study is to explore the following issues 1 the alfalfa productivity under regulated deficit irrigation in this area 2 the responses of alfalfa to different irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was carried out from 2017 to 2019 in suzhou district 98 8 e 39 67 n 1368 m above sea level jiuquan city gansu province china the area has a typical inland arid climate the annual average temperature is 8 14 1954 2019 with the highest in july and the lowest in january the annual average precipitation is 90 mm 1954 2019 and the annual average reference evapotranspiration calculated by penman monteith equation is 1730 mm 1954 2019 the frost free period is only 130 d on average the daily meteorological conditions during 2017 2019 were recorded by a weather station nearby and shown in fig 1 the soil is loam sandy 0 60 cm with field capacity based on volumatic water content 28 wilting point based on volumatic water content 8 8 bulk density 1 51 g cm3 ph 7 4 and organic matter 3 1 g kg total nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k contents of this soil are 0 22 0 24 and 7 6 g kg respectively in 0 150 cm soil layer the cropping in this area is mainly a one cropping mode and highly dependent on irrigation in this study the pre crop sown before the experiment was lycium ruthenicum which is an economic crop popularly sown in this area fig 1 2 2 experimental design alfalfa was sown in row on may 24 2017 the seed was sown at a rate of 22 5 kg ha at a depth of 2 cm and row space of 20 cm prior to sowing 300 kg ha diammonium phosphate was used as base fertilizer after sowing a light free shading net was used to cover the plot surface which can keep most of sunlight out and reduce evaporation helping germination and seedling growth for achieving an expected crop establishment irrigation with 30 mm was performed until three true leaves emerged and the cover was removed the experiment was arranged in a split plot design with two irrigation systems as main plots and seven treatments of regulated irrigation as subplots irrigation systems included flood irrigation fi and subsurface drip irrigation sdi regulated irrigation treatments included a full irrigation treatment for the whole growth period ifu100 and six regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatments a slight water deficit for whole growth period isl70 b moderate water deficit for the whole growth period imo50 c moderate water deficit at the branching and budding stage ibb50 d moderate water deficit at the regrowth stage ire50 e moderate water deficit at the branching stage ibr50 and f moderate water deficit at the budding stage ibu50 there were three replicates per treatment the plot area for fi was 24 m2 6 m 4 m and for sdi it was 48 m2 6 m 8 m water meters were used to measure the amount of water applied using the irrigation amount under ifu100 as the standard the irrigation amount of slight water deficit was 70 and the amount of moderate water deficit was 50 the time of irrigation for ifu100 treatment was determined on the measurement of available water content of reference soil layer kuslu et al 2010 in this study when the available water content of reference soil layer 60 cm in the first year and 100 cm in 2018 and 2019 under ifu100 treatment reduced to half of the maximum available water content irrigation was applied the manual time domain reflectometry instrument trime tdr imko germany was used to measure the soil water content of each plot every three days during whole growing period the amount under fi was about 50 60 mm for each irrigation and 30 40 mm under sdi the actual amount of irrigation was shown in table 1 in 2017 no water deficit treatment was carried out at the early stage of crop establishment and irrigation treatment was started at the branching stage 2 3 sampling measurement and calculation the shoot of alfalfa was randomly harvested by sampling two 25 cm fragments of the aboveground part with a 5 cm stubble height in each plot in 2017 all shoot samples were put into self sealed bags after weighing the fresh weight fw and then oven dried at 120 c for 20 min and 75 c for 48 h to measure the dry weight dw the dry matter yield ydm t ha was then calculated based on dw note that in 2017 the establishment year shoot sample was taken at the branching stage at the 2nd cut because it began to cool down significantly on september 21 and alfalfa no longer grew in 2018 and 2019 the shoot sample was divided into two parts after measurements of fw and dw one of them was further separated into stem and leaf samples obtaining the weights and the other one was used to measure quality indexes stem leaf ratio slr was calculated with stem and leaf dry weights dry plant samples were ground into fine powder for measurement of quality indexes total n content tn g kg was measured by kjeldahl auto analyzer foss8400 shanghai china and then crude protein content was calculated by multiplying coefficient 6 25 neutral detergent fibers ndf and acid detergent fibers adf were determined using the procedure by goering and van soest 1970 relative feeding value rfv was calculated with the following formula 1 rfv dmi ddm 1 29 2 dmi 120 ndf dm 3 ddm 88 9 0 779 adf dm where dm means dry matter dmi means dm intake ddm means digestible dm plant height of alfalfa was

ggplot2 package wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 dry matter yield of alfalfa under two irrigation systems dry matter yield ydm was significantly affected by irrigation system s treatment t and s t table 2 the ydm decreased with reducing irrigation amount and regulated deficit irrigation rdi greatly affected the ydm under two irrigation systems fig 2 in 2017 the establishment year the ydm was 4 7 t ha in average under fi and 3 8 t ha in average under sdi the highest and lowest ydm were measured in ibu50 and imo50 respectively under both irrigation systems and there was less difference in ydm among other treatments in 2018 the ydm was much higher than those in 2017 it was 25 3 t ha in average under fi and 20 5 t ha in average under sdi the highest ydm appeared in ifu100 under fi and in ibu50 under sdi and the lowest appeared in imo50 under both irrigation systems there was no significant difference in ydm among isl70 ibb50 ire50 ibr50 ibu50 under fi and among isl70 ibb50 and ibr50 under sdi in 2019 the ydm was 30 1 t ha in average under fi and 25 6 t ha in average under sdi higher than those in 2018 the highest ydm appeared in ifu100 under fi and in ire50 under sdi and the lowest appeared in imo50 under both irrigation systems there was no significant difference in ydm among isl70 ibb50 ire50 ibr50 under fi and among the treatments with one stage moderate water deficit under sdi the rdi had no significant impact on the proportion of ydm at both cuts in 2017 under both irrigation systems while in the following years it affected the proportion at most cuts table 3 in 2018 the rdi significantly affected the proportion at the 1st cut under fi and the highest proportion was measured in ire50 while had significant effect at all cuts under sdi in 2019 the rdi significantly affected the proportion of ydm at the 1st and 2nd cut under fi while had significant effect at the 1st and 3rd cut under sdi under two irrigation systems the ydm significantly increased with increasing plant height in a nonlinear model where r2 was 0 62 fi and 0 57 sdi respectively fig 3 the ydm increased linearly with lai increase under both irrigation systems fi r2 0 56 and sdi 0 64 moreover the slope value under sdi was higher than that under fi 3 2 crude protein content and relative feeding value of alfalfa under two irrigation systems crude protein cp of alfalfa was significantly affected by irrigation system table 2 the cp content was affected by the rdi which varied with the growth fig 4 in 2017 the rdi significantly affected cp content only at the 1st cut under fi and the cp content was the lowest in ifu100 and ibr50 in 2018 the rdi had significant effect on cp content at all cuts under both irrigation systems at the 2nd and 3rd cut cp content tended to increase with the decreasing irrigation amount during the whole growth period ifu100 isl70 and imo50 in 2019 the rdi only had significant effect on cp content at the 2nd cut under fi and cp content tended to increase with the decreasing irrigation amount during the whole growth period at all cuts relative feeding value rfv of alfalfa was significantly affected by treatment table 2 the effect of rdi on rfv was regulated by the growth fig 5 in 2017 the rdi significantly affected the rfv at all cuts but the 1st cut under fi in 2018 the rdi had a significant impact on the rfv except for the 1st cut under fi the rfv at the 2nd and 3rd cut tended to increase with reduced irrigation amount during the whole growth period ifu100 isl70 imo50 under both irrigation systems in 2019 the rfv at the 3rd cut under fi and at the 2nd and 3rd cut under sdi were significantly affected both cp content and rfv decreased significantly with increasing stem leaf ratio slr in linear models under both irrigation systems fig 6 the slopes under sdi were lower than those under fi in contrast both acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf contents increased linearly with slr increase 3 3 correlations between the dry matter yield and forage quality of alfalfa there were parabola relationships of ydm with cp ndf adf rfv and slr fig 7 with the increase of ydm the cp and rfv first decreased and then increased while the ndf adf and slr increased first and then decreased the inflexion position of parabola was different under the two irrigation systems the lowest cp content appeared when ydm was 14 8 t ha under fi while under sdi it was at 16 0 t ha ydm in contrast for ndf adf rfv and slr the inflexion point of fi was on the right of sdi 3 4 water use and correlation of irrigation amount with alfalfa performance irrigation water use efficiency iwue of alfalfa was significantly affected by irrigation system s treatment t and s t table 2 in 2017 there was no significant difference in iwue among regulated irrigations under the two irrigation systems while in 2018 and 2019 iwue changed significantly with regulated irrigation fig 8 it was the lowest under ifu100 and tended to increase with the decreasing irrigation amount the iwue under sdi was significantly higher than that under fi in three years irrigation amount had various impacts on the growth and quality characteristics of alfalfa which was different in different irrigation systems fig 9 under fi there was no correlation of irrigation amount with rfv ndf adf and cp at several cuts while more correlations were measured with ydm and plant height in contrast the correlation was attenuated under sdi nevertheless plant height was heavily affected by irrigation amount and there was a significant correlation between irrigation amount and lai under sdi 4 discussion 4 1 effect of regulated deficit irrigation on dry matter yield of alfalfa it is generally believed that the yield of alfalfa decreases with the decreasing irrigation amount carter and sheaffer 1982 klocke et al 2013 in this study the yield decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount under whole stage irrigation in 2018 with the decrease of irrigation amount the yield under fi decreased from 31 1 to 20 3 t ha and decreased from 22 1 to 12 3 t ha under sdi in 2019 the trend was similar but with higher yield the decrease of dry matter yield may be attributed to the reduced leaf expansion and photosynthesis under water stress hsiao 1973 zargar et al 2017 the alfalfa forage yield obtained in this study was in the high range of reported values from semiarid areas klocke et al 2013 lindenmayer et al 2011 lloveras et al 2008a 2008b additionally the performance of alfalfa was different when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages in 2018 and 2019 the ibb50 treatment had higher yield than the imo50 treatment suggesting that full irrigation at the regrowth stage would provide enough water for the emergence of more sprouts consequently affecting the final dry matter yield in contrast the branching stage was the most sensitive period of alfalfa to drought and water stress in this period would heavily affect the final dry matter accumulation cheng 2005 sun 2008 resulting in lower forage yield under the ibr50 treatment compared to other deficit treatments at single stage therefore for irrigation management of alfalfa total irrigation amount and performing stage should be considered together in practice in this study the dry matter yield at the 1st cut was generally higher than those at the rest cuts this may be due to the fact that sufficient light and water resources at the 1st cut helps to accumulate more dry matter while later the shortened sunshine length in autumn results in reduced dry matter accumulation and more dry matter of alfalfa is transferred to the root system for overwintering jing et al 2020 orloff et al 2005 however the dry matter yield at the 1st cut in 2017 was lower than that at the 2nd cut this may be because in the first year the biomass accumulation at early stage the 1st cut is mainly used for root growth steduto 2012 generally there is a good correlation between plant height and dry matter yield schirrmann et al 2016 tilly et al 2014 and dry matter yield is in large part considered a function of canopy or plant height pittman et al 2015 in this study the relationship between plant height and dry matter yield was closer to an exponential function under fi and sdi the r2 was 0 62 for fi and 0 57 for sdi which shows that with the increase of plant height dry matter yield increases faster the higher plant height tends to support the horizontal accumulation of dry matter maybe due to the increasing number of branches liu and guo 2013 found that higher soil moisture content resulted in more branches fig s1 there was a significant linear relationship between dry matter yield and lai the lai integrates leaf density and canopy height and it corresponds to leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area weiss et al 2004 so their relationship is closer to a linear relationship goswami et al 2015 in this three year test the iwue of sdi was significantly higher than that of fi the water deficit treatment in 2017 did not significantly affect the iwue value but there were significant effects in 2018 and 2019 this may be due to the lower dry matter yield in 2017 and therefore less demand for water in the treatment of ifu100 isl70 imo50 iwue showed an increasing trend with the decrease of irrigation amount there was no consistent trend in other treatments this also shows that the demand for water is different at different growth stages 4 2 effect of regulated deficit irrigation on forage quality under water stress perennial forage plants often have higher nutritive quality than those grown under well watered conditions halim et al 1989a wilson 1982 in this study with the decrease of irrigation amount crude protein content and relative feeding value showed an increasing trend under regulated irrigation treatments during the whole growth period this is consistent with previous studies halim et al 1989a 1989b wilson 1982 however it was not obvious in other treatments and the relationship between irrigation amount and crude protein content did not simply follow this rule when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages in the 2nd and 3rd cut in 2018 and 2019 water deficit caused the increase of relative feeding value during the whole growth period including ifu100 isl70 and imo50 treatments this confirmed the results of li et al 2017 and it was also not obvious in other treatments when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages under water stress higher leaf stem ratio halim et al 1989a and slower maturity speed wilson 1982 contribute to the improved forage quality in this study there was a significant negative correlation between crude protein rfv and stem leaf ratio while there was a significant positive correlation between ndf adf and stem leaf ratio this is consistent with other studies lloveras et al 2008a 2008b martiniello et al 1997 testa et al 2011 water stress affects the growth of stem more than the leaf halim et al 1989a and the content of cell wall in the stem is usually higher than that in the leaf which makes the leaf easier to be digested than the stem albrecht et al 1987 however although there was a significant correlation between stem leaf ratio and quality indexes the correlation coefficient was not high suggesting that stem leaf ratio may not be the main reason for the quality change of alfalfa volenec and cherney 1990 4 3 the correlation between biomass yield and forage quality high yield and good quality are two important goals of forage production in general higher irrigation amount can achieve greater dry matter yield but there is no simultaneous change in dry matter yield and forage quality li et al 2017 lindenmayer et al 2011 forage yield and forage quality are often reported to be negatively correlated demment et al 1986 li et al 2017 in this study although there was also a negative correlation between forage quality and yield the relationship was closer to quadratic relationships we found that there was also a quadratic relationship between dry matter yield and stem leaf ratio helping to explain the quadratic relationship between dry matter yield and quality index to some extent the cp content under fi reached the inflection point faster with the increase of dry matter yield than that under sdi while for rfv it was slower under fi in contrast there were significant parabolic relationships between dry matter yield and ndf adf and the detergent fiber contents reached the inflection point faster under sdi than fi this indicated that there were differences in the effects of fi and sdi on cp and fiber indexes of alfalfa although we found significant quadratic relationships between dry matter yield and quality of alfalfa it was still difficult to simply determine a balance of the yield and quality in the production we failed to show a value where we can have both high yield and good quality in this study we think this may be an economic issue rather than an experiment result just as orloff and putnam 2010 suggested strive for higher output in the year of high price and strive for higher quality in the year of low price 5 conclusions under both irrigation systems alfalfa forage yield decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount under whole stage irrigation while forage quality increased however the performance of alfalfa was different when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages with limited water supply deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually maintained a higher forage yield compared to slightly stressed irrigation during the whole growth deficit irrigation at the branching stage led to more negative effect on forage yield compared to other single stages there was also a negative correlation between forage quality and yield which was closer to some quadratic relationships in the inland arid area of midwestern china subsurface drip irrigation showed a higher irrigation water use efficiency than flood irrigation for alfalfa production declaration of competing interest the authors

10166,irrigation plays a fundamental role in sustanining the productivity of agricultural systems in the inland arid area of midwestern china deficit irrigation can help to balance yield outcome and water input few studies have investigated the impact of deficit irrigation on alfalfa performance which shows great differences from grain crops in water requirement and management strategy the study aimed to evaluate the effect of regulated deficit irrigation on forage yield and quality of alfalfa medicago sativa a three year trial was carried out with two irrigation systems flood irrigation fi and subsurface drip irrigation sdi and seven contrasting regulated irrigation treatments and alfalfa growth productivity and water use were measured under both irrigation systems alfalfa forage yield decreased with decreasing irrigation amount under whole stage irrigation while forage quality improved however the performance of alfalfa was different when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages compared with other deficit irrigation treatments regulated deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually led to a higher yield there was an exponential relationship between plant height and forage yield r2 0 62 for fi and r2 0 57 for sdi and a linear relationship between leaf area index and forage yield r2 0 56 for fi and r2 0 64 for sdi there was a negative correlation between forage yield and quality which was closer to some quadratic relationships therefore regulated deficit irrigation can help to achieve an ideal yield up to 34 9 t ha and quality in this area in the inland arid area of midwestern china subsurface drip irrigation showed a higher irrigation water use efficiency 13 8 84 4 kg ha mm than flood irrigation 10 8 66 6 kg ha mm for alfalfa production with limited water supply deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually maintained a higher forage yield compared to slightly stressed irrigation during the whole growth deficit irrigation at the branching stage led to more negative effect on forage yield compared to other single stages keywords lucerne dry matter yield forage quality irrigation water use efficiency flood irrigation subsurface drip irrigation regulated deficit irrigation 1 introduction more than half of the global agricultural area is facing drought challenges geng et al 2016 and drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production pelling et al 2004 irrigation plays a fundamental role in sustanining the productivity of agricultural systems in arid areas however scarce water resource in these areas requires more rationalized strategies to well manage irrigation in the agricultural production for example changing irrigation system reducing irrigation frequency and or amount etc the inland arid area of midwestern china has long been suffering from severe drought stress due to very low rainfall but very high evapotranspiration meng et al 2013 in recent years crop structure adjustment with more forage crops sown in this area has been used as a solution to sustain productivity under restricted water availability nevertheless well managed irrigation is still needed to sustain an ideal productivity of the forage including agricultural systems in this area and similar areas encountering similar challenges control of irrigation amount is critical to achieve better biomass accumulation and final yield of the crops excessive irrigation will not only waste water resources but also reduce growth and yield due to lodging or less tolerance to waterlogging saturated soils of the crops steduto 2012 in contrast deficit irrigation can save water but guarantee water supply at an exact time point which thus can well balance yield outcome and water input cui et al 2020 ors et al 2015 generally when total available water content of soil reduces to 50 60 crop growth and yield will be affected steduto 2012 therefore it is vital to accurately regulate the deficit degree of soil water availability through regulating irrigation for grain crops like maize zea mays and wheat triticum aestivum water deficit at the early stage of tillering and or grain filling will significantly affect the yield and quality farre and faci 2009 found that maize was most sensitive to water deficit at flowering stage which will significantly reduce grain yield passioura and angus 2010 found that tiller number was limited by early stage stress and the size and number of individual grains were reduced by post flowering stress it is difficult to make up for yield loss with the later water supply after suffering from water stress steduto 2012 differing from grain crops forage crops like alfalfa medicago sativa mainly produce the vegetative aboveground parts that are harvested as forage so the growth cycle is generally ended at the early flowering stage testa et al 2011 a midsummer deficit irrigation strategy can maintain the relatively high yield of early year and reduce irrigation amount during the summer hanson et al 2007 2008 frate et al 1991 found that the yields of a midsummer termination treatment were 65 71 of those under fully irrigated treatment while the yields recovered during next year when all treatments were full irrigated the response of alfalfa to water deficit was the most sensitive at the branching stage and the effect of water deficit on yield was the most significant at this stage cheng 2005 however the critical irrigation amount and time that the deficit irrigation is applied needs to be further explored flood irrigation has been used in most irrigated farms worldwide akbari et al 2018 saha 2010 and been replaced by other irrigation systems like subsurface drip irrigation due to easy operation low cost and traditional habit of farmers flood irrigation is still one of the main irrigation systems however flood irrigation is typically less efficient in using water gebremedhin 2015 maybe because of large amount of runoff percolation almarshadi and ismail 2011 many studies have shown that subsurface drip irrigation can reduce or eliminate irrigation runoff deep percolation and soil evaporation ali 2015 gebremedhin 2015 lamm et al 2012 roberts et al 2009 therefore this system shows great advantages even though there are still problems in practical application such as higher cost and possible salinization of surface soil onder et al 2005 roberts et al 2009 selim et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 the above two irrigation systems are applied in the arid areas of midwestern china however more and more restricted water supply has increasingly urged farmers to use some water saving system in agricultural irrigation deeper roots of forage crops usually lead to less water percolation than shallower roots of grain crops and greater coverage of forages than cereals may lead to reduced soil evaporation these traits may also lead to different water uses of forage and cereal crops and to various responses to the two systems we are still not sure how the two irrigation systems affect forage production in this area in china the importance of alfalfa has been largely increased in recent years feng et al 2016 especially in the arid and semi arid areas to meet the requirements of livestock husbandry and ecological restoration alfalfa is widely adaptive to natural precipitation but highly water consuming and very sensitive to water deficit almarshadi and ismail 2011 kuslu et al 2010 lamm et al 2012 in arid areas irrigation is an efficient strategy to guarantee great biomass production and high forage quality of alfalfa however more water supply usually leads to more dry matter yield but excessive irrigation would reduce the growth rate of alfalfa and lead to yield loss xiao et al 2015 in a suitable range increasing irrigation amount leads to increased evapotranspiration of alfalfa and dry matter accumulation of alfalfa increases linearly with the increasing evapotranspiration kuslu et al 2010 lamm et al 2012 cavero et al 2017 found that the dry matter yield and plant height of alfalfa increased linearly with the increasing irrigation amount while the n content decreased linearly in contrast lamm et al 2012 found that the annual dry matter yield barely changed with water deficit levels compared with 100 of plant evapotranspiration rates etr irrigation treatment alfalfa can be irrigated in 70 or 85 etr of sdi without reducing yield or quality lamm et al 2013 these implied that well regulated irrigation would less affect alfalfa productivity additionally water demand of alfalfa is different at different growth stages but there are few researches exploring effect of water deficit at various stages on growth and final yield the purpose of this study is to explore the following issues 1 the alfalfa productivity under regulated deficit irrigation in this area 2 the responses of alfalfa to different irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was carried out from 2017 to 2019 in suzhou district 98 8 e 39 67 n 1368 m above sea level jiuquan city gansu province china the area has a typical inland arid climate the annual average temperature is 8 14 1954 2019 with the highest in july and the lowest in january the annual average precipitation is 90 mm 1954 2019 and the annual average reference evapotranspiration calculated by penman monteith equation is 1730 mm 1954 2019 the frost free period is only 130 d on average the daily meteorological conditions during 2017 2019 were recorded by a weather station nearby and shown in fig 1 the soil is loam sandy 0 60 cm with field capacity based on volumatic water content 28 wilting point based on volumatic water content 8 8 bulk density 1 51 g cm3 ph 7 4 and organic matter 3 1 g kg total nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k contents of this soil are 0 22 0 24 and 7 6 g kg respectively in 0 150 cm soil layer the cropping in this area is mainly a one cropping mode and highly dependent on irrigation in this study the pre crop sown before the experiment was lycium ruthenicum which is an economic crop popularly sown in this area fig 1 2 2 experimental design alfalfa was sown in row on may 24 2017 the seed was sown at a rate of 22 5 kg ha at a depth of 2 cm and row space of 20 cm prior to sowing 300 kg ha diammonium phosphate was used as base fertilizer after sowing a light free shading net was used to cover the plot surface which can keep most of sunlight out and reduce evaporation helping germination and seedling growth for achieving an expected crop establishment irrigation with 30 mm was performed until three true leaves emerged and the cover was removed the experiment was arranged in a split plot design with two irrigation systems as main plots and seven treatments of regulated irrigation as subplots irrigation systems included flood irrigation fi and subsurface drip irrigation sdi regulated irrigation treatments included a full irrigation treatment for the whole growth period ifu100 and six regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatments a slight water deficit for whole growth period isl70 b moderate water deficit for the whole growth period imo50 c moderate water deficit at the branching and budding stage ibb50 d moderate water deficit at the regrowth stage ire50 e moderate water deficit at the branching stage ibr50 and f moderate water deficit at the budding stage ibu50 there were three replicates per treatment the plot area for fi was 24 m2 6 m 4 m and for sdi it was 48 m2 6 m 8 m water meters were used to measure the amount of water applied using the irrigation amount under ifu100 as the standard the irrigation amount of slight water deficit was 70 and the amount of moderate water deficit was 50 the time of irrigation for ifu100 treatment was determined on the measurement of available water content of reference soil layer kuslu et al 2010 in this study when the available water content of reference soil layer 60 cm in the first year and 100 cm in 2018 and 2019 under ifu100 treatment reduced to half of the maximum available water content irrigation was applied the manual time domain reflectometry instrument trime tdr imko germany was used to measure the soil water content of each plot every three days during whole growing period the amount under fi was about 50 60 mm for each irrigation and 30 40 mm under sdi the actual amount of irrigation was shown in table 1 in 2017 no water deficit treatment was carried out at the early stage of crop establishment and irrigation treatment was started at the branching stage 2 3 sampling measurement and calculation the shoot of alfalfa was randomly harvested by sampling two 25 cm fragments of the aboveground part with a 5 cm stubble height in each plot in 2017 all shoot samples were put into self sealed bags after weighing the fresh weight fw and then oven dried at 120 c for 20 min and 75 c for 48 h to measure the dry weight dw the dry matter yield ydm t ha was then calculated based on dw note that in 2017 the establishment year shoot sample was taken at the branching stage at the 2nd cut because it began to cool down significantly on september 21 and alfalfa no longer grew in 2018 and 2019 the shoot sample was divided into two parts after measurements of fw and dw one of them was further separated into stem and leaf samples obtaining the weights and the other one was used to measure quality indexes stem leaf ratio slr was calculated with stem and leaf dry weights dry plant samples were ground into fine powder for measurement of quality indexes total n content tn g kg was measured by kjeldahl auto analyzer foss8400 shanghai china and then crude protein content was calculated by multiplying coefficient 6 25 neutral detergent fibers ndf and acid detergent fibers adf were determined using the procedure by goering and van soest 1970 relative feeding value rfv was calculated with the following formula 1 rfv dmi ddm 1 29 2 dmi 120 ndf dm 3 ddm 88 9 0 779 adf dm where dm means dry matter dmi means dm intake ddm means digestible dm plant height of alfalfa was measured at the early flowering stage leaf area index lai was measured by a plant canopy analyzer sunscan delta t devices cambridge uk at the early flowering stage except for the 1st cut in 2017 irrigation water use efficiency iwue t ha mm of alfalfa forage was calculated using the following formula 4 iwue y dm ia where ydm is dry matter yield t ha and ia is irrigation amount mm 2 4

in average under fi and 3 8 t ha in average under sdi the highest and lowest ydm were measured in ibu50 and imo50 respectively under both irrigation systems and there was less difference in ydm among other treatments in 2018 the ydm was much higher than those in 2017 it was 25 3 t ha in average under fi and 20 5 t ha in average under sdi the highest ydm appeared in ifu100 under fi and in ibu50 under sdi and the lowest appeared in imo50 under both irrigation systems there was no significant difference in ydm among isl70 ibb50 ire50 ibr50 ibu50 under fi and among isl70 ibb50 and ibr50 under sdi in 2019 the ydm was 30 1 t ha in average under fi and 25 6 t ha in average under sdi higher than those in 2018 the highest ydm appeared in ifu100 under fi and in ire50 under sdi and the lowest appeared in imo50 under both irrigation systems there was no significant difference in ydm among isl70 ibb50 ire50 ibr50 under fi and among the treatments with one stage moderate water deficit under sdi the rdi had no significant impact on the proportion of ydm at both cuts in 2017 under both irrigation systems while in the following years it affected the proportion at most cuts table 3 in 2018 the rdi significantly affected the proportion at the 1st cut under fi and the highest proportion was measured in ire50 while had significant effect at all cuts under sdi in 2019 the rdi significantly affected the proportion of ydm at the 1st and 2nd cut under fi while had significant effect at the 1st and 3rd cut under sdi under two irrigation systems the ydm significantly increased with increasing plant height in a nonlinear model where r2 was 0 62 fi and 0 57 sdi respectively fig 3 the ydm increased linearly with lai increase under both irrigation systems fi r2 0 56 and sdi 0 64 moreover the slope value under sdi was higher than that under fi 3 2 crude protein content and relative feeding value of alfalfa under two irrigation systems crude protein cp of alfalfa was significantly affected by irrigation system table 2 the cp content was affected by the rdi which varied with the growth fig 4 in 2017 the rdi significantly affected cp content only at the 1st cut under fi and the cp content was the lowest in ifu100 and ibr50 in 2018 the rdi had significant effect on cp content at all cuts under both irrigation systems at the 2nd and 3rd cut cp content tended to increase with the decreasing irrigation amount during the whole growth period ifu100 isl70 and imo50 in 2019 the rdi only had significant effect on cp content at the 2nd cut under fi and cp content tended to increase with the decreasing irrigation amount during the whole growth period at all cuts relative feeding value rfv of alfalfa was significantly affected by treatment table 2 the effect of rdi on rfv was regulated by the growth fig 5 in 2017 the rdi significantly affected the rfv at all cuts but the 1st cut under fi in 2018 the rdi had a significant impact on the rfv except for the 1st cut under fi the rfv at the 2nd and 3rd cut tended to increase with reduced irrigation amount during the whole growth period ifu100 isl70 imo50 under both irrigation systems in 2019 the rfv at the 3rd cut under fi and at the 2nd and 3rd cut under sdi were significantly affected both cp content and rfv decreased significantly with increasing stem leaf ratio slr in linear models under both irrigation systems fig 6 the slopes under sdi were lower than those under fi in contrast both acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf contents increased linearly with slr increase 3 3 correlations between the dry matter yield and forage quality of alfalfa there were parabola relationships of ydm with cp ndf adf rfv and slr fig 7 with the increase of ydm the cp and rfv first decreased and then increased while the ndf adf and slr increased first and then decreased the inflexion position of parabola was different under the two irrigation systems the lowest cp content appeared when ydm was 14 8 t ha under fi while under sdi it was at 16 0 t ha ydm in contrast for ndf adf rfv and slr the inflexion point of fi was on the right of sdi 3 4 water use and correlation of irrigation amount with alfalfa performance irrigation water use efficiency iwue of alfalfa was significantly affected by irrigation system s treatment t and s t table 2 in 2017 there was no significant difference in iwue among regulated irrigations under the two irrigation systems while in 2018 and 2019 iwue changed significantly with regulated irrigation fig 8 it was the lowest under ifu100 and tended to increase with the decreasing irrigation amount the iwue under sdi was significantly higher than that under fi in three years irrigation amount had various impacts on the growth and quality characteristics of alfalfa which was different in different irrigation systems fig 9 under fi there was no correlation of irrigation amount with rfv ndf adf and cp at several cuts while more correlations were measured with ydm and plant height in contrast the correlation was attenuated under sdi nevertheless plant height was heavily affected by irrigation amount and there was a significant correlation between irrigation amount and lai under sdi 4 discussion 4 1 effect of regulated deficit irrigation on dry matter yield of alfalfa it is generally believed that the yield of alfalfa decreases with the decreasing irrigation amount carter and sheaffer 1982 klocke et al 2013 in this study the yield decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount under whole stage irrigation in 2018 with the decrease of irrigation amount the yield under fi decreased from 31 1 to 20 3 t ha and decreased from 22 1 to 12 3 t ha under sdi in 2019 the trend was similar but with higher yield the decrease of dry matter yield may be attributed to the reduced leaf expansion and photosynthesis under water stress hsiao 1973 zargar et al 2017 the alfalfa forage yield obtained in this study was in the high range of reported values from semiarid areas klocke et al 2013 lindenmayer et al 2011 lloveras et al 2008a 2008b additionally the performance of alfalfa was different when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages in 2018 and 2019 the ibb50 treatment had higher yield than the imo50 treatment suggesting that full irrigation at the regrowth stage would provide enough water for the emergence of more sprouts consequently affecting the final dry matter yield in contrast the branching stage was the most sensitive period of alfalfa to drought and water stress in this period would heavily affect the final dry matter accumulation cheng 2005 sun 2008 resulting in lower forage yield under the ibr50 treatment compared to other deficit treatments at single stage therefore for irrigation management of alfalfa total irrigation amount and performing stage should be considered together in practice in this study the dry matter yield at the 1st cut was generally higher than those at the rest cuts this may be due to the fact that sufficient light and water resources at the 1st cut helps to accumulate more dry matter while later the shortened sunshine length in autumn results in reduced dry matter accumulation and more dry matter of alfalfa is transferred to the root system for overwintering jing et al 2020 orloff et al 2005 however the dry matter yield at the 1st cut in 2017 was lower than that at the 2nd cut this may be because in the first year the biomass accumulation at early stage the 1st cut is mainly used for root growth steduto 2012 generally there is a good correlation between plant height and dry matter yield schirrmann et al 2016 tilly et al 2014 and dry matter yield is in large part considered a function of canopy or plant height pittman et al 2015 in this study the relationship between plant height and dry matter yield was closer to an exponential function under fi and sdi the r2 was 0 62 for fi and 0 57 for sdi which shows that with the increase of plant height dry matter yield increases faster the higher plant height tends to support the horizontal accumulation of dry matter maybe due to the increasing number of branches liu and guo 2013 found that higher soil moisture content resulted in more branches fig s1 there was a significant linear relationship between dry matter yield and lai the lai integrates leaf density and canopy height and it corresponds to leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area weiss et al 2004 so their relationship is closer to a linear relationship goswami et al 2015 in this three year test the iwue of sdi was significantly higher than that of fi the water deficit treatment in 2017 did not significantly affect the iwue value but there were significant effects in 2018 and 2019 this may be due to the lower dry matter yield in 2017 and therefore less demand for water in the treatment of ifu100 isl70 imo50 iwue showed an increasing trend with the decrease of irrigation amount there was no consistent trend in other treatments this also shows that the demand for water is different at different growth stages 4 2 effect of regulated deficit irrigation on forage quality under water stress perennial forage plants often have higher nutritive quality than those grown under well watered conditions halim et al 1989a wilson 1982 in this study with the decrease of irrigation amount crude protein content and relative feeding value showed an increasing trend under regulated irrigation treatments during the whole growth period this is consistent with previous studies halim et al 1989a 1989b wilson 1982 however it was not obvious in other treatments and the relationship between irrigation amount and crude protein content did not simply follow this rule when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages in the 2nd and 3rd cut in 2018 and 2019 water deficit caused the increase of relative feeding value during the whole growth period including ifu100 isl70 and imo50 treatments this confirmed the results of li et al 2017 and it was also not obvious in other treatments when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages under water stress higher leaf stem ratio halim et al 1989a and slower maturity speed wilson 1982 contribute to the improved forage quality in this study there was a significant negative correlation between crude protein rfv and stem leaf ratio while there was a significant positive correlation between ndf adf and stem leaf ratio this is consistent with other studies lloveras et al 2008a 2008b martiniello et al 1997 testa et al 2011 water stress affects the growth of stem more than the leaf halim et al 1989a and the content of cell wall in the stem is usually higher than that in the leaf which makes the leaf easier to be digested than the stem albrecht et al 1987 however although there was a significant correlation between stem leaf ratio and quality indexes the correlation coefficient was not high suggesting that stem leaf ratio may not be the main reason for the quality change of alfalfa volenec and cherney 1990 4 3 the correlation between biomass yield and forage quality high yield and good quality are two important goals of forage production in general higher irrigation amount can achieve greater dry matter yield but there is no simultaneous change in dry matter yield and forage quality li et al 2017 lindenmayer et al 2011 forage yield and forage quality are often reported to be negatively correlated demment et al 1986 li et al 2017 in this study although there was also a negative correlation between forage quality and yield the relationship was closer to quadratic relationships we found that there was also a quadratic relationship between dry matter yield and stem leaf ratio helping to explain the quadratic relationship between dry matter yield and quality index to some extent the cp content under fi reached the inflection point faster with the increase of dry matter yield than that under sdi while for rfv it was slower under fi in contrast there were significant parabolic relationships between dry matter yield and ndf adf and the detergent fiber contents reached the inflection point faster under sdi than fi this indicated that there were differences in the effects of fi and sdi on cp and fiber indexes of alfalfa although we found significant quadratic relationships between dry matter yield and quality of alfalfa it was still difficult to simply determine a balance of the yield and quality in the production we failed to show a value where we can have both high yield and good quality in this study we think this may be an economic issue rather than an experiment result just as orloff and putnam 2010 suggested strive for higher output in the year of high price and strive for higher quality in the year of low price 5 conclusions under both irrigation systems alfalfa forage yield decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount under whole stage irrigation while forage quality increased however the performance of alfalfa was different when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages with limited water supply deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually maintained a higher forage yield compared to slightly stressed irrigation during the whole growth deficit irrigation at the branching stage led to more negative effect on forage yield compared to other single stages there was also a negative correlation between forage quality and yield which was closer to some quadratic relationships in the inland arid area of midwestern china subsurface drip irrigation showed a higher irrigation water use efficiency than flood irrigation for alfalfa production declaration of competing interest the authors

10167,farmers are challenged to maintain yield and economic productivity with declining water resources and climatic variability in semi arid regions worldwide growth stage based deficit irrigation has been suggested as a feasible approach to maintain yields with less water experiments were conducted in 2012 2013 and 2015 in which maize zea mays l was irrigated under twelve treatments with varied levels of deficit irrigation during the late vegetative lveg and maturation mat growth stage periods in northern colorado the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 ceres maize model was used to simulate the effects of growth stage based deficit irrigation on maize production and yield components the results showed that rzwqm2 could simulate the impact of temperature on maize phenology but did not simulate the impact of water stress on maize maturity both simulated and observed aboveground biomass grain yield and kernel weight decreased with the decrease of irrigation water amount during lveg and mat periods in general the simulated aboveground biomass and grain yield showed larger errors in terms of root mean squared error rmse relative rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency than those reported in the previous modeling studies where deficit irrigation was applied uniformly throughout the growing seasons in the same field future efforts to improve the effects of deficit irrigation on kernel development will likely make rzwqm2 a better tool for optimizing irrigation management in semi arid regions keywords root zone water quality model ceres maize grain yield kernel weight kernel number 1 introduction irrigation water in semi arid northern colorado has declined due to factors such as growing population increasing industrial water needs and declining aquifer recharge increasing temperature has resulted in increased evaporative water loss in watersheds and reduced river flows finley 2018 therefore farmers are facing a challenge of maintaining yield and economic productivity with declining irrigation water supplies maize is a major crop for human consumption and an important feed for livestock both regionally and globally more irrigated land is planted to maize than any other crop in the usa and this trend is increasing wright and wimberly 2013 derner et al 2015 many studies have been conducted on water management strategies that maximize maize production such as agronomic practices and irrigation systems and growth stage based deficit irrigation kirda 2002 walthall et al 2013 growth stage based deficit irrigation allocates a limited water supply in response to plant s varying sensitivity to water stress during different growth stages water deficit during reproductive stages from tassel emergence to the beginning of grain filling might reduce yield significantly by decreasing grain number due to poor pollination and fertilization bolanos and edmeades 1996 nesmith and ritchie 1992a saini and westgate 2000 çakir 2004 studies have shown a 20 40 reduction in maize yield by water stress during grain filling period with kernel weight being the most affected yield component nesmith and ritchie 1992b çakir 2004 it has also been reported that maize is relatively insensitive to water stress imposed during vegetative growth stages from emergence to tasseling and that water deficit during vegetative growth stages does not reduce maize yield significantly abrecht and carberry 1993 çakir 2004 however much of the previous research on maize has focused on the impact of water deficit during a single growth stage otegui et al 1995 bolanos and edmeades 1996 çakir 2004 and more recent research comas et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 has provided a more complex understanding of maize response to deficit irrigation there may be opportunities to improve water productivity yield per unit water consumed in maize by applying deficit irrigation during specific periods of both vegetative and maturation stages but full irrigation during key reproductive stages by studying crop water use as well as crop yield under deficit irrigation during the late vegetative lveg v8 vt and maturation mat r4 r6 growth stage periods comas et al 2019 suggested that greater water productivity could be achieved by deficit irrigation during lveg than mat periods zhang et al 2019 evaluated the impact of deficit irrigation on maize during lveg and mat periods in terms of phenology dry leaf weight aboveground biomass yield kernel number 1000 kernel weight and grain filling rate their results suggested that water deficit during lveg decreased the kernel number and dry leaf weight and thus decreased the potential grain filling rate whereas deficit during mat directly reduced the grain filling rate and duration and thus had the strongest effect on grain yield modeling studies have also evaluated maize responses to non water stressed and limited irrigation management anothai et al 2013 evaluated the capability of the cropping system model csm ceres maize model to simulate the impact of different irrigation regimes 100 85 70 55 and 40 of full crop water requirements throughout the season on maize growth and development under semi arid conditions in northern colorado their results showed that the csm ceres maize model simulated both grain yield and final biomass fairly well for all irrigation levels trout and dejonge 2017 found that water productivity of maize in colorado might be relatively insensitive to small decreases in crop evapotranspiration etc 25 when deficit irrigation was applied uniformly through the season but was partially relieved during early reproduction which was supported by modeling studies ma et al 2012a 2016 using the root zone water quality model decision support system for agrotechnology transfer rzwqm2 dssat zhang et al 2018 demonstrated that the daycent model could simulate maize canopy development biomass production soil water dynamics and grain yields under water deficit conditions as well as those achieved using models with greater complexity in crop growth production submodels e g ceres and rzwqm2 using the same dataset as the above mentioned studies ma et al 2012a 2016 qi et al 2016 reported that rzwqm2 adequately simulated overall corn growth stages in northern colorado under constant deficit irrigation water stress conditions saseendran et al 2014 modified the water stress factors for simulating dryland and limited irrigated corn using rzwqm2 model with the embedded csm ceres maize module their results show that overall simulation of crop responses to water stress was improved especially in simulation of corn grain yield most agricultural system models have been evaluated under uniform water stresses throughout the whole growing season few studies have reported on model performance under growth stage based irrigation management especially the response of yield components to deficit irrigation applied during lveg and or mat periods a recent study conducted in northern colorado has developed an agro economic model to connect plant growth stage specific evapotranspiration targets with farm profitability suggesting that deficit irrigation can become optimal both during lveg or mat periods depending on output price and production costs manning et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to further evaluate agricultural system models for simulating growth stage based irrigation management on crop production the purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of rzwqm2 in simulating maize yield and yield components under growth stage based deficit irrigation management with three years of experimental data and investigate the best growth stage based irrigation strategies under conditions of limited water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1

deficit irrigation rdi were arranged in a randomized block design with four replications table 1 irrigations trout and dejonge 2017 were scheduled using fao 56 dual crop coefficient methodology allen et al 1998 with basal crop coefficients adapted from table e 2 in jensen and allen 2016 and adjusted for measured crop canopy growth and senescence allen and pereira 2009 at the beginning all plots were irrigated the same to ensure good germination deficit irrigation was applied during the late vegetative lveg v8 vt and or maturation mat r4 r6 growth stage periods abendroth et al 2011 all

2013 was replaced with t40 80 in 2015 to further investigate the effect of water deficit during the mat period all measurements were taken from the middle six of twelve rows to avoid edge effects during each growing season irrigation water was applied through a surface drip irrigation system with 16 mm diameter drip tubing that was placed along each crop row meteorological data were recorded

full details of plant data collection are found in comas et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 2 2 description and calibration of rzwqm2 model the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 is a continuous time physically based deterministic whole system model developed by the u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars with detailed soil c n dynamics plant growth water and solute transport and heat flow ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2012a specifically the green ampt equation is used for water infiltration and the richards equation is solved for water redistribution between rainfall irrigation events the ceres maize crop model is incorporated from the dssat model and used in this study potential evapotranspiration estimated from the shuttleworth wallace equations is partitioned between potential evaporation and potential transpiration actual evaporation is calculated by solving the richards equation for upper boundary water flux and actual transpiration is estimated from root length density and soil water content ma et al 2006 2012a fang et al 2017 calibrated the model with measured data end of season crop yield and aboveground biomass soil water content in the 0 120 cm depth and growth stage data including emergence anthesis and maturity from the full irrigation 100 100 and lowest irrigation 40 40 treatments in 2012 and 2013 and the calibrated soil parameters for 2013 were used without further calibration since the same plots were planted to maize in 2013 and 2015 and these values were close to those used by ma et al 2012b on the same site table 4 however we did recalibrate the plant parameters to improve crop simulation because fang et al 2017 found inadequacy in their model calibration in response to irrigation for some treatments in addition ma et al 2012b demonstrated the dependence of calibrated plant parameters with calibration datasets due to the non uniqueness of model calibration therefore some recalibration of the plant parameters was warranted the maize cultivar parameters were calibrated using the parameter estimation pest software optimization algorithm in rzwqm2 based on the previous simulation study in fang et al 2017 who used soil water content plant biomass final yield and n uptake in their objective function for optimization in this study we also looked into kernel number and kernel weight although they are not included in the objective function the final calibrated maize cultivar parameters were similar to the previous results for the study site table 5 2 3 statistics for model calibration and evaluation the simulation performance was evaluated with the root mean squared error rmse eq 1 the relative rmse rrmse eq 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 3 nash and sutcliffe 1970

2016 interpretation and assessment of performance statistics followed standard methods and guidelines moriasi et al 2007 harmel et al 2014 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water the simulated and observed soil water storage sws in 0 200 cm depth in all treatments of each year ranged from 240 to 420 mm fig 1 simulated sws in 0 200 cm was on average lower than measured values in 2012 and 2013 but the rmse of sws of each year was smaller than average measurement error of 50 mm among replicates indicating that the simulated sws was reasonable with a rmse of 18 34 mm these simulation errors were also comparable with previous simulation results ma et al 2012b found rmse 37 mm for 0 200 cm soil depth fang et al 2017 found overall rmse for model evaluation treatments were 22 2 mm in 2012 and 24 8 mm in 2013 for 0 120 cm soil depth respectively at the same experiment site the model underpredicted total sws in 2012 and 2013 which was also reported by fang et al 2017 soil water measurement in the field depends on tdr sensor location measurements of sws were taken near the drip line and may have given higher readings than the modeled sws based on a homogeneous one dimensional layer fang et al 2017 compared with simulation results in upper soil layer 0 90 cm soil water content was better simulated in 90 200 cm with smaller rmse and rrmse values table 6 in general soil water content was overestimated in the 120 200 cm layers but underestimated in the 0 120 cm layers however overall the rmse rrmse nse and r2 values of the simulated soil water content in all layers across three years were 0 025 cm3 cm 3 15 2 0 39 and 0 47 respectively this is similar to that reported in a previous study at the same site saseendran et al 2014 although standard model performance criteria have not been developed for assessing soil moisture simulation applying standard surface flow based criteria harmel et al 2018 suggests that these results were marginally satisfactory nse and r2 0 5 or greater only for surface soil layers 0 30 cm and overall r2 0 200 cm table 6 both simulated and calculated seasonal evapotranspiration et from soil water balance decreased with decreasing total irrigation amount for example seasonal et values decreased from treatment 80 80 80 65 to 80 40 increased for treatment 65 80 and then decreased again for treatment 40 40 and treatment 40 80 showed a higher seasonal et value than treatment 40 40 in 2015 fig 2 seasonal et was overestimated in 2013 but was closer to measured data in 2012 and 2015 the overall rmse was 29 2 mm and r2 was 0 92 for simulated seasonal et across the three years the simulated seasonal et ranged from 350 to 825 mm across the treatments which was close to the estimated range of 323 771 mm from the soil water balance with rmse and r2 values of 22 6 mm and 0 94 2012 19 6 mm and 0 88 2013 and 18 8 mm and 0 97 2015 respectively the rmse and r2 of simulated swc and seasonal et were comparable with previous simulation results in the same field using the 2008 2011 data ma et al 2012a 2016 fang et al 2017 3 2 maize phenology and water stress simulations table 7 shows the days after planting dap when maize reached anthesis r1 and physiological maturity r6 in each treatment in 2012 2013 and 2015 dap data to reach beginning of grain filling r3 were not shown in table 7 but the observed and simulated values agreed well for all treatments in the three years as shown in table 7 the simulated maize phenology for r1 and r6 was close to the observed values in 2012 and 2013 but not in 2015 both simulated and observed r1 stage dap decreased with increasing mean air temperature table 2 and 7 for example mean air temperature in lveg increased from 20 3 c in 2012 21 0 c in 2015 table 2 thus requiring fewer days to reach r1 stage for both observed data and simulated values also the simulated maize phenology for r6 was up to 40 days longer than the observed values for deficit treatments in 2015 which corresponded with mean air temperature during the mat stage being about 3 4 c cooler in 2015 than in the other two years the csm ceres maize model simulated crop development mainly based on thermal time so it did not incorporate water stress effects in determining maturation days in all three years the simulated phenology was not sensitive to irrigation treatment so it did not reflect the fact that water stress accelerated maize development to reach r6 in the mat period table 7 results from previous studies also reported that water stress during mat would shorten the grain maturation period nesmith and ritchie 1992a 1992b abrecht and carberry 1993 farré and faci 2006 aydinsakir et al 2013 thus the csm ceres maize model was able to address the impact of temperature on maize phenology but could not reflect the impact of water stress on maize maturation many studies have shown plant responds to water stress differently at different growth stage sudar et al 1981 however the csm ceres maize model uses the same water nitrogen and temperature stresses factor throughout the growing season the empirical equation itself in the model may be outdated due to the new cultivars developed in the past decades new approaches are needed to include water stress in plant phenology development mcmaster et al 2019 in 2013 rzwqm2 did not simulate water stress during rep but did simulate water stress during lveg and mat for the deficit irrigation treatments table 8 in 2012 and 2015 maize showed water stress not only during lveg and mat but also some degree of stress during rep especially in 2012 in 2012 it was a dry year with average air temperature during rep being higher than those in 2013 and 2015 which could be the reason for water stress during the period even resuming full irrigation later could not relieve the accumulated stress from lveg there was about 80 mm more precipitation during mat in 2013 than the other two years table 2 so lower water stress was observed after rain interfered with the designed deficit treatments in 2015 the observed rep r1 r3 was between 61 and 86 days after planting dap while the simulated rep was between 72 and 86 dap thus the water stress effect ranging from 61 to 71 dap actual deficit irrigation applied was accounted into the simulated stress value for rep overall the simulated water stress increased with decreasing irrigation amount during both lveg and mat for example for treatments 40 80 and 40 40 in 2015 similar stress levels were observed during lveg but the stress level in treatment 40 40 was higher than for 40 80 due to receiving less irrigation during mat 3 3 leaf area index destructive direct measurements of leaf area index lai for all treatments were only taken four times in 2012 comas et al 2019 during early growth stages lai was overpredicted when lai was low especially for lowest irrigation treatments 50 50 and 40 40 and underpredicted when lai was moderate to high fig 3 with rmse of 0 51 cm2 cm 2 rrmse of 16 4 and nse of 0 89 similar simulation errors were reported for csm ceres maize model in previous studies ma et al 2016 saseendran et al 2014 the treatments to meet 65 of etc or above during lveg reached similar lai values by the beginning of mat especially treatment 100 50 this indicated that water stress during mat had little impact on vegetative growth 3 4 yield and yield component simulation the statistical comparison between model simulated and observed grain and biomass yield kernel number and 1000 kernel weight are shown in table 9 both simulated and observed grain yield decreased with decreasing irrigation amount during lveg and mat fig 4 as stated previously in ceres maize water stress during lveg might have impacted yield in two ways 1 by its effect on potential daily growth rate which affects kernel number and 2 by its effect on lai and the carbon assimilation process the water stress has direct impacts on daily kernel growth rate during mat the rmse rrmse r2 and nse values of simulated yield were 1193 kg ha 11 0 75 and 0 75 2012 551 kg ha 5 0 77 and 0 23 2013 and 1148 kg ha 15 0 84 and 0 74 2015 respectively the simulation errors in grain yield were higher than the values in previous studies at the same experimental site ma et al 2012a 2016 fang et al 2017 which suggested that the model performed better for a crop under uniform water stress conditions throughout the season than that under stage based stress conditions the response of both simulated and observed grain yield to water stress during mat and lveg varied in different years both simulated and observed grain yield showed an obvious decreasing trend with decreasing irrigation amount during lveg and mat in 2012 and 2015 due to high crop water stress in 2013 simulated grain yield was less responsive to the treatments due to less water stress in mat although maize in 2013 still suffered high water stress in lveg which indicated that enough irrigation in mat might relieve the impact of water stress in lveg on maize yield based on both simulated and observed results in 2012 and 2013 water stress during lveg and mat showed similar effect on grain yield reduction however in 2015 the simulated grain yield reduction was more significant with the decrease of irrigation amount during mat nonetheless the model adequately simulated the effect of water deficits in lveg and mat on maize yield simulation of final aboveground biomass yield aby was good in 2015 and fairly good in 2012 and 2013 fig 5 there was significant over estimation of aby in treatment 100 50 in 2012 and 2013 and 40 80 in 2015 which might indicate that the model could not simulate the aby for large contrasts of irrigation amount between lveg and mat the rmses of simulated aby table 9 were larger than those reported in previous studies in the same field using data from 2008 to 2011 uniformly irrigated treatments ma et al 2012a 2016 given the same irrigation amount during lveg both simulated and observed 1000 kernel weight decreased with decreasing irrigation amount in mat in all three years in rzwqm2 the daily growth rate during mat was calculated by adjusting the potential daily growth rate g2 in table 5 actual kernel number based on temperature and water stresses ma et al 2002 2006 jones et al 2003 the 1000 kernel weight g per 1000 kernels was determined by dividing grain yield g ha 1 by kernel number kernels ear 1 ears ha 1 times 1000 previous research also indicated that water stress during mat might result in decreased 1000 kernel weight caused by early leaf senescence and a shortened grain filling period grant et al 1989 nesmith and ritchie 1992b mansouri far et al 2010 the simulated values agreed well with observed 1000 kernel weight in 2012 and 2015 but overestimated observed values in 2013 the rmse rrmse r2 and nse values were 9 82 g 4 0 86 and 0 71 2012 and 9 48 g 4 0 98 and 0 60 2015 respectively the simulated 1000 kernel weight values of treatment 40 40 were inversely related to the simulated water stress values during the mat stage table 7 and fig 6 across the three years both observed and simulated kernel weight showed a decreasing trend with decreasing irrigation amount during mat especially the ability to repeat the small bumps on the curves for treatment 65 80 and 50 50 suggesting that rzwqm2 adequately simulated the effect of water stress in mat on kernel weight given the same irrigation amount in mat stage both observed and simulated kernel number decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount in lveg in all three years fig 7 simulated kernel numbers were similar for these treatments meeting 80 of etc or above in lveg treatment 40 80 also had similar kernel number as treatment 40 40 in 2015 which indicated that as expected water stress during lveg has much more impact on kernel number than water stress in mat if the crop suffered moderate to severe water stress during lveg water stress effects on kernel number might not be recovered even with more irrigation in rep and mat in ceres maize kernel number per plant is determined in the flowering vt r1 period based on a potential kernel number g2 in table 5 canopy weight daily carbohydrate accumulation as well as stress during this period ma et al 2002 2006 jones et al 2003 thus in the ceres maize water stress before vt stage might cause the decrease of kernel number by decreasing the leaf weight and then decreasing carbohydrate accumulation during the flowering period previous studies also suggested that the actual kernel number was determined at r1 and any factors that influence the ovules fertilization processes might affect the actual kernel number kiniry and ritchie 1985 ritchie and hanway 1989 nesmith and ritchie 1992a experimental studies indicate that water stress at v12 and v17 stages also have direct impact on kernel number by influencing the ear size and number of ovules potential kernels ritchie and hanway 1989 the ceres maize model underestimated the kernel number in all three years fig 7 which suggested high water stress effects on kernel number simulated in the model as kernel number were reduced significantly from the potential g3 of 890 to less than 500 overall the ceres maize model in the rzwqm2 successfully simulated the impact of water stress during lveg on kernel number the corresponding rmse rrmse nse and r2 ranged 15 4 42 3 3 8 5 52 to 0 67 and 0 3 0 72 in three years respectively table 9 4 conclusion the study used ceres maize model in rzwqm2 to simulate the effects of growth stage based deficit irrigation on maize zea mays l dekalb dck52 59 growth and yield components the results showed that the impact of temperature on maize phenological development was simulated adequately but the impact of water stress on maize phenology was not accurately simulated both simulated and observed aboveground biomass yield grain yield and kernel weight decreased with decreasing irrigation water amount during lveg and mat periods in general the simulation errors of aboveground biomass and grain yield were higher in terms of rmse rrmse and nse than those reported previously where deficit irrigation was applied uniformly throughout the growing seasons in the same field the simulated and observed 1000 kernel weight in 2012 and 2015 agreed well with rmse rrmse r2 and nse values of 9 82 g 4 0 86 and 0 71 2012 and 9 48 g 4 0 98 and 0 6 2015 respectively the study also revealed the knowledge gaps in ceres maize model in terms of water stress effects on kernel number and maturity dates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10167,farmers are challenged to maintain yield and economic productivity with declining water resources and climatic variability in semi arid regions worldwide growth stage based deficit irrigation has been suggested as a feasible approach to maintain yields with less water experiments were conducted in 2012 2013 and 2015 in which maize zea mays l was irrigated under twelve treatments with varied levels of deficit irrigation during the late vegetative lveg and maturation mat growth stage periods in northern colorado the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 ceres maize model was used to simulate the effects of growth stage based deficit irrigation on maize production and yield components the results showed that rzwqm2 could simulate the impact of temperature on maize phenology but did not simulate the impact of water stress on maize maturity both simulated and observed aboveground biomass grain yield and kernel weight decreased with the decrease of irrigation water amount during lveg and mat periods in general the simulated aboveground biomass and grain yield showed larger errors in terms of root mean squared error rmse relative rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency than those reported in the previous modeling studies where deficit irrigation was applied uniformly throughout the growing seasons in the same field future efforts to improve the effects of deficit irrigation on kernel development will likely make rzwqm2 a better tool for optimizing irrigation management in semi arid regions keywords root zone water quality model ceres maize grain yield kernel weight kernel number 1 introduction irrigation water in semi arid northern colorado has declined due to factors such as growing population increasing industrial water needs and declining aquifer recharge increasing temperature has resulted in increased evaporative water loss in watersheds and reduced river flows finley 2018 therefore farmers are facing a challenge of maintaining yield and economic productivity with declining irrigation water supplies maize is a major crop for human consumption and an important feed for livestock both regionally and globally more irrigated land is planted to maize than any other crop in the usa and this trend is increasing wright and wimberly 2013 derner et al 2015 many studies have been conducted on water management strategies that maximize maize production such as agronomic practices and irrigation systems and growth stage based deficit irrigation kirda 2002 walthall et al 2013 growth stage based deficit irrigation allocates a limited water supply in response to plant s varying sensitivity to water stress during different growth stages water deficit during reproductive stages from tassel emergence to the beginning of grain filling might reduce yield significantly by decreasing grain number due to poor pollination and fertilization bolanos and edmeades 1996 nesmith and ritchie 1992a saini and westgate 2000 çakir 2004 studies have shown a 20 40 reduction in maize yield by water stress during grain filling period with kernel weight being the most affected yield component nesmith and ritchie 1992b çakir 2004 it has also been reported that maize is relatively insensitive to water stress imposed during vegetative growth stages from emergence to tasseling and that water deficit during vegetative growth stages does not reduce maize yield significantly abrecht and carberry 1993 çakir 2004 however much of the previous research on maize has focused on the impact of water deficit during a single growth stage otegui et al 1995 bolanos and edmeades 1996 çakir 2004 and more recent research comas et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 has provided a more complex understanding of maize response to deficit irrigation there may be opportunities to improve water productivity yield per unit water consumed in maize by applying deficit irrigation during specific periods of both vegetative and maturation stages but full irrigation during key reproductive stages by studying crop water use as well as crop yield under deficit irrigation during the late vegetative lveg v8 vt and maturation mat r4 r6 growth stage periods comas et al 2019 suggested that greater water productivity could be achieved by deficit irrigation during lveg than mat periods zhang et al 2019 evaluated the impact of deficit irrigation on maize during lveg and mat periods in terms of phenology dry leaf weight aboveground biomass yield kernel number 1000 kernel weight and grain filling rate their results suggested that water deficit during lveg decreased the kernel number and dry leaf weight and thus decreased the potential grain filling rate whereas deficit during mat directly reduced the grain filling rate and duration and thus had the strongest effect on grain yield modeling studies have also evaluated maize responses to non water stressed and limited irrigation management anothai et al 2013 evaluated the capability of the cropping system model csm ceres maize model to simulate the impact of different irrigation regimes 100 85 70 55 and 40 of full crop water requirements throughout the season on maize growth and development under semi arid conditions in northern colorado their results showed that the csm ceres maize model simulated both grain yield and final biomass fairly well for all irrigation levels trout and dejonge 2017 found that water productivity of maize in colorado might be relatively insensitive to small decreases in crop evapotranspiration etc 25 when deficit irrigation was applied uniformly through the season but was partially relieved during early reproduction which was supported by modeling studies ma et al 2012a 2016 using the root zone water quality model decision support system for agrotechnology transfer rzwqm2 dssat zhang et al 2018 demonstrated that the daycent model could simulate maize canopy development biomass production soil water dynamics and grain yields under water deficit conditions as well as those achieved using models with greater complexity in crop growth production submodels e g ceres and rzwqm2 using the same dataset as the above mentioned studies ma et al 2012a 2016 qi et al 2016 reported that rzwqm2 adequately simulated overall corn growth stages in northern colorado under constant deficit irrigation water stress conditions saseendran et al 2014 modified the water stress factors for simulating dryland and limited irrigated corn using rzwqm2 model with the embedded csm ceres maize module their results show that overall simulation of crop responses to water stress was improved especially in simulation of corn grain yield most agricultural system models have been evaluated under uniform water stresses throughout the whole growing season few studies have reported on model performance under growth stage based irrigation management especially the response of yield components to deficit irrigation applied during lveg and or mat periods a recent study conducted in northern colorado has developed an agro economic model to connect plant growth stage specific evapotranspiration targets with farm profitability suggesting that deficit irrigation can become optimal both during lveg or mat periods depending on output price and production costs manning et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to further evaluate agricultural system models for simulating growth stage based irrigation management on crop production the purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of rzwqm2 in simulating maize yield and yield components under growth stage based deficit irrigation management with three years of experimental data and investigate the best growth stage based irrigation strategies under conditions of limited water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the field experiment was conducted on maize zea mays l dekalb dck52 59 102 day relative maturity class maize hybrid designed for use in the northern colorado at the usda ars limited

deficiencies on all treatments total applied nitrogen n uan 32 ranged between 266 and 349 kg ha 1 in 2012 230 294 kg ha 1 in 2013 and 242 290 kg ha 1 in 2015 depending on the treatment a liquid starter n of 41 kg ha 1 was applied at planting each year with approximately 170 kg ha 1 applied as fertigation over four irrigation events in 2012 160 kg ha 1 applied over five irrigation events in 2013 comas et al 2019 and 167 kg ha 1 applied as fertigation over four irrigation events in 2015 in july prior to tasseling the remainder of n 97 175 kg ha 1 in 2012 74 127 kg ha 1 in 2013 38 120 kg

sections and maize was rotated with sunflower helianthus annuus l with the same irrigation treatment design each section was divided into four replicated blocks and each block was divided into twelve 9 m 43 m plots containing twelve crop rows oriented north south with 0 76 m spacing during the growing seasons in 2012 2013 and 2015 twelve irrigation treatments with varying levels of regulated deficit irrigation rdi were arranged in a randomized block design with four replications table 1 irrigations trout and dejonge 2017 were scheduled using fao 56 dual crop coefficient methodology allen et al 1998 with basal crop coefficients adapted from table e 2 in jensen and allen 2016 and adjusted for measured crop canopy growth and senescence allen and pereira 2009 at the beginning all plots were irrigated the same to ensure good germination deficit irrigation was applied during the late vegetative lveg v8 vt and or maturation mat r4 r6 growth stage periods abendroth et al 2011 all treatments were irrigated fully to meet etc demand during the reproductive period rep r1 r3 each treatment was targeted to meet a percentage of potential non stressed etc allen et al 1998 jensen and

2013 was replaced with t40 80 in 2015 to further investigate the effect of water deficit during the mat period all measurements were taken from the middle six of twelve rows to avoid edge effects during each growing season irrigation water was applied through a surface drip irrigation system with 16 mm diameter drip tubing that was placed along each crop row meteorological data were recorded

lveg to the end of the growing season the total irrigation and actual et amount mm for each treatment in experimental years are given in table 3 comas et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 maize phenology was measured weekly during each growing season from five plants in each treatment plot or a total of 20 plants for each treatment aboveground biomass and leaf area index lai were measured at the beginning

plants collected from each plot all biomass samples were oven dried to constant mass at 60 c grain was removed from the ear after being dried and then both grain and cob were re dried and weighed the dry weight sum of leaves stems cob and grain was considered the total aboveground biomass and was calculated for each plot once grain moisture in the plots fell to approximately 16 grain yield was

full details of plant data collection are found in comas et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 2 2 description and calibration of rzwqm2 model the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 is a continuous time physically based deterministic whole system model developed by the u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars with detailed soil c n dynamics plant growth water and solute transport and heat flow ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2012a specifically the green ampt equation is used for water infiltration and the richards equation is solved for water redistribution between rainfall irrigation events the ceres maize crop model is incorporated from the dssat model and used in this study potential evapotranspiration estimated from the shuttleworth wallace equations is partitioned between potential evaporation and potential transpiration actual evaporation is calculated by solving the richards equation for upper boundary water flux and actual transpiration is estimated from root length density and soil water content ma et al 2006 2012a fang et al 2017 calibrated the model with measured data end of season crop yield and aboveground biomass soil water content in the 0 120 cm depth and growth stage data including emergence anthesis and maturity from the full irrigation 100 100 and lowest irrigation 40 40 treatments in 2012 and 2013 and the calibrated soil parameters for 2013 were used without further calibration since the same plots were planted to maize in 2013 and 2015 and these values were close to those used by ma et al 2012b on the same site table 4 however we did recalibrate the plant parameters to improve crop simulation because fang et al 2017 found inadequacy in their model calibration in response to irrigation for some treatments in addition ma et al 2012b demonstrated the dependence of calibrated plant parameters with calibration datasets due to the non uniqueness of model calibration therefore some recalibration of the plant parameters was warranted the maize cultivar parameters were calibrated using the parameter estimation pest software optimization algorithm in rzwqm2 based on the previous simulation study in fang et al 2017 who used soil water content plant biomass final yield and n uptake in their objective function for optimization in this study we also looked into kernel number and kernel weight although they are not included in the objective function the final calibrated maize cultivar parameters were similar to the previous results for the study site table 5 2 3 statistics for model calibration and evaluation the simulation performance was evaluated with the root mean squared error rmse eq 1 the relative rmse rrmse eq 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 3 nash and sutcliffe 1970

simulated value o i is the ith observed value o and p are the mean observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of data pairs the statistical analyses were conducted in r r core team 2016 interpretation and assessment of performance statistics followed standard methods and guidelines moriasi et al 2007 harmel et al 2014 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water the simulated and observed soil water storage sws in 0 200 cm depth in all treatments of each year ranged from 240 to 420 mm fig 1 simulated sws in 0 200 cm was on average lower than measured values in 2012 and 2013 but the rmse of sws of each year was smaller than average measurement error of 50 mm among replicates indicating that the simulated sws was reasonable with a rmse of 18 34 mm these simulation errors were also comparable with previous simulation results ma et al 2012b found rmse 37 mm for 0 200 cm soil depth fang et al 2017 found overall rmse for model evaluation treatments were 22 2 mm in 2012 and 24 8 mm in 2013 for 0 120 cm soil depth respectively at the same experiment site the model underpredicted total sws in 2012 and 2013 which was also reported by fang et al 2017 soil water measurement in the field depends on tdr sensor location measurements of sws were taken near the drip line and may have given higher readings than the modeled sws based on a homogeneous one dimensional layer fang et al 2017 compared with simulation results in upper soil layer 0 90 cm soil water content was better simulated in 90 200 cm with smaller rmse and rrmse values table 6 in general soil water content was overestimated in the 120 200 cm layers but underestimated in the 0 120 cm layers however overall the rmse rrmse nse and r2 values of the simulated soil water content in all layers across three years were 0 025 cm3 cm 3 15 2 0 39 and 0 47 respectively this is similar to that reported in a previous study at the same site saseendran et al 2014 although standard model performance criteria have not been developed for assessing soil moisture simulation applying standard surface flow based criteria harmel et al 2018 suggests that these results were marginally satisfactory nse and r2 0 5 or greater only for surface soil layers 0 30 cm and overall r2 0 200 cm table 6 both simulated and calculated seasonal evapotranspiration et from soil water balance decreased with decreasing total irrigation amount for example seasonal et values decreased from treatment 80 80 80 65 to 80 40 increased for treatment 65 80 and then decreased again for treatment 40 40 and treatment 40 80 showed a higher seasonal et value than treatment 40 40 in 2015 fig 2 seasonal et was overestimated in 2013 but was closer to measured data in 2012 and 2015 the overall rmse was 29 2 mm and r2 was 0 92 for simulated seasonal et across the three years the simulated seasonal et ranged from 350 to 825 mm across the treatments which was close to the estimated range of 323 771 mm from the soil water balance with rmse and r2 values of 22 6 mm and 0 94 2012 19 6 mm and 0 88 2013 and 18 8 mm and 0 97 2015 respectively the rmse and r2 of simulated swc and seasonal et were comparable with previous simulation results in the same field using the 2008 2011 data ma et al 2012a 2016 fang et al 2017 3 2 maize phenology and water stress simulations table 7 shows the days after planting dap when maize reached anthesis r1 and physiological maturity r6 in each treatment in 2012 2013 and 2015 dap data to reach beginning of grain filling r3 were not shown in table 7 but the observed and simulated values agreed well for all treatments in the three years as shown in table 7 the simulated maize phenology for r1 and r6 was close to the observed values in 2012 and 2013 but not in 2015 both simulated and observed r1 stage dap decreased with increasing mean air temperature table 2 and 7 for example mean air temperature in lveg increased from 20 3 c in 2012 21 0 c in 2015 table 2 thus requiring fewer days to reach r1 stage for both observed data and simulated values also the simulated maize phenology for r6 was up to 40 days longer than the observed values for deficit treatments in 2015 which corresponded with mean air temperature during the mat stage being about 3 4 c cooler in 2015 than in the other two years the csm ceres maize model simulated crop development mainly based on thermal time so it did not incorporate water stress effects in determining maturation days in all three years the simulated phenology was not sensitive to irrigation treatment so it did not reflect the fact that water stress accelerated maize development to reach r6 in the mat period table 7 results from previous studies also reported that water stress during mat would shorten the grain maturation period nesmith and ritchie 1992a 1992b abrecht and carberry 1993 farré and faci 2006 aydinsakir et al 2013 thus the csm ceres maize model was able to address the impact of temperature on maize phenology but could not reflect the impact of water stress on maize maturation many studies have shown plant responds to water stress differently at different growth stage sudar et al 1981 however the csm ceres maize model uses the same water nitrogen and temperature stresses factor throughout the growing season the empirical equation itself in the model may be outdated due to the new cultivars developed in the past decades new approaches are needed to include water stress in plant phenology development mcmaster et al 2019 in 2013 rzwqm2 did not simulate water stress during rep but did simulate water stress during lveg and mat for the deficit irrigation treatments table 8 in 2012 and 2015 maize showed water stress not only during lveg and mat but also some degree of stress during rep especially in 2012 in 2012 it was a dry year with average air temperature during rep being higher than those in 2013 and 2015 which could be the reason for water stress during the period even resuming full irrigation later could not relieve the accumulated stress from lveg there was about 80 mm more precipitation during mat in 2013 than the other two years table 2 so lower water stress was observed after rain interfered with the designed deficit treatments in 2015 the observed rep r1 r3 was between 61 and 86 days after planting dap while the simulated rep was between 72 and 86 dap thus the water stress effect ranging from 61 to 71 dap actual deficit irrigation applied was accounted into the simulated stress value for rep overall the simulated water stress increased with decreasing irrigation amount during both lveg and mat for example for treatments 40 80 and 40 40 in 2015 similar stress levels were observed during lveg but the stress level in treatment 40 40 was higher than for 40 80 due to receiving less irrigation during mat 3 3 leaf area index destructive direct measurements of leaf area index lai for all treatments were only taken four times in 2012 comas et al 2019 during early growth stages lai was overpredicted when lai was low especially for lowest irrigation treatments 50 50 and 40 40 and underpredicted when lai was moderate to high fig 3 with rmse of 0 51 cm2 cm 2 rrmse of 16 4 and nse of 0 89 similar simulation errors were reported for csm ceres maize model in previous studies ma et al 2016 saseendran et al 2014 the treatments to meet 65 of etc or above during lveg reached similar lai values by the beginning of mat especially treatment 100 50 this indicated that water stress during mat had little impact on vegetative growth 3 4 yield and yield component simulation the statistical comparison between model simulated and observed grain and biomass yield kernel number and 1000 kernel weight are shown in table 9 both simulated and observed grain yield decreased with decreasing irrigation amount during lveg and mat fig 4 as stated previously in ceres maize water stress during lveg might have impacted yield in two ways 1 by its effect on potential daily growth rate which affects kernel number and 2 by its effect on lai and the carbon assimilation process the water stress has direct impacts on daily kernel growth rate during mat the rmse rrmse r2 and nse values of simulated yield were 1193 kg ha 11 0 75 and 0 75 2012 551 kg ha 5 0 77 and 0 23 2013 and 1148 kg ha 15 0 84 and 0 74 2015 respectively the simulation errors in grain yield were higher than the values in previous studies at the same experimental site ma et al 2012a 2016 fang et al 2017 which suggested that the model performed better for a crop under uniform water stress conditions throughout the season than that under stage based stress conditions the response of both simulated and observed grain yield to water stress during mat and lveg varied in different years both simulated and observed grain yield showed an obvious decreasing trend with decreasing irrigation amount during lveg and mat in 2012 and 2015 due to high crop water stress in 2013 simulated grain yield was less responsive to the treatments due to less water stress in mat although maize in 2013 still suffered high water stress in lveg which indicated that enough irrigation in mat might relieve the impact of water stress in lveg on maize yield based on both simulated and observed results in 2012 and 2013 water stress during lveg and mat showed similar effect on grain yield reduction however in 2015 the simulated grain yield reduction was more significant with the decrease of irrigation amount during mat nonetheless the model adequately simulated the effect of water deficits in lveg and mat on maize yield simulation of final aboveground biomass yield aby was good in 2015 and fairly good in 2012 and 2013 fig 5 there was significant over estimation of aby in treatment 100 50 in 2012 and 2013 and 40 80 in 2015 which might indicate that the model could not simulate the aby for large contrasts of irrigation amount between lveg and mat the rmses of simulated aby table 9 were larger than those reported in previous studies in the same field using data from 2008 to 2011 uniformly irrigated treatments ma et al 2012a 2016 given the same irrigation amount during lveg both simulated and observed 1000 kernel weight decreased with decreasing irrigation amount in mat in all three years in rzwqm2 the daily growth rate during mat was calculated by adjusting the potential daily growth rate g2 in table 5 actual kernel number based on temperature and water stresses ma et al 2002 2006 jones et al 2003 the 1000 kernel weight g per 1000 kernels was determined by dividing grain yield g ha 1 by kernel number kernels ear 1 ears ha 1 times 1000 previous research also indicated that water stress during mat might result in decreased 1000 kernel weight caused by early leaf senescence and a shortened grain filling period grant et al 1989 nesmith and ritchie 1992b mansouri far et al 2010 the simulated values agreed well with observed 1000 kernel weight in 2012 and 2015 but overestimated observed values in 2013 the rmse rrmse r2 and nse values were 9 82 g 4 0 86 and 0 71 2012 and 9 48 g 4 0 98 and 0 60 2015 respectively the simulated 1000 kernel weight values of treatment 40 40 were inversely related to the simulated water stress values during the mat stage table 7 and fig 6 across the three years both observed and simulated kernel weight showed a decreasing trend with decreasing irrigation amount during mat especially the ability to repeat the small bumps on the curves for treatment 65 80 and 50 50 suggesting that rzwqm2 adequately simulated the effect of water stress in mat on kernel weight given the same irrigation amount in mat stage both observed and simulated kernel number decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount in lveg in all three years fig 7 simulated kernel numbers were similar for these treatments meeting 80 of etc or above in lveg treatment 40 80 also had similar kernel number as treatment 40 40 in 2015 which indicated that as expected water stress during lveg has much more impact on kernel number than water stress in mat if the crop suffered moderate to severe water stress during lveg water stress effects on kernel number might not be recovered even with more irrigation in rep and mat in ceres maize kernel number per plant is determined in the flowering vt r1 period based on a potential kernel number g2 in table 5 canopy weight daily carbohydrate accumulation as well as stress during this period ma et al 2002 2006 jones et al 2003 thus in the ceres maize water stress before vt stage might cause the decrease of kernel number by decreasing the leaf weight and then decreasing carbohydrate accumulation during the flowering period previous studies also suggested that the actual kernel number was determined at r1 and any factors that influence the ovules fertilization processes might affect the actual kernel number kiniry and ritchie 1985 ritchie and hanway 1989 nesmith and ritchie 1992a experimental studies indicate that water stress at v12 and v17 stages also have direct impact on kernel number by influencing the ear size and number of ovules potential kernels ritchie and hanway 1989 the ceres maize model underestimated the kernel number in all three years fig 7 which suggested high water stress effects on kernel number simulated in the model as kernel number were reduced significantly from the potential g3 of 890 to less than 500 overall the ceres maize model in the rzwqm2 successfully simulated the impact of water stress during lveg on kernel number the corresponding rmse rrmse nse and r2 ranged 15 4 42 3 3 8 5 52 to 0 67 and 0 3 0 72 in three years respectively table 9 4 conclusion the study used ceres maize model in rzwqm2 to simulate the effects of growth stage based deficit irrigation on maize zea mays l dekalb dck52 59 growth and yield components the results showed that the impact of temperature on maize phenological development was simulated adequately but the impact of water stress on maize phenology was not accurately simulated both simulated and observed aboveground biomass yield grain yield and kernel weight decreased with decreasing irrigation water amount during lveg and mat periods in general the simulation errors of aboveground biomass and grain yield were higher in terms of rmse rrmse and nse than those reported previously where deficit irrigation was applied uniformly throughout the growing seasons in the same field the simulated and observed 1000 kernel weight in 2012 and 2015 agreed well with rmse rrmse r2 and nse values of 9 82 g 4 0 86 and 0 71 2012 and 9 48 g 4 0 98 and 0 6 2015 respectively the study also revealed the knowledge gaps in ceres maize model in terms of water stress effects on kernel number and maturity dates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10168,agriculture has always been considered as an important source of food supply and the optimal use of its resources specially water for productive agriculture has been given especial attention in this paper a simulation optimization model based on the volume balance model for designing an efficient and practical irrigation system is presented the proposed model uses the multi objective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing design parameters of different irrigation systems furrow border and basin using appropriate constraints and applying performance indicators in first and subsequent irrigations practical and theoretical optimal designs are obtained the proposed model achieves a more practical design using three novel approaches first simultaneously considering the performance indicators of the first and subsequent irrigations second using both total time required for irrigation and inflow rate of the field third considering the labor required to implement the obtained design in this study the proposed model was evaluated performing several experiments on 16 fields to get better results an evolutionary method called metaga is used to properly tune the parameters of the simulation optimization model results of the simulation stage of the proposed model were compared with results of two simulation software in the irrigation systems sirmod and surdev and the simulation stage was validated results of the proposed model were evaluated using the results of two other models edosim and multi objective in 16 fields based on 5 performance indicators the results of this study reveal that the proposed model in most fields and indicators achieves better results and the results are close in the others keywords surface irrigation system design precision

of the world is agriculture and the demand for shared agricultural resources is ever increasing by the population growth advancement of civilization increasing of agricultural and industrial productivity and other interactual systems choudhari and anand raj 2010 the transition from traditional to modern agriculture is of special attention modern agriculture and the use of new technologies and knowledge in order to increase agricultural productivity has been considered by researchers and participants in the field of agriculture water as one of the most important and effective resources in agriculture needs to be paid special attention since transition from traditional farming methods and direct use of new technologies requires a lot of time and money one of the effective solutions is to use new technologies to help improve the processes and decisions of traditional methods as an empowering utility one of the resources that can have a significant impact on agricultural productivity if it is managed and used carefully is water so the optimal management and design of the irrigation system is a good choice to realize modern agriculture the precision irrigation which use modern technologies such as iot cloud platforms and variety of many sensors for monitoring and controlling advance time of irrigation has been considered in recent years abioye et al 2020 the gravity flow in surface irrigation system is mostly used in agricultural irrigation systems the surface irrigation systems can be broadly classified as basin irrigation border irrigation furrow irrigation and uncontrolled flooding in the basin irrigation precision land leveling is very important to achieve high uniformity and efficiency in the border irrigation the precision of the field topography is critical but the extended lengths permit better leveling using the farm machinery the furrow irrigation provides better on farm water management flexibility under many surface irrigation conditions each surface irrigation system has unique advantages and disadvantages depending on factors which are listed here 1 initial cost 2 size and shape of fields 3 soil characteristics 4 nature and availability of the water supply 5 climate 6 cropping patterns 7 social preferences and structures 8 historical experiences and 9 influences external to the surface irrigation system walker 1989 the principle purpose of irrigating croplands is to replenish the root zone reservoir frequently enough to avoid crop stress but uniformly and efficiently enough to conserve energy water nutrients and labor in the design practice there is the assumption that uniformity and efficiency can be predicted from such parameters as discharge application time infiltration characteristics field slope and length and depth required to refill the root zone the data required for surface irrigation design is the inflow rate and duration the topography of land surface such as slope and surface drainage points the physical and chemical characteristics such as infiltration characteristics and the economic condition in the area as well as the availability of labor walker and skogerboe 1987 questions that are common to all irrigation systems are when to irrigate how much to apply and can the efficiency be improved walker 1989 the method frequency and duration of irrigations have significant effects on crop yield and farm productivity irrigation systems are often designed to maximize efficiencies and minimize labor and capital requirements walker 1989 in walker and skogerboe 1987 one of the basic methods for designing a surface irrigation system is presented where a search is performed from q min to q max for discharge and each selected value is simulated for calculating the efficiency the simulation procedure based on volume balance equation zero inertia kinematic and so on is implemented as a software and this design procedure can be performed using these software programs but the number of effective parameters in the design and simulation are large so search space of the design is relatively large also many criteria must be checked for each proposed design which are satisfying practical proposed design so for efficiently solving this design problem a constrained optimization problem cop is defined the meta heuristic methods are appropriate tools for solving the problems where the relationship between inputs and objectives is complex and multiple eiben and smith 2015 in akbari et al 2018 a simulation optimization model is proposed as edosim for design and evaluation of surface irrigation system for border basin and furrow method of irrigation in this model a volume balance equation is used for simulating and twenty meta heuristic algorithm are used for optimizing in the edosim seven performance indicators are used for optimizing which are weighted sum as a single objective optimization criterion also in the edosim some constraints are used in optimization procedure two main drawbacks of the edosim are the first simulate and design is performed only for one application in each irrigation practice and first and subsequent irrigations are not considered in the design simultaneously second constraints for required total inflow and total time of irrigation are not taken into account based on available resource of field therefore the design provided by the model may not be consistent with available resources in saberi et al 2020 a simulation optimization framework is proposed for furrow surface irrigation design in this paper flow rate furrow length and cut off time are given as decision variable and four performance indicator are used as multi objective optimization criteria also amalgam algorithm is used as multi objective optimization algorithm the software surdev is used for simulation and performance indicator calculation a few important constraints such as the total inflow rate and the total time required are not used in this paper some software programs are developed for simulating the surface irrigation system such as winsrfr bautista et al 2009b sirmod walker 2003 and surdev garcia 2014 also some studies are performed for analyzing these simulator software programs in ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 the accuracy of three mathematical models in the sirmod package for estimating advance and recession time are analyzed in some papers the simulation software programs are used to design and validate the selected parameters of surface irrigation system in salahou et al 2018 the effect of cut off time and bottom slope of field are analyzed using winsrfr for border irrigation field of winter wheat in china in bautista et al 2009a basin irrigation system is analyzed by winsrfr software in fadul et al 2020 winsrfr is used for verifying proposed design in large field dimensions which has made a significant improvement in efficiency adequacy and uniformity in mazarei et al 2020 the winsrfr is used for optimizing the inflow rate slope and field length of blocked end furrow irrigation system also in some researches only the most effective irrigation parameters are used directly in the design and other parameters are considered indirectly or as inputs with known values these studies focus only on a small and effective part of the parameters of the irrigation system smith et al 2018 and valipour and montazar 2012 are examples of these researches in smith et al 2018 the relationship between flow rate time of cut off and application efficiency as performance indicator is provided for furrow field in this paper sisco model gillies and smith 2015 is used as a simulation model the main related parameter which is analyzed is the advance time in valipour and montazar 2012 the mixed of genetic algorithm and winsrfr is used for designing and optimizing of furrow irrigation since these studies focus only on a small part of the parameters in the irrigation system the proposed model has less flexibility to design an optimal irrigation system while if more effective parameters were used in modeling the chances of designing a more optimal irrigation system would increase in the proposed model more effective parameters are used to design a better irrigation system in order to investigate the impact and desirability of evolutionary optimization algorithms on water engineering issues several studies have been presented in which evolutionary optimization algorithms are used to optimize water engineering issues in fanuel et al 2018 40 paper about agricultural water management problem solving using multi objective optimization algorithm is analyzed in this paper nsgaii mode and ga algorithms are examined in various fields including water allocation crop planning in water scarce areas and irrigation planning in this paper it is shown that the multi objective algorithm in water management problem can provide desirable results in khazaipoul et al 2019 a simulation optimization model is presented which uses swat and weap as simulation model and non dominated sorting differential evolution nsde as multi objective problem solver for solving the water allocation problem with conflicted objectives the result of this paper shows that the multi objective algorithm provides good results for water management problems in yassin et al 2016 a model for infiltrated water volume of furrow irrigation based on the gen expression algorithm is shown in this paper inflow rate q 0 furrow length advance time opportunity time and cross sectional area are used as input and the infiltration volume is the output of the model also in this paper 159 data points are used for training and testing the learning model based on the findings of this paper the use of evolutionary algorithms to learn specific patterns related to water engineering is appropriate in some papers the goal is to provide the best water allocation model based on one or more objective functions in ikudayisi et al 2018 a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used for optimizing water allocation based on crop net benefit and water resource usage in lalehzari et al 2016 a biobjective optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithm for groundwater allocation according to the reviewed research the use of evolutionary multi objective algorithms in optimization issues related to water engineering is a good choice and provides acceptable results accordingly in the proposed model evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms are used the simulation optimization models are convenient solutions to provide optimal design of surface irrigation systems the effective parameters in this design are numerous so problem spaces are also very large with nonlinear relationships on the other hand there are several performance indicators that are in conflict with each other in this design issue there are also a number of constraints that must be met in the design matter so in this design the issue of constrained optimization problem cop is raised the evolutionary algorithms are convenient tools for solving cop eiben and smith 2015 since this problem is inherently multi objective instead of turning it into a single objective problem that simply solves the problem in one state of objectives it is better to provide a set of appropriate solutions for different weight states of objectives then the farmer will select the appropriate design from the set of design solution based on his or her decision and priorities in this paper based on the design procedures presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 performance indicators for the first irrigation and subsequent irrigations are considered simultaneously since labor is considered as an effective resource in irrigation efficiency labor impact modeling is also considered in the simulation optimization proposed model in order to make the design presented by the model more applicable additional constraints are also included in the optimization process the details of the proposed model and its test results are presented below 2 materials and methods the simulation optimization proposed model designs a surface irrigation system for furrow border and basin systems simulation stage of the model uses the equations and procedure in walker and skogerboe 1987 optimization stage of the model uses the multi objective evolutionary algorithm the overview of the proposed model is shown in fig 1 as shown the main framework of the proposed model is based on multi objective evolutionary optimization algorithms the details of which are presented in the following of this section the simulation part of the proposed model is also included as an evaluation component fitness evaluation in the evolutionary algorithm cycle the details of which are also provided below the sequence of execution of the components of the proposed model is marked with numbers in order the parameters of the optimization algorithm is tuned using metaga which is a kind of evolutionary algorithm also sirmod and surdev which are two well known irrigation simulator software are used for validating the model and implementation of algorithms more details of the proposed model are provided below 2 1 simulation procedure the simulation procedure which is used in the proposed model is based on the volume balance equation in this simulation model the kostiakov lewis characteristics such as a k and f 0 are known and advance time rescission time the depletion time and infiltration volume are unknown and are calculated based on numerical equations and procedures so the simulation stage of the model receives the mechanical chemical and geometrical characteristics of the field and designs irrigation system for the field and then calculates the intermediate parameters and finally the performance indicators by the following equations the volume balance equation base model is as lewis and milne 1938 1 0 t q t d t 0 x a x t d x 0 x z x t d x where q t is inlet discharge a x t is the cross sectional area of the surface and z x t is the cross sectional area of subsurface flow which variate with distance x and time t the volume balance equation is rewritten based on two assumptions first the power function which describes the trajectory of the advance of the water front field 2 x p t a x r where x is the distance the front has advance in time t a and r and p are empirical fitting parameters second the infiltration equation that has the modified kostiakov lewis characteristic form as 3 z k τ a f 0 τ where z is infiltrated volume per unit length after an infiltration elapsed time since the irrigation start τ k a and f 0 are kostiakov lewis parameters so the volume balance equation which is written utilizing eq 3 and eq 2 is 4 q 0 t σ y a 0 x σ z k t a x f 0 t x 1 r where q 0 is inlet discharge a 0 is cross sectional area of flow at the inlet σ y is the surface storage shape factor which is typically a constant between 0 7 and 0 8 and in this model is equal to 0 77 σ z is subsurface shape factor and based on numerical power advance approach defined as eq 5 5 σ z a r 1 a 1 1 r 1 a the cross sectional area of the furrow basin and border is calculated based on the geometrical design parameters and equations which are presented in walker 2003 based on the results which are provided in elliott et al 1983 wetted perimeter and cross sectional area can be expressed as simple power functions of depth which are presented in eq 6 and eq 7 6 w p γ 1 y γ 2 7 a σ 1 y σ 2 where a is the cross sectional area of the furrow in m 2 wp is the wetted perimeter of the furrow in m y is the flow depth in m and γ 1 γ 2 σ 1 and σ 2 are numerical fitting parameters the values of γ 1 γ 2 σ 1 and σ 2 for border and basin are 1 0 0 0 1 0 and 1 0 respectively these values for furrow assuming that the cross sectional area of the furrows is a parabolic geometric shape with a flat bottom with top width t max middle width t mid bottom width base and depth y max parameters can be estimated by equations eq 8 eq 9 eq 10 eq 11 8 σ 1 y m a x 2 b a s e 2 t m i d t m a x 2 y m a x σ 2 9 σ 2 l o g y m a x 2 b a s e 2 t m i d t m a x 2 y m a x 2 b a s e 2 t m i d t m a x 2 l o g 2 10 γ 1 b a s e y m a x 2 t m i d b a s e 2 y m a x 2 t m a x t m i

field inlet a 0 is calculated as eq 12 for field slope s 0 greater than about 0 0001 12 a 0 q 0 2 3600 n 2 s 0 ρ 1 1 ρ 2 where n is manning roughness coefficient the values of ρ 1 and ρ 2 for border and basin are 1 0 and 3 33 respectively and for furrow are calculated as eq 13 and eq 14 as follow 13 ρ 1 σ 1 10 3 γ 1 4 3 14 ρ 2 10 3 4 γ 2 3 σ 2 some important parameters that must be calculated in the simulation stage are intake opportunity time τ req advance time t l cut off time t co depletion time t d and infiltration z these parameters are obtained using numerical estimation procedure based on the newton raphson procedure and volume balance equation eq 4 the detail procedure of the estimation is presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 and walker 2003 in order to simplify the paper those procedures are not repeated here for calculating performance indicator in the first step it must be determined whether the irrigation practice is complete and overirrigation or underirrigation by calculating v z and z i in m station points of the field using eq 16 and eq 15 and comparing given z i in these stations with z req the irrigation status is determined 15 z i k t r t l i a f 0 t r t l i where t l i is the advance time to ith station and z i is the infiltration volume in ith station in eq 16 the total infiltrated volume v z in one furrow basin or border is found by integrating the infiltration of each station by the trapezoidal rule 16 v z l 2 m z 0 2 z 1 2 z 2 z m if irrigation is complete or overirrigation equations eq 17 eq 20 eq 21 and eq 23 are used to found performance indicators and if it is underirrigation equations eq 18 eq 19 eq 20 eq 22 and eq 23 are used the performance indicators which are used in proposed model are presented below the application efficiency is found by eq 17 for complete and overirrigation and by eq 18 for underirrigation 17 e a z r e q l q 0 t c o 18 e a z r e q x d v z i q 0 t c o where v zi is the integrated infiltration volume over the inadequately irrigated area of the field which is found by eq 16 and eq 15 and analysis of infiltration in the m selected stations x d is the distance of last adequately irrigated station to the inlet and l is the field length the water requirement efficiency for underirrigation is calculated by eq 19 and this indicator is one or 100 in percentage representation for complete and overirrigation 19 e r z r e q x d v z i z r e q l the distribution uniformity is given by eq 20 which is calculated based on a quarter of the field 20 d u 4 0 v l q v r z v d p where v lq is the average volume of infiltrated water in the least irrigated 25 of the field v dp is the volume per furrow spacing of water that percolates below the root zone and v rz is the volume per furrow spacing of irrigation water that is actually stored in the root zone washington 2012 the deep percolation ratio is given by eq 21 for complete and overirrigation and by eq 22 for underirrigation 21 d p r v z z r e q l q 0 t c o 22 d p r v z a z r e q x d q 0 t c o where v z is the total infiltrated volume and v za is the total infiltrated volume of the adequately irrigated stations the tailwater ratio is obtained by eq 23 23 t w r 100 e a d p r also in furrow irrigation with cutback and reused different equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 after calculating the performance indicators in order to check the applicability of the irrigation system parameters the total amount of required inlet flow and total required time are calculated different irrigation systems use different equations to calculate the required total time and inlet inflow rate in the first step the land division structure must be given which in the furrow model eq 24 and eq 25 are used but based on the drainage type of irrigation system such as cutback and reused other equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 and walker 2003 24 n f w f w 25 n s n f q

requirements for first and later irrigation application 2 2 optimization method due to the large space of the irrigation system design problem finding an efficient design solution requires the use of effective optimization algorithms in the proposed model the irrigation system design is modeled in the form of a multivariate multi objective and multi constraint optimization problem there are several parameters influencing the design so it is a multivariate issue there are several effective design objectives that conflict with each other so it is a multi objective issue it also controls the feasible space of the solutions of the problem with the help of several constraints so it is a multi constraint problem on the other hand the relations between input parameters and objectives and constraints are complex such as the equations provided simulation procedure which is presented in section 2 1 therefore using evolutionary multi objective algorithms can be a wise decision for the optimization module of the proposed model eiben and smith 2015 according to the procedures proposed in walker and skogerboe 1987 in order to optimally design the irrigation system the provided solution should be an appropriate response in the first irrigation and the later irrigations accordingly changes in the various parameters of agricultural field during the first and subsequent irrigations have been considered also since we want the proposed model to be usable as much as possible in the real problems of farmers two different types of modeling have been done with two different perspectives the first model takes into account the amount of labor in implementing the given irrigation design in the second one the amount of labor is less considered the first model is called labor sensitive ls and the second model is called labor insensitive lis the overhead labor considered in the modeling is related to two parts of the irrigation system the first part is the slope of the field land preparation with very precise slopes and high accuracy usually requires high cost and labor walker and skogerboe 1987 so the slope parameter is used as the input value in the ls model and the values provided for them are the typical values of this parameter in the design of irrigation systems the second part is the difference between inflow rate q 0 of the first and later irrigations the difference between the inflow rate q 0 of the first irrigation and its subsequent leads to a change in the structure of the inland irrigation network between the two irrigations which requires overhead effort in the ls model only one inflow rate is used while in the lis model two inflow rates are used in the design process the ls model is used for furrow border and basin irrigation systems and the lis model is used only for furrow irrigation systems the decision variables input parameters and constraints of the proposed model in ls mode and lis mode are given in table 1 and table 2 the range of changes selected for decision variables is large enough for a more appropriate search of the problem space also the range of changes is the same for all fields and only the maximum value of inlet discharge q 0 and q 0l is set to q t which is the system discharge this feature of the proposed model makes it easier to be used for different fields and reduces the need for a specific configuration for each field appropriate performance indicators have been introduced in the field of irrigation system design in optimization procedure some well known performance indicators are used as objectives of optimization algorithms the application efficiency e a water requirement efficiency e r distribution uniformity du deep percolation ratio dpr and tailwater ratio twr are the selected performance indicators which are used in the proposed model according to the design principles in irrigation systems e a e r and du should be maximized and dpr and twr should be minimized in the proposed model two sets of selected performance indicators are used the first for first irrigation practice and the second for subsequent irrigations so the ten objective functions are used in multi objective algorithm of all models and irrigation system of the proposed model which are application efficiency water requirement efficiency deep percolation ratio tailwater ration and distribution uniformity for first and later irrigations for optimizing in the proposed model six different mutli objective evolutionary optimization algorithms as nsga2 deb et al 2002 rnsga2 deb and

on the output quality of algorithms in general in order to achieve better results from evolutionary algorithms a suitable parameter tuning should be performed on these algorithms eiben and smith 2015 due to the random nature of evolutionary algorithms their parameter tuning is complex one method is to use an evolutionary algorithm to find the parameters of another evolutionary algorithm eiben and smith 2015 this algorithm is called metaga eiben and smith 2015 in proposed model an evolutionary algorithm is used for parameter tuning which is called metaga in metaga the fitness function which is called the utility function here along with the structure of other components of the algorithm such as representation decode and encode procedure and operators should be defined in metaga the mean best fitness mbf is used as the utility function because evolutionary algorithms are random in nature to reliably evaluate a set of parameters that is an individual of metaga related multi objective algorithm is repeated several times taking into account the proposed parameters in this individual then based on a specific weight combination of objective functions the fitness value of the best individual in each iteration is calculated from related multi objective algorithm the mbf is calculated by averaging the best fitness in several iterations b is the number of iteration of the related

include diversity of surface irrigation systems such as furrow in free draining cutback and reused model border and basin also in order to compare the results of the proposed model with other similar ones a set of data is selected that has been used as experimental data in other proposed models akbari et al 2018 saberi et al 2020 due to the large number of experimental data parameters the data is not provided here and the parameters can be accessed referring to the provided references the used parameters in the experiments are the same as the main parameters of the based data in table 3 experimental fields references and their irrigation system are provided as shown in table 3 the experimental data includes 10 furrow fields three border fields and three basin fields 3 result and discussion to evaluate and validate the proposed simulation optimization model a set of experiments has been designed and implemented on data from 16 farm lands with different characteristics the proposed model is implemented with python language and related libraries the simulation algorithm of proposed model is implemented from scratch based on the presented theories and algorithms of section 2 1 for validating the simulation part of the proposed model the given results of proposed model are compared with simulation results of two well known software sirmod walker 2003 and surdev garcia 2014 in the following the experiments and obtained results are given 3 1 results the proposed model is based on multi objective irrigation system design in multi objective methods after solving the problem a package of desirable solutions or designs is presented instead of just one solution multi objective methods based on the objectives of the problem seek the best estimate of the pareto front of the problem therefore the results of multi objective methods can be evaluated in two ways the first method is to check the accuracy of the estimated pareto front based on the pareto front of the problem different performance indicators have been introduced for the first method audet et al 2018 one of the most widely used of which is the hyper volume indicator that is because the hyper volume indicator can be calculated without the need of reference points this is considered because in most researches reference points ie the problem pareto front are not available the second method is to select one or more weight combinations of the problem objectives that are equivalent to one or more points on the pareto front and to evaluate the quality of problem solving in those specific points in this section the proposed model is evaluated based on both methods in the problem of irrigation system design each weight combination provides an irrigation plan that determines the importance and impact of each objective in proportion to the weight of that objective in the weight combination as shown in section 2 1 several performance indicators are used as objectives in the proposed model therefore weight combination is equivalent to choosing a design appropriate to the importance of performance indicators considered by the farmer in designing her farm irrigation system one of the reasons for the desirability of multi objective methods compared to single objective methods in problems that have more than one performance indicators is that they have a set of desirable solutions in the operation phase so the appropriate solution can be selected among them based on operating time decisions in this section in order to evaluate the proposed model different weight combinations have been selected which are presented in table 4 in order to show the status of performance indicators in the space of designs that can be provided for the irrigation system fig 2 is presented in this figure with the aim of displaying relationships only two performance indicators that have the most interaction with each other application efficiency and tail water ratio are drawn in the objective space of the design problem of two fields the charts in this figure are based on the estimated pareto front data by two different algorithms in two different fields as shown in the charts increasing one indicator often leads to decreasing the other and vice versa in table 5 the best results of all algorithms in ls mode for furrow fields are given in order to obtain these results four sets of weights have been selected from table 4 the results are presented in two parts the first part is the design resulting from the optimization algorithm and the second part is the intermediate parameters obtained in the simulation stage of the model in part two four most important parameters obtained from the simulation stage based on the design provided for the irrigation system are presented these parameters include the total time required for complete field irrigation and the number of field divisions across the length an example is the design presented for field 11 table 3 based on the weight set number 4 of table 4 where the field is divided into four pieces of 250 m in length and each piece contains a set of 67 furrow that takes 1509 min of the whole land irrigation with an inflow rate of 9 48 cubic meters per minute in table 6 the values of the performance indicators along with the weighted objective obtained from the application of the selected weight set for each of the designs are presented the performance indicators of proposed design of field 11 show that this field is irrigated with application efficiency of 69 water requirement efficiency of 100 tail water ratio of 17 deep percolation ratio of 14 and the distribution uniformity of 92 the best results of border and basin fields in ls mode are shown in table 7 the first part of this table is based on the parameters obtained from the design of border and basin irrigation system in the design of border and basin fields as presented in table 1 the inlet flow rate the number of pieces of field along the length and the maximum depth are used also the second part of the results which is the result of simulation based on the parameters of the first part width of border or basin and the number of borders and basins are presented along with the other time information the values of performance indicators of the presented designs are also presented in table 8 the results of the experiments of lis mode for furrow fields are presented in table 9 in lis mode two other parameters have been added to the first part of the results the design part of the irrigation system which are the inlet inflow for subsequent irrigations and the slope of the field with these two parameters a better design is possible especially for better performance for subsequent irrigations the performance indicators of the designs obtained based on lis mode which are presented in table 10 indicate an improvement in the quality of the designs as can be seen in the results the value of application efficiency for first and later irrigations in table 10 have been increased compared to table 6 and the value of deep peculation and tail water ratio have been decreased of course a change in the rate of inlet inflow for later irrigations that is applied by changing the structure of the field increases the labor besides the application of precise slopes is also accompanied by an increase in labor that is why the model is named labor insensitive in this paragraph based on the results presented in these tables the obtained designs for fields are reviewed the obtained design for field 1 in table 9 and the weight vector 3 is such that this field with a length of 200 m a width of 720 m and a water inflow rate of 6 m 3 m i n is divided into two separate sections across its length to be irrigated in first irrigation each section is divided into 5 sub sections with 100 furrows and field is fully irrigated during three days with the application efficiency of 60 the tail water ratio of 37 and the deep peculation ration of 4 in later irrigations each section of the field is divided into 2 sub sections with 300 and 180 furrows which is fully irrigated during three days with the application efficiency of 78 the tail water ratio of 16 and the deep peculation ratio of 6 according to the presented design and performance indicators the irrigation system designed for this field is practical and is desirable for the first and subsequent irrigations in the following the obtained design for field 11 with the length of 1000 m width of 100 m inflow rate water of 6 m 3 m i n and same conditions in the first and later irrigations is reviewed the design presented for this field in table 9 and the weight vector 3 is such that this field is divided into 10 separate sections with 67 furrows across its length this field is fully irrigated during about 1 5 days with the application efficiency of 72 the tail water ratio of 13 and the deep peculation ration of 16 the obtained design of these two fields shows that the proposed model based on field conditions proposes a practical and appropriate irrigation system in general presented designs for fields provide the possibility of complete irrigation at the appropriate time which is on average between two and three days by properly dividing the fields across length and also dividing each section into a desirable number of subsections also the obtained performance indicators are desirable on average as the application efficiency is mostly above 60 and tail water ratio is below 20 therefore it can be concluded that the proposed model offers practical and theoretical optimal designs as mentioned six evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms have been used at the simulation optimization model in order to evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms three performance indicators which are number of function evaluations nfe hyper volume hv and weighted objective obj are used since evolutionary algorithms are kind of trial and error method eiben and smith 2015 reducing the number of calculations of their evaluation function indicates better performance of the algorithm which is presented in the form of nfe in the table 11 the value of hyper volume also indicates the accuracy of estimation of the pareto front which should be maximized value obj also calculates the value of the weighted objective functions based on the weight selected from table 4 in table 11 six used algorithms are compared through the introduced indicators separately based on the obtained results from furrow border and basin fields which are also ranked based on the results of this comparison accordingly moea algorithm always shows the best results in order to show the convergence rate of the algorithms graphs of the changes of hyper volume for nfe are presented in fig 3 this figure shows the rate of change of the hyper volume for the three fields 11 13 and 16 which are optimized using nsga2 nsga3 and rnsga3 algorithms as can be seen in the image the value of the hyper volume increases with the progress of the generation of the algorithms and at the termination criterion of the algorithms it becomes somewhat linear this image shows the desirable convergence of the algorithms one of the challenges of implementing evolutionary algorithms is to properly tune the their parameters these algorithms usually have many effective parameters that can be significantly improved by performing an appropriate parameter tuning eiben and smith 2015 as described in section 2 3 an evolutionary algorithm as metaga is used to tune the parameters of multi objective optimization algorithms of course metaga itself has parameters in this paper s experiments metaga is performed with the population size of 40 the maximum number of generations of 15 and the elitism retention ratio of 10 the metaga results for rnsga2 on field 11 are presented in table 12 as can be seen the value of mbf which should be minimized according to the design of metaga decreases over time and so more suitable parameters for the running of the rnsga2 will be obtained 3 2 validation in order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method a set of comparisons is performed in experiments comparisons are made in two ways first in order to check the accuracy of the implemented simulation procedure the design obtained by the proposed model is simulated using two well known irrigation system software sirmod and surdev the results of the simulation stage of the proposed model and the results of the simulation by the selected software for 8 fields are presented in table 13 in order to match the results with the output structure of the software the results of the proposed model are expressed in percentage in this table as the results show the accuracy of the implemented simulation is desirable and the slight difference between the results can be due to the rounding numbers in some table cells the value was not provided due to the lack of value provided by the related software also in fig 4 and fig 5 two important graphs obtained by simulation using sirmod software are presented which are runoff hydrograph and surface and subsurface flow profile the presented charts in fig 4 and fig 5 also visually show the quality of design which is provided by the proposed model in order to asses the results of the proposed model they are compared with the results of two methods in table 14 in common fields and based on similar performance indicators the results are obtained from the papers proposing these methods in order to match the output structure of those methods the results of the proposed model are expressed in percentage in this table the table shows the best results of each indicator and each field in bold the proposed model has yielded better results than the edosim model akbari et al 2018 in most fields and for most indicators but has provided better results than multi objective framework model saberi et al 2020 in some indicators 4 conclusion in this paper a simulation optimization model for designing an theoretical optimal surface irrigation system is presented in the simulation stage of the model using the volume balance and kostiakov lewis equations the value of some well known performance indicators in evaluating irrigation system based on design parameters of the irrigation system such as inlet inflow rate length of the field width of the furrow border or basin and parabolic cross sectional area parameters of the flow at inlet are calculated six multi objective evolutionary optimization algorithms are used in optimization stage of the model in order to extract practical designs a set of constraints is considered during optimization so that the obtained optimal design is feasible based on the requirements of the field also the proposed model solves the problem in two cases labor sensitive and labor insensitive the difference between these is the amount of effort required to implement the proposed irrigation system in the proposed model an irrigation system is designed that is suitable for the first and subsequent irrigations at the same time while in most of the proposed models such as edosim akbari et al 2018 and multi objective model saberi et al 2020 which are selected as the basic papers of this research the design is optimized based only on one irrigation program in the proposed model two important parameters of the irrigation system the amount of inflow rate of water to the field and the total time required for the complete irrigation are considered in the form of the problem constraints unlike most previous works also by considering the effective factors in increasing the labor to implement the design given by the proposed model it is possible to provide a design commensurate with the amount of labor that can be achieved by the farmer due to these features that are included in the proposed model the obtained design is more practical the proposed model was evaluated during a series of experiments it was found that the simulation stage of the model has the same performance as the two valid simulation software of irrigation systems also the results of the experiments were compared with the results of the two other models and it was found that the proposed model has more favorable results or close to the two other models of course it is also important to note that the proposed model provides the optimal design solely on the basis of theoretical equations and procedures so the more the input parameters match the actual parameters of the field the more real results are obtained however field parameters are dynamic and heterogeneous which increases the design error declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a

10168,agriculture has always been considered as an important source of food supply and the optimal use of its resources specially water for productive agriculture has been given especial attention in this paper a simulation optimization model based on the volume balance model for designing an efficient and practical irrigation system is presented the proposed model uses the multi objective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing design parameters of different irrigation systems furrow border and basin using appropriate constraints and applying performance indicators in first and subsequent irrigations practical and theoretical optimal designs are obtained the proposed model achieves a more practical design using three novel approaches first simultaneously considering the performance indicators of the first and subsequent irrigations second using both total time required for irrigation and inflow rate of the field third considering the labor required to implement the obtained design in this study the proposed model was evaluated performing several experiments on 16 fields to get better results an evolutionary method called metaga is used to properly tune the parameters of the simulation optimization model results of the simulation stage of the proposed model were compared with results of two simulation software in the irrigation systems sirmod and surdev and the simulation stage was validated results of the proposed model were evaluated using the results of two other models edosim and multi objective in 16 fields based on 5 performance indicators the results of this study reveal that the proposed model in most fields and indicators achieves better results and the results are close in the others keywords surface irrigation system design precision

of the world is agriculture and the demand for shared agricultural resources is ever increasing by the population growth advancement of civilization increasing of agricultural and industrial productivity and other interactual systems choudhari and anand raj 2010 the transition from traditional to modern agriculture is of special attention modern agriculture and the use of new technologies and knowledge in order to increase agricultural productivity has been considered by researchers and participants in the field of agriculture water as one of the most important and effective resources in agriculture needs to be paid special attention since transition from traditional farming methods and direct use of new technologies requires a lot of time and money one of the effective solutions is to use new technologies to help improve the processes and decisions of traditional methods as an empowering utility one of the resources that can have a significant impact on agricultural productivity if it is managed and used carefully is water so the optimal management and design of the irrigation system is a good choice to realize modern agriculture the precision irrigation which use modern technologies such as iot cloud platforms and variety of many sensors for monitoring and controlling advance time of irrigation has been considered in recent years abioye et al 2020 the gravity flow in surface irrigation system is mostly used in agricultural irrigation systems the surface irrigation systems can be broadly classified as basin irrigation border irrigation furrow irrigation and uncontrolled flooding in the basin irrigation precision land leveling is very important to achieve high uniformity and efficiency in the border irrigation the precision of the field topography is critical but the extended lengths permit better leveling using the farm machinery the furrow irrigation provides better on farm water management flexibility under many surface irrigation conditions each surface irrigation system has unique advantages and disadvantages depending on factors which are listed here 1 initial cost 2 size and shape of fields 3 soil characteristics 4 nature and availability of the water supply 5 climate 6 cropping patterns 7 social preferences and structures 8 historical experiences and 9 influences external to the surface irrigation system walker 1989 the principle purpose of irrigating croplands is to replenish the root zone reservoir frequently enough to avoid crop stress but uniformly and efficiently enough to conserve energy water nutrients and labor in the design practice there is the assumption that uniformity and efficiency can be predicted from such parameters as discharge application time infiltration characteristics field slope and length and depth required to refill the root zone the data required for surface irrigation design is the inflow rate and duration the topography of land surface such as slope and surface drainage points the physical and chemical characteristics such as infiltration characteristics and the economic condition in the area as well as the availability of labor walker and skogerboe 1987 questions that are common to all irrigation systems are when to irrigate how much to apply and can the efficiency be improved walker 1989 the method frequency and duration of irrigations have significant effects on crop yield and farm productivity irrigation systems are often designed to maximize efficiencies and minimize labor and capital requirements walker 1989 in walker and skogerboe 1987 one of the basic methods for designing a surface irrigation system is presented where a search is performed from q min to q max for discharge and each selected value is simulated for calculating the efficiency the simulation procedure based on volume balance equation zero inertia kinematic and so on is implemented as a software and this design procedure can be performed using these software programs but the number of effective parameters in the design and simulation are large so search space of the design is relatively large also many criteria must be checked for each proposed design which are satisfying practical proposed design so for efficiently solving this design problem a constrained optimization problem cop is defined the meta heuristic methods are appropriate tools for solving the problems where the relationship between inputs and objectives is complex and multiple eiben and smith 2015 in akbari et al 2018 a simulation optimization model is proposed as edosim for design and evaluation of surface irrigation system for border basin and furrow method of irrigation in this model a volume balance equation is used for simulating and twenty meta heuristic algorithm are used for optimizing in the edosim seven performance indicators are used for optimizing which are weighted sum as a single objective optimization criterion also in the edosim some constraints are used in optimization procedure two main drawbacks of the edosim are the first simulate and design is performed only for one application in each irrigation practice and first and subsequent irrigations are not considered in the design simultaneously second constraints for required total inflow and total time of irrigation are not taken into account based on available resource of field therefore the design provided by the model may not be consistent with available resources in saberi et al 2020 a simulation optimization framework is proposed for furrow surface irrigation design in this paper flow rate furrow length and cut off time are given as decision variable and four performance indicator are used as multi objective optimization criteria also amalgam algorithm is used as multi objective optimization algorithm the software surdev is used for simulation and performance indicator calculation a few important constraints such as the total inflow rate and the total time required are not used in this paper some software programs are developed for simulating the surface irrigation system such as winsrfr bautista et al 2009b sirmod walker 2003 and surdev garcia 2014 also some studies are performed for analyzing these simulator software programs in ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 the accuracy of three mathematical models in the sirmod package for estimating advance and recession time are analyzed in some papers the simulation software programs are used to design and validate the selected parameters of surface irrigation system in salahou et al 2018 the effect of cut off time and bottom slope of field are analyzed using winsrfr for border irrigation field of winter wheat in china in bautista et al 2009a basin irrigation system is analyzed by winsrfr software in fadul et al 2020 winsrfr is used for verifying proposed design in large field dimensions which has made a significant improvement in efficiency adequacy and uniformity in mazarei et al 2020 the winsrfr is used for optimizing the inflow rate slope and field length of blocked end furrow irrigation system also in some researches only the most effective irrigation parameters are used directly in the design and other parameters are considered indirectly or as inputs with known values these studies focus only on a small and effective part of the parameters of the irrigation system smith et al 2018 and valipour and montazar 2012 are examples of these researches in smith et al 2018 the relationship between flow rate time of cut off and application efficiency as performance indicator is provided for furrow field in this paper sisco model gillies and smith 2015 is used as a simulation model the main related parameter which is analyzed is the advance time in valipour and montazar 2012 the mixed of genetic algorithm and winsrfr is used for designing and optimizing of furrow irrigation since these studies focus only on a small part of the parameters in the irrigation system the proposed model has less flexibility to design an optimal irrigation system while if more effective parameters were used in modeling the chances of designing a more optimal irrigation system would increase in the proposed model more effective parameters are used to design a better irrigation system in order to investigate the impact and desirability of evolutionary optimization algorithms on water engineering issues several studies have been presented in which evolutionary optimization algorithms are used to optimize water engineering issues in fanuel et al 2018 40 paper about agricultural water management problem solving using multi objective optimization algorithm is analyzed in this paper nsgaii mode and ga algorithms are examined in various fields including water allocation crop planning in water scarce areas and irrigation planning in this paper it is shown that the multi objective algorithm in water management problem can provide desirable results in khazaipoul et al 2019 a simulation optimization model is presented which uses swat and weap as simulation model and non dominated sorting differential evolution nsde as multi objective problem solver for solving the water allocation problem with conflicted objectives the result of this paper shows that the multi objective algorithm provides good results for water management problems in yassin et al 2016 a model for infiltrated water volume of furrow irrigation based on the gen expression algorithm is shown in this paper inflow rate q 0 furrow length advance time opportunity time and cross sectional area are used as input and the infiltration volume is the output of the model also in this paper 159 data points are used for training and testing the learning model based on the findings of this paper the use of evolutionary algorithms to learn specific patterns related to water engineering is appropriate in some papers the goal is to provide the best water allocation model based on one or more objective functions in ikudayisi et al 2018 a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used for optimizing water allocation based on crop net benefit and water resource usage in lalehzari et al 2016 a biobjective optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithm for groundwater allocation according to the reviewed research the use of evolutionary multi objective algorithms in optimization issues related to water engineering is a good choice and provides acceptable results accordingly in the proposed model evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms are used the simulation optimization models are convenient solutions to provide optimal design of surface irrigation systems the effective parameters in this design are numerous so problem spaces are also very large with nonlinear relationships on the other hand there are several performance indicators that are in conflict with each other in this design issue there are also a number of constraints that must be met in the design matter so in this design the issue of constrained optimization problem cop is raised the evolutionary algorithms are convenient tools for solving cop eiben and smith 2015 since this problem is inherently multi objective instead of turning it into a single objective problem that simply solves the problem in one state of objectives it is better to provide a set of appropriate solutions for different weight states of objectives then the farmer will select the appropriate design from the set of design solution based on his or her decision and priorities in this paper based on the design procedures presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 performance indicators for the first irrigation and subsequent irrigations are considered simultaneously since labor is considered as an effective resource in irrigation efficiency labor impact modeling is also considered in the simulation optimization proposed model in order to make the design presented by the model more applicable additional constraints are also included in the optimization process the details of the proposed model and its test results are presented below 2 materials and methods the simulation optimization proposed model designs a surface irrigation system for furrow border and basin systems simulation stage of the model uses the equations and procedure in walker and skogerboe 1987 optimization stage of the model uses the multi objective evolutionary algorithm the overview of the proposed model is shown in fig 1 as shown the main framework of the proposed model is based on multi objective evolutionary optimization algorithms the details of which are presented in the following of this section the simulation part of the proposed model is also included as an evaluation component fitness evaluation in the evolutionary algorithm cycle the details of which are also provided below the sequence of execution of the components of the proposed model is marked with numbers in order the parameters of the optimization algorithm is tuned using metaga which is a kind of evolutionary algorithm also sirmod and surdev which are two well known irrigation simulator software are used for validating the model and implementation of algorithms more details of the proposed model are provided below 2 1 simulation procedure the simulation procedure which is used in the proposed model is based on the volume balance equation in this simulation model the kostiakov lewis characteristics such as a k and f 0 are known and advance time rescission time the depletion time and infiltration volume are unknown and are calculated based on numerical equations and procedures so the simulation stage of the model receives the mechanical chemical and geometrical characteristics of the field and designs irrigation system for the field and then calculates the intermediate parameters and finally the performance indicators by the following equations the volume balance equation base model is as lewis and milne 1938 1 0 t q t d t 0 x a x t d x 0 x z x t d x where q t is inlet discharge a x t is the cross sectional area of the surface and z x t is the cross sectional area of subsurface flow which variate with distance x and time t the volume balance equation is rewritten based on two assumptions first the power function which describes the trajectory of the advance of the water front field 2 x p t a x r where x is the distance the front has advance in time t a and r and p are empirical fitting parameters second the infiltration equation that has the modified kostiakov lewis characteristic form as 3 z k τ a f 0 τ where z is infiltrated volume per unit length after an infiltration elapsed time since the irrigation start τ k a and f 0 are kostiakov lewis parameters so the volume balance equation which is written utilizing eq 3 and eq 2 is 4 q 0 t σ y a 0 x σ z k t a x f 0 t x 1 r where q 0 is inlet discharge a 0 is cross sectional area of flow at the inlet σ y is the surface storage shape factor which is typically a constant between 0 7 and 0 8 and in this model is equal to 0 77 σ z is subsurface shape factor and based on numerical power advance approach defined as eq 5 5 σ z a r 1 a 1 1 r 1 a the cross sectional area of the furrow basin and border is calculated based on the geometrical design parameters and equations which are presented in walker 2003 based on the results which are provided in elliott et al 1983 wetted perimeter and cross sectional area can be expressed as simple power functions of depth which are presented in eq 6 and eq 7 6

fitting parameters the values of γ 1 γ 2 σ 1 and σ 2 for border and basin are 1 0 0 0 1 0 and 1 0 respectively these values for furrow assuming that the cross sectional area of the furrows is a parabolic geometric shape with a flat bottom with top width t max middle width t mid bottom width base and depth y max parameters can be estimated by equations eq 8 eq 9 eq 10 eq 11 8 σ 1 y m a x 2 b

the simulation stage are intake opportunity time τ req advance time t l cut off time t co depletion time t d and infiltration z these parameters are obtained using numerical estimation procedure based on the newton raphson procedure and volume balance equation eq 4 the detail procedure of the estimation is presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 and walker 2003 in order to simplify the paper those procedures are not repeated here for calculating performance indicator in the first step it must be determined whether the irrigation practice is complete and overirrigation or underirrigation by calculating v z and z i in m station points of the field using eq 16 and eq 15 and comparing given z i in these stations with z req the irrigation status is determined 15 z i k t r t l i a f 0 t r t l i where t l i is the advance time to ith station and z i is the infiltration volume in ith station in eq 16 the total infiltrated volume v z in one furrow basin or border is found by integrating the infiltration of each station by the trapezoidal rule 16 v z l 2 m z 0 2 z 1 2 z 2 z m if irrigation is complete or overirrigation equations eq 17 eq 20 eq 21 and eq 23 are used to found performance

z r e q l q 0 t c o 22 d p r v z a z r e q x d q 0 t c o where v z is the total infiltrated volume and v za is the total infiltrated volume of the adequately irrigated stations the tailwater ratio is obtained by eq 23 23 t w r 100 e a d p r also in furrow irrigation with cutback and reused different equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 after calculating the performance indicators in order to check the applicability of the irrigation system parameters the total amount of required inlet flow and total required time are calculated different irrigation systems use different equations to calculate the required total time and inlet inflow rate in the first step the land division structure must be given which in the furrow model eq 24 and eq 25 are used but based on the drainage type of irrigation system such as cutback and reused other equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 and walker 2003 24 n f w f w 25 n s n f q

effective optimization algorithms in the proposed model the irrigation system design is modeled in the form of a multivariate multi objective and multi constraint optimization problem there are several parameters influencing the design so it is a multivariate issue there are several effective design objectives that conflict with each other so it is a multi objective issue it also controls the feasible space of the solutions of the problem with the help of several constraints so it is a multi constraint problem on the other hand the relations between input parameters and objectives and constraints are complex such as the equations provided simulation procedure which is presented in section 2 1 therefore using evolutionary multi objective algorithms can be a wise decision for the optimization module of the proposed model eiben and smith 2015 according to the procedures proposed in walker and skogerboe 1987 in order to optimally design the irrigation system the provided solution should be an appropriate response in the first irrigation and the later irrigations accordingly changes in the various parameters of agricultural field during the first and subsequent irrigations have been considered also since we want the proposed model to be usable as much as possible in the real problems of farmers two different types of modeling have been done with two different perspectives the first model takes into account the amount of labor in implementing the given irrigation design in the second one the amount of labor is less considered the first model is called labor sensitive ls and the second model is called labor insensitive lis the overhead labor considered in the modeling is related to two parts of the irrigation system the first part is the slope of the field land preparation with very precise slopes and high accuracy usually requires high cost and labor walker and skogerboe 1987 so the slope parameter is used as the input value in the ls model and the values provided for them are the typical values of this parameter in the design of irrigation systems the second part is the difference between inflow rate q 0 of the first and later irrigations the difference between the inflow rate q 0 of the first irrigation and its subsequent leads to a change in the structure of the inland irrigation network between the two irrigations which requires overhead effort in the ls model only one inflow rate is used while in the lis model two inflow rates are used in the design process the ls model is used for furrow border and basin irrigation systems and the lis model is used only for furrow irrigation systems the decision variables input parameters and constraints of the proposed model in ls mode and lis mode are given in table 1 and table 2 the range of changes selected for decision variables is large enough for a more appropriate search of the problem space also the range of changes is the same for all fields and only the maximum value of inlet discharge q 0 and q 0l is set to q t which is the system discharge this feature of the proposed model makes it easier to be used for different fields and reduces the need for a specific configuration for each field appropriate performance indicators have been introduced in the field of irrigation system design in optimization procedure some well known performance indicators are used as objectives of optimization algorithms the application efficiency e a water requirement efficiency e r distribution uniformity du deep percolation ratio dpr and tailwater ratio twr are the selected performance indicators which are used in the proposed model according to the design principles in irrigation systems e a e r and du should be maximized and dpr and twr should be minimized in the proposed model two sets of selected performance indicators are used the first for first irrigation practice and the second for subsequent irrigations so the ten objective functions are used in multi objective algorithm of all models and irrigation system of the proposed model which are application efficiency water requirement efficiency deep percolation ratio tailwater ration and distribution uniformity for first and later irrigations for optimizing in the proposed model six different mutli objective evolutionary optimization algorithms as nsga2 deb et al 2002 rnsga2 deb and

of generations stage 8 in fig 1 2 3 parameter tuning the selected multi objective optimization algorithms have effective parameters determining the value of these parameters has a significant effect on the output quality of algorithms in general in order to achieve better results from evolutionary algorithms a suitable parameter tuning should be performed on these algorithms eiben and smith 2015 due to the random nature of evolutionary algorithms their parameter tuning is complex one method is to use an evolutionary algorithm to find the parameters of another evolutionary algorithm eiben and smith 2015 this algorithm is called metaga eiben and smith 2015 in proposed model an evolutionary algorithm is used for parameter tuning which is called metaga in metaga the fitness function which is called the utility function here along with the structure of other components of the algorithm such as representation decode and encode procedure and operators should be defined in metaga the mean best fitness mbf is used as the utility function because evolutionary algorithms are random in nature to reliably evaluate a set of parameters that is an individual of metaga related multi objective algorithm is repeated several times taking into account the proposed parameters in this individual then based on a specific weight combination of objective functions the fitness value of the best individual in each iteration is calculated from related multi objective algorithm the mbf is calculated by averaging the best fitness in several iterations b is the number of iteration of the related

include diversity of surface irrigation systems such as furrow in free draining cutback and reused model border and basin also in order to compare the results of the proposed model with other similar ones a set of data is selected that has been used as experimental data in other proposed models akbari et al 2018 saberi et al 2020 due to the large number of experimental data parameters the data is not provided here and the parameters can be accessed referring to the provided references the used parameters in the experiments are the same as the main parameters of the based data in table 3 experimental fields references and their irrigation system are provided as shown in table 3 the experimental data includes 10 furrow fields three border fields and three basin fields 3 result and discussion to evaluate and validate the proposed simulation optimization model a set of experiments has been designed and implemented on data from 16 farm lands with different characteristics the proposed model is implemented with python language and related libraries the simulation algorithm of proposed model is implemented from scratch based on the presented theories and algorithms of section 2 1 for validating the simulation part of the proposed model the given results of proposed model are compared with simulation results of two well known software sirmod walker 2003 and surdev garcia 2014 in the following the experiments and obtained results are given 3 1 results the proposed model is based on multi objective irrigation system design in multi objective methods after solving the problem a package of desirable solutions or designs is presented instead of just one solution multi objective methods based on the objectives of the problem seek the best estimate of the pareto front of the problem therefore the results of multi objective methods can be evaluated in two ways the first method is to check the accuracy of the estimated pareto front based on the pareto front of the problem different performance indicators have been introduced for the first method audet et al 2018 one of the most widely used of which is the hyper volume indicator that is because the hyper volume indicator can be calculated without the need of reference points this is considered because in most researches reference points ie the problem pareto front are not available the second method is to select one or more weight combinations of the problem objectives that are equivalent to one or more points on the pareto front and to evaluate the quality of problem solving in those specific points in this section the proposed model is evaluated based on both methods in the problem of irrigation system design each weight combination provides an irrigation plan that determines the importance and impact of each objective in proportion to the weight of that objective in the weight combination as shown in section 2 1 several performance indicators are used as objectives in the proposed model therefore weight combination is equivalent to choosing a design appropriate to the importance of performance indicators considered by the farmer in designing her farm irrigation system one of the reasons for the desirability of multi objective methods compared to single objective methods in problems that have more than one performance indicators is that they have a set of desirable solutions in the operation phase so the appropriate solution can be selected among them based on operating time decisions in this section in order to evaluate the proposed model different weight combinations have been selected which are presented in table 4 in order to show the status of performance indicators in the space of designs that can be provided for the irrigation system fig 2 is presented in this figure with the aim of displaying relationships only two performance indicators that have the most interaction with each other application efficiency and tail water ratio are drawn in the objective space of the design problem of two fields the charts in this figure are based on the estimated pareto front data by two different algorithms in two different fields as shown in the charts increasing one indicator often leads to decreasing the other and vice versa in table 5 the best results of all algorithms in ls mode for furrow fields are given in order to obtain these results four sets of weights have been selected from table 4 the results are presented in two parts the first part is the design resulting from the optimization algorithm and the second part is the intermediate parameters obtained in the simulation stage of the model in part two four most important parameters obtained from the simulation stage based on the design provided for the irrigation system are presented these parameters include the total time required for complete field irrigation and the number of field divisions across the length an example is the design presented for field 11 table 3 based on the weight set number 4 of table 4 where the field is divided into four pieces of 250 m in length and each piece contains a set of 67 furrow that takes 1509 min of the whole land irrigation with an inflow rate of 9 48 cubic meters per minute in table 6 the values of the performance indicators along with the weighted objective obtained from the application of the selected weight set for each of the designs are presented the performance indicators of proposed design of field 11 show that this field is irrigated with application efficiency of 69 water requirement efficiency of 100 tail water ratio of 17 deep percolation ratio of 14 and the distribution uniformity of 92 the best results of border and basin fields in ls mode are shown in table 7 the first part of this table is based on the parameters obtained from the design of border and basin irrigation system in the design of border and basin fields as presented in table 1 the inlet flow rate the number of pieces of field along the length and the maximum depth are used also the second part of the results which is the result of simulation based on the parameters of the first part width of border or basin and the number of borders and basins are presented along with the other time information the values of performance indicators of the presented designs are also presented in table 8 the results of the experiments of lis mode for furrow fields are presented in table 9 in lis mode two other parameters have been added to the first part of the results the design part of the irrigation system which are the inlet inflow for subsequent irrigations and the slope of the field with these two parameters a better design is possible especially for better performance for subsequent irrigations the performance indicators of the designs obtained based on lis mode which are presented in table 10 indicate an improvement in the quality of the designs as can be seen in the results the value of application efficiency for first and later irrigations in table 10 have been increased compared to table 6 and the value of deep peculation and tail water ratio have been decreased of course a change in the rate of inlet inflow for later irrigations that is applied by changing the structure of the field increases the labor besides the application of precise slopes is also accompanied by an increase in labor that is why the model is named labor insensitive in this paragraph based on the results presented in these tables the obtained designs for fields are reviewed the obtained design for field 1 in table 9 and the weight vector 3 is such that this field with a length of 200 m a width of 720 m and a water inflow rate of 6 m 3 m i n is divided into two separate sections across its length to be irrigated in first irrigation each section is divided into 5 sub sections with 100 furrows and field is fully irrigated during three days with the application efficiency of 60 the tail water ratio of 37 and the deep peculation ration of 4 in later irrigations each section of the field is divided into 2 sub sections with 300 and 180 furrows which is fully irrigated during three days with the application efficiency of 78 the tail water ratio of 16 and the deep peculation ratio of 6 according to the presented design and performance indicators the irrigation system designed for this field is practical and is desirable for the first and subsequent irrigations in the following the obtained design for field 11 with the length of 1000 m width of 100 m inflow rate water of 6 m 3 m i n and same conditions in the first and later irrigations is reviewed the design presented for this field in table 9 and the weight vector 3 is such that this field is divided into 10 separate sections with 67 furrows across its length this field is fully irrigated during about 1 5 days with the application efficiency of 72 the tail water ratio of 13 and the deep peculation ration of 16 the obtained design of these two fields shows that the proposed model based on field conditions proposes a practical and appropriate irrigation system in general presented designs for fields provide the possibility of complete irrigation at the appropriate time which is on average between two and three days by properly dividing the fields across length and also dividing each section into a desirable number of subsections also the obtained performance indicators are desirable on average as the application efficiency is mostly above 60 and tail water ratio is below 20 therefore it can be concluded that the proposed model offers practical and theoretical optimal designs as mentioned six evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms have been used at the simulation optimization model in order to evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms three performance indicators which are number of function evaluations nfe hyper volume hv and weighted objective obj are used since evolutionary algorithms are kind of trial and error method eiben and smith 2015 reducing the number of calculations of their evaluation function indicates better performance of the algorithm which is presented in the form of nfe in the table 11 the value of hyper volume also indicates the accuracy of estimation of the pareto front which should be maximized value obj also calculates the value of the weighted objective functions based on the weight selected from table 4 in table 11 six used algorithms are compared through the introduced indicators separately based on the obtained results from furrow border and basin fields which are also ranked based on the results of this comparison accordingly moea algorithm always shows the best results in order to show the convergence rate of the algorithms graphs of the changes of hyper volume for nfe are presented in fig 3 this figure shows the rate of change of the hyper volume for the three fields 11 13 and 16 which are optimized using nsga2 nsga3 and rnsga3 algorithms as can be seen in the image the value of the hyper volume increases with the progress of the generation of the algorithms and at the termination criterion of the algorithms it becomes somewhat linear this image shows the desirable convergence of the algorithms one of the challenges of implementing evolutionary algorithms is to properly tune the their parameters these algorithms usually have many effective parameters that can be significantly improved by performing an appropriate parameter tuning eiben and smith 2015 as described in section 2 3 an evolutionary algorithm as metaga is used to tune the parameters of multi objective optimization algorithms of course metaga itself has parameters in this paper s experiments metaga is performed with the population size of 40 the maximum number of generations of 15 and the elitism retention ratio of 10 the metaga results for rnsga2 on field 11 are presented in table 12 as can be seen the value of mbf which should be minimized according to the design of metaga decreases over time and so more suitable parameters for the running of the rnsga2 will be obtained 3 2 validation in order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method a set of comparisons is performed in experiments comparisons are made in two ways first in order to check the accuracy of the implemented simulation procedure the design obtained by the proposed model is simulated using two well known irrigation system software sirmod and surdev the results of the simulation stage of the proposed model and the results of the simulation by the selected software for 8 fields are presented in table 13 in order to match the results with the output structure of the software the results of the proposed model are expressed in percentage in this table as the results show the accuracy of the implemented simulation is desirable and the slight difference between the results can be due to the rounding numbers in some table cells the value was not provided due to the lack of value provided by the related software also in fig 4 and fig 5 two important graphs obtained by simulation using sirmod software are presented which are runoff hydrograph and surface and subsurface flow profile the presented charts in fig 4 and fig 5 also visually show the quality of design which is provided by the proposed model in order to asses the results of the proposed model they are compared with the results of two methods in table 14 in common fields and based on similar performance indicators the results are obtained from the papers proposing these methods in order to match the output structure of those methods the results of the proposed model are expressed in percentage in this table the table shows the best results of each indicator and each field in bold the proposed model has yielded better results than the edosim model akbari et al 2018 in most fields and for most indicators but has provided better results than multi objective framework model saberi et al 2020 in some indicators 4 conclusion in this paper a simulation optimization model for designing an theoretical optimal surface irrigation system is presented in the simulation stage of the model using the volume balance and kostiakov lewis equations the value of some well known performance indicators in evaluating irrigation system based on design parameters of the irrigation system such as inlet inflow rate length of the field width of the furrow border or basin and parabolic cross sectional area parameters of the flow at inlet are calculated six multi objective evolutionary optimization algorithms are used in optimization stage of the model in order to extract practical designs a set of constraints is considered during optimization so that the obtained optimal design is feasible based on the requirements of the field also the proposed model solves the problem in two cases labor sensitive and labor insensitive the difference between these is the amount of effort required to implement the proposed irrigation system in the proposed model an irrigation system is designed that is suitable for the first and subsequent irrigations at the same time while in most of the proposed models such as edosim akbari et al 2018 and multi objective model saberi et al 2020 which are selected as the basic papers of this research the design is optimized based only on one irrigation program in the proposed model two important parameters of the irrigation system the amount of inflow rate of water to the field and the total time required for the complete irrigation are considered in the form of the problem constraints unlike most previous works also by considering the effective factors in increasing the labor to implement the design given by the proposed model it is possible to provide a design commensurate with the amount of labor that can be achieved by the farmer due to these features that are included in the proposed model the obtained design is more practical the proposed model was evaluated during a series of experiments it was found that the simulation stage of the model has the same performance as the two valid simulation software of irrigation systems also the results of the experiments were compared with the results of the two other models and it was found that the proposed model has more favorable results or close to the two other models of course it is also important to note that the proposed model provides the optimal design solely on the basis of theoretical equations and procedures so the more the input parameters match the actual parameters of the field the more real results are obtained however field parameters are dynamic and heterogeneous which increases the design error declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a

conservation and environmental sustainability here we conducted a two year field experiment to investigate annual greenhouse gas ghg emission yield water use efficiency wue global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi from 2016 to 2018 in a typical wheat maize cropping system in the north china plain two tillage methods t1 rotary tillage t2 subsoiling and four irrigation schedules w1 pre planting irrigation w2 pre planting jointing irrigation w3 pre planting anthesis irrigation w4 pre planting jointing anthesis irrigation were used for winter wheat and conventional practices were adopted for summer maize in the winter wheat summer maize season the soil acted as a net sink for ch4 but as a source for co2 and n2o in all treatments and co2 accounted for the highest proportion of the gwp the inappropriate irrigation period in the w3 treatment caused greater ghg release and reduced crop yield whereas the excessive irrigation in the w4 treatment led to low water productivity although the use of irrigation water increased annual ghg emissions an appropriate irrigation schedule could significantly mitigate the ghgi compared with the w3 and w4 treatments the w2 treatment increased yield by an average of 7 56 10 58 and 2 06 2 68 improved wue by 9 95 17 83 and 11 29 22 84 reduced gwp by 3 70 5 10 and 0 65 2 25 and decreased ghgi by 10 66 14 26 and 3 05 4 86 respectively the t2 treatment resulted in high ghg emissions and was accompanied by low yield and water productivity relative to the t2 treatment the annual yield and wue in the t1 treatment increased by an average of 4 41 15 15 and 8 12 12 76 and the annual gwp and ghgi decreased by 3 97 4 62 and 8 80 16 93 therefore rotary tillage combined with supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage can mitigate ghg emissions and improve yield and water productivity making it an environmentally friendly agricultural practice keywords wheat maize cropping systems tillage irrigation greenhouse gas yield water saving 1 introduction global warming and other environmental concerns caused by high greenhouse gas ghg emissions such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o have aroused widespread attention across the globe stocker et al 2013 as an important source of ghg increased agricultural input has released substantial ghg into the atmosphere accounting for about 10 12 of global anthropogenic emissions ipcc 2014 meeting global food demand while reducing ghg emissions is an unprecedented challenge to extensive agriculture the formation of ghg in agricultural systems is frequently a complex process that is influenced by management measures soil texture and climate conditions chen et al 2020 developing cleaner agricultural operations associated with reduced ghg emissions has become an urgent task as soil texture and climate conditions are largely outside human control the optimization of agricultural practices such as irrigation scheduling and tillage may be an effective option for maintaining environmental sustainability and improving crop production the north china plain ncp is one of the most important agricultural regions in china and accounts for about 50 and 33 of total winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l production liang et al 2011 it is irrigated only once after sowing summer maize in the ncp whereas three to five applications of heavy irrigation are typically used to meet the water demand of winter wheat sun et al 2011 over exploitation of groundwater has caused the ncp to experience severe water shortage zhang et al 2015 and more than 70 of agricultural water is used to irrigate winter wheat li et al 2005 because of the impact of water management on crop growth and ghg emissions excessive irrigation promotes denitrification by soil microorganisms and increases active methanogens which emit large amounts of n2o and ch4 accompanied by co2 emissions d acunha and johnson 2019 linquist et al 2012 zou et al 2005 however irrigation during the critical growth period promotes deep root growth which improves the absorption and utilization of water stored in deep soil layers deng et al 2006 xu et al 2018 investigated the effects of seven irrigation schedules on winter wheat yield and water use efficiency they reported that supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage was essential for meeting the crop s water requirement after testing three irrigation strategies cheng et al 2020 found that intermittent irrigation after midseason drainage mitigated ghg emissions and maintained high rice yields therefore determining an appropriate irrigation schedule is important for conserving water maintaining high crop production and mitigating ghg emissions as another major factor that affects crop yields and ghg emissions soil tillage leads to the decomposition of soil organic matter and changes the availability of soil organic carbon and nitrogen by disturbing the soil structure and microbial community bossio et al 1999 kool et al 2011 because each tillage method has a different effect on soil physical chemical and biological properties and crop performance selection of an appropriate tillage method is important for mitigating ghg emissions and improving crop production studies have shown that conventional tillage has disadvantages for soil fertility crop productivity and ghg emissions waglea et al 2018 wang et al 2020a reduced tillage e g rotary tillage and subsoiling an important form of conservation tillage has been gradually developed in recent years however various outcomes have been obtained under different reduced tillage systems shi et al 2016 reported that rotary tillage with subsoiling every two years could increase dry matter accumulation whereas sarauskis et al 2014 indicated that subsoiling required greater energy consumption because of the deep tillage layer resulting in higher co2 emissions in the ncp no tillage is used to sow summer maize whereas winter wheat is typically sown under tillage conditions after the harvest of summer maize therefore determining an effective tillage method is important for balancing the trade off between mitigating ghg emissions and improving crop production winter wheat is the main water consumer in the agroecosystem of ncp and tillage is indispensable for sowing winter wheat in this region studies indicate that water saving irrigation and improved tillage can mitigate global warming and increase water use efficiency and crop yield fangueiro et al 2017 maraseni et al 2012 however these studies have not systematically assessed the effects of interactions between irrigation scheduling and tillage method on water productivity crop production and potential environmental risks in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system in this study we hypothesized that an optimized irrigation schedule with an appropriate tillage method in an annual wheat maize system would maintain high yields achieve high water productivity and enable the sustainable development of cleaner agriculture a two year field experiment with two tillage methods and four irrigation schedules was performed to test this hypothesis the objectives of the study were 1 to investigate annual variation in ghg emissions under different tillage methods and irrigation schedules and 2 to propose an appropriate combination of tillage method and irrigation scheduling that could mitigate ghg emissions while increasing water productivity and yield the results will be helpful for the effective implementation of tillage and water management in an environmentally friendly agricultural system 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted at the experimental station of china agricultural

measurements for this study were collected from 2016 to 2018 the experiment had eight treatments in a split block design and each treatment was replicated three times each plot was 5 m wide and 11 m long and an isolation belt of 1 m was set between the different treatments two tillage methods t1 rotary tillage t2 subsoiling were used as the main treatment and four irrigation schedules were selected as the sub treatment irrigation at the pre planting stage w1 the pre planting jointing stages w2 the pre planting anthesis stages w3 and the pre planting jointing anthesis stages w4 the eight treatment combinations were applied to winter wheat whereas conventional management strategies were used for summer maize in all plots the direct effects of the management regimes on winter wheat the residual effects on summer maize and the annual effects on the wheat maize system were analyzed in terms of mitigating ghg emission and increasing yield and water use efficiency winter wheat was sown on 12 october 2016 and 14 october 2017 it was harvested on 5 june 2017 and 6 june 2018 the winter wheat variety jimai 22 was sown at a seeding rate of 300 kg ha 1 the summer maize straw was crushed with a rotary tiller before sowing winter wheat and all summer maize straw was returned to the field for rotary tillage a rotary tiller was used twice at a depth of 10 cm for subsoiling a subsoiler was used at a depth of 30 cm each year followed by rotary tillage twice at a depth of 10 cm to establish a smooth seedbed after tillage winter wheat was sown using a 2bx 9 wheat planter nonghaha machinery group hebei province all plots were irrigated before winter wheat was sown irrigation at the jointing stage was applied on 11 april 2017 and 8 april 2018 and irrigation at the anthesis stage was applied on 2 may 2017 and 7 may 2018 the irrigation amount was 75 mm each time all plots received 225 kg ha 1 nitrogen 46 urea and 18 diammonium phosphate 138 kg ha 1 phosphorus pentoxide 46 diammonium phosphate and 112 kg ha 1 potassium oxide 50 potassium sulphate all fertilizers were applied before sowing winter wheat the summer maize variety zhengdan 958 was sown on 8 june in 2016 and 2017 and harvested on 5 october 2017 and 4 october 2018 the planting density was 7 5 104 plants ha 1 the winter wheat straw was left on the soil surface with about 20 cm of stubble standing after harvest all wheat straw produced in each season was returned to the field in all plots no tillage operations were carried out prior to sowing summer maize in all plots summer maize was sown directly through winter wheat straw using a no tillage planter nonghaha machinery group hebei province irrigation 75 mm was applied to all plots after sowing summer maize and no additional irrigation was applied to summer maize before harvest the amounts of all fertilizers were the same as those used for winter wheat and all fertilizers were applied at the time of summer maize sowing 2 3 greenhouse gas sampling and analysis greenhouse gas fluxes were sampled using the closed chamber technique during the winter wheat or summer maize growing season the base of each chamber 20 20 30 cm was fixed in each plot the upper collar base had a 3 cm deep groove that could be filled with water and the chamber was inserted into the base groove to seal its edge during sampling in general eight gas samples were taken once every ten days at 10 min intervals between 09 00 and 11 00 am using a 50 ml gas tight plastic syringe after irrigation gas samples were obtained once every other day three times gas concentrations in the samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 a agilent technologies usa equipped with a flame ionization detector for measuring co2 and ch4 at 200 c and an electron capture detector for measuring n2o at 330 c the column temperature was set to 55 c the gas emission flux gao et al 2019 was calculated as follows f c t v a ρ 273 273 t where f is the gas

warming potential was obtained using seasonal co2 ch4 and n2o emissions with the co2 equivalent for a 100 year time period the equivalent coefficients of co2 ch4 and n2o emissions for ghg emissions were 1 25 and 298 respectively ipcc 2007 gwp co 2 ch 4 25 n 2 o 298 where gwp is global warming potential kg co2 equivalents ha 1 the gas emission intensity ma et al 2019 was calculated as follows

usa the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals were tested using the shapiro wilk test and the levene test respectively a two way anova was performed to test the effects of tillage method and irrigation schedule on yield wue gwp and ghgi differences between treatments were identified using the least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions in the winter wheat season cumulative rainfall was 110 4 mm for 32 rainy days in 2016 2017 and 224 2 mm for 25 rainy days in 2017 2018 rainfall was concentrated mainly in the months of april and may the mean air temperature was 8 6 c in 2016 2017 and 8 0 c in 2017 2018 fig 1 in the summer maize season cumulative rainfall was 334 9 mm for 27 rainy days in 2017 and 448 3 mm for 21 rainy days in 2018 rainfall was concentrated mainly between the months of june to august the mean air temperature was 25 4 c in 2017 and 25 7 c in 2018 fig 1 there was a large difference in rainfall between the two years whereas the mean air temperatures were similar 3 2 greenhouse gas emissions 3 2 1 carbon dioxide large differences in co2 fluxes variation were observed between the winter wheat and summer maize seasons whereas the contributions of winter wheat and summer maize to annual cumulative co2 emission were similar fig 2 co2 fluxes peaks were observed after sowing winter wheat and summer maize this was attributed mainly to the application of fertilizers and irrigation water chi et al 2020 wei et al 2018 because these amendments resulted in high soil organic carbon and high water filled pore space co2 fluxes were relatively steady and usually low from december to the following march then gradually increased behnke et al 2018 and parkin and kaspar 2003 also reported low co2 emissions in winter followed by increasing co2 fluxes with increasing temperature in response to a temperature increase high co2 fluxes were observed as soil organic matter was more rapidly mineralized wu et al 2011 from june to july in summer maize co2 fluxes were relatively high and constantly fluctuated due to increases in temperature and rainfall frequency similar to the results of chen et al 2018 in summer strong photosynthesis stimulated the activity of aerobic microorganisms thereby accelerating root respiration and releasing more co2 into the atmosphere at the late growth stage of summer maize co2 emissions decreased as a result of fertilizer depletion and a reduction in temperature and rainfall high co2 fluxes were observed two to four days after irrigation at the jointing or anthesis stage leading to higher annual cumulative co2 emission in the w2 w3 and w4 treatments compared to the w1 treatment although there was little difference in cumulative co2 emission between the four irrigation treatments irrigation water improved microbial activity in the soil which caused a reduction in the amount of carbon returned to the soil and promoted co2 emissions lal 2004 in addition higher crop productivity could be achieved under irrigation conditions which stimulated autotrophic root respiration and further accelerated co2 emissions scheer et al 2013 yu et al 2017 the t2 treatment made a greater contribution to annual cumulative co2 emission than the t1 treatment rotary tillage caused the soil surface to crust and further decreased soil water infiltration thereby leading to lower soil respiration sánchez et al 2019 3 2 2 methane ch4 fluxes showed similar absorption and exclusion characteristics and the soil acted as a sink for ch4 in all treatments fig 3 similarly liu et al 2012 indicated that the soil in a wheat maize system was not a major source of ch4 in the atmosphere irrigation water was applied to eliminate the negative impact of water stress on crop growth whereas the increased soil moisture might have reduced the soil s capacity to absorb ch4 sainju et al 2012 in the present study obvious emission peaks were not observed after irrigation but ch4 uptake decreased with increasing irrigation indicating that there was a positive correlation between soil water content and ch4 fluxes wang et al 2016 in general the w1 treatment showed the greatest annual cumulative ch4 uptake followed by the w2 w4 and w3 treatments insufficient oxygen supply caused by irrigation water might have created an anaerobic environment thus promoting the activity of methanogens although the irrigation frequency of the w3 treatment was lower than that of the w4 treatment the w3 treatment made a greater contribution to annual cumulative ch4 emission before the anthesis stage the soil in the w3 treatment was relatively dry for a long time because it had not been irrigated application of irrigation water at the anthesis stage and greater rainfall at the post anthesis stage suddenly increased soil moisture resulting in high ch4 emissions in the later period in addition soil tillage might have affected gas diffusivity in the soil thereby reducing ch4 oxidation hütsch 2001 the t2 treatment resulted in higher annual cumulative ch4 uptake compared with the t1 treatment the organic matter content under rotary tillage was mainly concentrated in the surface and middle soil layers which led to low oxidation reduction potential promoting the production of ch4 bai et al 2010 compared with that of winter wheat the contribution of summer maize to cumulative ch4 uptake was lower perhaps because of frequent and heavy rainfall events xu et al 2020 cumulative ch4 uptake in 2017 2018 was higher than that in 2016 2017 although cumulative rainfall during the wheat maize growing season was lower in 2016 2017 rainfall frequency was relatively greater and the temporal distribution of precipitation was more even and high ch4 fluxes might therefore have been continuously emitted from the humid soil khaliq et al 2019 3 2 3 nitrous oxide n2o emissions in the wheat maize system were low most of the time with occasional peak events fig 4 consistent with the findings of barton et al 2008 and liu et al 2011a n2o fluxes peaks occurred approximately three days after sowing and irrigation for winter wheat and reached emission peaks seven days after sowing in 2017 and five days after sowing in 2018 for summer maize the probable reasons for n2o fluxes peaks were fertilizer application irrigation and heavy rainfall zhang et al 2016 reported that n2o fluxes peaks occurred after fertilizer application because the fertilizer provided available nitrogen and degradable carbon for n2o emissions the elevated soil moisture caused by irrigation or precipitation regulated the supply of oxygen to soil microbes inducing denitrification processes to accelerate nitrogen conversion and increasing the probability of n2o emissions bouwman 1996 butterbach bahl et al 2013 silva et al 2008 annual cumulative n2o emissions increased with increasing irrigation amount however cumulative values were higher in the w2 treatment than in the w3 treatment as obvious n2o fluxes peaks did not occur after anthesis irrigation in the w3 treatment the anthesis stage coincided with the rainy season which reduced the limitation associated with soil water shortage and the soil nitrogen pool was gradually exhausted in the late growth period available nitrogen rather than water deficit appeared to limit the production of n2o jabro et al 2008 rochette et al 2008 n2o fluxes in the summer maize season were the main contributor to annual cumulative n2o emissions the higher n2o emissions for summer maize were mainly attributed to higher temperature and rainfall liu et al 2011b trujillo et al 2008 whereas lower n2o emissions in winter wheat season were caused by cooler temperatures guardia et al 2016 microbial mineralization of nitrogen in organic matter was inhibited at low soil temperatures which restricted the denitrification process aulakh et al 1992 snyder et al 2009 in addition different tillage measures could accelerate the mineralization of soil organic matter which increased n2o emissions from agricultural soils huang et al 2015 our results indicated that there were higher annual cumulative n2o emissions in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment probably because of the comprehensive effects of crop straw and nitrogen fertilizer in the subsoiling treatment crop straw and nitrogen fertilizer were distributed among the different soil layers which helped nitrogen from the straw and fertilizer to be fully absorbed by roots at different depths resulting in a lower risk of n2o emissions xia et al 2016 3 3 yield under the same tillage method yields generally followed the order w2 w4 w3 w1 table 1 the w2 treatment resulted in an average of 15 47 18 02 higher yields for winter wheat and 7 56 10 58 higher yields for the wheat maize system compared with the w3 treatment across both years supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage effectively improved dry mass accumulation mainly due to the increase in leaf nutrient contents e g proline carotenoids and chlorophyll li et al 2010 in 2016 2018 the yields of winter wheat and the wheat maize system were increased by an average of 3 15 4 62 and 2 06 2 68 in the w2 treatment compared with the w4 treatment our results showed that an increase in irrigation frequency and irrigation amount did not further improve crop yield consistent with the research of rao et al 2013 wang et al 2013 reported that excessive soil water content could result in premature leaf senescence and lower grain weight for the w4 treatment the combination of irrigation at the anthesis stage with rainfall events after the anthesis stage might have increased soil moisture decreasing flag leaf chlorophyll content at the filling stage and thereby reducing dry matter accumulation li et al 2019b however differences in summer maize yield between irrigation treatments were relatively small indicating that changes in the irrigation schedule of winter wheat had little residual effect on summer maize the frequent rainfall in the summer maize season might offset soil moisture differences between plots in the previous season in general yield was higher in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment under the same irrigation schedule table 1 over the two growing seasons the t1 treatment resulted in 10 78 38 16 0 88 4 46 and 4 41 15 15 higher yields on average than the t2 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively these results were consistent with a previous study in which 2 44 higher yield was obtained under rotary tillage than under rotary tillage after subsoiling in southern china asenso et al 2019 soil tillage has been shown to affect both root nutrient absorption and variation in crop yield fageria 2004 compared with rotary tillage subsoiling might better eliminate soil compaction and facilitate root growth in the deeper soil layers and this effect might be clearer in a long term experiment however the present experiment lasted only four years which might have led to minimal differences in soil compaction between the two tillage methods and had little impact on root biomass jia et al 2004 in addition roots were more abundant in the upper soil layers wilhelm et al 1982 indicating that the surface soil might be a hotspot for differences in root growth and development kan et al 2020 in previous work root length density decreased with soil depth rubino and franchi 1990 and the highest root length density was observed in the 0 10 cm soil layer qin et al 2004 under rotary tillage the 0 10 cm soil layer was fully disturbed which was conducive to increased root length density and root surface density thereby improving crop yields guan et al 2014 a statistical analysis of the effects of tillage irrigation year and their interactions on yields was presented in table 1 there were significant effects of tillage irrigation year tillage irrigation and year tillage on winter wheat yield the primary factors influencing summer maize yield were irrigation and year the main factors determining total yield in the wheat maize system were tillage irrigation year and year tillage 3 4 water use efficiency the highest wue under the same tillage method was observed in the w2 treatment table 1 in the two growing seasons wue was higher by an average of 9 12 27 25 9 62 21 17 and 9 95 17 83 in the w2 treatment than in the w3 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively the soil water content was affected by the distribution and growth of root systems which had an effect on the change in wue benjamin and nielsen 2006 the w3 treatment without irrigation at jointing stage had a lower wue than the w2 treatment because the jointing stage was a more important period for root growth than the anthesis stage li et al 2018 drought at the pre anthesis stage was not beneficial for root system growth and thus reduced water uptake for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system in 2016 2018 the wue of the w2 treatment was higher than that of the w4 treatment by an average of 8 99 27 49 17 17 22 63 and 11 29 22 84 respectively although the w2 treatment was irrigated only at the jointing stage it achieved higher wue than the w4 treatment xu et al 2016 reported that limited irrigation could promote root growth deeper into the soil and further improve wue the w2 treatment without anthesis irrigation experienced a true water deficit which increased the ability of the roots to penetrate into the deep soil thereby promoting water consumption from the deep soil layer and increasing wue in addition frequent rainfall events at the post anthesis stage might have met the water requirement of the wheat crop to some extent in the w2 treatment wue was higher in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment under the same irrigation schedule table 1 as an illustration wue in 2016 2018 was 19 55 30 74 0 58 7 07 and 8 12 12 76 higher on average in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively tillage broke up the soil structure and affected root penetration thereby promoting soil moisture absorption and improving the water use status of the crop wang et al 2020b reported that although the evapotranspiration associated with rotary tillage was lower than that associated with subsoiling from anthesis to maturity rotary tillage promoted water absorption during the early growth stage in addition higher mean root diameter root width and number of nodal roots were measured under rotary tillage this resulted in more available water being used by root systems to meet crop growth demand and was accompanied by an increase in yield bian et al 2016 the effects of tillage irrigation year and their interactions on wue were analyzed using significance thresholds of p 0 05 and p 0 01 table 1 significant effects of tillage irrigation year and their interactions were observed on wue for winter wheat and the wheat maize system significant effects of tillage irrigation year and tillage irrigation were observed on wue for summer maize 3 5 global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity co2 accounted for the highest proportion of the gwp followed by n2o whereas the contribution of ch4 to the gwp was essentially negative table 2 4 the soil acted as a source for co2 and n2o but as a sink for ch4 in the wheat maize system similar to the results of maris et al 2016 and xu et al 2020 although the contribution of co2 to the gwp was much greater than that of n2o the capture of co2 and n2o was the key to reducing the gwp under the same tillage method the w2 treatment had the lowest gwp and ghgi for winter wheat from 2016 to 2018 table 2 for example gwp was lower in the w2 treatment by an average of 7 38 8 23 and 4 24 4 46 compared with the w3 and w4 treatments respectively the ghgi of the w2 treatment was 21 66 22 21 and 7 00 8 75 lower on average than that of the w3 and w4 treatments respectively however there was no obvious pattern to the effect of irrigation schedule on gwp and ghgi in summer maize table 3 probably because frequent rainfall events and high air temperatures were the main factors that affected ghg emission for the wheat maize system from 2016 to 2018 the findings for gwp and ghgi were similar to those for winter wheat table 4 as an illustration the gwp of the w2 treatment under the same tillage method decreased by an average of 3 70 5 10 and 0 65 2 25 compared with the w3 and w4 treatments respectively the ghgi of the w2 treatment was 10 66 14 26 and 3 05 4 86 lower on average than that of the w3 and w4 treatments respectively compared with the w2 treatment a greater contribution of both co2 and n2o to the gwp was found in the w3 and w4 treatments resulting in a higher gwp therefore higher yield and lower gwp in the w2 treatment led to a lower ghgi generally the gwp and ghgi were lower in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment under the same irrigation schedule in 2016 2018 the gwp and ghgi decreased by an average of 4 96 9 27 and 15 36 35 66 in the t1 treatment compared with the t2 treatment for winter wheat table 2 there was no obvious pattern to the effect of tillage method on gwp in summer maize whereas the ghgi of the t1 treatment averaged 2 17 4 99 lower than that of the t2 treatment due to the higher yield of the t1 treatment table 3 for the wheat maize system gwp and ghgi decreased by an average of 3 97 4 62 and 8 80 16 93 in the t1 treatment compared with the t2 treatment table 4 direct co2 emission was responsible for most of the gwp consistent with the results of xu et al 2020 who found that co2 accounted for the greatest proportion 90 of the gwp the difference in co2 emission between tillage methods might have been related to tillage depth and the number of tillage operations pratibha et al 2016 buragiene et al 2015 indicated that co2 emissions increased with increasing depth of soil tillage the depth of tillage was greater in the t2 treatment as a result of additional subsoiling which resulted in high co2 emissions in addition the formation of a soil surface crust under rotary tillage hindered water entry into the soil thereby causing lower co2 emissions in the t1 treatment sánchez et al 2019 overall lower co2 emission in the t1 treatment led to a lower gwp and this treatment also had a lower ghgi because of its higher yields tillage irrigation year and year tillage had significant effects on gwp and ghgi in winter wheat in addition the effects of tillage irrigation and year irrigation on ghgi were also significant table 2 for summer maize tillage irrigation year and their interactions had significant effects on gwp whereas significant effects of only tillage irrigation and year were observed on ghgi table 3 for the wheat maize system the primary factors influencing gwp and ghgi were tillage irrigation and year there were also significant effects of year irrigation on gwp and year tillage on ghgi table 4 3 6 combination of integrative productivity the combined tillage and irrigation management regimes had a significant effect on ghg emission crop yield and water productivity application of irrigation promoted ghg emissions which was not good for environmental protection as an illustration the w1 treatment had the lowest gwp but also produced the lowest yield owing to water shortage appropriate irrigation w2 treatment was capable of promoting increased crop yield and water productivity compared with the w2 treatment improper irrigation timing in the w3 treatment reduced yield and increased ghgi whereas the large volume of irrigation water in the w4 treatment resulted in lower wue as a soil management system of conservation tillage the t1 treatment improved yield and wue while reducing ghgi and input costs based on its integrative productivity the t1w2 treatment was considered to be a recommended management regime for ghg mitigation yield improvement and better water productivity 4 conclusions the present study documented annual variations in ghg emissions crop yield and water productivity under two tillage methods and four irrigation schedules in a typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system in the ncp regardless of management measures the soil acted as a sink for ch4 but as a source for co2 and n2o during the winter wheat summer maize season indicating that decreased co2 and n2o fluxes would be helpful in alleviating ghg emissions compared with subsoiling rotary tillage not only saved fuel and energy but also produced higher yields and lower gwp and ghgi excessive irrigation was not beneficial for ghg mitigation whereas irrigation during the critical growth period significantly increased crop yields and water productivity as a result pre planting jointing irrigation could achieve the goal of decreasing the gwp and ghgi while improving the yield and wue in practice supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage and rotary tillage can be regarded as an effective management strategy for water saving irrigation sustainable production and ghg mitigation

10169,excessive agricultural inputs meet food demand only at a huge environmental cost and optimized management strategies are needed to promote the balanced development of food security water conservation and environmental sustainability here we conducted a two year field experiment to investigate annual greenhouse gas ghg emission yield water use efficiency wue global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi from 2016 to 2018 in a typical wheat maize cropping system in the north china plain two tillage methods t1 rotary tillage t2 subsoiling and four irrigation schedules w1 pre planting irrigation w2 pre planting jointing irrigation w3 pre planting anthesis irrigation w4 pre planting jointing anthesis irrigation were used for winter wheat and conventional practices were adopted for summer maize in the winter wheat summer maize season the soil acted as a net sink for ch4 but as a source for co2 and n2o in all treatments and co2 accounted for the highest proportion of the gwp the inappropriate irrigation period in the w3 treatment caused greater ghg release and reduced crop yield whereas the excessive irrigation in the w4 treatment led to low water productivity although the use of irrigation water increased annual ghg emissions an appropriate irrigation schedule could significantly mitigate the ghgi compared with the w3 and w4 treatments the w2 treatment increased yield by an average of 7 56 10 58 and 2 06 2 68 improved wue by 9 95 17 83 and 11 29 22 84 reduced gwp by 3 70 5 10 and 0 65 2 25 and decreased ghgi by 10 66 14 26 and 3 05 4 86 respectively the t2 treatment resulted in high ghg emissions and was accompanied by low yield and water productivity relative to the t2 treatment the annual yield and wue in the t1 treatment increased by an average of 4 41 15 15 and 8 12 12 76 and the annual gwp and ghgi decreased by 3 97 4 62 and 8 80 16 93 therefore rotary tillage combined with supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage can mitigate ghg emissions and improve yield and water productivity making it an environmentally friendly agricultural practice keywords wheat maize cropping systems tillage irrigation greenhouse gas yield water saving 1 introduction global warming and other environmental concerns caused by high greenhouse gas ghg emissions such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o have aroused widespread attention across the globe stocker et al 2013 as an important source of ghg increased agricultural input has released substantial ghg into the atmosphere accounting for about 10 12 of global anthropogenic emissions ipcc 2014 meeting global food demand while reducing ghg emissions is an unprecedented challenge to extensive agriculture the formation of ghg in agricultural systems is frequently a complex process that is influenced by management measures soil texture and climate conditions chen et al 2020 developing cleaner agricultural operations associated with reduced ghg emissions has become an urgent task as soil texture and climate conditions are largely outside human control the optimization of agricultural practices such as irrigation scheduling and tillage may be an effective option for maintaining environmental sustainability and improving crop production the north china plain ncp is one of the most important agricultural regions in china and accounts for about 50 and 33 of total winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l production liang et al 2011 it is irrigated only once after sowing summer maize in the ncp whereas three to five applications of heavy irrigation are typically used to meet the water demand of winter wheat sun et al 2011 over exploitation of groundwater has caused the ncp to experience severe water shortage zhang et al 2015 and more than 70 of agricultural water is used to irrigate winter wheat li et al 2005 because of the impact of water management on crop growth and ghg emissions excessive irrigation promotes denitrification by soil microorganisms and increases active methanogens which emit large amounts of n2o and ch4 accompanied by co2 emissions d acunha and johnson 2019 linquist et al 2012 zou et al 2005 however irrigation during the critical growth period promotes deep root growth which improves the absorption and utilization of water stored in deep soil layers deng et al 2006 xu et al 2018 investigated the effects of seven irrigation schedules on winter wheat yield and water use efficiency they reported that supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage was essential for meeting the crop s water requirement after testing three irrigation strategies cheng et al 2020 found that intermittent irrigation after midseason drainage mitigated ghg emissions and maintained high rice yields therefore determining an appropriate irrigation schedule is important for conserving water maintaining high crop production and mitigating ghg emissions as another major factor that affects crop yields and ghg emissions soil tillage leads to the decomposition of soil organic matter and changes the availability of soil organic carbon and nitrogen by disturbing the soil structure and microbial community bossio et al 1999 kool et al 2011 because each tillage method has a different effect on soil physical chemical and biological properties and crop performance selection of an appropriate tillage method is important for mitigating ghg emissions and improving crop production studies have shown that conventional tillage has disadvantages for soil fertility crop productivity and ghg emissions waglea et al 2018 wang et al 2020a reduced tillage e g rotary tillage and subsoiling an important form of conservation tillage has been gradually developed in recent years however various outcomes have been obtained under different reduced tillage systems shi et al 2016 reported that rotary tillage with subsoiling every two years could increase dry matter accumulation whereas sarauskis et al 2014 indicated that subsoiling required greater energy consumption because of the deep tillage layer resulting in higher co2 emissions in the ncp no tillage is used to sow summer maize whereas winter wheat is typically sown under tillage conditions after the harvest of summer maize therefore determining an effective tillage method is important for balancing the trade off between mitigating ghg emissions and improving crop production winter wheat is the main water consumer in the agroecosystem of ncp and tillage is indispensable for sowing winter wheat in this region studies indicate that water saving irrigation and improved tillage can mitigate global warming and increase water use efficiency and crop yield fangueiro et al 2017 maraseni et al 2012 however these studies have not systematically assessed the effects of interactions between irrigation scheduling and tillage method on water productivity crop production and potential environmental risks in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system in this study we hypothesized that an optimized irrigation schedule with an appropriate tillage method in an annual wheat maize system would maintain high yields achieve high water productivity and enable the sustainable development of cleaner agriculture a two year field experiment with two tillage methods and four irrigation schedules was performed to test this hypothesis the objectives of the study were 1 to investigate annual variation in ghg emissions under different tillage methods and irrigation schedules and 2 to propose an appropriate combination of tillage method and irrigation scheduling that could mitigate ghg emissions while increasing water productivity and yield the results will be helpful for the effective implementation of tillage and water management in an environmentally friendly agricultural system 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted at the experimental station of china agricultural

measurements for this study were collected from 2016 to 2018 the experiment had eight treatments in a split block design and each treatment was replicated three times each plot was 5 m wide and 11 m long and an isolation belt of 1 m was set between the different treatments two tillage methods t1 rotary tillage t2 subsoiling were used as the main treatment and four irrigation schedules were selected as the sub treatment irrigation at the pre planting stage w1 the pre planting jointing stages w2 the pre planting anthesis stages w3 and the pre planting jointing anthesis stages w4 the eight treatment combinations were applied to winter wheat whereas conventional management strategies were used for summer maize in all plots the direct effects of the management regimes on winter wheat the residual effects on summer maize and the annual effects on the wheat maize system were analyzed in terms of mitigating ghg emission and increasing yield and water use efficiency winter wheat was sown on 12 october 2016 and 14 october 2017 it was harvested on 5 june 2017 and 6 june 2018 the winter wheat variety jimai 22 was sown at a seeding rate of 300 kg ha 1 the summer maize straw was crushed with a rotary tiller before sowing winter wheat and all summer maize straw was returned to the field for rotary tillage a rotary tiller was used twice at a depth of 10 cm for subsoiling a subsoiler was used at a depth of 30 cm each year followed by rotary tillage twice at a depth of 10 cm to establish a smooth seedbed after tillage winter wheat was sown using a 2bx 9 wheat planter nonghaha machinery group hebei province all plots were irrigated before winter wheat was sown irrigation at the jointing stage was applied on 11 april 2017 and 8 april 2018 and irrigation at the anthesis stage was applied on 2 may 2017 and 7 may 2018 the irrigation amount was 75 mm each time all plots received 225 kg ha 1 nitrogen 46 urea and 18 diammonium phosphate 138 kg ha 1 phosphorus pentoxide 46 diammonium phosphate and 112 kg ha 1 potassium oxide 50 potassium sulphate all fertilizers were applied before sowing winter wheat the summer maize variety zhengdan 958 was sown on 8 june in 2016 and 2017 and harvested on 5 october 2017 and 4 october 2018 the planting density was 7 5 104 plants ha 1 the winter wheat straw was left on the soil surface with about 20 cm of stubble standing after harvest all wheat straw produced in each season was returned to the field in all plots no tillage operations were carried out prior to sowing summer maize in all plots summer maize was sown directly through winter wheat straw using a no tillage planter nonghaha machinery group hebei province irrigation 75 mm was applied to all plots after sowing summer maize and no additional irrigation was applied to summer maize before harvest the amounts of all fertilizers were the same as those used for winter wheat and all fertilizers were applied at the time of summer maize sowing 2 3 greenhouse gas sampling and analysis greenhouse gas fluxes were sampled using the closed chamber technique during the winter wheat or summer maize growing season the base of each chamber 20 20 30 cm was fixed in each plot the upper collar base had a 3 cm deep groove that could be filled with water and the chamber was inserted into the base groove to seal its edge during sampling in general eight gas samples were taken once every ten days at 10 min intervals between 09 00 and 11 00 am using a 50 ml gas tight plastic syringe after irrigation gas samples were obtained once every other day three times gas concentrations in the samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 a agilent technologies usa equipped with a flame ionization detector for measuring co2 and ch4 at 200 c and an electron capture detector for measuring n2o at 330 c the column temperature was set to 55 c the gas emission flux gao et al 2019 was calculated as follows f c t v a ρ 273 273 t where f is the gas

warming potential was obtained using seasonal co2 ch4 and n2o emissions with the co2 equivalent for a 100 year time period the equivalent coefficients of co2 ch4 and n2o emissions for ghg emissions were 1 25 and 298 respectively ipcc 2007 gwp co 2 ch 4 25 n 2 o 298 where gwp is global warming potential kg co2 equivalents ha 1 the gas emission intensity ma et al 2019 was calculated as follows

usa the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals were tested using the shapiro wilk test and the levene test respectively a two way anova was performed to test the effects of tillage method and irrigation schedule on yield wue gwp and ghgi differences between treatments were identified using the least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions in the winter wheat season cumulative rainfall was 110 4 mm for 32 rainy days in 2016 2017 and 224 2 mm for 25 rainy days in 2017 2018 rainfall was concentrated mainly in the months of april and may the mean air temperature was 8 6 c in 2016 2017 and 8 0 c in 2017 2018 fig 1 in the summer maize season cumulative rainfall was 334 9 mm for 27 rainy days in 2017 and 448 3 mm for 21 rainy days in 2018 rainfall was concentrated mainly between the months of june to august the mean air temperature was 25 4 c in 2017 and 25 7 c in 2018 fig 1 there was a large difference in rainfall between the two years whereas the mean air temperatures were similar 3 2 greenhouse gas emissions 3 2 1 carbon dioxide large differences in co2 fluxes variation were observed between the winter wheat and summer maize seasons whereas the contributions of winter wheat and summer maize to annual cumulative co2 emission were similar fig 2 co2 fluxes peaks were observed after sowing winter wheat and summer maize this was attributed mainly to the application of fertilizers and irrigation water chi et al 2020 wei et al 2018 because these amendments resulted in high soil organic carbon and high water filled pore space co2 fluxes were relatively steady and usually low from december to the following march then gradually increased behnke et al 2018 and parkin and kaspar 2003 also reported low co2 emissions in winter followed by increasing co2 fluxes with increasing temperature in response to a temperature increase high co2 fluxes were observed as soil organic matter was more rapidly mineralized wu et al 2011 from june to july in summer maize co2 fluxes were relatively high and constantly fluctuated due to increases in temperature and rainfall frequency similar to the results of chen et al 2018 in summer strong photosynthesis stimulated the activity of aerobic microorganisms thereby accelerating root respiration and releasing more co2 into the atmosphere at the late growth stage of summer maize co2 emissions decreased as a result of fertilizer depletion and a reduction in temperature and rainfall high co2 fluxes were observed two to four days after irrigation at the jointing or anthesis stage leading to higher annual cumulative co2 emission in the w2 w3 and w4 treatments compared to the w1 treatment although there was little difference in cumulative co2 emission between the four irrigation treatments irrigation water improved microbial activity in the soil which caused a reduction in the amount of carbon returned to the soil and promoted co2 emissions lal 2004 in addition higher crop productivity could be achieved under irrigation conditions which stimulated autotrophic root respiration and further accelerated co2 emissions scheer et al 2013 yu et al 2017 the t2 treatment made a greater contribution to annual cumulative co2 emission than the t1 treatment rotary tillage caused the soil surface to crust and further decreased soil water infiltration thereby leading to lower soil respiration sánchez et al 2019 3 2 2 methane ch4 fluxes showed similar absorption and exclusion characteristics and the soil acted as a sink for ch4 in all treatments fig 3 similarly liu et al 2012 indicated that the soil in a wheat maize system was not a major source of ch4 in the atmosphere irrigation water was applied to eliminate the negative impact of water stress on crop growth whereas the increased soil moisture might have reduced the soil s capacity to absorb ch4 sainju et al 2012 in the present study obvious emission peaks were not observed after irrigation but ch4 uptake decreased with increasing irrigation indicating that there was a positive correlation between soil water content and ch4 fluxes wang et al 2016 in general the w1 treatment showed the greatest annual cumulative ch4 uptake followed by the w2 w4 and w3 treatments insufficient oxygen supply caused by irrigation water might have created an anaerobic environment thus promoting the activity of methanogens although the irrigation frequency of the w3 treatment was lower than that of the w4 treatment the w3 treatment made a greater contribution to annual cumulative ch4 emission before the anthesis stage the soil in the w3 treatment was relatively dry for a long time because it had not been irrigated application of irrigation water at the anthesis stage and greater rainfall at the post anthesis stage suddenly increased soil moisture resulting in high ch4 emissions in the later period in addition soil tillage might have affected gas diffusivity in the soil thereby reducing ch4 oxidation hütsch 2001 the t2 treatment resulted in higher annual cumulative ch4 uptake compared with the t1 treatment the organic matter content under rotary tillage was mainly concentrated in the surface and middle soil layers which led to low oxidation reduction potential promoting the production of ch4 bai et al 2010 compared with that of winter wheat the contribution of summer maize to cumulative ch4 uptake was lower perhaps because of frequent and heavy rainfall events xu et al 2020 cumulative ch4 uptake in 2017 2018 was higher than that in 2016 2017 although cumulative rainfall during the wheat maize growing season was lower in 2016 2017 rainfall frequency was relatively greater and the temporal distribution of precipitation was more even and high ch4 fluxes might therefore have been continuously emitted from the humid soil khaliq et al 2019 3 2 3 nitrous oxide n2o emissions in the wheat maize system were low most of the time with occasional peak events fig 4 consistent with the findings of barton et al 2008 and liu et al 2011a n2o fluxes peaks occurred approximately three days after sowing and irrigation for winter wheat and reached emission peaks seven days after sowing in 2017 and five days after sowing in 2018 for summer maize the probable reasons for n2o fluxes peaks were fertilizer application irrigation and heavy rainfall zhang et al 2016 reported that n2o fluxes peaks occurred after fertilizer application because the fertilizer provided available nitrogen and degradable carbon for n2o emissions the elevated soil moisture caused by irrigation or precipitation regulated the supply of oxygen to soil microbes inducing denitrification processes to accelerate nitrogen conversion and increasing the probability of n2o emissions bouwman 1996 butterbach bahl et al 2013 silva et al 2008 annual cumulative n2o emissions increased with increasing irrigation amount however cumulative values were higher in the w2 treatment than in the w3 treatment as obvious n2o fluxes peaks did not occur after anthesis irrigation in the w3 treatment the anthesis stage coincided with the rainy season which reduced the limitation associated with soil water shortage and the soil nitrogen pool was gradually exhausted in the late growth period available nitrogen rather than water deficit appeared to limit the production of n2o jabro et al 2008 rochette et al 2008 n2o fluxes in the summer maize season were the main contributor to annual cumulative n2o emissions the higher n2o emissions for summer maize were mainly attributed to higher temperature and rainfall liu et al 2011b trujillo et al 2008 whereas lower n2o emissions in winter wheat season were caused by cooler temperatures guardia et al 2016 microbial mineralization of nitrogen in organic matter was inhibited at low soil temperatures which restricted the denitrification process aulakh et al 1992 snyder et al 2009 in addition different tillage measures could accelerate the mineralization of soil organic matter which increased n2o emissions from agricultural soils huang et al 2015 our results indicated that there were higher annual cumulative n2o emissions in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment probably because of the comprehensive effects of crop straw and nitrogen fertilizer in the subsoiling treatment crop straw and nitrogen fertilizer were distributed among the different soil layers which helped nitrogen from the straw and fertilizer to be fully absorbed by roots at different depths resulting in a lower risk of n2o emissions xia et al 2016 3 3 yield under the same tillage method yields generally followed the order w2 w4 w3 w1 table 1 the w2 treatment resulted in an average of 15 47 18 02 higher yields for winter wheat and 7 56 10 58 higher yields for the wheat maize system compared with the w3 treatment across both years supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage effectively improved dry mass accumulation mainly due to the increase in leaf nutrient contents e g proline carotenoids and chlorophyll li et al 2010 in 2016 2018 the yields of winter wheat and the wheat maize system were increased by an average of 3 15 4 62 and 2 06 2 68 in the w2 treatment compared with the w4 treatment our results showed that an increase in irrigation frequency and irrigation amount did not further improve crop yield consistent with the research of rao et al 2013 wang et al 2013 reported that excessive soil water content could result in premature leaf senescence and lower grain weight for the w4 treatment the combination of irrigation at the anthesis stage with rainfall events after the anthesis stage might have increased soil moisture decreasing flag leaf chlorophyll content at the filling stage and thereby reducing dry matter accumulation li et al 2019b however differences in summer maize yield between irrigation treatments were relatively small indicating that changes in the irrigation schedule of winter wheat had little residual effect on summer maize the frequent rainfall in the summer maize season might offset soil moisture differences between plots in the previous season in general yield was higher in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment under the same irrigation schedule table 1 over the two growing seasons the t1 treatment resulted in 10 78 38 16 0 88 4 46 and 4 41 15 15 higher yields on average than the t2 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively these results were consistent with a previous study in which 2 44 higher yield was obtained under rotary tillage than under rotary tillage after subsoiling in southern china asenso et al 2019 soil tillage has been shown to affect both root nutrient absorption and variation in crop yield fageria 2004 compared with rotary tillage subsoiling might better eliminate soil compaction and facilitate root growth in the deeper soil layers and this effect might be clearer in a long term experiment however the present experiment lasted only four years which might have led to minimal differences in soil compaction between the two tillage methods and had little impact on root biomass jia et al 2004 in addition roots were more abundant in the upper soil layers wilhelm et al 1982 indicating that the surface soil might be a hotspot for differences in root growth and development kan et al 2020 in previous work root length density decreased with soil depth rubino and franchi 1990 and the highest root length density was observed in the 0 10 cm soil layer qin et al 2004 under rotary tillage the 0 10 cm soil layer was fully disturbed which was conducive to increased root length density and root surface density thereby improving crop yields guan et al 2014 a statistical analysis of the effects of tillage irrigation year and their interactions on yields was presented in table 1 there were significant effects of tillage irrigation year tillage irrigation and year tillage on winter wheat yield the primary factors influencing summer maize yield were irrigation and year the main factors determining total yield in the wheat maize system were tillage irrigation year and year tillage 3 4 water use efficiency the highest wue under the same tillage method was observed in the w2 treatment table 1 in the two growing seasons wue was higher by an average of 9 12 27 25 9 62 21 17 and 9 95 17 83 in the w2 treatment than in the w3 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively the soil water content was affected by the distribution and growth of root systems which had an effect on the change in wue benjamin and nielsen 2006 the w3 treatment without irrigation at jointing stage had a lower wue than the w2 treatment because the jointing stage was a more important period for root growth than the anthesis stage li et al 2018 drought at the pre anthesis stage was not beneficial for root system growth and thus reduced water uptake for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system in 2016 2018 the wue of the w2 treatment was higher than that of the w4 treatment by an average of 8 99 27 49 17 17 22 63 and 11 29 22 84 respectively although the w2 treatment was irrigated only at the jointing stage it achieved higher wue than the w4 treatment xu et al 2016 reported that limited irrigation could promote root growth deeper into the soil and further improve wue the w2 treatment without anthesis irrigation experienced a true water deficit which increased the ability of the roots to penetrate into the deep soil thereby promoting water consumption from the deep soil layer and increasing wue in addition frequent rainfall events at the post anthesis stage might have met the water requirement of the wheat crop to some extent in the w2 treatment wue was higher in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment under the same irrigation schedule table 1 as an illustration wue in 2016 2018 was 19 55 30 74 0 58 7 07 and 8 12 12 76 higher on average in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively tillage broke up the soil structure and affected root penetration thereby promoting soil moisture absorption and improving the water use status of the crop wang et al 2020b reported that although the evapotranspiration associated with rotary tillage was lower than that associated with subsoiling from anthesis to maturity rotary tillage promoted water absorption during the early growth stage in addition higher mean root diameter root width and number of nodal roots were measured under rotary tillage this resulted in more available water being used by root systems to meet crop growth demand and was accompanied by an increase in yield bian et al 2016 the effects of tillage irrigation year and their interactions on wue were analyzed using significance thresholds of p 0 05 and p 0 01 table 1 significant effects of tillage irrigation year and their interactions were observed on wue for winter wheat and the wheat maize system significant effects of tillage irrigation year and tillage irrigation were observed on wue for summer maize 3 5 global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity co2 accounted for the highest proportion of the gwp followed by n2o whereas the contribution of ch4 to the gwp was essentially negative table 2 4 the soil acted as a source for co2 and n2o but as a sink for ch4 in the wheat maize system similar to the results of maris et al 2016 and xu et al 2020 although the contribution of co2 to the gwp was much greater than that of n2o the capture of co2 and n2o was the key to reducing the gwp under the same tillage method the w2 treatment had the lowest gwp and ghgi for winter wheat from 2016 to 2018 table 2 for example gwp was lower in the w2 treatment by an average of 7 38 8 23 and 4 24 4 46 compared with the w3 and w4 treatments respectively the ghgi of the w2 treatment was 21 66 22 21 and 7 00 8 75 lower on average than that of the w3 and w4 treatments respectively however there was no obvious pattern to the effect of irrigation schedule on gwp and ghgi in summer maize table 3 probably because frequent rainfall events and high air temperatures were the main factors that affected ghg emission for the wheat maize system from 2016 to 2018 the findings for gwp and ghgi were similar to those for winter wheat table 4 as an illustration the gwp of the w2 treatment under the same tillage method decreased by an average of 3 70 5 10 and 0 65 2 25 compared with the w3 and w4 treatments respectively the ghgi of the w2 treatment was 10 66 14 26 and 3 05 4 86 lower on average than that of the w3 and w4 treatments respectively compared with the w2 treatment a greater contribution of both co2 and n2o to the gwp was found in the w3 and w4 treatments resulting in a higher gwp therefore higher yield and lower gwp in the w2 treatment led to a lower ghgi generally the gwp and ghgi were lower in the t1 treatment than in the t2 treatment under the same irrigation schedule in 2016 2018 the gwp and ghgi decreased by an average of 4 96 9 27 and 15 36 35 66 in the t1 treatment compared with the t2 treatment for winter wheat table 2 there was no obvious pattern to the effect of tillage method on gwp in summer maize whereas the ghgi of the t1 treatment averaged 2 17 4 99 lower than that of the t2 treatment due to the higher yield of the t1 treatment table 3 for the wheat maize system gwp and ghgi decreased by an average of 3 97 4 62 and 8 80 16 93 in the t1 treatment compared with the t2 treatment table 4 direct co2 emission was responsible for most of the gwp consistent with the results of xu et al 2020 who found that co2 accounted for the greatest proportion 90 of the gwp the difference in co2 emission between tillage methods might have been related to tillage depth and the number of tillage operations pratibha et al 2016 buragiene et al 2015 indicated that co2 emissions increased with increasing depth of soil tillage the depth of tillage was greater in the t2 treatment as a result of additional subsoiling which resulted in high co2 emissions in addition the formation of a soil surface crust under rotary tillage hindered water entry into the soil thereby causing lower co2 emissions in the t1 treatment sánchez et al 2019 overall lower co2 emission in the t1 treatment led to a lower gwp and this treatment also had a lower ghgi because of its higher yields tillage irrigation year and year tillage had significant effects on gwp and ghgi in winter wheat in addition the effects of tillage irrigation and year irrigation on ghgi were also significant table 2 for summer maize tillage irrigation year and their interactions had significant effects on gwp whereas significant effects of only tillage irrigation and year were observed on ghgi table 3 for the wheat maize system the primary factors influencing gwp and ghgi were tillage irrigation and year there were also significant effects of year irrigation on gwp and year tillage on ghgi table 4 3 6 combination of integrative productivity the combined tillage and irrigation management regimes had a significant effect on ghg emission crop yield and water productivity application of irrigation promoted ghg emissions which was not good for environmental protection as an illustration the w1 treatment had the lowest gwp but also produced the lowest yield owing to water shortage appropriate irrigation w2 treatment was capable of promoting increased crop yield and water productivity compared with the w2 treatment improper irrigation timing in the w3 treatment reduced yield and increased ghgi whereas the large volume of irrigation water in the w4 treatment resulted in lower wue as a soil management system of conservation tillage the t1 treatment improved yield and wue while reducing ghgi and input costs based on its integrative productivity the t1w2 treatment was considered to be a recommended management regime for ghg mitigation yield improvement and better water productivity 4 conclusions the present study documented annual variations in ghg emissions crop yield and water productivity under two tillage methods and four irrigation schedules in a typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system in the ncp regardless of management measures the soil acted as a sink for ch4 but as a source for co2 and n2o during the winter wheat summer maize season indicating that decreased co2 and n2o fluxes would be helpful in alleviating ghg emissions compared with subsoiling rotary tillage not only saved fuel and energy but also produced higher yields and lower gwp and ghgi excessive irrigation was not beneficial for ghg mitigation whereas irrigation during the critical growth period significantly increased crop yields and water productivity as a result pre planting jointing irrigation could achieve the goal of decreasing the gwp and ghgi while improving the yield and wue in practice supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage and rotary tillage can be regarded as an effective management strategy for water saving irrigation sustainable production and ghg mitigation
