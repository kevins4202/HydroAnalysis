20320,an analytical study associated with surface gravity wave interaction with a horizontal flexible floating and a submerged porous plate is presented under linearized water wave theory and small amplitude structural response the expansion formulae of the referred problem based on green s function technique is derived using the two dimensional laplace equation and fundamental solution of source potentials in finite and infinite water depths the velocity potential for the free oscillations in a closed basin is derived and the hydroelastic wave characteristics in floating and submerged flexural modes are analyzed in specific cases further the usefulness of the expansion formula is demonstrated by analyzing a real physical problem of wave interaction with a moored flexible floating plate and a moored submerged flexible porous plate of finite dimensions in finite water depth the convergence of the present solution is checked and the effect of a moored finite submerged porous plate on the moored finite flexible floating plate with different design parameters are analyzed it is observed that the present analysis may be helpful for better understanding in designing a floating and submerged flexible porous plate system for application as a breakwater keywords flexible structures green s function expansion formulae hydroelastic waves mooring lines 1 introduction in the islands and the countries that have long coastlines with high population and urban development a flexible plate type system of horizontal floating with submerged porous structures may be a viable alternative to a single floating or submerged structure the use of these type of structures has great advantages compared to the rigid and rigid permeable structures the structural porosity helps in dissipating a large amount of wave energy and the flexibility of the structure provides an additional feature of wave attenuation through structural characteristics guo et al 2020a mohapatra et al 2018 further this type of structure is cost efficient environmentally friendly reusable and rapidly deployable effective wave protection allowing the passage of currents preventing seawater pollution less dependent on water depth and protected from seismic shocks on the other hand the submerged horizontal flexible porous structure is one of the methods to reduce the hydroelastic response of floating structures that directly increases the safety and serviceability see cheng et al 2016a 2016b and other methods using different structural arrangements can be found see wang et al 2010 tavana and khanjani 2013 cheng et al 2015 therefore nowadays researchers are more interested in the use of submerged ﬂexible porous type structures with a flexible floating structure for designing floating or submerged flexible plate system applications to breakwaters wave energy absorption devices see zheng et al 2020 mohapatra and guedes soares 2020 and ocean space utilization in practice designing a floating and submerged flexible breakwater system with mooring lines is of great concern to the coastal and ocean engineering problems due to the possibility of structural failure due to waves and current during storm events hence for the design of reliable and economical breakwater the accurate analysis of hydroelastic characteristics and dynamic response of the floating and submerged flexible plate systems under the action of waves is of great importance in recent years valuable progress has been made in the study of flexible floating structure applications to wave energy conversion and also coastal protection based on numerical and experimental methodologies through hydroelastic analysis see michailides and angelides 2012 michailides et al 2013 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 a 3d experimental investigation was conducted to analyze the internal forces of the flexible connectors and tension on mooring lines of a flexible floating breakwater under the action of both regular and irregular waves as well as oblique incident waves loukogeorgaki et al 2014 later a multi optimization process for flexible floating structure waves was performed to investigate the capability for wave energy production and effective for coastal protection structures michailides and angelides 2015 on the other hand another exciting aspect of the submerged porous structures is the submerged flexible porous plate which acts as an effective wave energy absorption structure some of the previous related studies associated with the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients based on the analytical approach are discussed below liu et al 2007 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a new perforated wall breakwater consists of a perforated front wall a solid back wall and a submerged horizontal porous plate based on the matched eigenfunction method evans and peter 2011 presented an explicit expression for reflection coefficient under oblique wave incidence upon the semi infinite submerged porous plate in finite water depth fwd under the velocity decomposition method liu and li 2011 presented an alternate analytical solution for wave motion over submerged horizontal porous plate using the eigenfunction expansion method cho and kim 2013 investigated a submerged horizontal porous type breakwater based on the analytical solutions and compared it with experiments they found that the performance of the breakwater can be significantly enhanced by selecting optimal values of the porous effect parameter submergence depth and plate width all the above discussed studies have been carried out without considering the structural flexibility and edge condition at the structural boundaries as the mathematical modelling associated with the submerged flexible porous membrane is the limiting case of the tensioned beam porous plate it is worth summarizing some of the relevant previous studies related to the submerged flexible porous membrane based on two dimensional hydroelastic theory cho and kim 2000 investigated the interaction of oblique monochromatic incident waves with a horizontal submerged flexible porous membrane using an eigenfunction expansion method boundary element method bem and the numerical results were verified by model tests in 2d wave tank recently guo et al 2020a reviewed recent developments in the porous membrane and net type structures application to breakwaters and fish cages based on analytical numerical and experimental methodologies further guo et al 2020b 2020c developed two different models associated with a submerged horizontal flexible porous membrane over flat bottom and rubble mound to analyze the wave energy dissipation by the porous breakwater based on analytical methodology the above problems were investigated without involving either a flexible floating plate or a floating membrane in previous work mohapatra et al 2018 mohapatra and guedes soares 2020 the expansion formulae associated with wave interaction with a submerged flexible porous plate in two dimensions and oblique waves for different water depths were derived based on green s function technique and demonstrated real physical problems arising in ocean engineering however a horizontal flexible floating structure with a submerged flexible porous structure based on green s function technique and the utilization of expansion formulae in two dimensions have not been developed for the present proposed analytical model therefore the objective of this paper is to derive the expansion formulae associated with flexible horizontal floating and submerged porous plate based on green s function technique and applied the expansion formula to a real physical problem in two dimensions the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical model is formulated for the problem of wave interaction with flexible horizontal floating and submerged porous structure section 3 derives the expansion formulae based on green s function technique in finite water depth fwd and infinite water depth iwd section 4 is derived the velocity potentials of free motions in a closed basin and investigated the hydroelastic waves hyws characteristics by analyzing dispersion curves phase and group velocities and period of oscillation in ffm and sfm section 5 demonstrates the usefulness of the expansion formula derived in section 3 by analyzing a real physical problem of surface gravity wave interaction with a moored finite horizontal flexible floating plate and a moored finite submerged porous plate in fwd the important conclusions and future scope of the present study are presented in the final section in appendix a the shallow water equations of the referred problem are included for showing compatibility with the published results 2 mathematical formulation based on linear water wave theory and small amplitude structural response the mathematical formulation of the aforementioned problem is considered in a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system with x axis being in the horizontal direction and y axis being in the vertically downward positive direction an infinitely extended horizontal flexible plate flexible floating structure modelled as thin elastic plate theory is assumed to be floating at the free surface y 0 and another infinitely extended flexible porous plate the wave past porous submerged plate using generalized darcy s law is submerged at y h see fig 1 which are balanced by neutral buoyance hence the fluid domain is divided into two regions which are referred as the domain bounded by the flexible floating and submerged porous plate 0 y h x region 1 and the domain occupies h y h x in case of fwd and h y x in iwd region 2 assuming that the fluid is inviscid incompressible the flow is irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω there exist velocity potentials φ j x y t re φ j x y e i ω t where re being the real part with the subscripts j 1 2 correspond to the regions 1 and 2 respectively let the flexible floating plate and submerged flexible porous plate deflections are denoted by η 1 x t re η 10 x e i ω t and η 2 x t re η 20 x e i ω t respectively thus the spatial velocity potentials φ j x y t satisfy the two dimensional laplace equation 1 x y 2 φ j 0 for j 1 2 in the fluid domain where x y 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 the linearized kinematic condition on the flexible floating plate is given by 2 φ y y h η 1 t on y 0 the linearized kinematic condition on the submerged porous plate based on darcy s law is given by 3 φ y y h φ y y h η 2 t i σ φ 2 φ 1 where in h and denote below and above the flexible porous plate with porous effect parameter σ respectively φ 1 and φ 2 refer to the velocity potentials for the region 0 y h x and h y h x respectively the flexible floating plate and submerged flexible porous plate deflections η j for j 1 2 satisfy 4 e j i j 4 x 4 f c j x 2 x 2 m p j 2 t 2 η j p j y a p j 1 y a j 1 2 x where a 0 h and p j x y t is the linearized hydrodynamic pressure in the j th region 5 p j x y t ρ φ j t g y with p 0 x y t is the constant atmospheric pressure exerted on the flexible floating plate near the free surface substituting eq 5 into eq 4 and using eq 2 the linearized boundary condition on the flexible floating plate is obtained as 6 e 1 i 1 4 x 4 f c 1 x 2 x 2 m p 1 2 t 2 φ 1 y ρ 2 φ 1 t 2 g φ 1 y o n y 0 x eliminating η 2 from eqs 3 and 4 and using eq 5 the submerged porous plate condition on y h is derived as 7 e 2 i 2 4 x 4 f c 2 2 x 2 ρ p d 2 t 2 φ 2 y i σ φ 2 φ 1 ρ 2 φ 2 t 2 2 φ 1 t 2 now using eq 1 2 x 2 2 y 2 into eq 6 the linearized condition on the flexible floating plate in terms of spatial velocity potential φ 1 is obtained as 8 α 1 5 φ 1 y 5 β 1 3 φ 1 y 3 φ 1 y k φ 1 0 on y 0 for x in addition using eq 1 2 x 2 2 y 2 into eq 7 the linearized condition on the submerged flexible porous plate in terms of spatial velocity potentials φ 1 and φ 2 is derived as 9 α 2 5 y 5 β 2 3 y

assumed that f c j x f c j j 1 2 where f c 1 and f c 2 are the compressive forces acting on the flexible floating plate and submerged flexible porous plate respectively further the linearized kinematic condition 3 on the submerged flexible porous plate in terms of spatial velocity potential read as 10 φ y y h φ y y h i ω η 2 i σ φ 2 φ 1 the no flow conditions at the rigid bottom boundary are of the form 11a φ 2 y 0 at y h x in the case of fwd and 11b φ 2 φ 2 0 as y x in case of iwd in the context of the present problem two propagating wave modes will exist one is due to the presence of a floating plate at the free surface and the other is because of the submerged porous plate at the interface thus the far field radiation condition is assumed to take the form 12 φ x y n i i i a n ψ n y e i p n x as x in case of fwd n i i i b n f n y e i p n x as x in case of iwd where p n n i i i are the wave numbers of the flexural gravity waves in ffm and sfm respectively the detail of the vertical eigenfunctions ψ n y s and f n y s in eq 12 will be discussed in subsequent sections further a n s and b n s in eq 12 are the unknown wave amplitudes at far field in fwd and iwd respectively 3 expansion formulae based on green s function technique in fwd and iwd it may be mentioned that mohapatra et al 2018 derived the expansion formulae associated with a surface gravity wave interaction with a submerged flexible porous plate based on green s function technique in two dimensions in the context of the present section the expansion formulae associated with a surface gravity wave interaction with a horizontal flexible floating plate and a submerged porous plate based on green s function technique will be derived which is reported for the first time in the literature let g x y x 0 y 0 represents the green s function with x 0 y 0 being the source point of unity strength and x y being any point in the fluid domain thus g x y x 0 y 0 satisfies the two dimensional laplace equation 13 x y 2 g 0 in the fluid domain excluding at x 0 y 0 where x y 2 is being the same as in eq 1 along with the floating plate covered condition in eq 8 the submerged porous plate conditions 9 10 and the bottom boundary conditions 11a b further near the source point x 0 y 0 the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 satisfies the condition 14 g x y x 0 y 0 ln r as r 0 where r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 the green s function will be derived based on the position of the source point x 0 y 0 below and above the submerged flexible porous plate in fwd and iwd 3 1 green s function in fwd it is assumed that the position of source point x 0 y 0 in 0 y h the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 satisfying eq 13 and boundary condition 11a is expanded as 15 g x y x 0 y 0 ln r r 0 a p cosh p y b p sinh p y cos p x x 0

may be noted that s p 0 in eq 19 is the dispersion relation associated with wave interaction with horizontal flexible floating and submerged porous plate in fwd the dispersion relation 19 has infinitely many complex roots out of them two complex roots p n n 0 i are referred to as the wavenumbers associated with the most progressive waves in ffm and sfm whilst the four complex roots p n n i i v of the form a i b are referred to as the wavenumbers associated with the non propagating wave modes and the infinitely many complex roots p n n 1 2 3 which are close to the imaginary axis are referred to the evanescent wave modes further it may be noted that the nature of the roots of the dispersion relation is obtained using the principle of counting arguments as discussed in fox and squire 1990 under other assumption when the position of source point x 0 y 0 in h y h the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 can be expressed by satisfying eq 13 and bottom condition 11a as 20 g x y x 0 y

and the superscript dash in s p n indicates the partial derivative with respect to p n 3 2 green s function in iwd similarly in the case of iwd when the position of the source x 0 y 0 in 0 y h the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 can be expanded by satisfying eq 13 and bottom condition 11b as 23 g x y x 0 y 0 ln r r 0 a p cosh p y b p sinh p y cos p x x 0 d p 0 y h 0 c p e p y cos p x x 0 d p h y applying the floating plate covered condition 8 submerged porous plate conditions 9 10 and the integral identities 17 one can obtain the coefficients a p b p and c p in eq 23 as a p 2 α 1 p 4 β 1 p 2

with h furthermore when the source x 0 y 0 is in h y the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 satisfying eq 13 and the boundary condition 11b is expressed as 25 g x y x 0 y 0 0 a p cosh p y b p sinh p y cos

22 it may be noted that if α 1 0 and β 1 0 then the reduced expansion formulae in eqs 21 and 26 will be the same as in mohapatra et al 2018 4 characteristics of free oscillation hyws in ffm and sfm in a closed basin consider a closed basin of flexible floating plate at y 0 with a submerged porous plate at y h and the closed basin is bounded by vertical planes at x 0 x a 0 y h h y h in fwd see fig 2 in this case the spatial velocity potential φ x y satisfies the laplace equation 1 the floating plate covered condition 8 submerged flexible porous plate conditions 9 10 and along with bottom boundary condition 11a in addition near the vertical wall boundaries φ satisfies φ x 0 at x 0 for 0 y h and h y h thus the velocity potential associated with the free motion with a flexible floating and a submerged porous plate can be derived as 27 φ x y t n 1 cos n π x a q 0 i a n ψ q n p q n y e i ω n t q i i i i i b n ψ q n p q n y e i ω n t where the first summation refers to the waves in ffm with q 0 i and the second summation refers to the waves in sfm with q i i i i i it may be mentioned that hereafter the term depending on ρ p d ρ is neglected by assuming ρ p d ρ is negligible compared to the other terms as in mohapatra et al 2018 and hence the expression associated with the following eq 28 gives α j e j i j ρ g β j f c j ρ g and k ω 2 g now ψ q n q 0 i i i i i i is the vertical eigenfunction and p q n n π a satisfy the dispersion relation 28 k p q n α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 π n where π n k 1 tanh p q n h tanh p q n h h d p q n i σ 1 tanh p q n h tanh p q n h h tanh p q n h

dispersion relation 28 is quadratic in ω 2 which yields 29 ω n 2 s n s n 2 4 p n v n 1 2 2 p n where p n 1 tanh p q n h tanh p q n h h s n g p q n α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 tanh p q n h α 2 p q n 4 β

and sfm respectively from eq 30 the phase velocity and group velocity in ffm and sfm are found to be 31 c g α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 p q n 1 2 and c g α 2 p q n 4 β 2 p q n 2 1 2 i σ 2 p q n 1 2 32 c

oscillations in ffm and sfm are obtained as 33 t n 4 π g n a α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 1 2 34 t n 8 g n a 2 p q n α 2 p q n 2 β 2 1 2 i σ 1 2 next the behaviour of hyws in ffm and sfm will be investigated by analyzing several numerical results on dispersive curves phase velocity group velocity the effect of the porous effect parameter and period of oscillations for different parametric values fig 3 shows the effect of the first four modes of oscillations on dispersion curves of the free oscillation hyws ω n in ffm and ω n in sfm versus basin length a m with e 1 i 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 and period t 10 sec it is observed that the dispersion curve increases with an increase in modes of oscillation n however as the length of the basin increases the variations of oscillations become lessens which indicates that the mode of oscillations has an effect at the edges of the plate for a certain value of uniform compressive force these observations are similar as in mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 on the other hand the comparison of dispersive curves ω n in ffm and ω n in sfm shown that wave disperses faster in ffm than that of sfm fig 4 plots the effect of compressive force f c 1 f c 2 on dispersion curves ω n s 1 and ω n s 1 of the hyws in ffm and sfm versus basin length a m with e 1 i 1 0 4 10 9 nm 2 and period t 10 sec it is observed that the effect of compressive force on the middle part of the plate is significant on the dispersion curves whilst the effect is decreasing towards at the edges of the flexible plate at length 0 a this indicates that the compressive force changes the shape of the flexible floating plate and porous plate at the edges of the plate on the other hand the dispersion curve propagates in a negative direction at the buckling limit of the compressive force which observation is similar as in mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 it is also clear that ω n s 1 is higher than those of ω n s 1 for each value of compressive force fig 5 shows the comparison of phase velocity c ms 1 and group velocity c g ms 1 propagating in ffm versus basin length a m for e 1 i 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 e 2 i 2 0 47 10 7 nm 2 f c 1 1 5 e 1 i 1 ρ g and f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g it is observed that as the value of mode n increases both phase velocity and group velocity increase and the group velocity moves faster than that of phase velocity however this effect becomes reverse towards the edges of the plates fig 6 shows the comparison between the phase velocity c ms 1 and group velocity c g ms 1 in sfm versus basin length a m with e 1 i 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 e 2 i 2 0 47 10 6 nm 2 f c 1 1 5 e 1 i 1 ρ g and f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g in general from fig 6 it is observed that as the modes of oscillation n increases the phase and group velocity increase as in fig 4 in this case also the group velocity moves faster than that of phase velocity in sfm fig 7 depicts the effect of porous effect parameter on period of oscillation of hyws in sfm in a closed basin versus basin length with e 2 i 2 0 47 10 7 nm 2 f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g and n 1 it is observed that the period of oscillation increases with an increase in porous effect parameter in sfm and the values are becoming higher for a larger basin this may be due to the existence of both inertial and friction coefficients in the porous effect parameter a similar observation was made by mohapatra and guedes soares 2021 in the case of wave oscillation in a closed channel having a submerged porous plate fig 8 plots the comparisons of the period of oscillations t n and t n of hyws in ffm and sfm for different modes n

modes n and for higher modes the variations of the period of oscillations become closer on the other hand it is also seen that the period of oscillation t n in sfm decreases with an increase in the values of modes n from the comparisons it is clearly seen that the period of oscillation t n in sfm is higher than that of t n in ffm which is due to the fact that wave energy absorbed by the submerged porous plate that leads to higher oscillation fig 9 compares the period of oscillations t n and t n of hyws between ffm and sfm for different values of compressive force f c 1 f c 2 versus basin length a m for e 1 i 1 0 4 10 9 nm 2 and period t 10 sec as the compressive forces increase the period of oscillation t n of hyws in ffm increases whilst in sfm t n is decreasing in nature it is also found that the period of oscillation t n in ffm is higher than that of t n in sfm however the effect of compressive force becomes significant in the middle part of the flexible floating plate whilst there is no such effect in sfm 5 usefulness of the expansion formula in fwd in this section the usefulness of the expansion formula is illustrated by analyzing a real physical problem of

results and discussions to understand the effect of the moored porous plate on the moored flexible plate for different design parameters several numerical results on the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients are analyzed based on the analytical solutions associated with complex dispersion relation matlab codes are developed to compute the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients in the numerical results flexible floating plate and submerged flexible porous plates of same length 2a are considered and hereafter all computations are executed by considering water density ρ 1025 kgm 3 acceleration due to gravity g 9 8 ms 1 mooring stiffness k f k s 10 2 nm 1 young s modulus e 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 e 2 0 47 10 7 nm 2 compressive force on a floating plate f c 1 1 5 e 1 i 1 ρ g 1 2 and submerged porous plate f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g 1 2 and thickness d 1 d 2 d 0 1 m unless stated otherwise in the present computations matlab r2016b 64 bit win64 is used to perform calculations in a very quick way all numerical computations of the analytical expressions were performed in a desktop machine with intel core i7 4790 cpu with 3 60 ghz processor and 16 gb of ram 3601 mhz 4 core s and 8 logical processor s the data was written in an ssd disk and on average each case took roughly 3 5 min to finish the convergence of the analytical solution is checked by analyzing the values of k r and k e based on different design parameters with increasing the values of n table 1 shows that the values of k r and k t converged up to five decimal places to n 6 therefore for the correctness of the numerical computation n 6 is confined to the numerical results of the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients in fig 11 the effects of mooring stiffness k f on k r k t and k e with k s 10 2 nm 1 σ 1 0 5 i and h h 0 25 versus non dimensional wavelength λ a are plotted it is observed that the reflection coefficients to be higher for higher mooring stiffness whilst the transmission and the dissipation coefficients become lessens this may be because with an increase in mooring stiffness of the floating structure becomes stiffer with a certain value of mooring stiffness in the submerged porous plate that leads to higher reflection further the number of crests in k r k t and k e decrease for larger wavelength which is due to the change of phase between interaction of two propagating wave modes this suggests that the hydroelastic response or the vibration of the flexible floating plate decreases with an increase in mooring stiffness k f it may also be noted that the stability of the flexible floating plate increases with an increase in mooring stiffness similar observations were obtained in the case of a moored flexible floating plate as in mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 in fig 12 the effects of submergence depth h h on k r k t and k e versus non dimensional wavelength λ a with σ 1 0 5 i are plotted it is observed that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in submergence depth h h which is due to the presence of moored floating and submerged flexible porous plate with a certain mooring stiffness on the other hand the transmission and the dissipation coefficients decrease as the mooring stiffness increases however there is not much significant effect on the variations of transmission coefficients for different h h moreover this is because as the submerged porous plate away from the floating plate the energy dissipation becomes less as a result the reflection coefficient becomes higher than those of wave dissipation and transmission it may be mentioned that the reduction of the vibration of the flexible floating plate depends also on a suitable position of the submerged horizontal flexible porous plate fig 13 presents the effect of compressive force f c 1 on k r k t and k e versus λ a with σ 1 0 5 i and h h 0 25 it is observed that with an increase in the values of compressive force f c 1 on the flexible floating plate the reflection coefficient k r increases whilst the dissipation and the transmission coefficients decrease this concludes that the horizontal flexible floating structure becomes stiffer which leads to the lower transmission and dissipation absorption of wave energy by the submerged flexible porous plate with certain values of mooring stiffness in fig 14 the effect of porous effect parameter σ on k r k t and k e versus λ a are plotted with h h 0 25 it is observed that the reflection coefficient k r decreases with an increase in porous effect parameter whilst the transmission coefficient k t and the dissipation coefficient k e increase this is because as the pores in the submerged flexible plate increase the wave energy absorption increases which lead to less reflection higher dissipation and transmission 6 conclusions the expansion formulae associated with surface wave interaction with a flexible horizontal floating and a submerged porous plate based on green s function technique in fwd and iwd are derived in two dimensions the hydroelastic wave characteristics in ffm and sfm in a closed basin are analyzed for different design parameters further the usefulness of the expansion formula is demonstrated by analyzing a real physical problem of surface wave interaction with a moored finite horizontal flexible floating and a moored submerged porous plate in fwd in numerical results the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients for different design parameters are analyzed to study the hydroelastic response of the flexible floating and submerged porous plate system in appendix a the linearized long wave equations are derived and results are compared the important contributions and results can be summarized as follows 1 the expansion formulae of the referred problem based on green s function technique are derived here in fwd and iwd are communicated for the first time in the literature 2 for a longer wave basin and a certain value of compressive force the modes of oscillation of hyws change the edges of the plate the compressive force has a significant effect at the middle part of the floating and submerged porous plate for dispersion curves whilst no such effect in sfm in the case of the period of oscillation further the period of oscillation becomes higher for higher porosity due to the presence of inertial and friction coefficients in sfm 3 for higher modes the period of oscillations of hyws versus basin length decrease whilst the phase and group velocities increase in ffm and sfm however the group velocity moves faster than those of phase velocity in ffm and sfm 4 it was also found that for different compressive forces the period of oscillations and dispersion curves in ffm is higher than that in sfm 5 for numerical correctness and convergence of the series solution the computation n 6 is confined 6 it was also seen that the reflection coefficients are to be higher for higher mooring stiffness than those of the transmission and the dissipation coefficients which indicated that the hydroelastic response or the vibration of the flexible floating plate decreases with an increase in mooring stiffness 7 in general the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients are oscillatory in nature the transmission coefficient values are the least among the reflection and the dissipation coefficients that is k t k e k r as a result the present formulation can be generalized to a three dimensional hydroelastic problem with a real physical problem in three dimensions further a two mode type wave energy converter will be developed over the analytical and numerical methodologies over the classical

20320,an analytical study associated with surface gravity wave interaction with a horizontal flexible floating and a submerged porous plate is presented under linearized water wave theory and small amplitude structural response the expansion formulae of the referred problem based on green s function technique is derived using the two dimensional laplace equation and fundamental solution of source potentials in finite and infinite water depths the velocity potential for the free oscillations in a closed basin is derived and the hydroelastic wave characteristics in floating and submerged flexural modes are analyzed in specific cases further the usefulness of the expansion formula is demonstrated by analyzing a real physical problem of wave interaction with a moored flexible floating plate and a moored submerged flexible porous plate of finite dimensions in finite water depth the convergence of the present solution is checked and the effect of a moored finite submerged porous plate on the moored finite flexible floating plate with different design parameters are analyzed it is observed that the present analysis may be helpful for better understanding in designing a floating and submerged flexible porous plate system for application as a breakwater keywords flexible structures green s function expansion formulae hydroelastic waves mooring lines 1 introduction in the islands and the countries that have long coastlines with high population and urban development a flexible plate type system of horizontal floating with submerged porous structures may be a viable alternative to a single floating or submerged structure the use of these type of structures has great advantages compared to the rigid and rigid permeable structures the structural porosity helps in dissipating a large amount of wave energy and the flexibility of the structure provides an additional feature of wave attenuation through structural characteristics guo et al 2020a mohapatra et al 2018 further this type of structure is cost efficient environmentally friendly reusable and rapidly deployable effective wave protection allowing the passage of currents preventing seawater pollution less dependent on water depth and protected from seismic shocks on the other hand the submerged horizontal flexible porous structure is one of the methods to reduce the hydroelastic response of floating structures that directly increases the safety and serviceability see cheng et al 2016a 2016b and other methods using different structural arrangements can be found see wang et al 2010 tavana and khanjani 2013 cheng et al 2015 therefore nowadays researchers are more interested in the use of submerged ﬂexible porous type structures with a flexible floating structure for designing floating or submerged flexible plate system applications to breakwaters wave energy absorption devices see zheng et al 2020 mohapatra and guedes soares 2020 and ocean space utilization in practice designing a floating and submerged flexible breakwater system with mooring lines is of great concern to the coastal and ocean engineering problems due to the possibility of structural failure due to waves and current during storm events hence for the design of reliable and economical breakwater the accurate analysis of hydroelastic characteristics and dynamic response of the floating and submerged flexible plate systems under the action of waves is of great importance in recent years valuable progress has been made in the study of flexible floating structure applications to wave energy conversion and also coastal protection based on numerical and experimental methodologies through hydroelastic analysis see michailides and angelides 2012 michailides et al 2013 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 a 3d experimental investigation was conducted to analyze the internal forces of the flexible connectors and tension on mooring lines of a flexible floating breakwater under the action of both regular and irregular waves as well as oblique incident waves loukogeorgaki et al 2014 later a multi optimization process for flexible floating structure waves was performed to investigate the capability for wave energy production and effective for coastal protection structures michailides and angelides 2015 on the other hand another exciting aspect of the submerged porous structures is the submerged flexible porous plate which acts as an effective wave energy absorption structure some of the previous related studies associated with the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients based on the analytical approach are discussed below liu et al 2007 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a new perforated wall breakwater consists of a perforated front wall a solid back wall and a submerged horizontal porous plate based on the matched eigenfunction method evans and peter 2011 presented an explicit expression for reflection coefficient under oblique wave incidence upon the semi infinite submerged porous plate in finite water depth fwd under the velocity decomposition method liu and li 2011 presented an alternate analytical solution for wave motion over submerged horizontal porous plate using the eigenfunction expansion method cho and kim 2013 investigated a submerged horizontal porous type breakwater based on the analytical solutions and compared it with experiments they found that the performance of the breakwater can be significantly enhanced by selecting optimal values of the porous effect parameter submergence depth and plate width all the above discussed studies have been carried out without considering the structural flexibility and edge condition at the structural boundaries as the mathematical modelling associated with the submerged flexible porous membrane is the limiting case of the tensioned beam porous plate it is worth summarizing some of the relevant previous studies related to the submerged flexible porous membrane based on two dimensional hydroelastic theory cho and kim 2000 investigated the interaction of oblique monochromatic incident waves with a horizontal submerged flexible porous membrane using an eigenfunction expansion method boundary element method bem and the numerical results were verified by model tests in 2d wave tank recently guo et al 2020a reviewed recent developments in the porous membrane and net type structures application to breakwaters and fish cages based on analytical numerical and experimental methodologies further guo et al 2020b 2020c developed two different models associated with a submerged horizontal flexible porous membrane over flat bottom and rubble mound to analyze the wave energy dissipation by the porous breakwater based on analytical methodology the above problems were investigated without involving either a flexible floating plate or a floating membrane in previous work mohapatra et al 2018 mohapatra and guedes soares 2020 the expansion formulae associated with wave interaction with a submerged flexible porous plate in two dimensions and oblique waves for different water depths were derived based on green s function technique and demonstrated real physical problems arising in ocean engineering however a horizontal flexible floating structure with a submerged flexible porous structure based on green s function technique and the utilization of expansion formulae in two dimensions have not been developed for the present proposed analytical model therefore the objective of this paper is to derive the expansion formulae associated with flexible horizontal floating and submerged porous plate based on green s function technique and applied the expansion formula to a real physical problem in two dimensions the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical model is formulated for the problem of wave interaction with flexible horizontal floating and submerged porous structure section 3 derives the expansion formulae based on green s function technique in finite water depth fwd and infinite water depth iwd section 4 is derived the velocity potentials of free motions in a closed basin and investigated the hydroelastic waves hyws characteristics by analyzing dispersion curves phase and group velocities and period of oscillation in ffm and sfm section 5 demonstrates the usefulness of the expansion formula derived in section 3 by analyzing a real physical problem of surface gravity wave interaction with a moored finite horizontal flexible floating plate and a moored finite submerged porous plate in fwd the important conclusions and future scope of the present study are presented in the final section in appendix a the shallow water equations of the referred problem are included for showing compatibility with the published results 2 mathematical formulation based on linear water wave theory and small amplitude structural response the mathematical formulation of the aforementioned problem is considered in a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system with x axis being in the horizontal direction and y axis being in the vertically downward positive direction an infinitely extended horizontal flexible

are of the form 11a φ 2 y 0 at y h x in the case of fwd and 11b φ 2 φ 2 0 as y x in case of iwd in the context of the present problem two propagating wave modes will exist one is due to the presence of a floating plate at the free surface and the other is because of the submerged porous plate at the interface thus the far field radiation condition is assumed to take the form 12 φ x y n i i i a n ψ n y e i p n x as x in case of fwd n i i i b n f n y e i p n x as x in case of iwd where p n n i i i are the wave numbers of the flexural gravity waves in ffm and sfm respectively the detail of the vertical eigenfunctions ψ n y s and f n y s in eq 12 will be discussed in subsequent sections further a n s and b n s in eq 12 are the unknown wave amplitudes at far field in fwd and iwd respectively 3 expansion formulae based on green s function technique in fwd and iwd it may be mentioned that mohapatra et al 2018 derived the expansion formulae associated with a surface gravity wave interaction with a submerged flexible porous plate based on green s function technique in two dimensions in the context of the present section the expansion formulae associated with a surface gravity wave interaction with a horizontal flexible floating plate and a submerged porous plate based on green s function technique will be derived which is reported for the first time in the literature let g x y x 0 y 0 represents the green s function with x 0 y 0 being the source point of unity strength and x y being any point in the fluid domain thus g x y x 0 y 0 satisfies the two dimensional laplace equation 13 x y 2 g 0 in the fluid domain excluding at x 0 y 0 where x y 2 is being the same as in eq 1 along with the floating plate covered condition in eq 8 the submerged porous plate conditions 9 10 and the bottom boundary conditions 11a b further near the source point x 0 y 0 the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 satisfies the condition 14 g x y x 0 y 0 ln r as r 0 where r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 the green s function will be derived based on the position of the source point x 0 y 0 below and above the submerged flexible porous plate in fwd and iwd 3 1 green s function in fwd it is assumed that the position of source point x 0 y 0 in 0 y h the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 satisfying eq 13 and boundary condition 11a is expanded as 15 g x y x 0 y 0 ln r r 0 a p cosh p y b p sinh p y cos p x x 0

may be noted that s p 0 in eq 19 is the dispersion relation associated with wave interaction with horizontal flexible floating and submerged porous plate in fwd the dispersion relation 19 has infinitely many complex roots out of them two complex roots p n n 0 i are referred to as the wavenumbers associated with the most progressive waves in ffm and sfm whilst the four complex roots p n n i i v of the form a i b are referred to as the wavenumbers associated with the non propagating wave modes and the infinitely many complex roots p n n 1 2 3 which are close to the imaginary axis are referred to the evanescent wave modes further it may be noted that the nature of the roots of the dispersion relation is obtained using the principle of counting arguments as discussed in fox and squire 1990 under other assumption when the position of source point x 0 y 0 in h y h the green s function g x y x 0 y 0 can be expressed by satisfying eq 13 and bottom condition 11a as 20 g x y x 0 y

a closed basin consider a closed basin of flexible floating plate at y 0 with a submerged porous plate at y h and the closed basin is bounded by vertical planes at x 0 x a 0 y h h y h in fwd see fig 2 in this case the spatial velocity potential φ x y satisfies the laplace equation 1 the floating plate covered condition 8 submerged flexible porous plate conditions 9 10 and along with bottom boundary condition 11a in addition near the vertical wall boundaries φ satisfies φ x 0 at x 0 for 0 y h and h y h thus the velocity potential associated with the free motion with a flexible floating and a submerged porous plate can be derived as 27 φ x y t n 1 cos n π x a q 0 i a n ψ q n p q n y e i ω n t q i i i i i b n ψ q n p q n y e i ω n t where the first summation refers to the waves in ffm with q 0 i and the second summation refers to the waves in sfm with q i i i i i it may be mentioned that hereafter the term depending on ρ p d ρ is neglected by assuming ρ p d ρ is negligible compared to the other terms as in mohapatra et al 2018 and hence the expression associated with the following eq 28 gives α j e j i j ρ g β j f c j ρ g and k ω 2 g now ψ q n q 0 i i i i i i is the vertical eigenfunction and p q n n π a satisfy the dispersion relation 28 k p q n α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 π n where π n k 1 tanh p q n h tanh p q n h h d p q n i σ 1 tanh p q n h tanh p q n h h tanh p q n h

dispersion relation 28 is quadratic in ω 2 which yields 29 ω n 2 s n s n 2 4 p n v n 1 2 2 p n where p n 1 tanh p q n h tanh p q n h h s n g p q n α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 tanh p q n h α 2 p q n 4 β

and sfm respectively from eq 30 the phase velocity and group velocity in ffm and sfm are found to be 31 c g α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 p q n 1 2 and c g α 2 p q n 4 β 2 p q n 2 1 2 i σ 2 p q n 1 2 32 c

oscillations in ffm and sfm are obtained as 33 t n 4 π g n a α 1 p q n 4 β 1 p q n 2 1 1 2 34 t n 8 g n a 2 p q n α 2 p q n 2 β 2 1 2 i σ 1 2 next the behaviour of hyws in ffm and sfm will be investigated by analyzing several numerical results on dispersive curves phase velocity group velocity the effect of the porous effect parameter and period of oscillations for different parametric values fig 3 shows the effect of the first four modes of oscillations on dispersion curves of the free oscillation hyws ω n in ffm and ω n in sfm versus basin length a m with e 1 i 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 and period t 10 sec it is observed that the dispersion curve increases with an increase in modes of oscillation n however as the length of the basin increases the variations of oscillations become lessens which indicates that the mode of oscillations has an effect at the edges of the plate for a certain value of uniform compressive force these observations are similar as in mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 on the other hand the comparison of dispersive curves ω n in ffm and ω n in sfm shown that wave disperses faster in ffm than that of sfm fig 4 plots the effect of compressive force f c 1 f c 2 on dispersion curves ω n s 1 and ω n s 1 of the hyws in ffm and sfm versus basin length a m with e 1 i 1 0 4 10 9 nm 2 and period t 10 sec it is observed that the effect of compressive force on the middle part of the plate is significant on the dispersion curves whilst the effect is decreasing towards at the edges of the flexible plate at length 0 a this indicates that the compressive force changes the shape of the flexible floating plate and porous plate at the edges of the plate on the other hand the dispersion curve propagates in a negative direction at the buckling limit of the compressive force which observation is similar as in mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 it is also clear that ω n s 1 is higher than those of ω n s 1 for each value of compressive force fig 5 shows the comparison of phase velocity c ms 1 and group velocity c g ms 1 propagating in ffm versus basin length a m for e 1 i 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 e 2 i 2 0 47 10 7 nm 2 f c 1 1 5 e 1 i 1 ρ g and f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g it is observed that as the value of mode n increases both phase velocity and group velocity increase and the group velocity moves faster than that of phase velocity however this effect becomes reverse towards the edges of the plates fig 6 shows the comparison between the phase velocity c ms 1 and group velocity c g ms 1 in sfm versus basin length a m with e 1 i 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 e 2 i 2 0 47 10 6 nm 2 f c 1 1 5 e 1 i 1 ρ g and f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g in general from fig 6 it is observed that as the modes of oscillation n increases the phase and group velocity increase as in fig 4 in this case also the group velocity moves faster than that of phase velocity in sfm fig 7 depicts the effect of porous effect parameter on period of oscillation of hyws in sfm in a closed basin versus basin length with e 2 i 2 0 47 10 7 nm 2 f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g and n 1 it is observed that the period of oscillation increases with an increase in porous effect parameter in sfm and the values are becoming higher for a larger basin this may be due to the existence of both inertial and friction coefficients in the porous effect parameter a similar observation was made by mohapatra and guedes soares 2021 in the case of wave oscillation in a closed channel having a submerged porous plate fig 8 plots the comparisons of the period of oscillations t n and t n of hyws in ffm and sfm for different modes n with e 1 i 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 e 2 i 2 0 47 10 7 nm 2 f c 1 1 5 e 1 i 1 ρ g and f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g versus basin length a m it is observed that the period of oscillation decreases with an increase in modes n and for higher modes the variations of the period of oscillations become closer on the other hand it is also seen that the period of oscillation t n in sfm decreases with an increase in the values of modes n from the comparisons it is clearly seen that the period of oscillation t n in sfm is higher than that of t n in ffm which is due to the fact that wave energy absorbed by the submerged porous plate that leads to higher oscillation fig 9 compares the period of oscillations t n and t n of hyws between ffm and sfm for different values of compressive force f c 1 f c 2 versus basin length a m for e 1 i 1 0 4 10 9 nm 2 and period t 10 sec as the compressive forces increase the period of oscillation t n of hyws in ffm increases whilst in sfm t n is decreasing in nature it is also found that the period of oscillation t n in ffm is higher than that of t n in sfm however the effect of compressive force becomes significant in the middle part of the flexible floating plate whilst there is no such effect in sfm 5 usefulness of the expansion formula in fwd in this section the usefulness of the expansion formula is illustrated by analyzing a real physical problem of surface gravity wave interaction with a moored flexible floating and a moored submerged porous plate of finite dimensions in fwd based on velocity decompositions in numerical results the dynamic

submerged porous plate is kept below the floating plate at y h are considered to be of length 2a occupies the region a x a the horizontal flexible floating plate and submerged porous plate ends are connected by mooring lines with stiffness k fj and k sj at x a for j 1 2 respectively with y h being the bottom bed see fig 10 thus the fluid domain is split into two sub regions r 1 x a a x 0 y h r 2

k 0 x cosh k 0 h y cosh k 0 h as x where k 0 satisfies the surface gravity wave dispersion relation ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h further i 0 r 0 and t 0 are the amplitudes associated with the incident the reflected and the transmitted waves respectively 5 2 solution using eemm under velocity decompositions to find the solution to the referred physical problem the original problem is split into two simpler problems in the semi infinite domain along the x axis so we only consider the semi infinite domain x 0 as the solution can be extended into x 0 using symmetric relations the reduced potentials θ x y and τ x y can be written as 44 θ x y φ s x y φ a x y a n d τ x y φ s x y φ a x y where φ s x y and φ a x y are represented to the symmetric and anti symmetric potentials respectively the reduced

i 0 and t 0 d 0 d 0 2 i 0 finally the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients can be computed by using the formula k r r 0 k t t 0 and k e 1 k r k t respectively 5 4 numerical results and discussions to understand the effect of the moored porous plate on the moored flexible plate for different design parameters several numerical results on the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients are analyzed based on the analytical solutions associated with complex dispersion relation matlab codes are developed to compute the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients in the numerical results flexible floating plate and submerged flexible porous plates of same length 2a are considered and hereafter all computations are executed by considering water density ρ 1025 kgm 3 acceleration due to gravity g 9 8 ms 1 mooring stiffness k f k s 10 2 nm 1 young s modulus e 1 0 47 10 9 nm 2 e 2 0 47 10 7 nm 2 compressive force on a floating plate f c 1 1 5 e 1 i 1 ρ g 1 2 and submerged porous plate f c 2 0 5 e 2 i 2 ρ g 1 2 and thickness d 1 d 2 d 0 1 m unless stated otherwise in the present computations matlab r2016b 64 bit win64 is used to perform calculations in a very quick way all numerical computations of the analytical expressions were performed in a desktop machine with intel core i7 4790 cpu with 3 60 ghz processor and 16 gb of ram 3601 mhz 4 core s and 8 logical processor s the data was written in an ssd disk and on average each case took roughly 3 5 min to finish the convergence of the analytical solution is checked by analyzing the values of k r and k e based on different design parameters with increasing the values of n table 1 shows that the values of k r and k t converged up to five decimal places to n 6 therefore for the correctness of the numerical computation n 6 is confined to the numerical results of the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients in fig 11 the effects of mooring stiffness k f on k r k t and k e with k s 10 2 nm 1 σ 1 0 5 i and h h 0 25 versus non dimensional wavelength λ a are plotted it is observed that the reflection coefficients to be higher for higher mooring stiffness whilst the transmission and the dissipation coefficients become lessens this may be because with an increase in mooring stiffness of the floating structure becomes stiffer with a certain value of mooring stiffness in the submerged porous plate that leads to higher reflection further the number of crests in k r k t and k e decrease for larger wavelength which is due to the change of phase between interaction of two propagating wave modes this suggests that the hydroelastic response or the vibration of the flexible floating plate decreases with an increase in mooring stiffness k f it may also be noted that the stability of the flexible floating plate increases with an increase in mooring stiffness similar observations were obtained in the case of a moored flexible floating plate as in mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 in fig 12 the effects of submergence depth h h on k r k t and k e versus non dimensional wavelength λ a with σ 1 0 5 i are plotted it is observed that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in submergence depth h h which is due to the presence of moored floating and submerged flexible porous plate with a certain mooring stiffness on the other hand the transmission and the dissipation coefficients decrease as the mooring stiffness increases however there is not much significant effect on the variations of transmission coefficients for different h h moreover this is because as the submerged porous plate away from the floating plate the energy dissipation becomes less as a result the reflection coefficient becomes higher than those of wave dissipation and transmission it may be mentioned that the reduction of the vibration of the flexible floating plate depends also on a suitable position of the submerged horizontal flexible porous plate fig 13 presents the effect of compressive force f c 1 on k r k t and k e versus λ a with σ 1 0 5 i and h h 0 25 it is observed that with an increase in the values of compressive force f c 1 on the flexible floating plate the reflection coefficient k r increases whilst the dissipation and the transmission coefficients decrease this concludes that the horizontal flexible floating structure becomes stiffer which leads to the lower transmission and dissipation absorption of wave energy by the submerged flexible porous plate with certain values of mooring stiffness in fig 14 the effect of porous effect parameter σ on k r k t and k e versus λ a are plotted with h h 0 25 it is observed that the reflection coefficient k r decreases with an increase in porous effect parameter whilst the transmission coefficient k t and the dissipation coefficient k e increase this is because as the pores in the submerged flexible plate increase the wave energy absorption increases which lead to less reflection higher dissipation and transmission 6 conclusions the expansion formulae associated with surface wave interaction with a flexible horizontal floating and a submerged porous plate based on green s function technique in fwd and iwd are derived in two dimensions the hydroelastic wave characteristics in ffm and sfm in a closed basin are analyzed for different design parameters further the usefulness of the expansion formula is demonstrated by analyzing a real physical problem of surface wave interaction with a moored finite horizontal flexible floating and a moored submerged porous plate in fwd in numerical results the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients for different design parameters are analyzed to study the hydroelastic response of the flexible floating and submerged porous plate system in appendix a the linearized long wave equations are derived and results are compared the important contributions and results can be summarized as follows 1 the expansion formulae of the referred problem based on green s function technique are derived here in fwd and iwd are communicated for the first time in the literature 2 for a longer wave basin and a certain value of compressive force the modes of oscillation of hyws change the edges of the plate the compressive force has a significant effect at the middle part of the floating and submerged porous plate for dispersion curves whilst no such effect in sfm in the case of the period of oscillation further the period of oscillation becomes higher for higher porosity due to the presence of inertial and friction coefficients in sfm 3 for higher modes the period of oscillations of hyws versus basin length decrease whilst the phase and group velocities increase in ffm and sfm however the group velocity moves faster than those of phase velocity in ffm and sfm 4 it was also found that for different compressive forces the period of oscillations and dispersion curves in ffm is higher than that in sfm 5 for numerical correctness and convergence of the series solution the computation n 6 is confined 6 it was also seen that the reflection coefficients are to be higher for higher mooring stiffness than those of the transmission and the dissipation coefficients which indicated that the hydroelastic response or the vibration of the flexible floating plate decreases with an increase in mooring stiffness 7 in general the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients are oscillatory in nature the transmission coefficient values are the least among the reflection and the dissipation coefficients that is k t k e k r as a result the present formulation can be generalized to a three dimensional hydroelastic problem with a real physical problem in three dimensions further a two mode type wave energy converter will be developed over the analytical and numerical methodologies over the classical

20321,this paper investigates a performance guaranteed formation tracking problem of autonomous surface vehicles asvs under uncertain environments especially model uncertainties external disturbances and actuator faults exist simultaneously based on graph theory and adaptive techniques a novel two layer robust adaptive fault tolerant formation scheme is developed in kinematic layer a transformation is made to get a performance unconstrained problem and an adaptive control strategy is incorporated to stabilize transformed errors in kinetic layer two types of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers i e the fault based one and the fault unknown one are designed for different fault scenarios these controllers share the same structure of single parameter updating laws to adjust adaptive parameters it is shown that 1 using the proposed formation scheme with either designed fault tolerant controller desired formation configurations of asvs are achieved if the interaction topology is connected and control parameters satisfy given conditions 2 prescribed formation tracking performance can be ensured and all error signals are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded 3 a trade off between two designed controllers exists that is although the assumption for fault unknown controller is weaker larger control parameters are required to behave like fault based one simulations and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results keywords formation adaptive fault tolerant guaranteed performance surface vehicles 1 introduction due to greater coverage and efficiency the cooperation of asvs is preferred in more and more maritime tasks such as cable laying zhang et al 2020b marine search fu and yu 2018 and so on as a typical way of cooperation the formation control of asvs focuses on steering a group of asvs to desired formation configurations and has received extensive attention from both theoretical and engineering communities see peng et al 2020 and the references therein aiming at reducing communication costs and improving fault tolerance position only interaction is used in the recent research of asv formation peng et al 2013 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a liang et al 2020 where each asv merely transmits its positions to neighbors and realizes the formation by interactive positions and its own velocities such kind of formation control for the asvs is still faced with several challenging issues two of which are addressed in this paper one issue is on the formation performance constraints in certain practical scenarios of asv cooperation the overshoot or the convergence rate of formation tracking errors is strictly constrained and the steady state formation tracking errors are required to be determined precisely to obtain the guaranteed formation performance some good results have arisen in dai et al 2017 li et al 2017 and he et al 2019 where the tracking errors are calculated from a global reference signal and limited within prescribed performance functions in distributed formation control each asv operates solely with its neighboring feedback and not all asvs have access to the leader asv this means that formation tracking errors with respect to the reference trajectory are only available to a few asvs and above results cannot be directly applied to deal with this issue a novel robust distributed controller that achieves arbitrarily fast and accurate synchronization of the following agents with the leader is proposed in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2016 the idea of which is successfully applied to the synchronization of multiple 3 dof helicopters yang et al 2018 however these works require both position and velocity interaction for the scenario where only neighboring positions are attainable suitable velocity estimation or compensation mechanism is needed to ensure desired formation performance in general distributed guaranteed performance requirements and position only interaction limits make formation control of asvs intractable the other issue is about the actuator failure constraints when suppressing model uncertainties and external disturbances for asvs the actuator failure will occur during the formation since a propeller is entangled by foreign matters or a steering gear shakes its rudder and the actuator faults of a certain asv can spread to its neighbors such that primal formation performance of asvs is degraded to improve the fault tolerance some effective results have been presented to cope with additive faults li and kumar 2011 chen and song 2014 multiplicative faults khalili et al 2018 deng and yang 2019 their combinations deng et al 2020 hua et al 2017 li and yang 2015 wang et al 2019 where most of these works consider linear systems or nonlinear systems with linear couplings as for asvs their states are nonlinearly strongly coupled and dynamics are under uncertainties existing approximation based robust formation methods in peng et al 2013 shojaei 2015 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018 and liang et al 2020 i e neural networks etc require the states of asvs to remain within a compact set but actuator faults may drive system states to exceed such limitation leading to the degradation or even ineffectuality of these formation methods here a main challenge lies in that the fault tolerant performance should be considered along with existing robust requirements therefore it is necessary but still challenging to explore fault tolerant formation control approaches for asvs with uncertainties and disturbances motivated by the above discussions we investigate a distributed formation tracking problem of asvs with guaranteed performance and actuator faults model uncertainties and external disturbances are also considered a novel two layer robust adaptive fault tolerant formation scheme is designed in kinematic layer the performance constrained formation tracking is transformed into an unconstrained one then an adaptive control strategy is proposed to stabilize the transformed errors and avoid the effect induced by prescribed performance constraints in kinematic layer a robust adaptive fault based formation controller is derived which relies on prior fault diagnosis or prognosis then a general fault unknown formation controller is constructed to avoid the dependence on fault information main contributions of this paper are threefold 1 a novel formation tracking scheme for asvs is designed unlike the work in dai et al 2017 li et al 2017 and he et al 2019 the designed scheme incorporates an adaptive control strategy to guarantee the prescribed formation performance via a distributed manner and can merge different robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers 2 two kinds of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers i e the fault based one and the fault unknown one are presented for different actuator faults scenarios their control parameter selection conditions are derived and a trade off relationship between them is observed compared with existing literature deng et al 2020 hua et al 2017 3 a general structure of single parameter adaptive updating laws is given for two fault tolerant controllers to adjust adaptive parameters different from refs li and yang 2015 and wang et al 2019 this structure can obtain the robustness against uncertainties disturbances together with actuator faults with less computation the rest of this paper is summarized as below in section 2 the problem is formulated then the formation scheme is designed in section 3 related results and analysis are also included simulations and comparisons are provided in section 4 section 5 concludes the paper key notations in the paper are outlined as follows r n is a space of real numbers with dimension n for x x 1 x n t x x 1 x n t x is l 2 norm of x tanh x tanh x 1 tanh x n t diag λ i is a diagonal matrix with the i th diagonal element or block λ i λ min max is a minimum maximum eigenvalue 2 problem formulation the interaction topology of n asvs is modeled by a graph g v e where v 1 n is the vertex set and e v v is the edge set an asv labeled by i is viewed as a vertex i and a communication link from asv i to asv j is viewed as an edge e i j i j the neighbor set of vertex i is denoted as n i j j i e in graph g a path from i to j is a sequence of vertices and edges given by i e i j 1 j 1 e j k 1 j k j k j if there is a path from i to j vertices i and j are connected graph g is connected if any two vertices in g are connected undirected graph is a graph with all edges bidirectional i e e i j e j i for graph g the adjacency matrix is denoted by a a i j n n where a i j is an entry at i th row and j th column of a if there is an edge e j i a i j 1 otherwise a i j 0 the laplacian matrix of graph g is denoted by l l i j n n where l i j is an entry at i th row and j th column of l if i j l i j k 1 n a i k otherwise l i j a i j if an undirected graph g is connected its laplacian matrix l is positive semi definite with a simple eigenvalue 0 the dynamics of the i th i v asv are given as lu et al

τ w v i τ w r i t denotes forces and moments induced by environmental disturbances vector τ i f τ u i f τ v i f τ r i f t symbolizes actuators inputs which are subject to the potential faults in order to fully capture the impact of faults on the efficiency and accuracy of actuators actuator faults in affine form with time varying coefficients are considered namely 2 τ ξ i f t ξ u v r μ ξ i t τ ξ i

are difficult to be accurately obtained and all of them together with g i are treated as model uncertainties this paper devotes to proposing robust schemes where real values of m i c i d i g i and τ wi will not be used in the controller design remark 2 actuators of an asv include propellers and rudders when a propeller is entangled by foreign matters or a steering gear shakes its rudder actuator faults are induced the faults can not only affect the actuation efficiency but also decrease the actuation precision as discussed in deng et al 2020 hua et al 2017 and li and yang 2015 the combination of multiplicative and additive faults can effectively model such influence thus it is adopted for asvs here in 2 μ ξ i t describes the actuation effectiveness and ϕ ξ i t represents unexpected bias value note that μ ξ i t 1 and ϕ ξ i t 0 imply the i th asv is free of actuator faults in channel ξ a time varying reference trajectory η r t r 3 is used to guide n asvs note that η r t is available only to a small number of asvs and this availability is described by a matrix d diag d 1 d n where d i 1 if the i th asv can obtain η r and d i 0 otherwise the formation tracking problem of asvs with guaranteed performance and actuator faults is formulated below problem 1 there are n asvs communicating via an undirected graph g model parameters of them are unknown and they suffer from external disturbances as described in 1 their control inputs are subject to actuator faults in 2 design a control law τ i i v τ u i τ v i τ r i t for each asv that relies on its states η i ν i and position vectors of its neighbors η j j n i such that 1 a predefined formation configuration δ i r 3 can be achieved with bounded errors i e there exists a small positive constant ɛ 0 η i t δ i η r t ɛ 0 i v 2 the neighborhood tracking error η ei a t of each asv remains within a prescribed bound ρ η i t i e η ei a t n ρ η i t i v where η ei a t x e i a t y e i a t ψ e i a t t has a form as η ei a j n i a i

parameters satisfying l ζ i 0 ρ ζ i 0 and ρ ζ i 0 ρ ζ i 0 ζ e i a 0 respectively remark 3 the main features of the above problem are that 1 only position rather than velocity vectors of neighboring asvs are interacted during the formation 2 the guaranteed performance is evaluated via a time varying reference trajectory which is not available by all asvs 3 model uncertainties disturbances together with actuator faults impose further challenges to such formation tracking problem 3 formation scheme design this section designs a robust adaptive formation scheme for problem 1 this novel scheme includes an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer and the robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controller in kinetic layer especially two kinds of fault tolerant formation controllers are given and related results with these controllers are also derived for the convenience of design the kinetic of i th asv is transformed into a parametric form as 3 ξ i ξ u v r θ ξ i t t f ξ i ν i d ξ i t m ξ i 1 τ ξ i f t where θ ξ i t ξ u v r are unknown and time varying parameters satisfying that θ ui t m v i m u i d 11 i t m u i 0 t θ vi t m u i m v i d 22 i t m v i d 23 i t m r i

r i t g r i t τ w r i t m r i three assumptions are made to address problem 1 assumption 1 the derivative of η r is bounded i e there is an unknown constant ρ m r such that η r ρ m assumption 2 the parameter θ ξ i t ξ u v r i v satisfies that θ ξ i t t θ ξ i t θ ξ i where θ ξ i is an unknown constant assumption 3 the term d ξ i t ξ u v r i v and the additive actuator fault ϕ ξ i t ξ u v r i v satisfy that d ξ i t m ξ i 1 ϕ ξ i t m ξ i where m ξ i is an unknown constant remark 4 due to the limited actuator capabilities velocities of asvs are bounded in practice thus assumption 1 is reasonable the rationality of assumption 2 lies in the fact that unknown inertia coefficients and time varying hydrodynamic damping coefficients are bounded in model identification of asvs since marine environment keeps changing with finite energies the external disturbances and model uncertainties on asvs are unknown time varying and bounded additive actuator faults are also bounded such that each asv is controllable when actuator faults occur then assumption 3 is also reasonable before designing our fault tolerant formation controllers an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer is proposed which considers both guaranteed performance and position only interaction 3 1 adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer first original performance constrained formation tracking problem is transformed into an unconstrained one the normalized neighborhood tracking error ζ e i a ζ x y ψ i v ζ e i a n ρ ζ i is defined and an error transformation from ζ e i a to a transform error ɛ ζ i is introduced using ζ e i a tanh ɛ ζ i then we have ɛ ζ i tanh 1 ζ e i a 1 2 ln 1 ζ e i a 1 ζ e i a the signals ɛ ζ i are initially well defined since ρ ζ i 0 ρ ζ i 0 ζ e i a 0 n denote the normalized

the effect caused by limitations of prescribed performance functions remark 5 eqs 8 9 in above adaptive control strategy can guarantee desired formation performance in a distributed manner only interacting the position vectors with neighboring asvs this design is different from the existing schemes on prescribed performance control of multi agent systems for example in dai et al 2017 li et al 2017 and he et al 2019 a global reference signal is required to address performance constraints in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2016 and yang et al 2018 both position and velocity interaction among neighboring agents are needed 3 2 robust adaptive fault based formation controller based on the proposed kinematic layer control strategy a novel robust adaptive fault based formation controller is designed for asvs in this part the following assumption is added to facilitate the design of our fault based formation controller assumption 4 for any ξ u v r and i v the multiplicative actuator fault μ ξ i t satisfies that inf t 0 m ξ i 1 μ ξ i t b ξ i 0 where b ξ i is a known constant for the i th asv remark 6 this assumption comes from the facts where certain control directions for n asvs are guaranteed during operation and actuators will not totally break down in case of faults i e μ ξ i is strictly greater than 0 in some practical scenarios where actuator faults can be diagnosed or prognosed the worst case is able to be foreseen by each asv indicated by a known parameter b ξ i consider a lyapunov candidate function v 2 1 2 ν e t ν e it gives v 2 ξ u v r i 1 n ξ e i ξ i α ξ i

completed remark 8 note that k 2 and k 3 in condition 18 depend on the eigenvalues of matrix l 0 although the eigenvalues of l 0 related to the interaction topology are unknown to each asv in the formation one can determine them for each asv along the following strategy set out from large values to guarantee the feasibility then gradually reduce them till the satisfactory performance is achieved 3 3 robust adaptive fault unknown formation controller in some scenarios actuator faults of asvs cannot be timely or accurately diagnosed or prognosed e g when the asvs are under malicious attacks then assumption 4 will not be satisfied to address it a novel robust adaptive fault unknown formation controller is designed in this part before our controller design a weaker assumption than assumption 4 is made below assumption 5 for any ξ u v r and i v the multiplicative actuator fault μ ξ i t satisfies that inf t 0 m ξ i 1 μ ξ i t g 0 where g 0 is an unknown positive constant remark 9 the above assumption constrains the actuation effectiveness cannot reduce to zero i e the actuator is not totally invalid this is reasonable since the controller will not work once the actuator fully breaks down compared with assumption 4 no fault information is required to be known which is more general but also more challenging again consider the lyapunov candidate function v 2 according to 11 let λ ξ i f g 0 1 max θ ξ i m ξ i 2 1 and φ ξ i f ξi 2 1 α ξ i 2 4 b 2 where λ ξ i f 0 is an unknown constant φ ξ i t 0 and b 2 are same as those in last subsection then we have 32 ξ e i ξ i α ξ i g 0 ξ e i 2 λ ξ i f φ ξ i 3 b 2 ξ e i m ξ i 1 μ ξ i τ ξ i according to 32 and assumption 5 an auxiliary variable λ ξ i is constructed to facilitate the controller design it has a form as 33 λ ξ i ξ e i λ ˆ ξ i f φ ξ i where λ ˆ ξ i f is the estimation of λ ξ i f and the updating rule of λ ˆ ξ i f is expressed by an adaptive law as follows 34 λ ˆ ξ i f γ ξ φ ξ i ξ e i 2 δ ξ λ ˆ ξ i f λ ˆ ξ i f 0 λ ˆ ξ i f 0 0 where γ ξ 0 and δ ξ 0 are control parameters to be specified λ ˆ ξ i f 0 is the initial value of λ ˆ ξ i f which is close to λ ξ i based on the auxiliary variable λ ξ i the robust adaptive fault unknown formation control laws τ ξ i ξ u v r i v are designed as 35 τ ξ i λ ξ i 2 ξ e i 2 λ ξ i 2 ε 1 2 k ξ i ξ e i where k ξ i is a control parameter to be determined and ε has been defined in 8b as shown later by means of λ ξ i in 33 the control law 35 can effectively address unknown actuator faults model uncertainties and disturbances together remark 10 similar to the formation controller 13 14 in last subsection parameter integration and adaptive control are utilized in the above fault unknown formation controller 34 35 such that model uncertainties disturbances actuator faults are compensated together and computational burden is reduced at the same time compared with controller 13 14 controller 34 35 has two features 1 it adopts no fault information when addressing actuator faults 2 it shares a same form of adaptive updating rule with 13 14 but the meanings of adaptive parameters are different now it comes to another theorem as follows that shows the proposed robust adaptive fault unknown formation controller also successfully solves problem 1 theorem 2 under assumptions 1 to 3 and 5 choose control law 35 together with virtual control law 8 adaptive laws 9 and 34 for each asv for any initial states satisfying p ˆ i 0 0 and λ ˆ ξ i f 0 0 if the communication topology g of asvs is connected and control parameters k 1 k 2 k 3 k ξ i ξ u v r i v satisfy the condition 36 where k 1 1 2 k 2 n ρ m λ max l 0 λ min 1 l 0 36 k 3 n 4 b 1 λ min 1 l 0 min ξ i k ξ i 1 2 g 0 problem 1 is solved and all signals in closed loop formation system are guaranteed to be

ultimately bounded the proof is completed remark 11 the control parameter selection strategy in theorem 2 is same as that in remark 8 i e feasibility first and satisfactory performance latter by starting from large values and gradually reducing them 3 4 discussion the above two different kinds of fault tolerant formation controllers are both under the framework of our proposed two layer robust adaptive formation scheme for problem 1 where an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer lays a foundation to ensure prescribed formation performance via a distributed manner and the controller in kinetic layer is used to compensate model uncertainties disturbances together with actuator faults in general these two types of formation controllers can be applied into distinct scenarios when fault diagnosis or prognosis is reliable fault based formation controller in section 3 2 is more preferred otherwise one can adopt fault unknown formation controller in section 3 3 comparing condition 36 in theorem 2 with condition 18 in theorem 1 it can be seen that although the assumption is weaker by using fault unknown rather than fault based formation controller the expense is bigger control parameter k ξ i as the actuator effectiveness reduces this observation implies that a trade off exists between the proposed fault based and fault unknown formation controllers and will be illustrated in the comparison part of next section besides the developed two layer robust adaptive formation scheme for asvs can be extended to the case with unidirectional communication links in this case the adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer should be redesigned to accommodate directed graph with a spanning tree instead of undirected connected graph considered in this paper however our two kinds of fault tolerant formation controllers designed in the kinetic layer can still be used 4 simulations considering formation tracking tasks of four asvs the model parameters of them and the disturbances are the same as those in lu et al 2018 and are listed in table 1 initial states of asvs are given as η 1 2 m 3 m 0 rad t η 2 3 m 7 5 m π 2 rad t η 3 6 m 2 m π 12 rad t η 4 8

connected 4 1 closed loop performance of robust adaptive fault based formation controllers in this case the reference trajectory to be tracked by the formation is set as η r t t m 50 sin π 60 t m π 4 rad t according to theorem 1 choose control parameters for the asvs as k 1 10 k 2 195 k 3 180 k ξ i ξ u v r 10 in addition we select k p 30 b 1 0 1 b 2 0 1 γ ξ ξ u v r 1 δ ξ ξ u v r 1 b u i 0 0194 b v i 0 0148 and b r i 0 1449 the initial values of adaptive parameters are p ˆ i 0 0 5 and λ ˆ ξ i 0 ξ u v r 1 using the proposed formation scheme with robust adaptive fault based formation controllers formation trajectories of four asvs solid lines and the reference trajectory the dotted line are shown in fig 2 where prescribed formation configuration δ i can be achieved with bounded errors as time goes on and the group of asvs can track the time varying reference fig 3 depicts neighborhood tracking errors of four asvs solid lines and prescribed performance functions abbreviated as ppf see dotted lines it is observed that despite the presence of uncertain dynamics disturbances and actuator faults tracking errors in channels x y and ψ are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded and satisfy performance constraints above results all conform to theorem 1 4 2 closed loop performance of robust adaptive fault unknown formation controllers in this case the reference trajectory to be tracked by the formation is set as η r t t m t m π 4 rad t according to theorem 2 choose control parameters for the asvs as k 1 10 k 2 195 k 3 180 k ξ i ξ u v r 100 in addition we select k p 30 b 1 0 1 b 2 0 1 γ ξ ξ u v r 1 δ ξ ξ u v r 1 the initial values of adaptive parameters are p ˆ i 0 0 5 and λ ˆ ξ i 0 ξ u v r 1 using the proposed formation scheme with robust adaptive fault unknown formation controllers formation trajectories of four asvs solid lines and the reference trajectory the dotted line are shown in fig 4 where prescribed formation configuration δ i can be achieved with bounded errors and the formation of asvs can track the time varying trajectory fig 5 depicts neighborhood tracking errors of four asvs solid lines and prescribed performance functions abbreviated as ppf see dotted lines we can see that tracking errors in channels x y and ψ are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded and satisfy performance constraints in the presence of uncertain dynamics disturbances and actuator faults all results conform to theorem 2 4 3 comparison results to further demonstrate the performance of the proposed two kinds of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers we compare them with the widely adopted model based formation controller in the cooperative tasks of asvs breivik et al 2008 the model based formation controller is given by 41 τ ξ i k ξ i ξ e i m ξ i f ξ i m ξ i α ξ i ξ u v r i v where f u i c 13 r i d 11 u i m u i f v i c 23 r i d 22 v i d 23 r i m v i f r i c 31 u i c 32 v i d 32 v i d 33 r i m r i in controller 41 model parameters i e the entries in matrices m i c i d i are available since they can be identified in practice but uncertain dynamics and disturbances are unknown to controller 41 the influence of actuator faults is also not considered in 41 comparative simulations are conducted by incorporating the model based fault based and fault unknown formation controller into the framework of our proposed two layer robust adaptive formation scheme respectively the reference trajectory η r t is chosen same as that in section 4 2 for all three controllers we select k 1 10 k 2 195 k 3 180 k ξ i ξ u v r 100 k p 30 and b 1 0 1 which means common parameters are same in three cases besides for two fault tolerant controllers the settings are b 2 0 1 γ ξ ξ u v r 1 and δ ξ ξ u v r 1 performance comparisons between the above three formation controllers are listed in table 2 where integrated absolute error iae 0 t η e a τ 1 d τ and integrated time absolute error itae 0 t τ η e a τ 1 d τ are utilized to evaluate the transient and steady state formation tracking from table 2 both robust adaptive fault based and fault unknown formation controllers perform better than the model based formation controller this is because controller 41 has no compensation mechanism for uncertain dynamics disturbances and actuator faults furthermore the fault based controller obtains smaller iae and itae than the fault unknown one since the former one has more fault information than the latter one and control parameter k ξ i in them are same as discussed in section 3 4 the fault unknown controller needs larger k ξ i to get the similar performance as the fault based controller although it requires no fault information the relationship between control parameter k ξ i and performance index iae for the proposed two fault tolerant formation controllers are shown in fig 6 two curves in fig 6 come from function fitting of some typical points which are obtained via multiple simulations by choosing different k ξ i we use the power functions for this fitting according to the proof of theorems 1 and 2 the typical points for function fitting are the black circles in fig 6 it can be seen that to get the same iae k ξ i in fault unknown controller will be larger than that in fault based controller for instance if we set iae 100 the minimal value of k ξ i in fault based controller is 5 6833 however the minimal value of that in fault unknown controller is 380 1971 which is depicted by two star points in fig 6 the simulation result in fig 6 is consistent with our discussion in section 3 4 5 conclusions in this paper we investigate a distributed formation tracking problem for autonomous surface vehicles asvs with guaranteed performance and actuator faults a novel two layer robust adaptive formation tracking scheme is proposed where an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer is incorporated and two kinds of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers in kinetic layer are provided we show that desired formation configurations of asvs can be obtained using the developed scheme with either designed fault tolerant controller if the interaction topology is connected and some control parameter conditions are satisfied meanwhile the neighborhood formation tracking errors can satisfy the prescribed formation tracking performance furthermore our scheme can address actuator faults with only one adaptive parameter updated in each control channel when compensating model uncertainties and external disturbances in the future we will consider the formation case with unidirectional communication links and incorporate an event triggered control strategy into the proposed scheme to reduce the controller updating frequency credit authorship contribution statement yu lu conceptualization

20321,this paper investigates a performance guaranteed formation tracking problem of autonomous surface vehicles asvs under uncertain environments especially model uncertainties external disturbances and actuator faults exist simultaneously based on graph theory and adaptive techniques a novel two layer robust adaptive fault tolerant formation scheme is developed in kinematic layer a transformation is made to get a performance unconstrained problem and an adaptive control strategy is incorporated to stabilize transformed errors in kinetic layer two types of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers i e the fault based one and the fault unknown one are designed for different fault scenarios these controllers share the same structure of single parameter updating laws to adjust adaptive parameters it is shown that 1 using the proposed formation scheme with either designed fault tolerant controller desired formation configurations of asvs are achieved if the interaction topology is connected and control parameters satisfy given conditions 2 prescribed formation tracking performance can be ensured and all error signals are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded 3 a trade off between two designed controllers exists that is although the assumption for fault unknown controller is weaker larger control parameters are required to behave like fault based one simulations and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results keywords formation adaptive fault tolerant guaranteed performance surface vehicles 1 introduction due to greater coverage and efficiency the cooperation of asvs is preferred in more and more maritime tasks such as cable laying zhang et al 2020b marine search fu and yu 2018 and so on as a typical way of cooperation the formation control of asvs focuses on steering a group of asvs to desired formation configurations and has received extensive attention from both theoretical and engineering communities see peng et al 2020 and the references therein aiming at reducing communication costs and improving fault tolerance position only interaction is used in the recent research of asv formation peng et al 2013 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a liang et al 2020 where each asv merely transmits its positions to neighbors and realizes the formation by interactive positions and its own velocities such kind of formation control for the asvs is still faced with several challenging issues two of which are addressed in this paper one issue is on the formation performance constraints in certain practical scenarios of asv cooperation the overshoot or the convergence rate of formation tracking errors is strictly constrained and the steady state formation tracking errors are required to be determined precisely to obtain the guaranteed formation performance some good results have arisen in dai et al 2017 li et al 2017 and he et al 2019 where the tracking errors are calculated from a global reference signal and limited within prescribed performance functions in distributed formation control each asv operates solely with its neighboring feedback and not all asvs have access to the leader asv this means that formation tracking errors with respect to the reference trajectory are only available to a few asvs and above results cannot be directly applied to deal with this issue a novel robust distributed controller that achieves arbitrarily fast and accurate synchronization of the following agents with the leader is proposed in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2016 the idea of which is successfully applied to the synchronization of multiple 3 dof helicopters yang et al 2018 however these works require both position and velocity interaction for the scenario where only neighboring positions are attainable suitable velocity estimation or compensation mechanism is needed to ensure desired formation performance in general distributed guaranteed performance requirements and position only interaction limits make formation control of asvs intractable the other issue is about the actuator failure constraints when suppressing model uncertainties and external disturbances for asvs the actuator failure will occur during the formation since a propeller is entangled by foreign matters or a steering gear shakes its rudder and the actuator faults of a certain asv can spread to its neighbors such that primal formation performance of asvs is degraded to improve the fault tolerance some effective results have been presented to cope with additive faults li and kumar 2011 chen and song 2014 multiplicative faults khalili et al 2018 deng and yang 2019 their combinations deng et al 2020 hua et al 2017 li and yang 2015 wang et al 2019 where most of these works consider linear systems or nonlinear systems with linear couplings as for asvs their states are nonlinearly strongly coupled and dynamics are under uncertainties existing approximation based robust formation methods in peng et al 2013 shojaei 2015 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018 and liang et al 2020 i e neural networks etc require the states of asvs to remain within a compact set but actuator faults may drive system states to exceed such limitation leading to the degradation or even ineffectuality of these formation methods here a main challenge lies in that the fault tolerant performance should be considered along with existing robust requirements therefore it is necessary but still challenging to explore fault tolerant formation control approaches for asvs with uncertainties and disturbances motivated by the above discussions we investigate a distributed formation tracking problem of asvs with guaranteed performance and actuator faults model uncertainties and external disturbances are also considered a novel two layer robust adaptive fault tolerant formation scheme is designed in kinematic layer the performance constrained formation tracking is transformed into an unconstrained one then an adaptive control strategy is proposed to stabilize the transformed errors and avoid the effect induced by prescribed performance constraints in kinematic layer a robust adaptive fault based formation controller is derived which relies on prior fault diagnosis or prognosis then a general fault unknown formation controller is constructed to avoid the dependence on fault information main contributions of this paper are threefold 1 a novel formation tracking scheme for asvs is designed unlike the work in dai et al 2017 li et al 2017 and he et al 2019 the designed scheme incorporates an adaptive control strategy to guarantee the prescribed formation performance via a distributed manner and can merge different robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers 2 two kinds of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers i e the fault based one and the fault unknown one are presented for different actuator faults scenarios their control parameter selection conditions are derived and a trade off relationship between them is observed compared with existing literature deng et al 2020 hua et al 2017 3 a general structure of single parameter adaptive updating laws is given for two fault tolerant controllers to adjust adaptive parameters different from refs li and yang 2015 and wang et al 2019 this structure can obtain the robustness against uncertainties disturbances together with actuator faults with less computation the rest of this paper is summarized as below in section 2 the problem is formulated then the formation scheme is designed in section 3 related results and analysis are also included simulations and comparisons are provided in section 4 section 5 concludes the paper key

to fully capture the impact of faults on the efficiency and accuracy of actuators actuator faults in affine form with time varying coefficients are considered namely 2 τ ξ i f t ξ u v r μ ξ i t τ ξ i t ϕ ξ i t where τ ξ i t is a control input to be designed μ ξ i t 0 1 denotes a multiplicative actuator fault and ϕ ξ i t denotes an additive actuator fault remark 1 in practice matrices m i c i d i are difficult to be accurately obtained and all of them together with g i are treated as model uncertainties this paper devotes to proposing robust schemes where real values of m i c i d i g i and τ wi will not be used in the controller design remark 2 actuators of an asv include propellers and rudders when a propeller is entangled by foreign matters or a steering gear shakes its rudder actuator faults are induced the faults can not only affect the actuation efficiency but also decrease the actuation precision as discussed in deng et al 2020 hua et al 2017 and li and yang 2015 the combination of multiplicative and additive faults can effectively model such influence thus it is adopted for asvs here in 2 μ ξ i t describes the actuation effectiveness and ϕ ξ i t represents unexpected bias value note that μ ξ i t 1 and ϕ ξ i t 0 imply the i th asv is free of actuator faults in channel ξ a time varying reference trajectory η r t r 3 is used to guide n asvs note that η r t is available only to a small number of asvs and this availability is described by a matrix d diag d 1 d n where d i 1 if the i th asv can obtain η r and d i 0 otherwise the formation tracking problem of asvs with guaranteed performance and actuator faults is formulated below problem 1 there are n asvs communicating via an undirected graph g model parameters of them are unknown and they suffer from external disturbances as described in 1 their control inputs are subject to actuator faults in 2 design a control law τ i i v τ u i τ v i τ r i t for each asv that relies on its states η i ν i and position vectors of its neighbors η j j n i such that 1 a predefined formation configuration δ i r 3 can be achieved with bounded errors i e there exists a small positive constant ɛ 0 η i t δ i η r t ɛ 0 i v 2 the neighborhood tracking error η ei a t of each asv remains within a prescribed bound ρ η i t i e η ei a t n ρ η i t i v where η ei a t x e i a t y e i a t ψ e i a t t has a form as η ei a j n i a i

parameters satisfying l ζ i 0 ρ ζ i 0 and ρ ζ i 0 ρ ζ i 0 ζ e i a 0 respectively remark 3 the main features of the above problem are that 1 only position rather than velocity vectors of neighboring asvs are interacted during the formation 2 the guaranteed performance is evaluated via a time varying reference trajectory which is not available by all asvs 3 model uncertainties disturbances together with actuator faults impose further challenges to such formation tracking problem 3 formation scheme design this section designs a robust adaptive formation scheme for problem 1 this novel scheme includes an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer and the robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controller in kinetic layer especially two kinds of fault tolerant formation controllers are given and related results with these controllers are also derived for the convenience of design the kinetic of i th asv is transformed into a parametric form as 3 ξ i ξ u v r θ ξ i t t

r i t g r i t τ w r i t m r i three assumptions are made to address problem 1 assumption 1 the derivative of η r is bounded i e there is an unknown constant ρ m r such that η r ρ m assumption 2 the parameter θ ξ i t ξ u v r i v satisfies that θ ξ i t t θ ξ i t θ ξ i where θ ξ i is an unknown constant assumption 3 the term d ξ i t ξ u v r i v and the additive actuator fault ϕ ξ i t ξ u v r i v satisfy that d ξ i t m ξ i 1 ϕ ξ i t m ξ i where m ξ i is an unknown constant remark 4 due to the limited actuator capabilities velocities of asvs are bounded in practice thus assumption 1 is reasonable the rationality of assumption 2 lies in the fact that unknown inertia coefficients and time varying hydrodynamic damping coefficients are bounded in model identification of asvs since marine environment keeps changing with finite energies the external disturbances and model uncertainties on asvs are unknown time varying and bounded additive actuator faults are also bounded such that each asv is controllable when actuator faults occur then assumption 3 is also reasonable before designing our fault tolerant formation controllers an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer is proposed which considers both guaranteed performance and position only interaction 3 1 adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer first original performance constrained formation tracking problem is transformed into an unconstrained one the normalized neighborhood tracking error ζ e i a ζ x y ψ i v ζ e i a n ρ ζ i is defined and an error transformation from ζ e i a to a transform error ɛ ζ i is introduced using ζ e i a tanh ɛ ζ i then we have ɛ ζ i tanh 1 ζ e i a 1 2 ln 1 ζ e i a 1 ζ e i a the signals ɛ ζ i are initially well defined since ρ ζ i 0 ρ ζ i 0 ζ e i a 0 n denote the normalized neighborhood tracking error vector η ei a x e i a y e i a ψ e i a t and the transform error vector ɛ η i tanh 1 η ei a taking the derivative of ɛ η i with respect to time gives 4 ɛ η i d ɛ η i d η ei

the transformed formation tracking error ɛ η i the second part is given in 8b and used to compensate unknown velocities of the reference trajectory η r the third part is constructed in 8c to eliminate the effect caused by limitations of prescribed performance functions remark 5 eqs 8 9 in above adaptive control strategy can guarantee desired formation performance in a distributed manner only interacting the position vectors with neighboring asvs this design is different from the existing schemes on prescribed performance control of multi agent systems for example in dai et al 2017 li et al 2017 and he et al 2019 a global reference signal is required to address performance constraints in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2016 and yang et al 2018 both position and velocity interaction among neighboring agents are needed 3 2 robust adaptive fault based formation controller based on the proposed kinematic layer control strategy a novel robust adaptive fault based formation controller is designed for asvs in this part the following assumption is added to facilitate the design of our fault based formation controller assumption 4 for any ξ u v r and i v the multiplicative actuator fault μ ξ i t satisfies that inf t 0 m ξ i 1 μ ξ i t b ξ i 0 where b ξ i is a known constant for the i th asv remark 6 this assumption comes from the facts where certain control directions for n asvs are guaranteed during operation and actuators will not totally break down in case of faults i e μ ξ i is strictly greater than 0 in some practical scenarios where actuator faults can be diagnosed or prognosed the worst case is able to be foreseen by each asv indicated by a known parameter b ξ i consider a lyapunov candidate function v 2 1 2 ν e t ν e it gives v 2 ξ u v r i 1 n ξ e i ξ i α ξ i substituting 3 into v 2 according to young s inequality we have 10 ξ e i ξ i α ξ i 3 b 2 1 4 b 2 ξ e i 2 θ ξ i 2 f ξ i t f ξ i ξ e i 2 d ξ i m ξ i 1 ϕ ξ i 2 ξ e i 2 α ξ i 2 ξ e i m ξ i 1 μ ξ i τ ξ i

subsequent controller design then 11 gives 12 ξ e i ξ i α ξ i ξ e i 2 λ ξ i φ ξ i 3 b 2 ξ e i m ξ i 1 μ ξ i τ ξ i denote the estimation of λ ξ i as λ ˆ ξ i then introducing an estimation error λ ξ i λ

determined and λ ˆ ξ i is updated by an adaptive law as follows 14 λ ˆ ξ i γ ξ φ ξ i ξ e i 2 δ ξ λ ˆ ξ i λ ˆ ξ i 0 λ ˆ ξ i 0 0 where γ ξ and δ ξ are both positive control parameters to be determined λ ˆ ξ i 0 denotes the initial value of λ ˆ ξ i which is chosen to be close to the real value λ ξ i remark 7 different from peng et al 2013 and du et al 2015 single parameter adaptive updating rules are constructed by adopting λ ˆ ξ i into robust adaptive fault based formation controller 13 14 here λ ξ i is an integrated parameter to compensate uncertainties disturbances and actuator faults together with less computation where only one instead of multiple parameters needs to be updated in every control channel of each asv according to assumption 4 and 14 substituting 13 into 12 gives 15 ξ e i ξ i α ξ i λ ξ i φ ξ i ξ e i 2 k ξ i ξ e i 2 3 b 2 let λ ξ λ ξ 1 λ ξ n t λ ˆ ξ λ ˆ ξ 1 λ ˆ ξ n t and λ ξ λ ξ 1 λ ξ n t consider a lyapunov candidate function v 3 v 2 ξ u v r 1 2 γ ξ λ ξ t λ ξ substituting

completed remark 8 note that k 2 and k 3 in condition 18 depend on the eigenvalues of matrix l 0 although the eigenvalues of l 0 related to the interaction topology are unknown to each asv in the formation one can determine them for each asv along the following strategy set out from large values to guarantee the feasibility then gradually reduce them till the satisfactory performance is achieved 3 3 robust adaptive fault unknown formation controller in some scenarios actuator faults of asvs cannot be timely or accurately diagnosed or prognosed e g when the asvs are under malicious attacks then assumption 4 will not be satisfied to address it a novel robust adaptive fault unknown formation controller is designed in this part before our controller design a weaker assumption than assumption 4 is made below assumption 5 for any ξ u v r and i v the multiplicative actuator fault μ ξ i t satisfies that inf t 0 m ξ i 1 μ ξ i t g 0 where g 0 is an unknown positive constant remark 9 the above assumption constrains the actuation effectiveness cannot reduce to zero i e the actuator is not totally invalid this is reasonable since the controller will not work once the actuator fully breaks down compared with assumption 4 no fault information is required to be known which is more general but also more challenging again consider the lyapunov candidate function v 2 according to 11 let λ ξ i f g 0 1 max θ ξ i m ξ i 2 1 and φ ξ i f ξi 2 1 α ξ i 2 4 b 2 where λ ξ i f 0 is an unknown constant φ ξ i t 0 and b 2 are same as those in last subsection then we have 32 ξ e i ξ i α ξ i g 0 ξ e i 2 λ ξ i f φ ξ i 3 b 2 ξ e i m ξ i 1 μ ξ i τ ξ i according to 32 and assumption 5 an auxiliary variable λ ξ i is constructed to facilitate the controller design it has a form as 33 λ ξ i ξ e i λ ˆ ξ i f φ ξ i where λ ˆ ξ i f is the estimation of λ ξ i f and the updating rule of λ ˆ ξ i f is expressed by an adaptive law as follows 34 λ ˆ ξ i f γ ξ φ ξ i ξ e i 2 δ ξ λ ˆ ξ i f λ ˆ ξ i f 0 λ ˆ ξ i f 0 0 where γ ξ 0 and δ ξ 0 are control parameters to be specified λ ˆ ξ i f 0 is the initial value of λ ˆ ξ i f which is close to λ ξ i based on the auxiliary variable λ ξ i the robust adaptive fault unknown formation control laws τ ξ i ξ u v r i v are designed as 35 τ ξ i λ ξ i 2 ξ e i 2 λ ξ i 2 ε 1 2 k ξ i ξ e i where k ξ i is a control parameter to be determined and ε has been defined in 8b as shown later by means of λ ξ i in 33 the control law 35 can effectively address unknown actuator faults model uncertainties and disturbances together remark 10 similar to the formation controller 13 14 in last subsection parameter integration and adaptive control are utilized in the above fault unknown formation controller 34 35 such that model uncertainties disturbances actuator faults are compensated together and computational burden is reduced at the same time compared with controller 13 14 controller 34 35 has two features 1 it adopts no fault information when addressing actuator faults 2 it shares a same form of adaptive updating rule with 13 14 but the meanings of adaptive parameters are different now it comes to another theorem as follows that shows the proposed robust adaptive fault unknown formation controller also successfully solves problem 1 theorem 2 under assumptions 1 to 3 and 5 choose control law 35 together with virtual control law 8 adaptive laws 9 and 34 for each asv for any initial states satisfying p ˆ i 0 0 and λ ˆ ξ i f 0 0 if the communication topology g of asvs is connected and control parameters k 1 k 2 k 3 k ξ i ξ u v r i v satisfy the

ultimately bounded the proof is completed remark 11 the control parameter selection strategy in theorem 2 is same as that in remark 8 i e feasibility first and satisfactory performance latter by starting from large values and gradually reducing them 3 4 discussion the above two different kinds of fault tolerant formation controllers are both under the framework of our proposed two layer robust adaptive formation scheme for problem 1 where an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer lays a foundation to ensure prescribed formation performance via a distributed manner and the controller in kinetic layer is used to compensate model uncertainties disturbances together with actuator faults in general these two types of formation controllers can be applied into distinct scenarios when fault diagnosis or prognosis is reliable fault based formation controller in section 3 2 is more preferred otherwise one can adopt fault unknown formation controller in section 3 3 comparing condition 36 in theorem 2 with condition 18 in theorem 1 it can be seen that although the assumption is weaker by using fault unknown rather than fault based formation controller the expense is bigger control parameter k ξ i as the actuator effectiveness reduces this observation implies that a trade off exists between the proposed fault based and fault unknown formation controllers and will be illustrated in the comparison part of next section besides the developed two layer robust adaptive formation scheme for asvs can be extended to the case with unidirectional communication links in this case the adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer should be redesigned to accommodate directed graph with a spanning tree instead of undirected connected graph considered in this paper however our two kinds of fault tolerant formation controllers designed in the kinetic layer can still be used 4 simulations considering formation tracking tasks of four asvs the model parameters of them and the disturbances are the same as those in lu et al 2018 and are listed in table 1 initial states of asvs are given as η 1 2 m 3 m 0 rad t η 2 3 m 7 5 m π 2 rad t η 3 6 m 2 m π 12 rad t η 4 8

formation trajectories of four asvs solid lines and the reference trajectory the dotted line are shown in fig 2 where prescribed formation configuration δ i can be achieved with bounded errors as time goes on and the group of asvs can track the time varying reference fig 3 depicts neighborhood tracking errors of four asvs solid lines and prescribed performance functions abbreviated as ppf see dotted lines it is observed that despite the presence of uncertain dynamics disturbances and actuator faults tracking errors in channels x y and ψ are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded and satisfy performance constraints above results all conform to theorem 1 4 2 closed loop performance of robust adaptive fault unknown formation controllers in this case the reference trajectory to be tracked by the formation is set as η r t t m t m π 4 rad t according to theorem 2 choose control parameters for the asvs as k 1 10 k 2 195 k 3 180 k ξ i ξ u v r 100 in addition we select k p 30 b 1 0 1 b 2 0 1 γ ξ ξ u v r 1 δ ξ ξ u v r 1 the initial values of adaptive parameters are p ˆ i 0 0 5 and λ ˆ ξ i 0 ξ u v r 1 using the proposed formation scheme with robust adaptive fault unknown formation controllers formation trajectories of four asvs solid lines and the reference trajectory the dotted line are shown in fig 4 where prescribed formation configuration δ i can be achieved with bounded errors and the formation of asvs can track the time varying trajectory fig 5 depicts neighborhood tracking errors of four asvs solid lines and prescribed performance functions abbreviated as ppf see dotted lines we can see that tracking errors in channels x y and ψ are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded and satisfy performance constraints in the presence of uncertain dynamics disturbances and actuator faults all results conform to theorem 2 4 3 comparison results to further demonstrate the performance of the proposed two kinds of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers we compare them with the widely adopted model based formation controller in the cooperative tasks of asvs breivik et al 2008 the model based formation controller is given by 41 τ ξ i k ξ i ξ e i m ξ i f ξ i m ξ i α ξ i ξ u v r i v where f u i c 13 r i d 11 u i m u i f v i c 23 r i d 22 v i d 23 r i m v i f r i c 31 u i c 32 v i d 32 v i d 33 r i m r i in controller 41 model parameters i e the entries in matrices m i c i d i are available since they can be identified in practice but uncertain dynamics and disturbances are unknown to controller 41 the influence of actuator faults is also not considered in 41 comparative simulations are conducted by incorporating the model based fault based and fault unknown formation controller into the framework of our proposed two layer robust adaptive formation scheme respectively the reference trajectory η r t is chosen same as that in section 4 2 for all three controllers we select k 1 10 k 2 195 k 3 180 k ξ i ξ u v r 100 k p 30 and b 1 0 1 which means common parameters are same in three cases besides for two fault tolerant controllers the settings are b 2 0 1 γ ξ ξ u v r 1 and δ ξ ξ u v r 1 performance comparisons between the above three formation controllers are listed in table 2 where integrated absolute error iae 0 t η e a τ 1 d τ and integrated time absolute error itae 0 t τ η e a τ 1 d τ are utilized to evaluate the transient and steady state formation tracking from table 2 both robust adaptive fault based and fault unknown formation controllers perform better than the model based formation controller this is because controller 41 has no compensation mechanism for uncertain dynamics disturbances and actuator faults furthermore the fault based controller obtains smaller iae and itae than the fault unknown one since the former one has more fault information than the latter one and control parameter k ξ i in them are same as discussed in section 3 4 the fault unknown controller needs larger k ξ i to get the similar performance as the fault based controller although it requires no fault information the relationship between control parameter k ξ i and performance index iae for the proposed two fault tolerant formation controllers are shown in fig 6 two curves in fig 6 come from function fitting of some typical points which are obtained via multiple simulations by choosing different k ξ i we use the power functions for this fitting according to the proof of theorems 1 and 2 the typical points for function fitting are the black circles in fig 6 it can be seen that to get the same iae k ξ i in fault unknown controller will be larger than that in fault based controller for instance if we set iae 100 the minimal value of k ξ i in fault based controller is 5 6833 however the minimal value of that in fault unknown controller is 380 1971 which is depicted by two star points in fig 6 the simulation result in fig 6 is consistent with our discussion in section 3 4 5 conclusions in this paper we investigate a distributed formation tracking problem for autonomous surface vehicles asvs with guaranteed performance and actuator faults a novel two layer robust adaptive formation tracking scheme is proposed where an adaptive control strategy in kinematic layer is incorporated and two kinds of robust adaptive fault tolerant formation controllers in kinetic layer are provided we show that desired formation configurations of asvs can be obtained using the developed scheme with either designed fault tolerant controller if the interaction topology is connected and some control parameter conditions are satisfied meanwhile the neighborhood formation tracking errors can satisfy the prescribed formation tracking performance furthermore our scheme can address actuator faults with only one adaptive parameter updated in each control channel when compensating model uncertainties and external disturbances in the future we will consider the formation case with unidirectional communication links and incorporate an event triggered control strategy into the proposed scheme to reduce the controller updating frequency credit authorship contribution statement yu lu conceptualization

20322,in this study we evaluate the effect of climate change on explosive cyclones ecs using mega ensemble projection data d4pdf which has 50 members of 60 years present climate experiments and 90 members of 60 years 4k future climate experiments subsequently we evaluate the future change of coastal hazards due to high swell waves called yorimawari waves caused by strong and stagnant ecs around japan the number of ecs passing over the sea of japan increased but the number passing over the pacific ocean decreased under future climate the annual average of the minimum central pressure mcp of the ec did not change but the 10 to 60 year probability value increased for the future wave simulations with the d4pdf wind conditions for ecs with an mcp of the 10 year probability value that stagnated for over 24 h around hokkaido were conducted the ensemble average of the maximum significant wave height increased from 0 5 to 1 0 m along the sea of japan the significant wave period increased by over 0 25 s however the standard deviation was as large as the wave height of future change the wave height of high waves depends on the characteristics of the ec keywords extratropical cyclone explosive cyclone climate change high waves large ensemble d4pdf 1 introduction the latest ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate srocc ipcc 2019 indicates that the intensity of extreme phenomena will increase due to climate change an explosive cyclone ec also known as a bomb cyclone is an extreme phenomenon that occurs around japan in winter especially in the northern part of japan it is defined as an intensive extratropical cyclone which decreases by approximately 24 hpa or more at the center of the cyclone in 24 h sanders and davis 1988 its characteristics such as an asymmetric structure its occurrence between october and march and stagnating for a long period of over 24 h differ from those of typhoons japan has suffered from coastal disasters due to ecs for example on february 24 2008 large swells with a significant wave height of 9 92 m and a significant wave period of 16 2 s at the toyama point 20 m depth by japanese wave observation network nowphas nationwide ocean wave information network for ports and harbours were induced by an ec in japan this swell event caused 1 casualty and 15 injuries along coastal area of toyama bay in the sea of japan kawasaki et al 2008 ranasinghe et al 2010 on december 16 2014 an ec induced an approximately 1 7 m storm surge that caused inundation at nemuro in hokkaido saruwatari et al 2014 bricker et al 2015 the ec disasters are not unique to japan they are also found in north america and europe feser et al 2015 bärring and von storch 2004 gulev et al 2001 some studies have indicated that the observed frequency and intensity of ecs in winter over the last few decades has increased and this trend is projected to continue in the future graham and diaz 2001 langenberg et al 1999 several studies related to ecs in japan have been conducted mori et al 2017 analyzed the characteristics of ecs around japan in the past 55 years using the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 by the japanese meteorological agency they demonstrated that although the genesis frequency of the ec exhibited a decreasing trend weakly the intensity of them especially strong ec showed an increasing trend since 1958 yoshida and asuma 2004 summarized the characteristics and development mechanism of ecs based on three classified tracks as well as their development related to the eddies at upper and lower air the latent heat flux from the sea surface in the pacific northwest to investigate the effect of climate change on coastal disasters in east asia shimura et al 2014 estimated future changes in wave climates based on horizontal 60 km resolution wave projections using the meteorological research institute atmospheric general circulation model mri agcm3 2h and showed an increasing trend of the maximum wave heights in eastern japan due to climate change however research on future changes in regional coastal disasters has been performed based on a small number of ensemble results using time slice experiments typically 20 25 years however statistical evaluations of low frequency phenomena are difficult to perform based on a small number or decal length of experiments therefore mori et al 2016 conducted mega ensemble projections using the database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf integrating over 5000 years of both present and future 4k warmer climate conditions mori et al 2016 evaluated future changes in storm surges caused by typhoons using d4pdf which is a large climate dataset comprising data of extreme events over 100 years and showed an increase in storm surge height of approximately 0 5 m for the 100 year probability value in osaka bay japan however studies regarding future changes in ecs and coastal disasters caused by climate change are rare in this study we evaluate the effect of climate change on ecs involving in disasters in japan using d4pdf and investigate the future change of coastal hazards due to ecs in particular yorimawari waves in the sea of japan first outline of ec dataset based on d4pdf is explained in detail second the changes in ec characteristics due to climate change is analyzed targeting around japan third the application of ec dataset to yorimawari waves is investigated in the northern part of japan 2 methodology 2 1 overview of dataset 2 1 1 d4pdf climate projection dataset a future scenario was developed using the mega ensemble projection for climate change d4pdf by performing a large number of climate simulations using high resolution global and regional atmospheric models mizuta et al 2017 simulation experiments were designed such that past climate signals and future changes in mean climate and extreme events such as heavy rainfall and tropical cyclones can be detected with high statistical confidence in d4pdf simulations global surface air temperatures are climatologically constant at 4 k relative to post industrial levels corresponding to the end of the 21st century in the rcp8 5 representative concentration pathway scenario experiments of the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project 5 participating models global general and regional circulation climate models gcm and rcm of 60 and 20 km meshes were used for present and future climate simulations respectively the 60 km mesh resolution was approximately twice as high as those of most cmip6 participating models in order to decrease calculation cost and increase the number of ensemble members reproduce of extreme events such as typhoons needs several kilometers resolution so gcm may weakly estimate extreme events gcm used in the simulation was the meteorological research institute atmospheric general circulation model version 3 2 mri agcm3 2 mizuta et al 2012 and the regional model was mri nonhydrostatic regional climate model nhrcm sasaki et al 2011 murata et al 2013 covering the japan islands to investigate various effects of climate change on japan fig 1 the ensemble members of every experiment exceeded 50 and a pair of both global and regional simulations was available for each simulation type all simulations were conducted by integrating the models forced by the prescribed sea surface temperature sst and sea ice concentration sic future ssts and sics used in these simulations were detrended observations added to the sst future change distribution of cmip5 rcp8 5 experiments using six different atmosphere ocean gcms the uncertainties in the cmip5 scenario experiments were accounted for by the future change of the six cmip5 models selected six cmip5 models were ccsm4 cc gfdl cm3 gf hadgem2 ao ha miroc5 mi mpi esm mr mp and mri cgcm3 mr the results of d4pdf have been widely analyzed and applied to different sectors of impact assessment in japan ishii and mori 2020 we analyzed the ec using the d4pdf rcm experiment results the d4pdf had a 20 km horizontal and 1 h temporal resolution the d4pdf was performed under observed sst with 50 kinds of perturbations in present climate and under six future ssts with 15 kinds of perturbation in future climate experiment as the initial and boundary conditions 1 present climate experiment september 1950 august 2011 60 years 50 members total 3000 years 2 4k future climate experiment september 2050 august 2111 60 years 90 members 6 gcms 15 perturbation total 5400 years the conditions of 4k future climate experiments were defined as the constant conditions in which the global average temperature increased by 4k compared with the age of the industrial revolution 1850 because the global warming trend was not included throughout the experimental period the comparison between 4k future climate experiments and non warming experiments is able to evaluate the impact of climate change since there are not non warming experiments of d4pdf rcm a rigorous comparison with pre industrial climate is not possible however the similar line in previous study analyzing jra 55 by mori et al 2017 showed only a weak trend that cannot be distinguished from natural variability in both intensity and frequency from 1958 to 2011 based on their finding this study compares the present climate experiments with 4k future climate the variables of d4pdf dataset used in this study are slp sea level pressure and u10 v10 eastward northward wind at 10 m height 2 1 2 jra 55 reanalysis atmospheric dataset the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 is one of the latest reanalysis dataset of atmosphere kobayashi et al 2015 jra 55 provides data on atmospheric variables at 60 km horizontal grids its resolution is coarse to reproduce the extreme atmospheric phenomena but jra 55 has high reliability around japan and the other regions due to the data assimilation jra 55 is used to evaluate the present climate experiment of d4pdf jra 55 faithfully reproduces historical environment however historical environment does not represent climatic values we must be careful that the variables based on large number of samples such as monthly averaged temperature and daily precipitation in jra 55 will be included in the probability distribution of d4pdf while the variables based on small number of samples in jra 55 may be outlier of d4pdf 2 2 method of extracting ec we developed a standard and fast extracting ec method for long term d4pdf developed method uses spatial and temporal changes in slp for the analysis period from october to april the ec is defined as an extratropical low pressure which the central pressure drops more than 24 hpa sin ϕ sin 60 ϕ is the latitude degree in 24 h by japan meteorological agency fig 2 illustrates the algorithm for detecting and tracking the ec the extraction procedure comprised following three steps step 1 pertains to the search for the cyclone center first the slp spatial distribution was smoothed by a gaussian filter to remove the noise that caused the error we removed the grids at altitudes higher than 1500 m because the grids had a lower slp because of the error from sea level correction subsequently the grid that was at least 1 hpa smaller than the average slp surrounding grids was extracted as a candidate for the center of the cyclone for every snapshot when multiple centers were detected in a 3 radius area the center with the smallest slp was selected step 2 involves tracking the extracted cyclone center in step 1 the detection area of the next time step center was within travel distances of 1 5 h to the east and west and 1 0 h to the north and south respectively if multiple centers are detected in the detection area then the center with the smallest slp is selected as the next time step center we set the lifetime of the cyclone to be more than 24 h in order to exclude the disappeared low pressure due to the fusion of multiple low pressures step 3 is to assess whether the tracked cyclone in step 2 is an ec we set two criteria occurrence season and the maximum development rate of the central pressure the ec typically occurred during winter and spring in the target region i e from november to april yoshida and asuma 2004 defined the development rate as ε p t 12 p t 12 24 sin 60 sin ϕ t where p is the central pressure of the cyclone in slp hpa t is the time h and ϕ is the latitude degree the development rates for d4pdf and jra 55 are calculated every 1 hour and every 6 hours respectively subsequently the maximum development rate of the central pressure of 1 0 or more is judged as ec the influence of temporal resolution to the calculation of development rate is small although this extracting algorithm does not distinguish a typhoon from an ec for the atmospheric reanalysis dataset jra 55 it extracted 1047 ecs including two typhoons 0 19 over 60 years this algorithm is simple fast and sufficiently accurate in the following section we analyze the calculated ec database 2 3 wave modeling we evaluate the yorimawari wave that is one of the high wave events in winter at toyama bay in japan generally yorimawari wave is defined by their generation process and there are various criteria for the observed wave height and period for example the significant wave height and period are more than 1 m and 10 s or more than 2 m and 8 s yorimawari wave is caused by strong and stagnant ecs around east coast of hokkaido and seasonal pressure distribution in winter the strong pressure gradient causes strong northerly winds over the eastern sea of japan which develops high waves developed high waves reach toyama bay which has a steep and complex topography and bring disaster to the toyama coastal area tamura et al 2020 the future change of extreme waves caused by the extreme ecs is investigated by the spectral wave modeling simulating waves nearshore ver 41 10 swan booij et al 1999 is used swan is one of the open source models and is used in many researches in this study swan is forced by the wind fields u10 and v10 of d4pdf rcm 20 km resolution for ecs the calculation domain used in swan is 135 150 east longitude and 36 46 5 north latitude with 0 1 resolution the directional resolution is 10 and the frequency is set from 0 05 to 1 0 hz with 30 bins the calculation period is the duration when the ecs were extracted bathymetry is interpolated from gebco 2014 calculation conditions are activated with default parameters of swan tamura et al 2020 showed that it is difficult to reproduce the waves along the coast of toyama bay with a spectral wave model we extract the ecs that cause yorimawari wave and evaluate the swells at the mouth of toyama bay 3 analysis results and discussion 3 1 frequency of ecs to investigate the future change in the number of ecs around japan due to climate change we compared the characteristics of the extracted ec under the present and future climates of the d4pdf furthermore we compared the reanalysis data jra 55 to validate the present climate simulation of d4pdf in table 1 the annual average numbers of extracted ecs in jra 55 and d4pdf in the present and future climates respectively are shown the results of the future climate show each sst ensemble the baseline ec frequency by jra 55 was 17 45 y the frequency of d4pdf in the present climate was 10 15 y based on the 50 case ensemble average whereas that in the future climate was 10 56 y based on the 90 case ensemble average the ec frequency by jra 55 indicates a larger number of occurrences than that by the d4pdf in the present climate owing to the differences in modeling conditions between jra 55 and d4pdf due to the general circulation model and rcm data assimilation and horizontal resolution however it is difficult to discuss the differences in the model characteristics from this result regarding data assimilation and horizontal resolution some studies reported that high resolution modeling and using data assimilation reproduced accurate typhoons but the literature on ecs is limited although jra 55 is a 60 km global reanalysis with a lower resolution than the regional d4pdf dataset 20 km data assimilation is effective for reproducing the ec the differences between jra 55 and d4pdf present climate runs require further studies the d4pdf in the future climate estimates a slightly larger number than that in the present climate the standard deviations in the present and future climates were 2 09 and 0 71 respectively the t test for the number of ecs around japan showed that the future change in the number of ec was not statistically significant at the p 0 05 level and an increasing trend was not significantly detected furthermore the results for each sst change pattern presented a small standard deviation from 0 27 to 0 41 the distribution of sst may be related to the number of occurrences of ecs however we did not obtain a characteristic parameter between the sst change distribution around japan and the number of ecs a more detailed analysis including daily changes in sst and cyclone development is necessary 3 2 ec track in fig 3 the annual average frequencies of ec track in jra 55 present and future climate conditions of d4pdf are shown the ec tracks can be classified into two major routes one is over the sea of japan and the other is along the southern coast of japan over the pacific ocean these tracks in jra 55 and d4pdf agree with the previous results of yoshida and asuma 2004 although the frequency distributions of ecs in jra 55 and d4pdf in the present climate are similar the estimated number of ecs in d4pdf is underestimated by approximately 62 over the pacific ocean and 30 over the sea of japan compared to jra 55 the frequency of ecs along the pacific side in d4pdf in the present climate was three times larger than that on the sea of japan side the average frequency of ecs passing along the southern coastal area of honshu island was 1 1 y in present climates meanwhile the future change in the intensity of ecs over the sea of japan was stronger than that on the pacific side the details of the intensity change of ecs will be discussed in the next section fig 4 shows the future changes in the frequency of ecs future minus present fig 4 a shows that the mean frequency change of ecs over the pacific ocean decreased in the future climate whereas the frequency passing over the sea of japan increased by the same magnitude in addition the trends of future changes in frequency over the pacific ocean and the sea of japan were rejected at 95 by the t test and shown to be statistically significant the main cause of the frequency changes was the northward shift of the westerly winds due to climate change which is consistent with ipcc srocc ipcc 2019 and other recent studies the magnitudes of the frequency changes were 10 over the pacific ocean and 28 over the sea of japan compared with the frequency in the present climate table 2 the future change in the frequency under each sst pattern is shown in fig 4 b almost all trends of future change agreed with the ensemble average but the frequency under the mi condition increased over the pacific ocean the d4pdf in the future climate estimated a shift in the ec track from south to north and a part of the sst pattern suggested that it would affect the ec track as spatial patterns of sst were forced in the mri agcm all patterns can occur in the same rcp scenario the changes in the sst patterns at the global scale indicated significant differences in the regional scale climate 3 3 central pressure of extreme ecs as the average frequency of ecs will be increased as shown in table 2 it is important to analyze future changes in ecs table 3 shows the annual mean minimum central pressure of ecs by track the ecs in the present climate are stronger than those of the jra 55 and the averaged intensity of ecs is not consistent with jra 55 future change indicates enhancements fig 5 a shows the return period of the minimum central pressure mcp of the ec based on extreme value analysis in the present and future climate conditions the return periods are calculated from the ranking of mcps in each 60 year ensemble member the hatched areas are the envelopes of maximum and minimum values by the ensemble members in the present and future climate the thick lines indicate the ensemble averaged values the black line represents the extreme distribution by jra 55 the extreme ec intensity by jra 55 estimated a stronger ec below the 10 year return period than the strongest member of the d4pdf in the present climate however the intensity of the ec from a 10 to 60 year return period in jra 55 included the range of d4pdf members it should be noted here that the past reanalysis only represents one scenario in the past climate although the weak ecs of d4pdf in the present climate were underestimated based on the jra 55 d4pdf yielded a reasonable estimation of strong ecs the variance of each ensemble member was 17 hpa in the present climate and 29 hpa in the future climate at a 60 year return period and the difference in the ensemble averages of the present and future climates was approximately 2 3 hpa from the 1 to 60 year return period the averages of all ecs mcp around japan in the present and future climates were 980 6 and 980 2 hpa respectively the longer return period estimated a larger future change in the mcp of the ec extreme ecs below 970 hpa will increase in future climate conditions fig 6 fig 5 b shows the ensemble averaged mcp for fixed sst patterns and the present climate condition the distributions of cc ha mi and mp indicated almost the same profiles as that of the 60 year return period which was 2 3 hpa stronger than that of the present climate the distributions of gf and mr indicated a decrease of approximately 7 and 5 hpa in the 60 year return period respectively provided that the strong ecs have a longer return period the intensity of the mcp will increase in any of the sst patterns similarly the intensity of ecs varies depending on the sst pattern as well as the occurrence and passing frequency of ecs however the variability of intensity due to ssts is larger than the average future change signal 3 4 local ec characteristics extreme ecs caused severe coastal disasters in the northeastern part of japan in the winter next we analyze the characteristics of ecs in the present and future climate conditions classified into smaller domains in northeast japan the translation speed and central pressure of ecs were analyzed for 11 domains as shown in fig 7 we compared the results of reanalysis data jra 55 and d4pdf verified the agreement between jra 55 and the d4pdf in the present climate and evaluated the future change in the d4pdf fig 8 shows the box and whisker plot of the annual average of translation speed of the ec for each domain the left and right plots of each domain indicate the results in the present and future climates respectively the circles in the present climate indicate the annual average value of jra 55 the upper and lower lines of the box indicate the first and third quartiles respectively and the horizontal line in the box is the median value the upper and lower whiskers are the maximum and minimum values within the quartiles range plus 1 5 times the quartiles respectively the translation speed of ecs in jra 55 by the domains is within the range of the whiskers of the d4pdf in the present climate the translation speed decreased as the latitude increased the d4pdf estimated the increasing translation speed in northeast japan in the future the future change signal became significant to the north which is related to future changes in large scale circulations fig 9 shows future changes in zonal wind speed at 500 hpa from october to april the zonal wind speed will increase above 40n which corresponds to domains 2 4 5 7 8 10 and 11 in fig 7 the increase in the translation speed of the ec is consistent with the zonal wind distribution shown in fig 9 on the other hand the future changes in zonal wind speed in domains 1 and 3 will decrease and affect the southern domains below 40n a similar analysis was performed for the intensity of ecs fig 10 shows the box and whisker plot for the mcp of ecs by domain fig 10 a and b show the annual average value and the 10 year probability value jra 55 in almost of all domains is within the range of whiskers of both the annual average value and 10 year probability value in the present climate annual average value of jra 55 in the domains 1 5 and 8 are out of the range of d4pdf in present climate since the number of weak ecs in jra 55 is more than those in d4pdf table 1 and fig 6 the average intensity of ec in jra 55 is weaker than that in d4pdf this feature depends on the domain and the domains 1 5 and 8 show clearly the mcp decreased as the longitude and latitude increased in both climates the mcp decreased from the west to east due to the development route of the system although the range of annual average value of mcp between the present and future climate conditions differed slightly meanwhile the 10 year return values in the future climate of all domains were estimated to be smaller than those in the present climate the differences were remarkable in the high latitude domain the average future changes in the annual average value and the 10 year return value of all domains were 0 3 and 1 2 hpa respectively their first quartiles were 0 5 and 1 9 hpa respectively and their lower whisker values were 1 1 and 2 2 hpa respectively these results show that the annual average amplitude of the ec did not change or will be weaker and the ecs with a 10 year probability amplitude will be stronger in summary the ec are projected to become extreme and the scale of coastal disasters will increase e g the high waves in toyama bay in 2008 lee et al 2010 and storm surges in nemuro in 2014 saruwatari et al 2015 4 future changes in extreme waves by ecs one of the coastal disasters due to ecs is high waves along the sea of japan which is called yorimawari waves locally the development factor of high waves in the winter is strong north winds off the western coast of hokkaido and the northwest coast of the honshu area due to the strong ec propagating extremely slowly or stagnating around hokkaido analyses of ecs and related high waves around hokkaido are important to reduce wave related disasters in the northern part of japan the target area for analysis is the same as that in section 3 4 we simulated high waves due to strong and stagnant ecs under both climate conditions as the number of ensembles of d4pdf was large for computation the calculation period was limited by the strength and stagnation of ecs the conditions of the ecs to be used for calculation were that ecs have stronger mcp than the 10 year return value in the present and future climate conditions in domain 2 and that ecs stagnated around hokkaido corresponding to the domains 4 5 7 8 10 and 11 in fig 7 for more than 24 h the extracted ecs were 17 cases in the present climate and 22 cases in the future climate which were unevenly due to a northward track shift in the present and future climate conditions fig 11 shows the selected ec tracks and the bold lines mean averaged tracks in the present and future climate although the averaged tracks differed by 1 5 2 0 it would not have a significant impact on the estimation of high waves because the spatial scale of the bomb cyclone was 1000 km the extreme wave climate for the selected extreme ecs was simulated using the spectral wave model forced by the wind field of d4pdf rcm for all extracted ecs fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of the ensemble averaged maximum significant wave height mswh fig 12 a and b show the average value and standard deviation respectively the spatial distribution of the mswh ranged from 5 to 7 m along the sea of japan from the north of honshu to the noto peninsula the distribution of the standard deviation indicated small variations 1 m in the area corresponding to a large wave height along the sea of japan the area of larger mswh with a smaller standard deviation implied that the dependence of high waves on the track of ec was reduced by the criteria of selected events meanwhile the standard deviation in the pacific ocean side was large 1 m therefore the evaluation of high waves in the pacific ocean due to the ec required different criteria to select the events for example the risk evaluation of uchiura bay was performed in the southwest of hokkaido on the pacific ocean side fig 12 shows the future change in the ensemble averaged mswh the future change of extreme wave height indicated 0 5 1 0 m along the sea of japan the wave height increased beyond 0 75 m off the west coast of honshu the future decrease was evident in the east coast of hokkaido however it increased in the offshore region in addition the wave height increased beyond 0 5 m at the ishikari bay located in northwestern hokkaido the spatial distributions of the mswh and its changes differed and future changes in the mswh differed from those in the zonal wind speed as shown in fig 9 compared with winds high waves must develop and propagate long distances therefore the effects of fetch contributed significantly to changes in the mswh as shown in fig 13 the wave period is also important parameter to evaluate the coastal hazard risk because tamura et al 2020 showed that the wave ray trajectories with longer wave period were concentrated in specific locations along the coastal area with the complex topography such as toyama bay in fig 14 the distribution of the significant wave period at the mswh is depicted in fig 14 a the ensemble averaged value of the significant wave period in the present climate is shown and in fig 14 b the future change in the ensemble average is depicted the ensemble average of the significant wave period in the present climate was beyond 10 s along the sea of japan the wave condition along the sea of japan was an outstanding swell and the results of wave height and wave period agreed with the extracting condition for the ec an increasing distribution was shown in the significant wave period beyond 0 25 s along the sea of japan in particular for the coastal area from the toyama bay to niigata a large future change exceeding 0 5 s was estimated in addition a similar increasing trend was observed in ishikari bay based on these results the strengthening of ecs and the risk of coastal disasters will increase in areas where disasters have occurred in recent years in terms of both wave height and wave period 5 conclusion we developed a fast and simple algorithm for extracting ecs from slp a new algorithm was applied to the large ensemble dataset d4pdf and the future change analysis of ecs was conducted subsequently we evaluated the risk of high waves caused by ecs the results obtained in this study are as follows ec tracks were classified into the tracks of the sea of japan and pacific ocean the number of ecs that passed over the pacific ocean decreased whereas the number that passed over the sea of japan increased significantly the annual average of the mcp of the ec around japan did not change but the 10 to 60 year probability value will increase in the future a detailed analysis based on a small domain showed the same trend regarding the intensity of the ec we conducted wave simulations using the d4pdf wind in the present and future climates the simulations targeting the yorimawari wave were conducted for the period when strong ecs were stagnant around hokkaido the ensemble averaged value of the estimated significant wave height increased from 0 5 to 1 0 m along the sea of japan the standard deviation of the significant wave height was small and we confirmed that the extracting condition targeting the yorimawari wave yielded good results the significant wave period at the mswh along the sea of japan increased to beyond 0 25 s the method used in this study can be applied to north america and europe funding this work was supported by the integrated research program for advancing climate models tougou grant number jpmxd0717935498 from the

20322,in this study we evaluate the effect of climate change on explosive cyclones ecs using mega ensemble projection data d4pdf which has 50 members of 60 years present climate experiments and 90 members of 60 years 4k future climate experiments subsequently we evaluate the future change of coastal hazards due to high swell waves called yorimawari waves caused by strong and stagnant ecs around japan the number of ecs passing over the sea of japan increased but the number passing over the pacific ocean decreased under future climate the annual average of the minimum central pressure mcp of the ec did not change but the 10 to 60 year probability value increased for the future wave simulations with the d4pdf wind conditions for ecs with an mcp of the 10 year probability value that stagnated for over 24 h around hokkaido were conducted the ensemble average of the maximum significant wave height increased from 0 5 to 1 0 m along the sea of japan the significant wave period increased by over 0 25 s however the standard deviation was as large as the wave height of future change the wave height of high waves depends on the characteristics of the ec keywords extratropical cyclone explosive cyclone climate change high waves large ensemble d4pdf 1 introduction the latest ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate srocc ipcc 2019 indicates that the intensity of extreme phenomena will increase due to climate change an explosive cyclone ec also known as a bomb cyclone is an extreme phenomenon that occurs around japan in winter especially in the northern part of japan it is defined as an intensive extratropical cyclone which decreases by approximately 24 hpa or more at the center of the cyclone in 24 h sanders and davis 1988 its characteristics such as an asymmetric structure its occurrence between october and march and stagnating for a long period of over 24 h differ from those of typhoons japan has suffered from coastal disasters due to ecs for example on february 24 2008 large swells with a significant wave height of 9 92 m and a significant wave period of 16 2 s at the toyama point 20 m depth by japanese wave observation network nowphas nationwide ocean wave information network for ports and harbours were induced by an ec in japan this swell event caused 1 casualty and 15 injuries along coastal area of toyama bay in the sea of japan kawasaki et al 2008 ranasinghe et al 2010 on december 16 2014 an ec induced an approximately 1 7 m storm surge that caused inundation at nemuro in hokkaido saruwatari et al 2014 bricker et al 2015 the ec disasters are not unique to japan they are also found in north america and europe feser et al 2015 bärring and von storch 2004 gulev et al 2001 some studies have indicated that the observed frequency and intensity of ecs in winter over the last few decades has increased and this trend is projected to continue in the future graham and diaz 2001 langenberg et al 1999 several studies related to ecs in japan have been conducted mori et al 2017 analyzed the characteristics of ecs around japan in the past 55 years using the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 by the japanese meteorological agency they demonstrated that although the genesis frequency of the ec exhibited a decreasing trend weakly the intensity of them especially strong ec showed an increasing trend since 1958 yoshida and asuma 2004 summarized the characteristics and development mechanism of ecs based on three classified tracks as well as their development related to the eddies at upper and lower air the latent heat flux from the sea surface in the pacific northwest to investigate the effect of climate change on coastal disasters in east asia shimura et al 2014 estimated future changes in wave climates based on horizontal 60 km resolution wave projections using the meteorological research institute atmospheric general circulation model mri agcm3 2h and showed an increasing trend of the maximum wave heights in eastern japan due to climate change however research on future changes in regional coastal disasters has been performed based on a small number of ensemble results using time slice experiments typically 20 25 years however statistical evaluations of low frequency phenomena are difficult to perform based on a small number or decal length of experiments therefore mori et al 2016 conducted mega ensemble projections using the database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf integrating over 5000 years of both present and future 4k warmer climate conditions mori et al 2016 evaluated future changes in storm surges caused by typhoons using d4pdf which is a large climate dataset comprising data of extreme events over 100 years and showed an increase in storm surge height of approximately 0 5 m for the 100 year probability value in osaka bay japan however studies regarding future changes in ecs and coastal disasters caused by climate change are rare in this study we evaluate the effect of climate change on ecs involving in disasters in japan using d4pdf and investigate the future change of coastal hazards due to ecs in particular yorimawari waves in the sea of japan first outline of ec dataset based on d4pdf is explained in detail second the changes in ec characteristics due to climate change is analyzed targeting around japan third the application of ec dataset to yorimawari waves is investigated in the northern part of japan 2 methodology 2 1 overview of dataset 2 1 1 d4pdf climate projection dataset a future scenario was developed using the mega ensemble projection for climate change d4pdf by performing a large number of climate simulations using high resolution global and regional atmospheric models mizuta et al 2017 simulation experiments were designed such that past climate signals and future changes in mean climate and extreme events such as heavy rainfall and tropical cyclones can be detected with high statistical confidence in d4pdf simulations global surface air temperatures are climatologically constant at 4 k relative to post industrial levels corresponding to the end of the 21st century in the rcp8 5 representative concentration pathway scenario experiments of the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project 5 participating models global general and regional circulation climate models gcm and rcm of 60 and 20 km meshes were used for present and future climate simulations respectively the 60 km mesh resolution was approximately twice as high as those of most cmip6 participating models in order to decrease calculation cost and increase the number of ensemble members reproduce of extreme events such as typhoons needs several kilometers resolution so gcm may weakly estimate extreme events gcm used in the simulation was the meteorological research institute atmospheric general circulation model version 3 2 mri agcm3 2 mizuta et al 2012 and the regional model was mri nonhydrostatic regional climate model nhrcm sasaki et al 2011 murata et al 2013 covering the japan islands to investigate various effects of climate change on japan fig 1 the ensemble members of every experiment exceeded 50 and a pair of both global and regional simulations was available for each simulation type all simulations were conducted by integrating the models forced by the prescribed sea surface temperature sst and sea ice concentration sic future ssts and sics used in these simulations were detrended observations added to the sst future change distribution of cmip5 rcp8 5 experiments using six different atmosphere ocean gcms the uncertainties in the cmip5 scenario experiments were accounted for by the future change of the six cmip5 models selected six cmip5 models were ccsm4 cc gfdl cm3 gf hadgem2 ao ha miroc5 mi mpi esm mr mp and mri cgcm3 mr the results of d4pdf have been widely analyzed and applied to different sectors of impact assessment in japan ishii and mori 2020 we analyzed the ec using the d4pdf rcm experiment results the d4pdf had a 20 km horizontal and 1 h temporal resolution the d4pdf was performed under observed sst with 50 kinds of perturbations in present climate and under six future ssts with 15 kinds of perturbation in future climate experiment as the initial and boundary conditions 1 present climate experiment september 1950 august 2011 60 years 50 members total 3000 years 2 4k future climate experiment september 2050 august 2111 60 years 90 members 6 gcms 15 perturbation total 5400 years the conditions of 4k future climate experiments were defined as the constant conditions in which the global average temperature increased by 4k compared with the age of the industrial revolution 1850 because the global warming trend was not included throughout the experimental period the comparison between 4k future climate experiments and non warming experiments is able to evaluate the impact of climate change since there are not non warming experiments of d4pdf rcm a rigorous comparison with pre industrial climate is not possible however the similar line in previous study analyzing jra 55 by mori et al 2017 showed only a weak trend that cannot be distinguished from natural variability in both intensity and frequency from 1958 to 2011 based on their finding this study compares the present climate experiments with 4k future climate the variables of d4pdf dataset used in this study are slp sea level pressure and u10 v10 eastward northward wind at 10 m height 2 1 2 jra 55 reanalysis atmospheric dataset the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 is one of the latest reanalysis dataset of atmosphere kobayashi et al 2015 jra 55 provides data on atmospheric variables at 60 km horizontal grids its resolution is coarse to reproduce the extreme atmospheric phenomena but jra 55 has high reliability around japan and the other regions due to the data assimilation jra 55 is used to evaluate the present climate experiment of d4pdf jra 55 faithfully reproduces historical environment however historical environment does not represent climatic values we must be careful that the variables based on large number of samples such as monthly averaged temperature and daily precipitation in jra 55 will be included in the probability distribution of d4pdf while the variables based on small number of samples in jra 55 may be outlier of d4pdf 2 2 method of extracting ec we developed a standard and fast extracting ec method for long term d4pdf developed method uses spatial and temporal changes in slp for the analysis period from october to april the ec is defined as an extratropical low pressure which the central pressure drops more than 24 hpa sin ϕ sin 60 ϕ is the latitude degree in 24 h by japan meteorological agency fig 2 illustrates the algorithm for detecting and tracking the ec the extraction procedure comprised following three steps step 1 pertains to the search for the cyclone center first the slp spatial distribution was smoothed by a gaussian filter to remove the noise that caused the error we removed the grids at altitudes higher than 1500 m because the grids had a lower slp because of the error from sea level correction subsequently the grid that was at least 1 hpa smaller than the average slp surrounding grids was extracted as a candidate for the center of the cyclone for every snapshot when multiple centers were detected in a 3 radius area the center with the smallest slp was selected step 2 involves tracking the extracted cyclone center in step 1 the detection area of the next time step center was within travel distances of 1 5 h to the east and west and 1 0 h to the north and south respectively if multiple centers are detected in the detection area then the center with the smallest slp is selected as the next time step center we set the lifetime of the cyclone to be more than 24 h in order to exclude the disappeared low pressure due to the fusion of multiple low pressures step 3 is to assess whether the tracked cyclone in step 2 is an ec we set two criteria occurrence season and the maximum development rate of the central pressure the ec typically occurred during winter and spring in the target region i e from november to april yoshida and asuma 2004 defined the development rate as ε p t 12 p t 12 24 sin 60 sin ϕ t where p is the central pressure of the cyclone in slp hpa t is the time h and ϕ is the latitude degree the development rates for d4pdf and jra 55 are calculated every 1 hour and every 6 hours respectively subsequently the maximum development rate of the central pressure of 1 0 or more is judged as ec the influence of temporal resolution to the calculation of development rate is small although this extracting algorithm does not distinguish a typhoon from an ec for the atmospheric reanalysis dataset jra 55 it extracted 1047 ecs including two typhoons 0 19 over 60 years this algorithm is simple fast and sufficiently accurate in the following section we analyze the calculated ec database 2 3 wave modeling we evaluate the yorimawari wave that is one of the high wave events in winter at toyama bay in japan generally yorimawari wave is defined by their generation process and there are various criteria for the observed wave height and period for example the significant wave height and period are more than 1 m and 10 s or more than 2 m and 8 s yorimawari wave is caused by strong and stagnant ecs around east coast of hokkaido and seasonal pressure distribution in winter the strong pressure gradient causes strong northerly winds over the eastern sea of japan which develops high waves developed high waves reach toyama bay which has a steep and complex topography and bring disaster to the toyama coastal area tamura et al 2020 the future change of extreme waves caused by the extreme ecs is investigated by the spectral wave modeling simulating waves nearshore ver 41 10 swan booij et al 1999 is used swan is one of the open source models and is used in many researches in this study swan is forced by the wind fields u10 and v10 of d4pdf rcm 20 km resolution for ecs the calculation domain used in swan is 135 150 east longitude and 36 46 5 north latitude with 0 1 resolution the directional resolution is 10 and the frequency is set from 0 05 to 1 0 hz with 30 bins the calculation period is the duration when the ecs were extracted bathymetry is interpolated from gebco 2014 calculation conditions are activated with default parameters of swan tamura et al 2020 showed that it is difficult to reproduce the waves along the coast of toyama bay with a spectral wave model we extract the ecs that cause yorimawari wave and evaluate the swells at the mouth of toyama bay 3 analysis results and discussion 3 1 frequency of ecs to investigate the future change in the number of ecs around japan due to climate change we compared the characteristics of the extracted ec under the present and future climates of the d4pdf furthermore we compared the reanalysis data jra 55 to validate the present climate simulation of d4pdf in table 1 the annual average numbers of extracted ecs in jra 55 and d4pdf in the present and future climates respectively are shown the results of the future climate show each sst ensemble the baseline ec frequency by jra 55 was 17 45 y the frequency of d4pdf in the present climate was 10 15 y based on the 50 case ensemble average whereas that in the future climate was 10 56 y based on the 90 case ensemble average the ec frequency by jra 55 indicates a larger number of occurrences than that by the d4pdf in the present climate owing to the differences in modeling conditions between jra 55 and d4pdf due to the general circulation model and rcm data assimilation and horizontal resolution however it is difficult to discuss the differences in the model characteristics from this result regarding data assimilation and horizontal resolution some studies reported that high resolution modeling and using data assimilation reproduced accurate typhoons but the literature on ecs is limited although jra 55 is a 60 km global reanalysis with a lower resolution than the regional d4pdf dataset 20 km data assimilation is effective for reproducing the ec the differences between jra 55 and d4pdf present climate runs require further studies the d4pdf in the future climate estimates a slightly larger number than that in the present climate the standard deviations in the present and future climates were 2 09 and 0 71 respectively the t test for the number of ecs around japan showed that the future change in the number of ec was not statistically significant at the p 0 05 level and an increasing trend was not significantly detected furthermore the results for each sst change pattern presented a small standard deviation from 0 27 to 0 41 the distribution of sst may be related to the number of occurrences of ecs however we did not obtain a characteristic parameter between the sst change distribution around japan and the number of ecs a more detailed analysis including daily changes in sst and cyclone development is necessary 3 2 ec track in fig 3 the annual average frequencies of ec track in jra 55 present and future climate conditions of d4pdf are shown the ec tracks can be classified into two major routes one is over the sea of japan and the other is along the southern coast of japan over the pacific ocean these tracks in jra 55 and d4pdf agree with the previous results of yoshida and asuma 2004 although the frequency distributions of ecs in jra 55 and d4pdf in the present climate are similar the estimated number of ecs in d4pdf is underestimated by approximately 62 over the pacific ocean and 30 over the sea of japan compared to jra 55 the frequency of ecs along the pacific side in d4pdf in the present climate was three times larger than that on the sea of japan side the average frequency of ecs passing along the southern coastal area of honshu island was 1 1 y in present climates meanwhile the future change in the intensity of ecs over the sea of japan was stronger than that on the pacific side the details of the intensity change of ecs will be discussed in the next section fig 4 shows the future changes in the frequency of ecs future minus present fig 4 a shows that the mean frequency change of ecs over the pacific ocean decreased in the future climate whereas the frequency passing over the sea of japan increased by the same magnitude in addition the trends of future changes in frequency over the pacific ocean and the sea of japan were rejected at 95 by the t test and shown to be statistically significant the main cause of the frequency changes was the northward shift of the westerly winds due to climate change which is consistent with ipcc srocc ipcc 2019 and other recent studies the magnitudes of the frequency changes were 10 over the pacific ocean and 28 over the sea of japan compared with the frequency in the present climate table 2 the future change in the frequency under each sst pattern is shown in fig 4 b almost all trends of future change agreed with the ensemble average but the frequency under the mi condition increased over the pacific ocean the d4pdf in the future climate estimated a shift in the ec track from south to north and a part of the sst pattern suggested that it would affect the ec track as spatial patterns of sst were forced in the mri agcm all patterns can occur in the same rcp scenario the changes in the sst patterns at the global scale indicated significant differences in the regional scale climate 3 3 central pressure of extreme ecs as the average frequency of ecs will be increased as shown in table 2 it is important to analyze future changes in ecs table 3 shows the annual mean minimum central pressure of ecs by track the ecs in the present climate are stronger than those of the jra 55 and the averaged intensity of ecs is not consistent with jra 55 future change indicates enhancements fig 5 a shows the return period of the minimum central pressure mcp of the ec based on extreme value analysis in the present and future climate conditions the return periods are calculated from the ranking of mcps in each 60 year ensemble member the hatched areas are the envelopes of maximum and minimum values by the ensemble members in the present and future climate the thick lines indicate the ensemble averaged values the black line represents the extreme distribution by jra 55 the extreme ec intensity by jra 55 estimated a stronger ec below the 10 year return period than the strongest member of the d4pdf in the present climate however the intensity of the ec from a 10 to 60 year return period in jra 55 included the range of d4pdf members it should be noted here that the past reanalysis only represents one scenario in the past climate although the weak ecs of d4pdf in the present climate were underestimated based on the jra 55 d4pdf yielded a reasonable estimation of strong ecs the variance of each ensemble member was 17 hpa in the present climate and 29 hpa in the future climate at a 60 year return period and the difference in the ensemble averages of the present and future climates was approximately 2 3 hpa from the 1 to 60 year return period the averages of all ecs mcp around japan in the present and future climates were 980 6 and 980 2 hpa respectively the longer return period estimated a larger future change in the mcp of the ec extreme ecs below 970 hpa will increase in future climate conditions fig 6 fig 5 b shows the ensemble averaged mcp for fixed sst patterns and the present climate condition the distributions of cc ha mi and mp indicated almost the same profiles as that of the 60 year return period which was 2 3 hpa stronger than that of the present climate the distributions of gf and mr indicated a decrease of approximately 7 and 5 hpa in the 60 year return period respectively provided that the strong ecs have a longer return period the intensity of the mcp will increase in any of the sst patterns similarly the intensity of ecs varies depending on the sst pattern as well as the occurrence and passing frequency of ecs however the variability of intensity due to ssts is larger than the average future change signal 3 4 local ec characteristics extreme ecs caused severe coastal disasters in the northeastern part of japan in the winter next we analyze the characteristics of ecs in the present and future climate conditions classified into smaller domains in northeast japan the translation speed and central pressure of ecs were analyzed for 11 domains as shown in fig 7 we compared the results of reanalysis data jra 55 and d4pdf verified the agreement between jra 55 and the d4pdf in the present climate and evaluated the future change in the d4pdf fig 8 shows the box and whisker plot of the annual average of translation speed of the ec for each domain the left and right plots of each domain indicate the results in the present and future climates respectively the circles in the present climate indicate the annual average value of jra 55 the upper and lower lines of the box indicate the first and third quartiles respectively and the horizontal line in the box is the median value the upper and lower whiskers are the maximum and minimum values within the quartiles range plus 1 5 times the quartiles respectively the translation speed of ecs in jra 55 by the domains is within the range of the whiskers of the d4pdf in the present climate the translation speed decreased as the latitude increased the d4pdf estimated the increasing translation speed in northeast japan in the future the future change signal became significant to the north which is related to future changes in large scale circulations fig 9 shows future changes in zonal wind speed at 500 hpa from october to april the zonal wind speed will increase above 40n which corresponds to domains 2 4 5 7 8 10 and 11 in fig 7 the increase in the translation speed of the ec is consistent with the zonal wind distribution shown in fig 9 on the other hand the future changes in zonal wind speed in domains 1 and 3 will decrease and affect the southern domains below 40n a similar analysis was performed for the intensity of ecs fig 10 shows the box and whisker plot for the mcp of ecs by domain fig 10 a and b show the annual average value and the 10 year probability value jra 55 in almost of all domains is within the range of whiskers of both the annual average value and 10 year probability value in the present climate annual average value of jra 55 in the domains 1 5 and 8 are out of the range of d4pdf in present climate since the number of weak ecs in jra 55 is more than those in d4pdf table 1 and fig 6 the average intensity of ec in jra 55 is weaker than that in d4pdf this feature depends on the domain and the domains 1 5 and 8 show clearly the mcp decreased as the longitude and latitude increased in both climates the mcp decreased from the west to east due to the development route of the system although the range of annual average value of mcp between the present and future climate conditions differed slightly meanwhile the 10 year return values in the future climate of all domains were estimated to be smaller than those in the present climate the differences were remarkable in the high latitude domain the average future changes in the annual average value and the 10 year return value of all domains were 0 3 and 1 2 hpa respectively their first quartiles were 0 5 and 1 9 hpa respectively and their lower whisker values were 1 1 and 2 2 hpa respectively these results show that the annual average amplitude of the ec did not change or will be weaker and the ecs with a 10 year probability amplitude will be stronger in summary the ec are projected to become extreme and the scale of coastal disasters will increase e g the high waves in toyama bay in 2008 lee et al 2010 and storm surges in nemuro in 2014 saruwatari et al 2015 4 future changes in extreme waves by ecs one of the coastal disasters due to ecs is high waves along the sea of japan which is called yorimawari waves locally the development factor of high waves in the winter is strong north winds off the western coast of hokkaido and the northwest coast of the honshu area due to the strong ec propagating extremely slowly or stagnating around hokkaido analyses of ecs and related high waves around hokkaido are important to reduce wave related disasters in the northern part of japan the target area for analysis is the same as that in section 3 4 we simulated high waves due to strong and stagnant ecs under both climate conditions as the number of ensembles of d4pdf was large for computation the calculation period was limited by the strength and stagnation of ecs the conditions of the ecs to be used for calculation were that ecs have stronger mcp than the 10 year return value in the present and future climate conditions in domain 2 and that ecs stagnated around hokkaido corresponding to the domains 4 5 7 8 10 and 11 in fig 7 for more than 24 h the extracted ecs were 17 cases in the present climate and 22 cases in the future climate which were unevenly due to a northward track shift in the present and future climate conditions fig 11 shows the selected ec tracks and the bold lines mean averaged tracks in the present and future climate although the averaged tracks differed by 1 5 2 0 it would not have a significant impact on the estimation of high waves because the spatial scale of the bomb cyclone was 1000 km the extreme wave climate for the selected extreme ecs was simulated using the spectral wave model forced by the wind field of d4pdf rcm for all extracted ecs fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of the ensemble averaged maximum significant wave height mswh fig 12 a and b show the average value and standard deviation respectively the spatial distribution of the mswh ranged from 5 to 7 m along the sea of japan from the north of honshu to the noto peninsula the distribution of the standard deviation indicated small variations 1 m in the area corresponding to a large wave height along the sea of japan the area of larger mswh with a smaller standard deviation implied that the dependence of high waves on the track of ec was reduced by the criteria of selected events meanwhile the standard deviation in the pacific ocean side was large 1 m therefore the evaluation of high waves in the pacific ocean due to the ec required different criteria to select the events for example the risk evaluation of uchiura bay was performed in the southwest of hokkaido on the pacific ocean side fig 12 shows the future change in the ensemble averaged mswh the future change of extreme wave height indicated 0 5 1 0 m along the sea of japan the wave height increased beyond 0 75 m off the west coast of honshu the future decrease was evident in the east coast of hokkaido however it increased in the offshore region in addition the wave height increased beyond 0 5 m at the ishikari bay located in northwestern hokkaido the spatial distributions of the mswh and its changes differed and future changes in the mswh differed from those in the zonal wind speed as shown in fig 9 compared with winds high waves must develop and propagate long distances therefore the effects of fetch contributed significantly to changes in the mswh as shown in fig 13 the wave period is also important parameter to evaluate the coastal hazard risk because tamura et al 2020 showed that the wave ray trajectories with longer wave period were concentrated in specific locations along the coastal area with the complex topography such as toyama bay in fig 14 the distribution of the significant wave period at the mswh is depicted in fig 14 a the ensemble averaged value of the significant wave period in the present climate is shown and in fig 14 b the future change in the ensemble average is depicted the ensemble average of the significant wave period in the present climate was beyond 10 s along the sea of japan the wave condition along the sea of japan was an outstanding swell and the results of wave height and wave period agreed with the extracting condition for the ec an increasing distribution was shown in the significant wave period beyond 0 25 s along the sea of japan in particular for the coastal area from the toyama bay to niigata a large future change exceeding 0 5 s was estimated in addition a similar increasing trend was observed in ishikari bay based on these results the strengthening of ecs and the risk of coastal disasters will increase in areas where disasters have occurred in recent years in terms of both wave height and wave period 5 conclusion we developed a fast and simple algorithm for extracting ecs from slp a new algorithm was applied to the large ensemble dataset d4pdf and the future change analysis of ecs was conducted subsequently we evaluated the risk of high waves caused by ecs the results obtained in this study are as follows ec tracks were classified into the tracks of the sea of japan and pacific ocean the number of ecs that passed over the pacific ocean decreased whereas the number that passed over the sea of japan increased significantly the annual average of the mcp of the ec around japan did not change but the 10 to 60 year probability value will increase in the future a detailed analysis based on a small domain showed the same trend regarding the intensity of the ec we conducted wave simulations using the d4pdf wind in the present and future climates the simulations targeting the yorimawari wave were conducted for the period when strong ecs were stagnant around hokkaido the ensemble averaged value of the estimated significant wave height increased from 0 5 to 1 0 m along the sea of japan the standard deviation of the significant wave height was small and we confirmed that the extracting condition targeting the yorimawari wave yielded good results the significant wave period at the mswh along the sea of japan increased to beyond 0 25 s the method used in this study can be applied to north america and europe funding this work was supported by the integrated research program for advancing climate models tougou grant number jpmxd0717935498 from the

20323,due to the lack of sheltered area norwegian fish farms are expanding to more exposed and remote sites the severe environmental conditions in exposed sites can increase the risk of structural failure during aquaculture operations in the present study the program fhsim is employed to conduct time domain simulations to investigate structural responses of a single cage and 1 4 multi cage fish farm due to breakages in mooring lines the influences on the tension distribution in the mooring system and the displacement of the buoys due to breakage at different mooring lines are analysed in detail based on the analysis a method to identify the broken mooring line and to predict the maximum tension increment in the remaining mooring lines is proposed the results indicate that the breakage at one mooring line is unlikely to cause a progressive collapse of the fish farm immediately when the current velocity is less than 0 5 m s however these breakages may cause structural collapses and fish escapes when the current and waves increase in order to prevent fish escapes suggestions to improve the mooring system design and recommendations for monitoring during operations are given keywords norwegian fish farm mooring line breakages mooring system numerical simulation grid moored fish farm 1 introduction the expanding global population together with stagnation in capture fisheries is driving the demand for aquaculture products according to the report by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2020 the global population is expected to reach nine billion by the middle of the twenty first century food production from aquaculture is expected to exceed traditional capture fisheries in 2021 fredheim and reve 2018 and will be the main contributor to global food production as the population increases fao 2020 statistics show that marine finfish production is dominated by atlantic salmon salmo salar and norwegian production accounts for more than 50 of the global salmon production while the norwegian coast provides a favourable production environment the success of marine aquaculture in norway is based on regulations and design guidelines which are established to support sustainable aquaculture fish farming in norway is regulated through production licenses issued and regulated by the directorate of fisheries based on the aquaculture act norwegian directorate of fisheries 2005 the regulation limits the number of aquaculture farms but also impose requirements on planning design and operation in order to reduce adverse side effects such as waste parasites and escape of farmed salmon escapes of farmed fish can cause an economic loss for fish farmers threat the wild fish populations and reduce the societal acceptance of the aquaculture industry fig 1 shows the production of farmed salmon and the number of escaped salmon in norway in the period between 2000 and 2019 statistics norway 2020 the salmon production grows rapidly during the years 2000 2013 which lead to an increase in the number of fish escapes especially before 2006 according to moe føre and thorvaldsen 2021 92 of fish escapes were triggered by technological factors such as submergence of the net top and holes in nettings the norwegian standard ns 9415 standards norway 2009 on the design operation and installation of fish farms was introduced in 2004 berstad et al 2004 and compliance was ensured through the aquaculture act this technical standard was revised in 2009 and enforced correspondingly in 2011 the implementation of ns 9415 increases technological investments and reduces the number of escaped fish according to the report by moe føre et al 2019 82 of fish escapes in the period 2014 2018 happened during normal operations such as handling weights and netting in preparation for delousing in the last decade human and organisational factors during in situ operations instead of technological factor have been identified as dominant underlying causes for fish escapes thorvaldsen et al 2015 2018 fish farming is a complex process with various in situ operations such as delousing process changing cleaning netting and transfer of fish these operations usually involve a number of operators different types of equipment and well boats høyli 2016 during operations well boats can bring substantial forces on mooring lines as they are moored to aquaculture structures according to the research by shen et al 2019 loads on anchor lines can increase 40 due to the existence of well boats even under modest current velocities of 0 3 m s furthermore underwater structural failures such as tears on netting and mooring line breakage may be difficult to detect during operations these unaware structural failures may lead to fish escapes tang et al 2019 investigated structural responses of a single cage fish farm due to mooring line breakages the results indicated that tensions in the remaining mooring lines could increase up to 1 75 times compared to those under intact condition in order to prevent fish escapes a quick approach to detect and identify structural failures during operations is necessary yang et al 2020a this quick approach needs comprehensive analyses in the design phase on the structural responses of fish farms due to various structural failures when the fish farms are established in exposed and remote areas understanding how the surface visible parts of the structure are influenced by the combination of current and broken lines can lead to fast identification of failures by remote operators however to the best of our knowledge such analyses are rarely reported in literature a marine fish farm is built to support the containment netting with components floater weight system interconnecting ropes mooring lines anchor and supporting buoys a typical norwegian marine fish farm is illustrated in fig 2 these structures have complex topology regarding the interconnection of structure members and combinations of elastic stiff and permeable structures a comprehensive model is needed to analyse such structures and considerable research effort has been spent to analyse the physical effects of fish farm structures endresen et al 2013 developed a numerical tool to calculate the total drag force and deformation of a fish farm under complex sea conditions zhao et al 2013a employed a porous media model to simulate the flow through a net panel and showed that the velocity reduction downstream from one net panel is 11 bi et al 2014 proposed a coupled fluid structure model to study the weak effect after a fish cage and showed that the maximum velocity reductions downstream from a single fish cage are 17 5 zhao et al 2013b established a numerical model for multi cage fish farm using a porous media model and showed 69 of velocity reduction when the flow passed through 4 cages gutiérrez romero et al 2020 comprehensively analysed a fish farm under combined wave and current conditions using a fluid structure interaction method all the above studies proved that the numerical method is accurate enough to predict the structural responses of a fish farm under various current and wave conditions thus the effects of mooring line breakage on dynamic responses of grid moored fish farms are investigated through numerical simulations in the present study with complex in situ operations which can lead to increased loads on different structure members it is important to understand how breakage in any part of the fish farm will affect the response and load distribution in the present study the structural responses of a fish farm due to mooring line breakages under operational conditions i e current velocity is less than 0 5 m s are comprehensively analysed in sections 2 and 3 the numerical model and the description of fish farms are presented respectively results and detailed analysis are given in section 4 finally the results of this study are summarised in the conclusions 2 numerical model 2 1 fhsim framework in the present study numerical models of full scale fish farms are prepared in fhsim which is a modular analysis program developed by sintef ocean this program has been validated with experiments and extensively used for the analysis of fish farms endresen et al 2013 endresen et al 2014 reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 and the validations showed satisfactory results for current velocities less than 0 7 m s with a discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results in the region of 7 fig 3 represents how variables i e displacement velocity and force are transferred across the objects representing a fish farm during numerical analysis in fhsim a newly compiled module the mooring system in fig 3 was implemented in the existing program to represent a conventional grid mooring system by implementing the new module the initial setup and the exchange of forces become efficient since all the objects in the mooring system are packed into one single module this new module has also been successfully applied in the numerical simulations of a 2 4 multi cage fish farm by sim et al 2021 fhsim supports the use of several different integration methods including euler method heun s method and runge kutta method in this study the runge kutta method with variable time steps is used for numerical integration the mooring system and netting are modelled as collections of interconnected discrete rigid bodies and mass points respectively the rigid bodies or elements that comprise the mooring system are connected by constraint forces that replicate a linear strain stress relationship between the elements with an explicit elastic baumgarte stabilization technique skjong et al 2021 the mass of the netting are lumped into mass points and interconnected as triangular elements where structural forces are calculated along the netting twines as in and distributed evenly to the three interconnected mass points priour 1999 the response of the structure is calculated in the time domain with equations 1 m q f s q f g f b f h q q where q is the time dependent vector of nodal displacements m is the mass matrix f s is the force vector for the structural forces acting on the mass f g is the force vector due to gravity f b is the force vector due to buoyancy and f h is the force vector for the hydrodynamic forces by solving eq 1 the cage net deformations can be acquired 2 2 structural model the netting in the present study is discretised based on the triangular element method proposed by priour 2013 the triangular elements are interconnected through nodes and the total mass of the netting is distributed onto these nodes the environmental loads acting on a triangular element are computed as the total loads acting on individual twines within the triangular element and distributed onto its corresponding nodes enerhaug et al 2012 the buoy is modelled as vertical circular cylinders with a conical bottom it is given 5 degrees of freedom dof where rotation around its vertical axis is omitted fredriksson et al 2014 anchor lines frame lines bridles and other components with cable like properties are modelled using discrete rigid body elements combined into cables with a inter element dynamic constraint formulation on axial and angular displacements the sinker tube is modelled by the same discrete element type as used in the cable but with two endpoints connected to create a circle the tension in a cable like element is calculated as a constraint force skjong et al 2021 where the parameters of the baumgarte stabilization between elements are selected to give a linear material response 2 f e a l l 0 l 0 where e is young s modulus of the material a is the section area of the cable l 0 is the unstretched length of the cable and l is the length of the cable the mathematical and theoretical descriptions for the cable like elements in fhsim are given by johansen 2007 and skjong et al 2021 the floating collar is modelled as a flexible continuous circular ring using beam elements it is divided into sections and for each section the radial and vertical responses are calculated using the euler beam equations eq 3 3 f r s t m 2 v t 2 e i 4 v s 4 1 r 2 2 v s f z s t m 2 z d t 2 e i 4 z d s 4 where v and z are the radial and vertical responses of the floater respectively m is the mass per unit length of the floater ei is the bending stiffness of the floater f r is the radial force on the floater per unit length and f z is the vertical force on the floater per unit length 2 3 hydrodynamic model in this study the hydrodynamic forces acting on the triangular element is calculated by integrating the force on individual twines within the triangular element individual twine is regarded as a smooth cylinder and its hydrodynamic force is calculated using quadratic drag formulation in case of inclined twines due to the geometry or deformation of the cage the hydrodynamic forces on twines are decomposed into normal force f n and tangential force f t as shown in eq 2 4 f n 0 5 c n ρ a u n u n f t 0 5 c t ρ a u t u t where u n and u t are the normal and tangential components of the relative flow velocity for each twine respectively c n c t are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively and are dependent on reynolds number re a is the reference area which is the product of the length and the diameter of a twine c t is assigned with a constant value of 0 01 for all re and c n is taken from the experimental data as a seventh order polynomial function of the logarithmic re which is limited in the range of 32 and 104 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 cheng et al 2020a 5 c n 78 46675 254 73873 l o

study focuses on typical norwegian fish cages which include a double pipe floating collar a cage net cylindrical net structure with conical bottom ropes for supporting the weight system chains connecting cage net and sinker tube a sinker tube and a centre point weight in order to keep fish cages at targeted locations a grid mooring system that includes anchors buoys connection plates bridles buoy lines anchor lines and frame lines should be properly designed according to the environmental conditions fig 2 illustrates how these components are interconnected in a typical norwegian fish farm the topological relationship of the aforementioned components in numerical simulations is shown in fig 3 the dimensions and physical properties of the main components used in this paper are listed in table 1 3 2 single cage fish farm fig 4 shows an overview of the single cage fish farm the mooring lines are named following matrix style reflecting the matrix like structure of the grid mooring system mx represents the mooring lines along x axis the first digit of the index number after mx represents the index of the line in the y direction and the second digit represents the index of the line in the x direction the my lines along y direction are labelled in a similar fashion since this model only contains one fish cage the mooring lines whose name ends with number 1 are frame lines and the rest are anchor lines the labels of buoys follow the same matrix fashion starting with b with the following two numbers indicating the location in the mooring frame fig 5 shows the time series of the numerical results for this single cage fish farm with a current velocity of 0 5 m s and current direction θ 0 although the simulation is under pure current conditions oscillations are observed in the numerical results these oscillations come from the nonlinearity of the system which is also reported by antonutti et al 2018 and cheng et al 2021 the oscillations are deemed acceptable as the standard deviation for the time series force over the last 100 s is 3 1 of the mean force the time series results indicate that the simulation reaches the steady state after 300 s hereafter the tensions in mooring lines and displacements of buoys are time averaged under steady state conditions fig 6 shows the deformation of the single cage fish farm in a steady state condition due to the pre tensions in mooring lines the displacements of other components such as floating collar and mooring lines are unnoticeable 3 3 1x4 multi cage fish farm fig 7 shows the plan view of the 1x4 multi cage fish farm the labels of mooring lines and buoys follow the same rule as the single cage fish farm the longest axis of this fish farm is along the x axis as the four fish cages are arranged along x axis these mooring lines along x axis whose name ends with a number between 1 and 4 are frame lines and these mooring lines along y axis whose name ends with number 1 are frame lines the fish cage is named cage1 to cage4 from left to right the labels of buoys also follow the matrix style fig 8 shows the time series of the numerical results for this 1x4 multi cage fish farm when current velocity is 0 5 m s and current direction θ 0 oscillations of drag force are also observed in the numerical results the standard deviation for the time series drag force over the last 100 s is up to 5 3 of the mean drag force for the four cages due to the existence of the upstream fish cags the current velocity for the downstream fish cage is reduced the fish cage located downstream e g cage2 experiences a smaller current velocity compared to cage1 thus cage2 experience a smaller current load the smaller current load makes cage2 has less deformation and larger cultivation volume than cage1 thus the volume and drag force of the four fish cages are different due to the different experienced current velocities the mechanism that causes the current velocity reduction in the downstream location is the weak effect the detailed explanations and discussions for the weak effect can refer to cheng et al 2020b and sim et al 2021 here only the final expression for the current velocity in the rear of a fish cage u rear x y is presented 6 u r e a r x y 1 v d e c a y u 7 v d e c a y v r s n 0 25 e x p x d 1 5 25 8 v r 0 1201 0 2414 c o s ω y d 0 0115 c o s 2 ω y d 0 0644 c o s 3 ω y d 0 0030 c o s 4 ω

gansel et al 2012 d is the diameter of this fish cage and s n is the solidity of the netting x y is the coordinate in a local coordinate system where the x axis is aligned with the current direction z is opposite to gravity and y axis is perpendicular to the x axis and z axis as u rear x y is only meaningful downstream of a fish cage x is larger than 0 5d the assumption proposed by sim et al 2021 that the influence width of the wake is approximately twice of the fish cage diameter is adopted in this study hereby 1 y d 1 3 4 environmental conditions according to the report by halwart et al 2007 most of the conventional fish farms are located at sheltered sites the sheltered site according to the norwegian standards standards norway 2009 refers to the location with a significant wave height of 0 0 5 m and a peak wave period of 0 2 s according to the previous study by shen et al 2018 the waves at the sheltered sites can only contribute up to 10 of the tension forces in mooring lines when the current velocity is 0 5 m s as the present study focuses on the structural responses of the conventional fish farms under operational conditions wave induced forces are insignificant compared to current induced forces thus the waves are not included in the present numerical simulations pure current conditions with an assumption that the current is steady and uniform over the entire water depth are applied to all the cases the applied current velocity is 0 5 m s which corresponds to the velocity for a moderately exposed site and the water depth is 80 m as the current direction may vary in fish farms current directions from 0 to 360 with a 10 interval are considered 3 5 simulation of the mooring line breakages in order to study line breakage a function was implemented into the existing program fhsim to control where and when the breakage occurs in the mooring system for these mooring line breakage cases the simulations are conducted under an intact condition until it reaches a steady state condition and then the constraint equations between the elements at the desired position are deactivated to simulate the mooring line breakage only one broken mooring line is included for each simulation case for the single cage fish farm 12 breakage cases corresponding to the 12 mooring lines i e 8 anchor lines and 4 frame lines are considered to investigate the influence of breakages at various positions together with the different current directions there are 36 12 432 cases for the single cage fish farm similarly there are 36 27 972 cases for the 1 4 multi cage fish farm a summary of all the simulations in the present study is shown in table 2 regarding the measurements of structural responses the tension force in all mooring lines position of buoys drag forces and cultivation volume of the fish cage are recorded before and after breakages occur because the two fish farms are symmetric with respect to the y axis and the x axis many interesting characteristics can be seen in the following results and discussion 4 results and discussion 4 1 structural responses of a single cage fish farm due to mooring line breakage 4 1 1 tension distribution before mooring line breakage before the analysis of structural responses due to mooring line breakages detailed results of tension distribution under intact conditions are presented fig 9 presents the tension force in each mooring line when the current direction θ is 0 the dashed lines represent pre tensions in anchor lines and frame lines the red colour shows that the tension in the anchor line is higher than the pre tension and the blue colour shows that the tension in the anchor line is lower than the pre tension according to the layout of this single cage fish farm in fig 4 all the anchor lines in higher tensions i e mx00 mx10 my00 and my02 are located on the negative side of x axis which means they are the main contributors to hold the fish farms when the θ 0 tension forces in all the frame lines are much smaller than those in anchor lines the tension in frame line my01 which is on the upstream side of the fish cage is reduced compared to the pre tension when θ 0 the drag force on the fish cage is acting along x direction and this drag force is transferred to the mooring system through bridles the red lines in fig 4 according to the equilibrium of forces the tension in the front frame line my01 is reduced and the tension in the rear frame line my11 is increased compared to their pre tension together with figs 4 and 9 it can be seen that mooring lines which are symmetric with respect to the x axis experience the same tension forces such as mx00 and mx02 have the same value when θ 0 the environmental loads act along the axis of symmetry for this single cage fish farm and these loads can be symmetrically distributed among the mooring lines fig 10 shows the influence of different current directions on the tension distribution among anchor lines this figure is plotted in a polar coordinate system where the polar angle represents the current direction and the radius represents the value of tension force the tensions in anchor lines change with different current directions take mx00 and mx10 as an example when θ 0 the tension force in mx00 and mx10 are the same which can also be seen in fig 9 with the increasing current direction the tensions in mx00 and mx10 are reduced until θ 180 the tension deduction in mx00 is first slower than that of mx10 when θ 90 and then faster than that of mx10 when θ 90 when θ 180 the tensions in these two anchor lines are the same again when 0 θ 90 mx10 is relatively located in front of mx00 and thus mx10 carries a higher proportion of the current induced load on the fish farm hereby the tension in mx10 is larger than that in mx00 when 0 θ 90 for the current direction between 180 and 360 the change of tensions in mx00 and mx10 follows an opposite trend compared to those when 0 θ 180 the change of the tensions in other mooring lines can be interpreted in a similar way as with mx00 and mx10 the tension distribution is symmetric when the environmental loads along the axis of symmetry for this single cage fish farm in addition to θ 0 the symmetric tension distribution can also be observed when θ n 45 where n is an integer in fig 10 intersections of the curves occur when the tension distribution is symmetric for θ 45 135 225 and 315 these intersections can be observed by overlapping the two subplots for anchor lines in x and y directions in fig 10 all the above symmetric characteristics are related to geometric characteristics of the single cage fish farm these symmetric characteristics can simplify fish farm design and structural analysis 4 1 2 tension distribution after mooring line breakage when one of the mooring lines breaks the environmental loads will be distributed among the remaining mooring lines and consequently the position of buoys may also change the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines and positions of buoys due to mooring line breakages are presented in fig 11 the influence of mooring line breakages on the position of buoys will be discussed in section 4 1 3 fig 11 is divided into six blocks in order to differentiate the influence of breakages in anchor lines and frame lines here we define anchor lines and frame lines as two mooring components the names of the six blocks which are shown at the lower right of fig 11 indicate the influence of one component on others for example m af represents the influence on tensions in the anchor lines due to the frame line breakages the influence of breakages at the two components and current directions will be discussed in section 4 1 5 an example of the displacement of the fish farm can be seen in fig 12 when the anchor line mx00 breaks the whole fish farm is no longer symmetric with respect to x axis thus the tensions among the remaining mooring lines are no longer symmetric as shown in fig 9 the first column of fig 11 shows the changes of tension in the remaining mooring lines after anchor line mx00 breaks it is seen that the tension in anchor line mx10 which is parallel to the broken anchor line mx00 increases 32 kn 1 4 times of its tension under intact condition similar observations were also reported by tang et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 according to tang et al 2020 the tension in the remaining anchor line can increase up to 1 75 times due to mooring line breakage under the condition with the current velocity of 1 0 m s and irregular waves corresponding to a 50 year return period in addition tensions in anchor lines my00 and my12 are clearly increased as well which is similar to the results reported by tang et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 except for these three anchor lines the tensions in the remaining anchor lines are reduced after anchor line mx00 breaks as for the frame lines the tensions in three of the frame lines increase and tensions in only one frame line reduces generally the changes of tension among the frame lines are smaller than those in anchor lines the other columns which indicate the influence of breakages at different mooring lines will be discussed in section 4 1 4 4 1 3 movement of buoys after mooring line breakage as shown in fig 12 due to the breakage of anchor line mx00 the buoy b00 moves towards the x direction significantly however the other three buoys have negligible movements as their constraining structures are still intact the movements of buoys are also shown in fig 11 the movement of a buoy is calculated as the distance between the buoy before and after one of the mooring lines breaks as the distance is non negative the colour for the movement of buoys is always red according to the first column in fig 11 the movements of b00 is clearly larger than the other three buoys 4 1 4 influence of breakages at different mooring lines if one of the mooring lines breaks the fish farm with the remaining components is most likely geometrically asymmetric and the tension distribution among the remaining mooring lines may lose the symmetric characteristics as shown in section 4 1 1 the breakages at different mooring lines usually cause different tension distributions but symmetric characteristics of the changes in the structural responses can still be observed between different cases the different columns in fig 11 represent the changes in mooring line tensions and buoy movements caused by the breakages at different mooring lines when θ 0 the dashed diagonal line for m aa and m ff represents the influence of the broken mooring to itself since only the responses of the remaining components are discussed in the present study the values on this diagonal line are set to zero symmetric values with respect to this diagonal line can be observed from m aa for example m aa 3 1 m aa 1 3 m aa 4 2 m aa 2 4 and m aa 7 8 m aa 8 7 where the pair numbers in brackets are the index for the row number and the column number taking m aa 3 1 m aa 1 3 for instance the symmetric values imply that when θ 0 the influence from the broken mx00 on mx10 is equivalent to the influence from the broken mx10 to mx00 this is because of the symmetric characteristics of the intact fish farm as discussed in section 4 1 1 whichever anchor line breaks the number of mooring lines with increased tension compared to intact condition is the same when one of the anchor lines breaks there are always three anchor lines and three frame lines experiencing increased tensions more specifically the tensions in one of the remaining anchor lines which are parallel to the broken anchor line will increase and the tension in two of the remaining anchor lines which are perpendicular to the broken anchor line will increase as for the frame lines the tension always decreases in the frame lines which is parallel with and directly connected to the broken anchor line and increases in the rest of the frame lines however when one of the frame lines breaks the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines are relatively insignificant hereby the colours in m af and m ff are lighter than those in m fa and m aa as shown in fig 11 whichever anchor line breaks the buoy which is directly connected to the broken anchor line has the most significant movement this is because the constraint which holds this buoy at the desired position disappears due to the breakage of the anchor line for the other three buoys the constraints still work similarly to the condition that before the breakage happens thus the movement of the buoys that are not directly connected to the broken anchor line is negligible however when one of the frame lines breaks the movements of all buoys are negligible thus the colours in m bf are almost white as shown in fig 11 4 1 5 influence of current directions as shown in fig 11 the colours in the last four columns corresponding to the breakage of frame lines i e m af m ff and m bf are clearly lighter than the colours in the first eight columns corresponding to the anchor lines breakage cases i e m aa m fa and m ba these lighter colours mean that the influence on the mooring system caused by frame lines breakages is smaller than those caused by anchor lines breakages thus it can be considered that frame lines are less crucial than anchor lines regarding the robustness of the fish farm in order to compare the importance of the two components i e anchor lines and frame lines the root mean square rms value of the changes in the responses is introduced as an indicator the rms is calculated based on the values in each block as shown in fig 11 the values in each block can be considered as a matrix the rms value of each matrix can reflect the averaged changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines or the averaged movements of buoys due to breakages of the two components and is calculated as follows 9 m r m s 1 m n i 1 n j 1 m a i j 2 1 2 where m and n are the row and column numbers for the matrices respectively a ij is the value shown by the colour in fig 11 fig 13 presents the rms value for the six matrices with respect to different current directions due to the symmetric characteristics discussed from sections 4 1 1 to 4 1 4 the rms is only given for 0 90 in this figure all the lines are nearly horizontal which means that the averaged changes in the responses due to mooring line breakages at different components exhibit little sensitivity to the current direction in addition the solid lines are always higher than the dashed lines this implies that the influence caused by the anchor line breakages is always larger than those caused by the frame line breakages meanwhile the breakages at anchor lines are always easier to notice than those at frame lines as m ba is always larger than m bf 4 2 structural responses of the multi cage fish farm due to mooring line breakage 4 2 1 tension distribution before mooring line breakage fig 14 presents the tension distribution before mooring line breakage with respect to different current directions for the tensions in the my anchor lines only half of them are plotted in the right subplot of fig 14 to make this figure readable the tensions in the other half mooring lines can be obtained based on the symmetry similar to the single cage fish farm moreover the left subplot in fig 14 shows that zero tension appears in mx anchor lines when the angle between the current direction and the longest axis of this 1 4 multi cage fish farm is less than 45 under these current directions the anchor lines with small tension may become slack and have abrasions with the seabed according to cardia and lovatelli 2015 these abrasions can rapidly abrade the anchor lines to a dangerous condition and should be avoided in the design the use of floats attached close to the lower end of the anchor lines can reduce the possibility of these abrasions fig 15 shows the extreme tension in anchor lines under different current directions the extreme tension represents the largest tension among all the mooring lines in this 1 4 multi cage fish farm the maximum extreme tension around 140 kn is almost 2 3 times of the pre tension around 60 kn and it is much higher than that in the single cage fish farm around 80 kn due to higher total environmental loads for example the total drag force on the four fish cages is around 211 kn when θ 0 which is three times larger than that on the single fish cage 72 kn the maximum extreme tension in this 1 4 multi cage fish farm occurs when the angle between the current direction and the longest axis of the fish farm is 20 30 however the extreme tension is not sensitive to the current direction in the single cage fish farm according to the explanation by sim et al 2021 the layout of the two fish farms together with the wake effect can cause different reactions of extreme tension under different current directions due to the wake effect the current velocity is reduced after the current flowing through a fish cage zhao et al 2015 the reduced current velocity can lead to a smaller drag force on these fish cages which locate in the wake region of the upstream cages when the current direction increases from 0 to 90 the total drag force on the four fish cages first increases from the smallest value around 211 kn at 0 to around 320 kn at 30 and then remains at the maximum value it should be noted that the drag force is the maximum does not necessarily mean that the extreme tension in the mooring system is the maximum as the number of effective anchor lines also changes with the current direction the effective anchor lines are the main lines that hold the fish farm in position for example when θ 0 mx00 and mx10 are the main effective anchor lines to hold this 1 4 fish farm in position when θ 90 myi0 i 0 1 2 3 and 4 are the main effective anchor lines under the same total drag force more effective anchor lines can lead to smaller extreme tension in the mooring system due to the total drag force and the number of effective anchor lines the highest tension happens when the current direction is around 20 30 for other current directions 90 360 similar observations can be seen due to the geometric symmetry of this fish farm as for the single cage fish farm the total drag forces and effective anchor lines do not change with the current directions thus the extreme tension in this single cage fish farm is always around 80 kn 4 2 2 tension distribution and movement of buoys after mooring line breakage fig 16 shows the tension distribution and the movement of buoys after one of the mooring lines breaks when the current velocity is 0 5 m s and θ 30 the symmetric characteristics which are discussed in fig 11 cannot be observed in this figure as the current is not along the axis of symmetry for this 1 4 multi cage fish farm usually the breakages at different mooring lines can cause different tension increment or decrement in the remaining mooring lines however some mooring lines e g mx05 mx04 and mx14 are always white as shown in fig 16 that white colour means that whichever mooring lines break the tensions in these mooring lines are always the same as theirs under intact condition actually these mooring lines are zero tension and slack under the intact condition when θ 30 as the remaining mooring lines can still hold the whole fish farm these zero tension mooring lines are still slack thus the tensions in these mooring lines have no change after mooring line breakages fig 17 shows the top view of this 1 4 multi cage fish farm after anchor line my30 breaks when current velocity is 0 5 m s and θ 30 it can be observed that the buoy b13 have a significant movement towards y direction and the other buoys have relatively smaller movements the distances of these movements are shown in fig 16 4 2 3 influence of current directions as shown in fig 18 the influence due to frame line breakages is less serious than that due to anchor line breakages unlike the single cage fish farm for this 1 4 multi cage fish farm the influence on the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines due to mooring line breakages is dependent on the current direction when 20 θ 30 the influence on the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines due to anchor line breakages is strongest among all current directions when 20 θ 30 the extreme tension is also the maximum under intact condition as shown in fig 15 this implies that the influence is related to the extreme tensions before mooring line breakages if the extreme tension in the intact condition is high a stronger influence on the changes of the tensions is expected after mooring line breakages as for the influence on the movements of buoys m ba is always larger than m bf and both are independent of current directions 4 3 mooring system design consideration usually a fish farm consists of several fish cages and these fish cages are arranged in arrays using a grid like mooring system according to cardia and lovatelli 2015 the most common layouts of a fish farm are 2 3 2 4 and 2 6 during the design of a mooring system the ratio between the number of fish cages and the number of anchor lines is a useful indicator to measure the robustness of the fish farm as shown in table 3 a fish farm with a small number of fish cage usually has a relatively larger number of anchor lines per fish cage a larger number of anchor lines per fish cage is preferred in an exposed site as the position of the fish farm can be kept more securely as shown in fig 19 the maximum increment of tension in the single cage fish farm is less than half of that in the 1 4 multi cage fish farm thus the fish farm with a larger number of anchor lines per fish cage has a higher chance to sustain the fish farm after one of the mooring lines breaks while in a sheltered site a fish farm with more fish cages and small anchor lines per fish cage is preferable as it requires relatively fewer anchors and mooring lines and subsequently lower installation costs in some cases additional anchor lines are required to reinforce the mooring system particularly in an exposed site fig 19 shows the relationship between the maximum tension increment in the mooring system and the maximum buoy movement after one mooring line breaks for example one point in the left scatterplot is extracted based on the first column of fig 10 the x value in the scatter plot corresponds to the maximum movement which is from b00 and the y value corresponds to the maximum tension increment which is from mx10 the figure summarises the results for all the cases with different breakage situations due to the symmetry of the fish farm set up the scatter plots only include results for current directions of 0 θ 90 thus there are 10 12 120 points in the left subplot and 10 27 270 points in the right subplot according to the right subplot the breakages at the mx anchor lines can lead to a higher tension increment in the mooring system compared to the breakages at the my anchor lines in order to reinforce the mooring system additional anchor lines should be added as a backup for the mx anchor lines according to figs 15 and 18 when 20 θ 30 the extreme tension in the mooring system is the maximum and the influence of mooring line breakages is also the strongest thus the most effective way to improve the security and reliability of this 1x4 multi cage fish farm is to add additional anchor lines in the four corners as shown in fig 20 4 4 observations during operation the breaking strength for the considered anchor lines 50 mm three strand polysteel rope in this study is around 360 kn which is larger than the extreme tension around 220 kn in the remaining mooring lines of the 1x4 multi cage fish farm after one of the mooring lines breaks thus the mooring system should not have progressive collapse under operational conditions however if this breakage is not detected the damaged mooring system may not be able to keep the fish farm in position during higher currents and waves consequently the undetected mooring line breakage can lead to a structural collapse and fish escape which is a serious accident as reported by føre and thorvaldsen 2021 the most serious fish escape in the period of 2010 2018 occurs because of the breakages in the mooring system in order to avoid this serious fish escape one way is to increase the conservativeness during the design which means to increase the breaking strength of anchor lines by using stronger material or a larger diameter of the ropes this improvement can increase the initial financial investment for a fish farm another way is to monitor the positions of buoys during or after in situ operations according to ns9415 standards norway 2009 the regular inspections of a fish farm only emphasize the structural integrity of netting and floating collar monitoring the positions of buoys has not been given enough attention however based on the results from sections 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 the displacements of the buoys can act as a good indicator to detect the mooring line breakage as shown in fig 19 the tension increment in the mooring system has a strong correlation with the movement of buoys if one of the buoys is observed to have a large movement it is most likely that one of the mooring lines breaks the present analysis shows that the broken mooring line is most likely the one directly connected to the buoy with the largest movement in norway most of the in situ operations in a fish farm are handled by various auxiliary equipment such as net cleaners buoy ropes for crowding of fish tarpaulins for parasite treatment and netting for fish handing it may not be easy to notice the movement of buoys while the equipment operators are working from a practical point of view it is useful to install a global positioning system gps device on each buoy the gps device can record the locations of buoys and send the information back to the operators and administrators based on the movements of buoys a warning system to detect mooring line breakages can be established according to the previous studies by zhao et al 2019 and bi et al 2020 a warning system for mooring line breakages can be established through a deep learning method based on more simulations as presented in the present study by then the breakages in the mooring system can be quickly and automatically discovered and precisely located and the tension distribution in the remaining mooring system can be predicted with seconds the administrator can make a corresponding decision based on these predictions such as 1 stop the operation immediately or 2 continue the operation and repair the damaged mooring line later with more data training the autonomous fish farming system for early prediction proposed by yang et al 2020b can also be achieved in the future 5 conclusions in the present study the structural responses of the two fish farms i e a single cage fish farm and a 1 4 multi cage fish farm are comprehensively analysed with respect to combinations of mooring line breakages and current directions due to the symmetry of the two fish farms symmetric results are shown and discussed based on these results suggestions to improve the design of the mooring system are given it is also recommended to monitor the positions of buoys during operation to detect the mooring line breakages besides the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 breakage at one mooring line is unlikely to cause a progressive collapse of the fish fam under operational conditions such as current velocity 0 5 m s the extreme tension in the remaining mooring lines of the 1x4 multi cage fish farm is around 220 kn after one of the mooring lines breaks under operational condition this value is 3 6 times larger than the pre tension and 60 of the designed breaking strength however mooring line breakages may cause structural collapse and fish escape when the current and waves become stronger if the breakages remain undetected 2 monitoring the positions of buoys during and after in situ operations is recommended and could be emphasised in the operational handbook since mooring line breakages can be discovered and located from the movement of buoys the broken mooring line is usually directly connected to the buoy with the largest movement 3 the increment of tension in the mooring system due to mooring line breakages has a strong positive correlation with the movement of buoys based on the displacement of the buoys with the largest movement the maximum tension increment in the mooring system can be estimated this estimation can help the operators of fish farms to decide whether or not to repair the damaged mooring line immediately credit authorship contribution statement hui cheng conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data

20323,due to the lack of sheltered area norwegian fish farms are expanding to more exposed and remote sites the severe environmental conditions in exposed sites can increase the risk of structural failure during aquaculture operations in the present study the program fhsim is employed to conduct time domain simulations to investigate structural responses of a single cage and 1 4 multi cage fish farm due to breakages in mooring lines the influences on the tension distribution in the mooring system and the displacement of the buoys due to breakage at different mooring lines are analysed in detail based on the analysis a method to identify the broken mooring line and to predict the maximum tension increment in the remaining mooring lines is proposed the results indicate that the breakage at one mooring line is unlikely to cause a progressive collapse of the fish farm immediately when the current velocity is less than 0 5 m s however these breakages may cause structural collapses and fish escapes when the current and waves increase in order to prevent fish escapes suggestions to improve the mooring system design and recommendations for monitoring during operations are given keywords norwegian fish farm mooring line breakages mooring system numerical simulation grid moored fish farm 1 introduction the expanding global population together with stagnation in capture fisheries is driving the demand for aquaculture products according to the report by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2020 the global population is expected to reach nine billion by the middle of the twenty first century food production from aquaculture is expected to exceed traditional capture fisheries in 2021 fredheim and reve 2018 and will be the main contributor to global food production as the population increases fao 2020 statistics show that marine finfish production is dominated by atlantic salmon salmo salar and norwegian production accounts for more than 50 of the global salmon production while the norwegian coast provides a favourable production environment the success of marine aquaculture in norway is based on regulations and design guidelines which are established to support sustainable aquaculture fish farming in norway is regulated through production licenses issued and regulated by the directorate of fisheries based on the aquaculture act norwegian directorate of fisheries 2005 the regulation limits the number of aquaculture farms but also impose requirements on planning design and operation in order to reduce adverse side effects such as waste parasites and escape of farmed salmon escapes of farmed fish can cause an economic loss for fish farmers threat the wild fish populations and reduce the societal acceptance of the aquaculture industry fig 1 shows the production of farmed salmon and the number of escaped salmon in norway in the period between 2000 and 2019 statistics norway 2020 the salmon production grows rapidly during the years 2000 2013 which lead to an increase in the number of fish escapes especially before 2006 according to moe føre and thorvaldsen 2021 92 of fish escapes were triggered by technological factors such as submergence of the net top and holes in nettings the norwegian standard ns 9415 standards norway 2009 on the design operation and installation of fish farms was introduced in 2004 berstad et al 2004 and compliance was ensured through the aquaculture act this technical standard was revised in 2009 and enforced correspondingly in 2011 the implementation of ns 9415 increases technological investments and reduces the number of escaped fish according to the report by moe føre et al 2019 82 of fish escapes in the period 2014 2018 happened during normal operations such as handling weights and netting in preparation for delousing in the last decade human and organisational factors during in situ operations instead of technological factor have been identified as dominant underlying causes for fish escapes thorvaldsen et al 2015 2018 fish farming is a complex process with various in situ operations such as delousing process changing cleaning netting and transfer of fish these operations usually involve a number of operators different types of equipment and well boats høyli 2016 during operations well boats can bring substantial forces on mooring lines as they are moored to aquaculture structures according to the research by shen et al 2019 loads on anchor lines can increase 40 due to the existence of well boats even under modest current velocities of 0 3 m s furthermore underwater structural failures such as tears on netting and mooring line breakage may be difficult to detect during operations these unaware structural failures may lead to fish escapes tang et al 2019 investigated structural responses of a single cage fish farm due to mooring line breakages the results indicated that tensions in the remaining mooring lines could increase up to 1 75 times compared to those under intact condition in order to prevent fish escapes a quick approach to detect and identify structural failures during operations is necessary yang et al 2020a this quick approach needs comprehensive analyses in the design phase on the structural responses of fish farms due to various structural failures when the fish farms are established in exposed and remote areas understanding how the surface visible parts of the structure are influenced by the combination of current and broken lines can lead to fast identification of failures by remote operators however to the best of our knowledge such analyses are rarely reported in literature a marine fish farm is built to support the containment netting with components floater weight system interconnecting ropes mooring lines anchor and supporting buoys a typical norwegian marine fish farm is illustrated in fig 2 these structures have complex topology regarding the interconnection of structure members and combinations of elastic stiff and permeable structures a comprehensive model is needed to analyse such structures and considerable research effort has been spent to analyse the physical effects of fish farm structures endresen et al 2013 developed a numerical tool to calculate the total drag force and deformation of a fish farm under complex sea conditions zhao et al 2013a employed a porous media model to simulate the flow through a net panel and showed that the velocity reduction downstream from one net panel is 11 bi et al 2014 proposed a coupled fluid structure model to study the weak effect after a fish cage and showed that the maximum velocity reductions downstream from a single fish cage are 17 5 zhao et al 2013b established a numerical model for multi cage fish farm using a porous media model and showed 69 of velocity reduction when the flow passed through 4 cages gutiérrez romero et al 2020 comprehensively analysed a fish farm under combined wave and current conditions using a fluid structure interaction method all the above studies proved that the numerical method is accurate enough to predict the structural responses of a fish farm under various current and wave conditions thus the effects of mooring line breakage on dynamic responses of grid moored fish farms are investigated through numerical simulations in the present study with complex in situ operations which can lead to increased loads on different structure members it is important to understand how breakage in any part of the fish farm will affect the response and load distribution in the present study the structural responses of a fish farm due to mooring line breakages under operational conditions i e current velocity is less than 0 5 m s are comprehensively analysed in sections 2 and 3 the numerical model and the description of fish farms are presented respectively results and detailed analysis are given in section 4 finally the results of this study are summarised in the conclusions 2 numerical model 2 1 fhsim framework in the present study numerical models of full scale fish farms are prepared in fhsim which is a modular analysis program developed by sintef ocean this program has been validated with experiments and extensively used for the analysis of fish farms endresen et al 2013 endresen et al 2014 reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 and the validations showed satisfactory results for current velocities less than 0 7 m s with a discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results in the region of 7 fig 3 represents how variables i e displacement velocity and force are transferred across the objects representing a fish farm during numerical analysis in fhsim a newly compiled module the mooring system in fig 3 was implemented in the existing program to represent a conventional grid mooring system by implementing the new module the initial setup and the exchange of forces become efficient since all the objects in the mooring system are packed into one single module this new module has also been successfully applied in the numerical simulations of a 2 4 multi cage fish farm by sim et al 2021 fhsim supports the use of several different integration methods including euler method heun s method and runge kutta method in this study the runge kutta method with variable time steps is used for numerical integration the mooring system and netting are modelled as collections of interconnected discrete rigid bodies and mass points respectively the rigid bodies or elements that comprise the mooring system are connected by constraint forces that replicate a linear strain stress relationship between the elements with an explicit elastic baumgarte stabilization technique skjong et al 2021 the mass of the netting are lumped into mass points and interconnected as triangular elements where structural forces are calculated along the netting twines as in and distributed evenly to the three interconnected mass points priour 1999 the response of the structure is calculated in the time domain with equations 1 m q f s q f g f b f h q q where q is the time dependent vector of nodal displacements m is the mass matrix f s is the force vector for the structural forces acting on the mass f g is the force vector due to gravity f b is the force vector due to buoyancy and f h is the force vector for the hydrodynamic forces by solving eq 1 the cage net deformations can be acquired 2 2 structural model the netting in the present study is discretised based on the triangular element method proposed by priour 2013 the triangular elements are interconnected through nodes and the total mass of the netting is distributed onto these nodes the environmental loads acting on a triangular element are computed as the total loads acting on individual twines within the triangular element and distributed onto its corresponding nodes enerhaug et al 2012 the buoy is modelled as vertical circular cylinders with a conical bottom it is given 5 degrees of freedom dof where rotation around its vertical axis is omitted fredriksson et al 2014 anchor lines frame lines bridles and other components with cable like properties are modelled using discrete rigid body elements combined into cables with a inter element dynamic constraint formulation on axial and angular displacements the sinker tube is modelled by the same discrete element type as used in the cable but with two endpoints connected to create a circle the tension in a cable like element is calculated as a constraint force skjong et al 2021 where the parameters of the baumgarte stabilization between elements are selected to give a linear material response 2 f e a l l 0 l 0 where e is young s modulus of the material a is the section area of the cable l 0 is the unstretched length of the cable and l is the length of the cable the mathematical and theoretical descriptions for the cable like elements in fhsim are given by johansen 2007 and skjong et al 2021 the floating collar is modelled as a flexible continuous circular ring using beam elements it is divided into sections and for each section the radial and vertical responses are calculated using the euler beam equations eq 3 3 f r s t m 2 v t 2 e i 4 v s 4 1 r 2 2 v s f z s t m 2 z d t 2 e i 4 z d s 4 where v and z are the radial and vertical responses of the floater respectively m is the mass per unit length of the floater ei is the bending stiffness of the floater f r is the radial force on the floater per unit length and f z is the vertical force on the floater per unit length 2 3 hydrodynamic model in this study the hydrodynamic forces acting on the triangular element is calculated by integrating the force on individual twines within the triangular element individual twine is regarded as a smooth cylinder and its hydrodynamic force is calculated using quadratic drag formulation in case of inclined twines due to the geometry or deformation of the cage the hydrodynamic forces on twines are decomposed into normal force f n and tangential force f t as shown in eq 2 4 f n 0 5 c n ρ a u n u n f t 0 5 c t ρ a u t u t where u n and u t are the normal and tangential components of the relative flow velocity for each twine respectively c n c t are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively and are dependent on reynolds number re a is the reference area which is the product of the length and the diameter of a twine c t is assigned with a constant value of 0 01 for all re and c n is taken from the experimental data as a seventh order polynomial function of the logarithmic re which is limited in the range of 32 and 104 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 cheng et al 2020a 5 c n 78 46675 254 73873 l o

study focuses on typical norwegian fish cages which include a double pipe floating collar a cage net cylindrical net structure with conical bottom ropes for supporting the weight system chains connecting cage net and sinker tube a sinker tube and a centre point weight in order to keep fish cages at targeted locations a grid mooring system that includes anchors buoys connection plates bridles buoy lines anchor lines and frame lines should be properly designed according to the environmental conditions fig 2 illustrates how these components are interconnected in a typical norwegian fish farm the topological relationship of the aforementioned components in numerical simulations is shown in fig 3 the dimensions and physical properties of the main components used in this paper are listed in table 1 3 2 single cage fish farm fig 4 shows an overview of the single cage fish farm the mooring lines are named following matrix style reflecting the matrix like structure of the grid mooring system mx represents the mooring lines along x axis the first digit of the index number after mx represents the index of the line in the y direction and the second digit represents the index of the line in the x direction the my lines along y direction are labelled in a similar fashion since this model only contains one fish cage the mooring lines whose name ends with number 1 are frame lines and the rest are anchor lines the labels of buoys follow the same matrix fashion starting with b with the following two numbers indicating the location in the mooring frame fig 5 shows the time series of the numerical results for this single cage fish farm with a current velocity of 0 5 m s and current direction θ 0 although the simulation is under pure current conditions oscillations are observed in the numerical results these oscillations come from the nonlinearity of the system which is also reported by antonutti et al 2018 and cheng et al 2021 the oscillations are deemed acceptable as the standard deviation for the time series force over the last 100 s is 3 1 of the mean force the time series results indicate that the simulation reaches the steady state after 300 s hereafter the tensions in mooring lines and displacements of buoys are time averaged under steady state conditions fig 6 shows the deformation of the single cage fish farm in a steady state condition due to the pre tensions in mooring lines the displacements of other components such as floating collar and mooring lines are unnoticeable 3 3 1x4 multi cage fish farm fig 7 shows the plan view of the 1x4 multi cage fish farm the labels of mooring lines and buoys follow the same rule as the single cage fish farm the longest axis of this fish farm is along the x axis as the four fish cages are arranged along x axis these mooring lines along x axis whose name ends with a number between 1 and 4 are frame lines and these mooring lines along y axis whose name ends with number 1 are frame lines the fish cage is named cage1 to cage4 from left to right the labels of buoys also follow the matrix style fig 8 shows the time series of the numerical results for this 1x4 multi cage fish farm when current velocity is 0 5 m s and current direction θ 0 oscillations of drag force are also observed in the numerical results the standard deviation for the time series drag force over the last 100 s is up to 5 3 of the mean drag force for the four cages due to the existence of the upstream fish cags the current velocity for the downstream fish cage is reduced the fish cage located downstream e g cage2 experiences a smaller current velocity compared to cage1 thus cage2 experience a smaller current load the smaller current load makes cage2 has less deformation and larger cultivation volume than cage1 thus the volume and drag force of the four fish cages are different due to the different experienced current velocities the mechanism that causes the current velocity reduction in the downstream location is the weak effect the detailed explanations and discussions for the weak effect can refer to cheng et al 2020b and sim et al 2021 here only the final expression for the current velocity in the rear of a fish cage u rear x y is presented 6 u r e a r x y 1 v d e c a y u 7 v d e c a y v r s n 0 25 e x p x d 1 5 25 8 v r 0 1201 0 2414 c o s ω y d 0 0115 c o s 2 ω y d 0 0644 c o s 3 ω y d 0 0030 c o s 4 ω

gansel et al 2012 d is the diameter of this fish cage and s n is the solidity of the netting x y is the coordinate in a local coordinate system where the x axis is aligned with the current direction z is opposite to gravity and y axis is perpendicular to the x axis and z axis as u rear x y is only meaningful downstream of a fish cage x is larger than 0 5d the assumption proposed by sim et al 2021 that the influence width of the wake is approximately twice of the fish cage diameter is adopted in this study hereby 1 y d 1 3 4 environmental conditions according to the report by halwart et al 2007 most of the conventional fish farms are located at sheltered sites the sheltered site according to the norwegian standards standards norway 2009 refers to the location with a significant wave height of 0 0 5 m and a peak wave period of 0 2 s according to the previous study by shen et al 2018 the waves at the sheltered sites can only contribute up to 10 of the tension forces in mooring lines when the current velocity is 0 5 m s as the present study focuses on the structural responses of the conventional fish farms under operational conditions wave induced forces are insignificant compared to current induced forces thus the waves are not included in the present numerical simulations pure current conditions with an assumption that the current is steady and uniform over the entire water depth are applied to all the cases the applied current velocity is 0 5 m s which corresponds to the velocity for a moderately exposed site and the water depth is 80 m as the current direction may vary in fish farms current directions from 0 to 360 with a 10 interval are considered 3 5 simulation of the mooring line breakages in order to study line breakage a function was implemented into the existing program fhsim to control where and when the breakage occurs in the mooring system for these mooring line breakage cases the simulations are conducted under an intact condition until it reaches a steady state condition and then the constraint equations between the elements at the desired position are deactivated to simulate the mooring line breakage only one broken mooring line is included for each simulation case for the single cage fish farm 12 breakage cases corresponding to the 12 mooring lines i e 8 anchor lines and 4 frame lines are considered to investigate the influence of breakages at various positions together with the different current directions there are 36 12 432 cases for the single cage fish farm similarly there are 36 27 972 cases for the 1 4 multi cage fish farm a summary of all the simulations in the present study is shown in table 2 regarding the measurements of structural responses the tension force in all mooring lines position of buoys drag forces and cultivation volume of the fish cage are recorded before and after breakages occur because the two fish farms are symmetric with respect to the y axis and the x axis many interesting characteristics can be seen in the following results and discussion 4 results and discussion 4 1 structural responses of a single cage fish farm due to mooring line breakage 4 1 1 tension distribution before mooring line breakage before the analysis of structural responses due to mooring line breakages detailed results of tension distribution under intact conditions are presented fig 9 presents the tension force in each mooring line when the current direction θ is 0 the dashed lines represent pre tensions in anchor lines and frame lines the red colour shows that the tension in the anchor line is higher than the pre tension and the blue colour shows that the tension in the anchor line is lower than the pre tension according to the layout of this single cage fish farm in fig 4 all the anchor lines in higher tensions i e mx00 mx10 my00 and my02 are located on the negative side of x axis which means they are the main contributors to hold the fish farms when the θ 0 tension forces in all the frame lines are much smaller than those in anchor lines the tension in frame line my01 which is on the upstream side of the fish cage is reduced compared to the pre tension when θ 0 the drag force on the fish cage is acting along x direction and this drag force is transferred to the mooring system through bridles the red lines in fig 4 according to the equilibrium of forces the tension in the front frame line my01 is reduced and the tension in the rear frame line my11 is increased compared to their pre tension together with figs 4 and 9 it can be seen that mooring lines which are symmetric with respect to the x axis experience the same tension forces such as mx00 and mx02 have the same value when θ 0 the environmental loads act along the axis of symmetry for this single cage fish farm and these loads can be symmetrically distributed among the mooring lines fig 10 shows the influence of different current directions on the tension distribution among anchor lines this figure is plotted in a polar coordinate system where the polar angle represents the current direction and the radius represents the value of tension force the tensions in anchor lines change with different current directions take mx00 and mx10 as an example when θ 0 the tension force in mx00 and mx10 are the same which can also be seen in fig 9 with the increasing current direction the tensions in mx00 and mx10 are reduced until θ 180 the tension deduction in mx00 is first slower than that of mx10 when θ 90 and then faster than that of mx10 when θ 90 when θ 180 the tensions in these two anchor lines are the same again when 0 θ 90 mx10 is relatively located in front of mx00 and thus mx10 carries a higher proportion of the current induced load on the fish farm hereby the tension in mx10 is larger than that in mx00 when 0 θ 90 for the current direction between 180 and 360 the change of tensions in mx00 and mx10 follows an opposite trend compared to those when 0 θ 180 the change of the tensions in other mooring lines can be interpreted in a similar way as with mx00 and mx10 the tension distribution is symmetric when the environmental loads along the axis of symmetry for this single cage fish farm in addition to θ 0 the symmetric tension distribution can also be observed when θ n 45 where n is an integer in fig 10 intersections of the curves occur when the tension distribution is symmetric for θ 45 135 225 and 315 these intersections can be observed by overlapping the two subplots for anchor lines in x and y directions in fig 10 all the above symmetric characteristics are related to geometric characteristics of the single cage fish farm these symmetric characteristics can simplify fish farm design and structural analysis 4 1 2 tension distribution after mooring line breakage when one of the mooring lines breaks the environmental loads will be distributed among the remaining mooring lines and consequently the position of buoys may also change the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines and positions of buoys due to mooring line breakages are presented in fig 11 the influence of mooring line breakages on the position of buoys will be discussed in section 4 1 3 fig 11 is divided into six blocks in order to differentiate the influence of breakages in anchor lines and frame lines here we define anchor lines and frame lines as two mooring components the names of the six blocks which are shown at the lower right of fig 11 indicate the influence of one component on others for example m af represents the influence on tensions in the anchor lines due to the frame line breakages the influence of breakages at the two components and current directions will be discussed in section 4 1 5 an example of the displacement of the fish farm can be seen in fig 12 when the anchor line mx00 breaks the whole fish farm is no longer symmetric with respect to x axis thus the tensions among the remaining mooring lines are no longer symmetric as shown in fig 9 the first column of fig 11 shows the changes of tension in the remaining mooring lines after anchor line mx00 breaks it is seen that the tension in anchor line mx10 which is parallel to the broken anchor line mx00 increases 32 kn 1 4 times of its tension under intact condition similar observations were also reported by tang et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 according to tang et al 2020 the tension in the remaining anchor line can increase up to 1 75 times due to mooring line breakage under the condition with the current velocity of 1 0 m s and irregular waves corresponding to a 50 year return period in addition tensions in anchor lines my00 and my12 are clearly increased as well which is similar to the results reported by tang et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 except for these three anchor lines the tensions in the remaining anchor lines are reduced after anchor line mx00 breaks as for the frame lines the tensions in three of the frame lines increase and tensions in only one frame line reduces generally the changes of tension among the frame lines are smaller than those in anchor lines the other columns which indicate the influence of breakages at different mooring lines will be discussed in section 4 1 4 4 1 3 movement of buoys after mooring line breakage as shown in fig 12 due to the breakage of anchor line mx00 the buoy b00 moves towards the x direction significantly however the other three buoys have negligible movements as their constraining structures are still intact the movements of buoys are also shown in fig 11 the movement of a buoy is calculated as the distance between the buoy before and after one of the mooring lines breaks as the distance is non negative the colour for the movement of buoys is always red according to the first column in fig 11 the movements of b00 is clearly larger than the other three buoys 4 1 4 influence of breakages at different mooring lines if one of the mooring lines breaks the fish farm with the remaining components is most likely geometrically asymmetric and the tension distribution among the remaining mooring lines may lose the symmetric characteristics as shown in section 4 1 1 the breakages at different mooring lines usually cause different tension distributions but symmetric characteristics of the changes in the structural responses can still be observed between different cases the different columns in fig 11 represent the changes in mooring line tensions and buoy movements caused by the breakages at different mooring lines when θ 0 the dashed diagonal line for m aa and m ff represents the influence of the broken mooring to itself since only the responses of the remaining components are discussed in the present study the values on this diagonal line are set to zero symmetric values with respect to this diagonal line can be observed from m aa for example m aa 3 1 m aa 1 3 m aa 4 2 m aa 2 4 and m aa 7 8 m aa 8 7 where the pair numbers in brackets are the index for the row number and the column number taking m aa 3 1 m aa 1 3 for instance the symmetric values imply that when θ 0 the influence from the broken mx00 on mx10 is equivalent to the influence from the broken mx10 to mx00 this is because of the symmetric characteristics of the intact fish farm as discussed in section 4 1 1 whichever anchor line breaks the number of mooring lines with increased tension compared to intact condition is the same when one of the anchor lines breaks there are always three anchor lines and three frame lines experiencing increased tensions more specifically the tensions in one of the remaining anchor lines which are parallel to the broken anchor line will increase and the tension in two of the remaining anchor lines which are perpendicular to the broken anchor line will increase as for the frame lines the tension always decreases in the frame lines which is parallel with and directly connected to the broken anchor line and increases in the rest of the frame lines however when one of the frame lines breaks the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines are relatively insignificant hereby the colours in m af and m ff are lighter than those in m fa and m aa as shown in fig 11 whichever anchor line breaks the buoy which is directly connected to the broken anchor line has the most significant movement this is because the constraint which holds this buoy at the desired position disappears due to the breakage of the anchor line for the other three buoys the constraints still work similarly to the condition that before the breakage happens thus the movement of the buoys that are not directly connected to the broken anchor line is negligible however when one of the frame lines breaks the movements of all buoys are negligible thus the colours in m bf are almost white as shown in fig 11 4 1 5 influence of current directions as shown in fig 11 the colours in the last four columns corresponding to the breakage of frame lines i e m af m ff and m bf are clearly lighter than the colours in the first eight columns corresponding to the anchor lines breakage cases i e m aa m fa and m ba these lighter colours mean that the influence on the mooring system caused by frame lines breakages is smaller than those caused by anchor lines breakages thus it can be considered that frame lines are less crucial than anchor lines regarding the robustness of the fish farm in order to compare the importance of the two components i e anchor lines and frame lines the root mean square rms value of the changes in the responses is introduced as an indicator the rms is calculated based on the values in each block as shown in fig 11 the values in each block can be considered as a matrix the rms value of each matrix can reflect the averaged changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines or the averaged movements of buoys due to breakages of the two components and is calculated as follows 9 m r m s 1 m n i 1 n j 1 m a i j 2 1 2 where m and n are the row and column numbers for the matrices respectively a ij is the value shown by the colour in fig 11 fig 13 presents the rms value for the six matrices with respect to different current directions due to the symmetric characteristics discussed from sections 4 1 1 to 4 1 4 the rms is only given for 0 90 in this figure all the lines are nearly horizontal which means that the averaged changes in the responses due to mooring line breakages at different components exhibit little sensitivity to the current direction in addition the solid lines are always higher than the dashed lines this implies that the influence caused by the anchor line breakages is always larger than those caused by the frame line breakages meanwhile the breakages at anchor lines are always easier to notice than those at frame lines as m ba is always larger than m bf 4 2 structural responses of the multi cage fish farm due to mooring line breakage 4 2 1 tension distribution before mooring line breakage fig 14 presents the tension distribution before mooring line breakage with respect to different current directions for the tensions in the my anchor lines only half of them are plotted in the right subplot of fig 14 to make this figure readable the tensions in the other half mooring lines can be obtained based on the symmetry similar to the single cage fish farm moreover the left subplot in fig 14 shows that zero tension appears in mx anchor lines when the angle between the current direction and the longest axis of this 1 4 multi cage fish farm is less than 45 under these current directions the anchor lines with small tension may become slack and have abrasions with the seabed according to cardia and lovatelli 2015 these abrasions can rapidly abrade the anchor lines to a dangerous condition and should be avoided in the design the use of floats attached close to the lower end of the anchor lines can reduce the possibility of these abrasions fig 15 shows the extreme tension in anchor lines under different current directions the extreme tension represents the largest tension among all the mooring lines in this 1 4 multi cage fish farm the maximum extreme tension around 140 kn is almost 2 3 times of the pre tension around 60 kn and it is much higher than that in the single cage fish farm around 80 kn due to higher total environmental loads for example the total drag force on the four fish cages is around 211 kn when θ 0 which is three times larger than that on the single fish cage 72 kn the maximum extreme tension in this 1 4 multi cage fish farm occurs when the angle between the current direction and the longest axis of the fish farm is 20 30 however the extreme tension is not sensitive to the current direction in the single cage fish farm according to the explanation by sim et al 2021 the layout of the two fish farms together with the wake effect can cause different reactions of extreme tension under different current directions due to the wake effect the current velocity is reduced after the current flowing through a fish cage zhao et al 2015 the reduced current velocity can lead to a smaller drag force on these fish cages which locate in the wake region of the upstream cages when the current direction increases from 0 to 90 the total drag force on the four fish cages first increases from the smallest value around 211 kn at 0 to around 320 kn at 30 and then remains at the maximum value it should be noted that the drag force is the maximum does not necessarily mean that the extreme tension in the mooring system is the maximum as the number of effective anchor lines also changes with the current direction the effective anchor lines are the main lines that hold the fish farm in position for example when θ 0 mx00 and mx10 are the main effective anchor lines to hold this 1 4 fish farm in position when θ 90 myi0 i 0 1 2 3 and 4 are the main effective anchor lines under the same total drag force more effective anchor lines can lead to smaller extreme tension in the mooring system due to the total drag force and the number of effective anchor lines the highest tension happens when the current direction is around 20 30 for other current directions 90 360 similar observations can be seen due to the geometric symmetry of this fish farm as for the single cage fish farm the total drag forces and effective anchor lines do not change with the current directions thus the extreme tension in this single cage fish farm is always around 80 kn 4 2 2 tension distribution and movement of buoys after mooring line breakage fig 16 shows the tension distribution and the movement of buoys after one of the mooring lines breaks when the current velocity is 0 5 m s and θ 30 the symmetric characteristics which are discussed in fig 11 cannot be observed in this figure as the current is not along the axis of symmetry for this 1 4 multi cage fish farm usually the breakages at different mooring lines can cause different tension increment or decrement in the remaining mooring lines however some mooring lines e g mx05 mx04 and mx14 are always white as shown in fig 16 that white colour means that whichever mooring lines break the tensions in these mooring lines are always the same as theirs under intact condition actually these mooring lines are zero tension and slack under the intact condition when θ 30 as the remaining mooring lines can still hold the whole fish farm these zero tension mooring lines are still slack thus the tensions in these mooring lines have no change after mooring line breakages fig 17 shows the top view of this 1 4 multi cage fish farm after anchor line my30 breaks when current velocity is 0 5 m s and θ 30 it can be observed that the buoy b13 have a significant movement towards y direction and the other buoys have relatively smaller movements the distances of these movements are shown in fig 16 4 2 3 influence of current directions as shown in fig 18 the influence due to frame line breakages is less serious than that due to anchor line breakages unlike the single cage fish farm for this 1 4 multi cage fish farm the influence on the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines due to mooring line breakages is dependent on the current direction when 20 θ 30 the influence on the changes of tensions in the remaining mooring lines due to anchor line breakages is strongest among all current directions when 20 θ 30 the extreme tension is also the maximum under intact condition as shown in fig 15 this implies that the influence is related to the extreme tensions before mooring line breakages if the extreme tension in the intact condition is high a stronger influence on the changes of the tensions is expected after mooring line breakages as for the influence on the movements of buoys m ba is always larger than m bf and both are independent of current directions 4 3 mooring system design consideration usually a fish farm consists of several fish cages and these fish cages are arranged in arrays using a grid like mooring system according to cardia and lovatelli 2015 the most common layouts of a fish farm are 2 3 2 4 and 2 6 during the design of a mooring system the ratio between the number of fish cages and the number of anchor lines is a useful indicator to measure the robustness of the fish farm as shown in table 3 a fish farm with a small number of fish cage usually has a relatively larger number of anchor lines per fish cage a larger number of anchor lines per fish cage is preferred in an exposed site as the position of the fish farm can be kept more securely as shown in fig 19 the maximum increment of tension in the single cage fish farm is less than half of that in the 1 4 multi cage fish farm thus the fish farm with a larger number of anchor lines per fish cage has a higher chance to sustain the fish farm after one of the mooring lines breaks while in a sheltered site a fish farm with more fish cages and small anchor lines per fish cage is preferable as it requires relatively fewer anchors and mooring lines and subsequently lower installation costs in some cases additional anchor lines are required to reinforce the mooring system particularly in an exposed site fig 19 shows the relationship between the maximum tension increment in the mooring system and the maximum buoy movement after one mooring line breaks for example one point in the left scatterplot is extracted based on the first column of fig 10 the x value in the scatter plot corresponds to the maximum movement which is from b00 and the y value corresponds to the maximum tension increment which is from mx10 the figure summarises the results for all the cases with different breakage situations due to the symmetry of the fish farm set up the scatter plots only include results for current directions of 0 θ 90 thus there are 10 12 120 points in the left subplot and 10 27 270 points in the right subplot according to the right subplot the breakages at the mx anchor lines can lead to a higher tension increment in the mooring system compared to the breakages at the my anchor lines in order to reinforce the mooring system additional anchor lines should be added as a backup for the mx anchor lines according to figs 15 and 18 when 20 θ 30 the extreme tension in the mooring system is the maximum and the influence of mooring line breakages is also the strongest thus the most effective way to improve the security and reliability of this 1x4 multi cage fish farm is to add additional anchor lines in the four corners as shown in fig 20 4 4 observations during operation the breaking strength for the considered anchor lines 50 mm three strand polysteel rope in this study is around 360 kn which is larger than the extreme tension around 220 kn in the remaining mooring lines of the 1x4 multi cage fish farm after one of the mooring lines breaks thus the mooring system should not have progressive collapse under operational conditions however if this breakage is not detected the damaged mooring system may not be able to keep the fish farm in position during higher currents and waves consequently the undetected mooring line breakage can lead to a structural collapse and fish escape which is a serious accident as reported by føre and thorvaldsen 2021 the most serious fish escape in the period of 2010 2018 occurs because of the breakages in the mooring system in order to avoid this serious fish escape one way is to increase the conservativeness during the design which means to increase the breaking strength of anchor lines by using stronger material or a larger diameter of the ropes this improvement can increase the initial financial investment for a fish farm another way is to monitor the positions of buoys during or after in situ operations according to ns9415 standards norway 2009 the regular inspections of a fish farm only emphasize the structural integrity of netting and floating collar monitoring the positions of buoys has not been given enough attention however based on the results from sections 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 the displacements of the buoys can act as a good indicator to detect the mooring line breakage as shown in fig 19 the tension increment in the mooring system has a strong correlation with the movement of buoys if one of the buoys is observed to have a large movement it is most likely that one of the mooring lines breaks the present analysis shows that the broken mooring line is most likely the one directly connected to the buoy with the largest movement in norway most of the in situ operations in a fish farm are handled by various auxiliary equipment such as net cleaners buoy ropes for crowding of fish tarpaulins for parasite treatment and netting for fish handing it may not be easy to notice the movement of buoys while the equipment operators are working from a practical point of view it is useful to install a global positioning system gps device on each buoy the gps device can record the locations of buoys and send the information back to the operators and administrators based on the movements of buoys a warning system to detect mooring line breakages can be established according to the previous studies by zhao et al 2019 and bi et al 2020 a warning system for mooring line breakages can be established through a deep learning method based on more simulations as presented in the present study by then the breakages in the mooring system can be quickly and automatically discovered and precisely located and the tension distribution in the remaining mooring system can be predicted with seconds the administrator can make a corresponding decision based on these predictions such as 1 stop the operation immediately or 2 continue the operation and repair the damaged mooring line later with more data training the autonomous fish farming system for early prediction proposed by yang et al 2020b can also be achieved in the future 5 conclusions in the present study the structural responses of the two fish farms i e a single cage fish farm and a 1 4 multi cage fish farm are comprehensively analysed with respect to combinations of mooring line breakages and current directions due to the symmetry of the two fish farms symmetric results are shown and discussed based on these results suggestions to improve the design of the mooring system are given it is also recommended to monitor the positions of buoys during operation to detect the mooring line breakages besides the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 breakage at one mooring line is unlikely to cause a progressive collapse of the fish fam under operational conditions such as current velocity 0 5 m s the extreme tension in the remaining mooring lines of the 1x4 multi cage fish farm is around 220 kn after one of the mooring lines breaks under operational condition this value is 3 6 times larger than the pre tension and 60 of the designed breaking strength however mooring line breakages may cause structural collapse and fish escape when the current and waves become stronger if the breakages remain undetected 2 monitoring the positions of buoys during and after in situ operations is recommended and could be emphasised in the operational handbook since mooring line breakages can be discovered and located from the movement of buoys the broken mooring line is usually directly connected to the buoy with the largest movement 3 the increment of tension in the mooring system due to mooring line breakages has a strong positive correlation with the movement of buoys based on the displacement of the buoys with the largest movement the maximum tension increment in the mooring system can be estimated this estimation can help the operators of fish farms to decide whether or not to repair the damaged mooring line immediately credit authorship contribution statement hui cheng conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data

20324,a series of 1 g experimental tests was conducted to investigate the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity of bucket foundations in sand polycarbonate model buckets with a constant diameter of 150 mm and length to diameter l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were employed varying loading rates from 0 002 n s to 4 1 n s the slow loading rate of 0 002 n s induced drained conditions characterised with substantially small suction force and high skirt resistance the fast loading rate of 4 1 n s induced nearly undrained conditions characterised by large suction force and almost full uplift of the soil plug the pullout capacity increased almost linearly with the l d ratio a 50 increase in embedment depth resulted in an average increase in pullout capacity of 40 the pullout capacity and suction force inside the bucket rapidly increased with the loading rate in the partially drained condition and converged to nearly constant values in the undrained condition in the nearly undrained condition the suction force at the tip was approximately half of that under the lid the simplified approach reasonably predicted the capacities of buckets with various l d ratios keywords bucket foundation 1 g model tests pullout capacity embedment ratio loading rate drainage condition 1 introduction in recent years the use of bucket foundations has increased in the yellow sea of the korean peninsula where offshore wind power development is currently taking place tripod bucket foundations are considered candidate options to support offshore wind turbine structures kim et al 2010 dnv 2014 the priority sites have considerably large wind speeds and the water depth varies between 20 m and 50m park and kim 2019 a tripod bucket foundation is an expanded form of a single bucket foundation consisting of three single buckets grouped in a triangular form koh et al 2016 a single bucket foundation is a form of skirted suction foundation cylindrical in shape with a closed top and open bottom bransby and randolph 1999 tjelta 2001 bucket foundations have l d less than or equal to 1 l length d diameter this range of l d is smaller compared with 0 5 l d 4 and l d 5 for suction caissons and suction piles respectively el gharbawy et al 1998 tjelta 2015 the tripod bucket is installed in the seabed by mobilising suction pressure in individual buckets the suction pressure is mobilised by pumping out water trapped inside the buckets this process causes a pressure differential across the lid of the buckets thus penetrating the buckets to the desired depth houlsby and byrne 2005 suction cannot be mobilised in the dry soil condition which makes bucket penetration inapplicable the impact of wind and wave loads subjects the tripod bucket to failure by horizontal moment pullout and compression loadings the horizontal bearing capacity can be evaluated by applying equations proposed by kim et al 2014 which account for the effects of bucket diameter embedment depth and spacing between individual buckets of the tripod group the horizontal bearing capacity increases with the increase in bucket diameter embedment depth and spacing between individual buckets the previous study by tran et al 2017 analysed the capacity of a tripod bucket foundation the findings showed that the bucket demonstrates a push and pull behaviour when the loading is applied to the tripod bucket system the moment capacity of the tripod bucket is mainly governed by the vertical pullout capacity of a single bucket the moment capacity of the tripod bucket foundation increased with the bucket diameter and vertical load subjected to the foundation by the super structure wind and wave loads impact the wind turbine structure subjecting the windward bucket to uplift the uplift of the windward bucket causes other buckets to compress into the ground this imbalance may cause breakdown of the entire structure and the supported components the pullout capacity of one bucket the windward bucket plays a major role in the stability of the entire tripod system and dominates the design of a stable tripod bucket foundation kim et al 2014 the pullout load can act vertical or inclined the vertical pullout load condition results in smaller capacities compared with the inclined pullout load condition jones et al 2007 the vertical pullout capacity decreases with the increase in pullout load inclination to the horizontal rao et al 2006 this implies that pullout loads applied in the vertical direction are critical in the design of a stable suction bucket the pullout capacity is significantly influenced by the change in the drainage condition of the soil during bucket uplift the drainage condition can be drained partially drained and undrained nielsen et al 2015 it is influenced by the suction force generated during bucket uplift which depends on factors such as loading or displacement rate permeability and relative density of the soil el gharbawy and olson 1999 finite element fe studies on field buckets showed that substantially slow displacement rates e g 0 001 mm s induce drained pullout whilst rapidly fast displacement rates e g 100 mm s induce undrained conditions achmus and thicken 2014 experimental tests conducted on the model bucket length to diameter l d ratio 1 0 indicated that drained conditions occur at substantially slow loading rates 0 004 n s whilst undrained conditions occur at remarkably large loading rates 2 05 n s vicent et al 2020a when the loading rate is very fast the bucket pulls out rapidly no gap forms under the lid and suction is not dissipated the time period is too short for water to seep inside the bucket therefore the generated suction is sufficiently large to hold a considerable volume of soil during uplift on the other hand when the loading rate is substantially slow seepage occurs inside the bucket and suction is dissipated the bucket pulls out smoothly without the soil plug loading rates that are neither too fast nor too slow induce partially drained conditions which are characterised by partial uplift of the soil plug the failure mechanisms of the bucket are illustrated and discussed by deng and carter 2002 the above discussion implies that the undrained pullout capacity is larger than the drained pullout capacity due to the effects of suction generated inside the bucket el gharbawy and olson 1998 although bucket foundations are not applied on dry ground hung et al 2017 compared pullout capacities of model buckets l d 0 5 and 1 0 in dry and saturated sands to confirm the effects of ground saturation on pullout capacity the pullout capacity in saturated sand was approximately 1 3 times larger than that in dry sand the large pullout capacity in saturated sand was due to the suction force generated inside the bucket the pullout capacity at l d 0 5 increased approximately two times when the embedment ratio was doubled in the case of saturated sand the suction pressure inside the bucket at l d 0 5 increased by 46 when the embedment ratio increased to 1 0 a previous study reported that the undrained pullout capacity is approximately three times larger than the drained pullout capacity iskander et al 2002 studies on drained pullout capacity indicated that increasing the embedment depth of the bucket and relative density of the soil increases the pullout capacity wang et al 2019 under partially drained and undrained conditions the increase of embedment depth increases the soil plug weight and larger pullout loads are required to uplift the bucket under drained conditions the increase in skirt length increases the contact area between the soil and the bucket thus increasing the skin resistance rao et al 2006 chen and kulhawy 2002 reported that a small difference about 4 exists between the skin friction coefficient β in tension and compression de nicola and randolph 1993 showed that the shaft friction under tension is averagely 0 65 times that under compression o neill and reese 1999 estimated the shaft resistance in tension to be 12 25 smaller compared to that in compression the difference was attributed to the poisson s ratio effect which reduces and increases the diameter of the shaft during uplift and compression loadings respectively various models have been proposed to predict the pullout capacity of the bucket the general applicability of the proposed models is limited because they are subject to soil type and drainage condition in cohesive soils the pullout capacities can be predicted by applying models developed from previous studies on clay grounds patel and singh 2019 the models take into account factors such as suction at the bottom of the bucket embedment ratio shear strength and frictional resistance outside the bucket a significant portion of the priority site in the yellow sea is covered by sandy ground qiao et al 2017 only a few equations can predict the pullout capacity in sandy ground iskander et al 2002 sawicki et al 2016 moreover the proposed equations constitute parameters that may not be easy to determine thus evaluation of the pullout capacity in sandy ground remains a challenge and calls for further studies particularly the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity in the present study a series of 1 g experimental tests was conducted to investigate the effects of embedment depth on the static pullout capacity of buckets embedment ratios l d of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were applied and the loading rates varied from 0 002 n s to 4 1 n s the suction pressure soil heave and drained partially drained and undrained pullout capacities were investigated the current study is a further study after vicent et al 2020a and is intended to verify whether the simplified approach vicent et al 2020a can reasonably predict the pullout capacity of buckets with various embedment ratios l d additionally the current study applies transparent polycarbonate bucket models so that the extent of soil heave inside the buckets can be clearly visualised the findings of this study can be applied for the preliminary design of suction buckets under pullout loading 2 model tests 2 1 bucket models and test program fig 1 shows the bucket models used to conduct the experimental tests the buckets had a uniform diameter d of 150 mm and l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 the model buckets represented field bucket foundations with a constant diameter of 15 m and varying skirt lengths a scale factor for length of 1 100 was applied to model buckets adopting the scaling laws proposed by wood 2004 the buckets were manufactured from a strong transparent plastic polycarbonate material with a young s modulus e of 2 41 gpa and poisson s ratio ν of 0 36 the skirt and lid thicknesses were 1 and 5 mm respectively the skirt and lid were sufficiently strong to resist deformations during pullout loading the bucket was ventilated with three holes on the lid to pass out air and water trapped inside the bucket during installation the holes were closed before applying the pullout load a fourth hole was drilled through the lid to facilitate attachment of the pore pressure transducer for measuring suction pressure below the lid table 1 summarises the test program of the study loading rates from 0 002 n s to 4 1 n s were applied to buckets with l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 this test program was sufficient to capture the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity and suction inside the bucket under drained partially drained and undrained conditions the extent of soil heaving inside the buckets was clearly observed because the model buckets were transparent the heave phenomena were not visualised by previous studies because the employed bucket models were opaque deformation of the bucket skirt might occur when polycarbonate buckets are installed in very dense soils this effect is attributed to the considerably small value of young s modulus 2 41 gpa for the polycarbonate material this young s modulus value is approximately 80 times smaller than that of commonly used materials such as steel e 210 gpa in addition the polycarbonate material is not resistant to scratching scratches on the bucket skirt can result in over prediction of skin resistance de la colina martínez et al 2019 however in this study bucket deformations did not occur because the model ground was loose bucket scratches were avoided through careful handling thus the effects of bucket material would not be significant 2 2 test equipment and procedure fig 2 shows the set up of the test equipment used to conduct the experimental tests the whole set up consisted of a circular soil container with a diameter of 600 mm and height of 650 mm a light weight loading container a water supply tank and a 1 mm diameter tension wire passing over a fixed two pulley system the instrumentation included a load cell 50 kgf pore pressure transducers p306a 05 two linear variable differential transformers lvdts sdp 200d i e 200 mm and a gtdl series data logger gtdl 620 the load cell measured the pullout load and pore pressure transducers 1 and 2 measured the suction force below the lid and tip of the bucket respectively the lvdts measured the bucket pullout displacement the data logger applied multiscan and multiload software programs to record analyse display and save experimental data to apply the pullout load on the bucket the control valve was adjusted to regulate a constant water flow rate into the loading container as water accumulated in the loading container the tension in the wire increased thus applying the pullout load on the bucket 2 3 ground preparation and properties the model ground was silica sand and its particle size distribution and soil properties are shown in fig 3 and table 2 respectively a 5 mm thick circular soil container with a diameter of 600 mm and height of 650 mm was put in place to accommodate the model ground the dimensions of the soil container were decided after conducting a series of preliminary fe analyses to investigate the effects of various boundary extents on pullout capacity the above geometric parameters were confirmed to have no effect on the pullout capacity of the buckets the model ground was prepared by applying the water pluviation method vaid and negussey 1988 the sand was first saturated in water for a period exceeding 48 h vicent et al 2019 the circular soil container was then filled with water a sieve astm no 40 was stacked on top of the soil box whilst ensuring that the mesh is submerged portions of saturated sand were evenly dispersed over the submerged mesh this prompted the sand particles to drop in water with a constant velocity and finally settling to form a uniform ground the dispersion of sand over the submerged mesh was continuously done until a targeted ground thickness of 550 mm was achieved the above procedures were applied to the model ground of each experimental test the average relative density of the model ground was 28 which revealed a loose state kaniraj 1988 the angle of friction was estimated as 30 5⁰ from φ 26⁰ 10d r 0 4c u 1 6log d 50 d r in fraction where c u uniformity coefficient and d 50 mean grain size in mm das 2017 alternatively φ can be estimated using φ 25⁰ 0 18d r d r in which gives φ 30⁰ das 2007 the two expressions give approximately equal values of φ fig 4 shows the average unit weight of the model ground γ sat γ sat was calculated from soil samples collected at increasing depths of the soil profile and found to be 17 3 kn m3 the ground was left to stand for 24 h before commencing bucket installation this time period was sufficient to allow maturity of the fresh ground and clear visibility of the ground surface the latter is significant during the process of bucket installation a 10 mm thick acrylic template 650 mm in diameter with a centre hole was used to guide the centering of the bucket the central hole diameter was 6 mm larger than the outer diameter of the bucket to allow for adjustments during bucket placement the template was positioned to match with the top edge of the soil container and by using the guide beam the bucket was lowered through the central hole to touch the ground surface the guide beam and vertical guide applied were similar to those applied by hung et al 2017 two inclinometers were placed on the lid of the bucket to monitor bucket tilting during installation the bucket was slowly penetrated into the ground velocity v 0 0625 mm s by incrementally adding weights over the vertical guide connected to the bucket bucket penetration was stopped at the instant when the lid made contact with the ground surface the contact between the lid and the ground surface was observed by looking through the open holes on the lid the applied penetration velocity was sufficiently small enough not to cause soil disturbances and excess pore water pressure generation inside the bucket this penetration velocity is supported by previous studies wang et al 2019 guo et al 2012 the air drainage holes on the lid of the bucket were closed before commencing the test the method of installation applied in lab tests affects model results luke et al 2003 conducted laboratory tests on 100 mm diameter caissons installed by using suction and dead weight the peak side resistance of caissons installed partially using suction was approximately 20 higher than that of caissons installed using dead weights kelly et al 2006 conducted laboratory tests on caissons l d 0 66 d 150 mm installed in sand by suction and pushing accumulated deformations of caissons installed using suction were larger than those of a pushed installation the difference was attributed to loosening of sand surrounding the caisson during suction installation comparison of laboratory test data with data from large field suction caissons l d 0 66 d 1500 mm installed with suction revealed that the disturbance due to suction is relatively less important in large field suction caissons suction installation may create a localised zone of disturbance in the region of soil surrounding the suction caisson the zone of disturbance does not increase proportionally to the diameter of the caisson kelly et al 2006 3 test results and discussion 3 1 pullout load and suction fig 5 illustrates the pullout load displacement curves of the buckets l d 1 5 1 0 and 0 5 the curves initially show an almost vertical trend which then falls after the pullout load has accumulated to some large values during the early periods of loading the pullout load is applied to the bucket but no bucket uplift occurs the reason is that the accumulating load is still smaller than the total skin resistance of the bucket immediately after the skin resistance has been exceeded the bucket starts to pull out subsequent loading results in significant bucket displacements the larger the loading rate the higher the load displacement curves for loading rates of 0 08 4 1 n s additional resistance to pullout comes from the suction generated inside the bucket during uplift fig 6 shows the suction pressure developed under the lid of the buckets suction pressure is defined as measured pore pressure minus hydrostatic pore pressure the suction pressure was measured by pore pressure transducer 1 attached on the lid of the bucket shown in fig 2 the pore pressure transducer moved along with the bucket during uplift this technique enabled the monitoring and capturing of suction pressure generated during bucket uplift the suction pressure increased with bucket uplift and loading rate the curves in fig 6 show that the larger the loading rate the larger the suction pressure generated inside the bucket at a small slow loading rate of 0 002 n s the suction pressure inside the bucket was very small and had negligible effect on the soil trapped inside the bucket as the loading rate increased the generated suction pressure increased this increased the volume of soil uplifted with the bucket fig 7 the gap that developed under the lid during uplift was filled with only water and decreased with the increase of the loading rate table 3 shows values for the gap ratio δy δ estimated on the basis of experimental observations δy is the length of the gap formed under the lid and δ is the pullout displacement of 30 mm the gap ratio indicates the drainage condition of the soil during pull out the gap ratio values of one δy δ 1 and zero δy δ 0 imply drained and undrained conditions respectively moreover the gap ratio values between one and zero 0 δy δ 1 indicate a partially drained condition δy δ 1 when loading rates are smaller than or equal to 0 002 n s because the bucket pulled out empty without soil plug δy δ 0 for large loading rates because the soil plug almost filled the bucket during uplift except for the drained condition δy was constant at a particular loading rate the full uplift of the soil plug for l d 0 5 was possible at 2 1 n s whilst that for l d 1 0 was at 4 1 n s this implies that the larger the l d ratio the larger the loading rate required to cause uplift of the full soil plug fig 8 shows the increase in pullout velocity and lid suction pressure with time at various loading rates and l d ratio the increasing trend of lid suction is similar to that of pullout velocity the suction pressure initially increases at a slow rate when the pullout velocity is less than approximately 0 25 mm s especially at slow loading rates pullout velocities over 0 25 mm s cause rapid increase of suction pressure inside the bucket at slow loading rates water seeping into the bucket can accumulate under the lid thus degrading the suction pressure inside the bucket at large fast loading rates e g 4 1 n s the bucket rapidly pulls out no gap forms under the lid because the time is too short to permit seepage flow into the bucket consequently the generated suction pressures are not lost 3 2 pullout capacity v0 the pullout capacity was estimated by applying the tangent intersection method illustrated in fig 9 graham et al 1982 hung et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 vicent et al 2020b two tangents were drawn to touch the early and later sections of each curve the coordinate w 0 v 0 on the curve corresponding to the intersection of the tangents defined the pullout capacity v 0 and the corresponding displacement w 0 to minimise overestimation of pullout capacities the analysis was limited to bucket displacements within 0 2d the estimated pullout capacities occurred at displacements within 0 03 0 1d this displacement range is comparable to the range of 0 05 0 1d reported as being sufficient to generate maximum capacities kelly et al 2004 therefore the pullout capacities obtained in this study were appropriate table 4 shows a summary of the pullout capacities and suction forces at various loading rates fig 10 shows the variation of pullout capacity with l d ratio and loading rate the pullout capacity increased almost linearly with the l d ratio at the slowest loading rate and this was somewhat nonlinear at high loading rate more than 2 1 n s however the average trend line shows that a linear relationship is acceptable fig 10 the measured pullout capacities fell between the bottom and top boundary lines for the drained v d and undrained v u conditions respectively the bottom boundary line v d matched pullout capacity data at the slowest loading rate of 0 002 n s whilst the top boundary line matched the extrapolated data for v u shown in fig 11 the shaded area represents cases of partially drained conditions with pullout capacities higher than v d but lower than v u the data points at 4 1 n s are close to the v u line exhibiting nearly undrained conditions the pullout capacity increased approximately linearly with the l d ratio as previously discussed the functions describing linear trends were applied to estimate pullout capacities of buckets for intermediate l d ratio increments of 50 l d 0 75 1 125 and 2 25 when the l d ratio increased from 0 5 to 0 75 and further to 1 125 the average percentage increases in the pullout capacities were 35 and 38 respectively when the l d ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 5 and further to 2 25 the average percentage increases in the pullout capacities were 40 and 44 respectively for a 50 successive increase in the l d ratio the average percentage increase in pullout capacities was 39 25 say 40 the above finding is significant considering l d ratios in the range of 0 5 2 25 moreover suction buckets with l d ratios between 0 5 and 1 0 have been found applicable in the offshore wind industry due to their ease of installation achmus and thicken 2014 in the drained condition the pullout capacity increased with the increase in l d ratio because increasing the embedment length increased the contact area between the soil and the skirt therefore the resistance to pullout increased due to the increase in total skin resistance the effect of change in l d on the pullout capacity was larger in the undrained condition compared to the drained condition this is evidenced by the change of slope for v u fig 10 the suction generated inside the bucket increased with the l d ratio and was sufficient to uplift the entire trapped soil plug a longer bucket skirt implies an increase in bucket volume the larger the volume of soil trapped the larger the weight of soil to be uplifted which results in increased pullout capacities in the drained condition the change in l d ratio only affects the skin resistance but in the undrained condition it affects both the skin resistance and suction fig 11 shows the trends of pullout capacity at increasing l d ratio and loading rate between 0 002 n s and 4 1 n s the pullout capacity increased nonlinearly with the loading rate beyond 4 1 n s the pullout capacity increased uniformly with the loading rate but at a substantially low rate before finally converging to constant values to clarify the trend of pullout capacity at large loading rates an additional test was performed which increased the loading rate up to 7 4 n s the bucket took less than 3 s to pullout a skirt length of 30 mm the pullout rate induced by 7 4 n s was higher than that induced by 4 1 n s 30 mm pullout displacement in 10 s the percentage differences between measured values of pullout capacity lid and tip suction at 4 1 n s and 7 4 n s were considerably small less than 3 the loading rate of 4 1 n s would satisfy the undrained condition the lid and tip suctions were determined as follows firstly the pullout capacity v 0 and the corresponding displacement w 0 were determined by applying the tangent intersection method as discussed above then w 0 was applied to the suction pressure displacement curves to determine lid and tip suctions corresponding to v 0 finally the estimated suction pressures were multiplied by the cross sectional area of the bucket to obtain lid and tip suction forces shown in table 4 fig 12 shows the variation of suction force under the lid f s0 lid with loading rate the trend for the increase of f s0 lid with the loading rate was similar to that for pullout capacity f s0 lid increased nonlinearly with the loading rate until a certain critical value of loading rate was reached beyond the critical value no considerable increase in the suction force was observed despite the increasing loading rate the lid suction was not evenly distributed inside the bucket but it decreased with the increase of depth to the bucket tip fig 13 shows the variation of tip suction f s0 tip with loading rate at various embedment depths f s0 tip increased nonlinearly with the l d ratio and loading rate table 5 summarises data for the proportions of lid suction to pullout capacity f s0 lid v 0 and ratios of tip suction to lid suction f s0 tip f s0 lid the data in table 5 is presented in fig 14 which shows the variation of f s0 lid v 0 fig 14a and f s0 tip f s0 lid fig 14b with loading rate at various l d ratios at loading rates larger than 1 0 n s the lid suction contributed over 70 of the pullout capacity in the nearly undrained conditions the ratios of tip to lid suctions were 0 54 0 45 and 0 46 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the f s0 tip f s0 lid ratio increased with the loading rate the tip suction was close to 50 of the lid suction in the nearly undrained condition the bottom resistance below the tip of the bucket is expected to increase with the increase of tip suction however due to seepage flow outside and underneath the bucket a tension crack develops below the bucket which limits the bottom resistance to uplift 3 2 1 drained and undrained pullout capacities the drained pullout out capacities v d were obtained by applying the slowest loading rate of 0 002 n s and setting the drainage air holes open as previously shown in fig 5 the pullout load accumulated for some time without the bucket undergoing any displacement a critical value v d of pullout load was reached beyond which the empty bucket pulled out smoothly at a constant pullout load when the pullout load exceeded the skin resistance the bucket rapidly pulled out and large displacements were observed the drained pullout capacities v d were estimated as 12 45 20 25 and 31 98 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the initial resistance of the bucket to uplift despite the accumulating pullout load is attributed to the skin resistance along the inner and outer faces of the bucket skirt theoretically the drained pullout capacity is equal to the summation of skin resistances along the inner r s inner and outer r s outer faces of the bucket skirt and the submerged weight of the bucket w b as shown by eq 1 das 1986 byrne 2000 1 v d r s outer r s inner w b 2 w h e r e r s o u t e r r s i n n e r γ l 2 k t a n δ π d l the total skin resistances r s were obtained by substituting values of w b and v d in eq 1 w b 4 91 5 0 and 5 1 n for l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively on average say w b 5 0 n the values of r s were estimated as 7 45 15 25 and 26 98 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively r s was used to compute r s o u t e r and r s i n n e r and the results were substituted in eq 2 to obtain the skin friction coefficient β ktanδ the ktanδ values were estimated as 0 38 0 20 and 0 15 for l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively table 6 β decreased non linearly with the increase in bucket embedment depth fig 15 this observed trend for β is supported by findings from previous studies fellenius 2014 rollins et al 2005 although the effects of ktanδ are not easy to separate houlsby and byrne 2005 k is known to be a function of k 0 the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest k k 0 is predicted to vary between 0 67 and 1 0 rollins et al 2005 k 0 σ h σ v where σ h and σ v are the insitu lateral and vertical effective stresses respectively as σ v increases with soil depth k 0 decreases which results in smaller values for k kulhawy 1984 the changes in σ h are substantially small because buckets comprise of thin skirts that minimise disturbance of soils surrounding the bucket the decrease of k as embedment depth increases contributes greatly to the decrease of β as the l d ratio increases eq 3 was proposed to predict β in buckets with various l d ratios the β values of this study were comparable with those predicted for an equivalent prototype bucket in medium dense sand the data points for medium dense sand were obtained by applying finite element analysis procedures discussed in the study of vicent et al 2020b medium dense sand was chosen for comparison because it has a higher relative density compared to the loose model ground this ensures that the peak friction angle in the model corresponds to that in full scale prototypes leblanc et al 2010 kelly et al 2006 vicent et al 2019 found that the stress state positions of loose used for the study and medium dense sands lie equi distant from the steady state line thus exhibiting a similar behaviour this finding is supported by altaee and fellenius 1994 who demonstrated that a loose model ground can behave similarly to the prototype ground if the stress states of the model and prototype grounds have equal proximity upsilon parameter to the steady state line 3 β 0 20704 l d 0 855 where β ktanδ l and d are the embedment length and diameter of the bucket respectively the effects of change in relative density of soil on β can be addressed by applying eq 4 proposed by vicent et al 2020b eq 4 generally predicts the average values of β and might not reflect the effects of the increase in l d ratio 4 β a v 0 0493 e 2 6525 t a n where is the angle of friction for the soil applying eq 4 to experimental data results β 0 23 in loose sand β ranges between 0 2 and 0 4 cfem 2006 the experimental values of β are comparable to β av eq 4 and fall in the range specified by cfem 2006 the undrained pullout capacity v u is characterised by uplift of the full soil plug as previously discussed nearly undrained conditions prevailed at a loading rate of 4 1 n s and more than 95 of the soil plug uplifted with the bucket therefore to obtain a proper estimate for the undrained pullout capacity a curve defined by a hyperbolic function was fitted into experimental data points fig 11 the fitted curve matched well with the experimental data the curve was extrapolated to obtain the ultimate values for pullout capacities the ultimate values defined the undrained pullout capacities v u and estimated as 40 81 75 94 and 98 48 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively following a similar approach the suction force f su under the lid corresponding to undrained pullout capacities was estimated as 28 23 50 73 and 71 47 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively fig 12 the suction force under the bucket lid converged to constant values in the undrained conditions and contributed approximately 69 67 and 73 of the pullout capacity at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively as shown in table 7 the pullout capacity under the undrained condition can be predicted by applying eq 5 vicent et al 2020a 5 v u w b w s o i l r s o u t e r f t e n s i l e f s e e p a g e where w b and w s o i l are the submerged weights for the bucket and soil respectively r s outer is the outer skirt resistance f tensile is the transient tensile capacity below the bucket tip and f seepage is the increase in external skin resistance due to downward seepage eq 5 considers the equilibrium of forces acting on the submerged bucket vicent et al 2020a the undrained pullout capacity parameters of eq 5 are shown in table 8 the undrained pullout capacities at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were estimated as 43 86 77 03 and 103 82 n respectively the submerged weights for the buckets w b were 4 91 5 0 and 5 10 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the difference between w b values was small because the polycarbonate material is light the submerged weight of the soil was calculated considering uplift of the full soil plug the outer skin resistance was estimated by applying eq 2 f tensile is equal to the difference between the suction force under the lid and the submerged weight of the soil f seepage was predicted using eq 6 and estimated as 6 91 13 67 and 13 76 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively 6 f s e e p a g e 1 2 i γ w l k t a n δ π d l where i is the hydraulic gradient due to downward seepage and other parameters are as previously described the hydraulic gradient i was estimated from pore pressure measurements at the tip of the outer bucket skirt the predicted i values were 1 42 1 33 and 0 8 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively eq 5 may not be easily applied in the field because f tensile and f seepage are difficult to determine to address this problem vicent et al 2020a proposed a simplified approach eq 7 to evaluate the pullout capacity however eq 7 was developed on the basis of data from 1 g experimental tests on an aluminium model bucket with l d 1 0 d 150 mm the current study further investigated whether the simplified approach is applicable to buckets with l d ratios larger or smaller than 1 0 7 v u w b w soil r s where w b and w soil are the bucket and soil weights respectively and r s r s outer f seepage assuming that f seepage is equal to r s inner eq 7 predicted the undrained pullout capacity as 36 4 67 01 and 101 47 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the v u predicted by eqs 5 and 7 were compared with extrapolated v u test from fig 11 as shown in table 8 the percentage differences between v u test and v u eq 5 were 7 2 1 42 and 5 18 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the percentage differences between v u test and v u eq 7 were 11 42 12 49 and 2 99 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the percentage differences between v u test and v u predicted using eqs 5 and 7 were substantially small although predictions by eq 5 showed smaller errors compared with predictions by eq 7 this is because the parameters for eq 5 were derived from experimental results the proposed equation is very simple and gives reasonable predictions for the pullout capacity a previous research proposed that the pullout capacity can be predicted by applying eq 8 as follows houlsby et al 2005 8 v o f s 0 l i d 1 2 l d k t a n δ where f s 0 l i d is the suction force under the lid at pullout capacity v 0 and other parameters are as previously described eq 8 is applicable to buckets with thin skirts and requires measurement of suction pressure generated inside the bucket during pullout the measured suction force f s u l i d from fig 12 and the calculated ktanδ table 6 were substituted in eq 8 the undrained pullout capacities v u were predicted as 38 96 71 02 and 103 63 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively v u test was comparable to v u eq 8 as this is shown by the small percentage differences less than 10 the percentage differences between v u test and v u eq 8 were 4 63 6 70 and 5 10 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the predictions by the simplified approach eq 7 were comparable to v u eq 8 the percentage differences between v u eq 7 and v u eq 8 were 6 79 5 81 and 2 11 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively fig 16 presents a comparison between v u predicted by the simplified approach with that predicted by other models discussed above a good agreement exists between predictions by the simplified approach and other models therefore the simplified approach whose parameters are easy to determine can be applied to predict the undrained pullout capacity of buckets with various l d ratios the v u predicted by the simplified approach was divided by v d drained capacity to estimate the v u v d ratio shown in table 9 the v u v d ratio is equal to 2 92 3 31 and 3 17 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively approximating to an average value of 3 13 v u v d 3 13 is approximately equal to v u v d 3 that was predicted for buckets in sand iskander et al 2002 and is 15 larger than v u v d 2 7 that was predicted in cohesive soil patel and singh 2019 the equations proposed by this study were applied to predict the drained and undrained pullout capacities of previous studies tables 10 and 11 show the comparison of the findings and the parameters are as previously described the pullout capacities predicted by this study were comparable to those predicted by previous studies of allersma et al 2000 cho and bang 2002 hung et al 2017 iskander et al 2002 and kulczykowski et al 2020 cho and bang 2002 analysed the pullout capacities of a series of suction piles l d 0 5 5 0 d 3 05 m in sand and clay in sand the suction pile uplifted without the soil plug when l d 3 42 in clay ground drained pullout occurred in suction piles with l d 0 8 allersma et al 2000 investigated the pullout capacity of model suction piles l d 1 167 d 600 mm in sand the tests were conducted at single 1 g and multiple gravity 150 g the two test conditions showed approximately equal peak loads which defined the drained pullout capacity iskander et al 2002 performed tests on a small scale caisson l d 2 0 d 100 mm in sand the drained pullout capacity was reached at a small displacement of 0 043d whereas the undrained pullout capacity occurred at a bucket displacement of 0 2d the pullout resistance in caissons installed using suction was 25 lower than that of caissons installed by pushing hung et al 2017 investigated the pullout capacity of buckets l d 0 5 and 1 0 in sand the findings were applied to study the effects of vertical cyclic loading on model buckets kulczykowski et al 2020 conducted 1 g experimental tests on a model bucket with l d 1 0 test results showed that the displacement rate significantly affected pullout resistance and lid suction but had little effect on the stress displacement relationship the drained pullout capacities were evaluated by applying eq 1 the coefficient for skin friction β applied to calculate r s was obtained by using eqs 3 and 4 the current study has various limitations the bucket models applied in this study are smaller compared to full scale bucket foundations therefore cavitation is absent because suction pressure generated beneath the model bucket is considerably smaller than the cavitation limit of 100 kpa thicken et al 2014 meanwhile cavitation may occur in full scale bucket foundations which limits the increase in suction pressure and pullout capacity furthermore full scale bucket foundations are predominantly loaded with cyclic loads of wind and waves the cyclic response is affected by several factors such as the magnitude of peak cyclic load number of applied load cycles frequency and inclination of the load el gharbawy and olson 1999 which are not addressed by the current study therefore the simplified approach may be applicable during preliminary design considering the above limitations 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity of bucket foundations in sand 1 g model tests were conducted on polycarbonate model buckets with varying embedment ratios and loading rates the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the tripod bucket foundation system is a suitable foundation for supporting offshore wind turbine structures at intermediate water depth the stability of the entire tripod bucket system is considerably affected by the pullout loads uplifting the windward bucket the pullout of a single bucket is critical in the design of a stable tripod bucket system 2 the bucket pullout load is influenced by the change in drainage conditions of the soil inside and outside the bucket the change in drainage conditions can be due to changes in the loading rate and embedment ratio drained conditions occurred at substantially slow loading rates whilst undrained conditions occurred at considerably fast loading rates a partially drained loading condition was induced by intermediate loading rates 3 the suction force generated under drained conditions was substantially small and negligible when the loading rate was increased the suction pressure inside the bucket increased proportionally to the pullout load in the undrained conditions the suction force inside the bucket was substantially large and contributed the largest portion of the pullout capacity 4 the pullout capacity of the bucket increased approximately linearly with the bucket embedment ratio a 50 increase in embedment depth resulted in an average increase in pullout capacity of 40 under drained conditions the increase in bucket skirt length increased the bucket soil contact area which increased the skirt resistance to bucket uplift in the partially drained and undrained conditions the volume and weight of the entrapped soil increased with the bucket embedment ratio the increase of bucket embedment depth increased the seepage flow path thereby decreasing the seepage flow inside the bucket this minimised the loss of the generated suction thus increasing the pullout capacity 5 the drained pullout capacity was estimated by summing up the skin resistance along the inner and outer faces of the bucket skirt and the submerged weight of the bucket equations have been proposed to predict the skin friction coefficient β which can be applied to evaluate the skin resistance at various l d ratios the undrained pullout capacity was predicted by applying the proposed simplified approach which suggests that v u equals to the summation of the bucket weight soil weight and total skin resistance the approach reasonably predicted the undrained pullout capacities the pullout capacities predicted by the proposed approach were comparable to those predicted by previous models the simplified approach is easy to apply because it constitutes parameters whose values are easy to estimate and can be applied to buckets with various embedment ratios 6 the undrained pullout capacities predicted by the simplified approach were approximately three times larger than the drained pullout capacity credit authorship contribution statement vicent ssenyondo conceptualization investigation data curation writing original draft formal analysis

20324,a series of 1 g experimental tests was conducted to investigate the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity of bucket foundations in sand polycarbonate model buckets with a constant diameter of 150 mm and length to diameter l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were employed varying loading rates from 0 002 n s to 4 1 n s the slow loading rate of 0 002 n s induced drained conditions characterised with substantially small suction force and high skirt resistance the fast loading rate of 4 1 n s induced nearly undrained conditions characterised by large suction force and almost full uplift of the soil plug the pullout capacity increased almost linearly with the l d ratio a 50 increase in embedment depth resulted in an average increase in pullout capacity of 40 the pullout capacity and suction force inside the bucket rapidly increased with the loading rate in the partially drained condition and converged to nearly constant values in the undrained condition in the nearly undrained condition the suction force at the tip was approximately half of that under the lid the simplified approach reasonably predicted the capacities of buckets with various l d ratios keywords bucket foundation 1 g model tests pullout capacity embedment ratio loading rate drainage condition 1 introduction in recent years the use of bucket foundations has increased in the yellow sea of the korean peninsula where offshore wind power development is currently taking place tripod bucket foundations are considered candidate options to support offshore wind turbine structures kim et al 2010 dnv 2014 the priority sites have considerably large wind speeds and the water depth varies between 20 m and 50m park and kim 2019 a tripod bucket foundation is an expanded form of a single bucket foundation consisting of three single buckets grouped in a triangular form koh et al 2016 a single bucket foundation is a form of skirted suction foundation cylindrical in shape with a closed top and open bottom bransby and randolph 1999 tjelta 2001 bucket foundations have l d less than or equal to 1 l length d diameter this range of l d is smaller compared with 0 5 l d 4 and l d 5 for suction caissons and suction piles respectively el gharbawy et al 1998 tjelta 2015 the tripod bucket is installed in the seabed by mobilising suction pressure in individual buckets the suction pressure is mobilised by pumping out water trapped inside the buckets this process causes a pressure differential across the lid of the buckets thus penetrating the buckets to the desired depth houlsby and byrne 2005 suction cannot be mobilised in the dry soil condition which makes bucket penetration inapplicable the impact of wind and wave loads subjects the tripod bucket to failure by horizontal moment pullout and compression loadings the horizontal bearing capacity can be evaluated by applying equations proposed by kim et al 2014 which account for the effects of bucket diameter embedment depth and spacing between individual buckets of the tripod group the horizontal bearing capacity increases with the increase in bucket diameter embedment depth and spacing between individual buckets the previous study by tran et al 2017 analysed the capacity of a tripod bucket foundation the findings showed that the bucket demonstrates a push and pull behaviour when the loading is applied to the tripod bucket system the moment capacity of the tripod bucket is mainly governed by the vertical pullout capacity of a single bucket the moment capacity of the tripod bucket foundation increased with the bucket diameter and vertical load subjected to the foundation by the super structure wind and wave loads impact the wind turbine structure subjecting the windward bucket to uplift the uplift of the windward bucket causes other buckets to compress into the ground this imbalance may cause breakdown of the entire structure and the supported components the pullout capacity of one bucket the windward bucket plays a major role in the stability of the entire tripod system and dominates the design of a stable tripod bucket foundation kim et al 2014 the pullout load can act vertical or inclined the vertical pullout load condition results in smaller capacities compared with the inclined pullout load condition jones et al 2007 the vertical pullout capacity decreases with the increase in pullout load inclination to the horizontal rao et al 2006 this implies that pullout loads applied in the vertical direction are critical in the design of a stable suction bucket the pullout capacity is significantly influenced by the change in the drainage condition of the soil during bucket uplift the drainage condition can be drained partially drained and undrained nielsen et al 2015 it is influenced by the suction force generated during bucket uplift which depends on factors such as loading or displacement rate permeability and relative density of the soil el gharbawy and olson 1999 finite element fe studies on field buckets showed that substantially slow displacement rates e g 0 001 mm s induce drained pullout whilst rapidly fast displacement rates e g 100 mm s induce undrained conditions achmus and thicken 2014 experimental tests conducted on the model bucket length to diameter l d ratio 1 0 indicated that drained conditions occur at substantially slow loading rates 0 004 n s whilst undrained conditions occur at remarkably large loading rates 2 05 n s vicent et al 2020a when the loading rate is very fast the bucket pulls out rapidly no gap forms under the lid and suction is not dissipated the time period is too short for water to seep inside the bucket therefore the generated suction is sufficiently large to hold a considerable volume of soil during uplift on the other hand when the loading rate is substantially slow seepage occurs inside the bucket and suction is dissipated the bucket pulls out smoothly without the soil plug loading rates that are neither too fast nor too slow induce partially drained conditions which are characterised by partial uplift of the soil plug the failure mechanisms of the bucket are illustrated and discussed by deng and carter 2002 the above discussion implies that the undrained pullout capacity is larger than the drained pullout capacity due to the effects of suction generated inside the bucket el gharbawy and olson 1998 although bucket foundations are not applied on dry ground hung et al 2017 compared pullout capacities of model buckets l d 0 5 and 1 0 in dry and saturated sands to confirm the effects of ground saturation on pullout capacity the pullout capacity in saturated sand was approximately 1 3 times larger than that in dry sand the large pullout capacity in saturated sand was due to the suction force generated inside the bucket the pullout capacity at l d 0 5 increased approximately two times when the embedment ratio was doubled in the case of saturated sand the suction pressure inside the bucket at l d 0 5 increased by 46 when the embedment ratio increased to 1 0 a previous study reported that the undrained pullout capacity is approximately three times larger than the drained pullout capacity iskander et al 2002 studies on drained pullout capacity indicated that increasing the embedment depth of the bucket and relative density of the soil increases the pullout capacity wang et al 2019 under partially drained and undrained conditions the increase of embedment depth increases the soil plug weight and larger pullout loads are required to uplift the bucket under drained conditions the increase in skirt length increases the contact area between the soil and the bucket thus increasing the skin resistance rao et al 2006 chen and kulhawy 2002 reported that a small difference about 4 exists between the skin friction coefficient β in tension and compression de nicola and randolph 1993 showed that the shaft friction under tension is averagely 0 65 times that under compression o neill and reese 1999 estimated the shaft resistance in tension to be 12 25 smaller compared to that in compression the difference was attributed to the poisson s ratio effect which reduces and increases the diameter of the shaft during uplift and compression loadings respectively various models have been proposed to predict the pullout capacity of the bucket the general applicability of the proposed models is limited because they are subject to soil type and drainage condition in cohesive soils the pullout capacities can be predicted by applying models developed from previous studies on clay grounds patel and singh 2019 the models take into account factors such as suction at the bottom of the bucket embedment ratio shear strength and frictional resistance outside the bucket a significant portion of the priority site in the yellow sea is covered by sandy ground qiao et al 2017 only a few equations can predict the pullout capacity in sandy ground iskander et al 2002 sawicki et al 2016 moreover the proposed equations constitute parameters that may not be easy to determine thus evaluation of the pullout capacity in sandy ground remains a challenge and calls for further studies particularly the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity in the present study a series of 1 g experimental tests was conducted to investigate the effects of embedment depth on the static pullout capacity of buckets embedment ratios l d of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were applied and the loading rates varied from 0 002 n s to 4 1 n s the suction pressure soil heave and drained partially drained and undrained pullout capacities were investigated the current study is a further study after vicent et al 2020a and is intended to verify whether the simplified approach vicent et al 2020a can reasonably predict the pullout capacity of buckets with various embedment ratios l d additionally the current study applies transparent polycarbonate bucket models so that the extent of soil heave inside the buckets can be clearly visualised the findings of this study can be applied for the preliminary design of suction buckets under pullout loading 2 model tests 2 1 bucket models and test program fig 1 shows the bucket models used to conduct the experimental tests the buckets had a uniform diameter d of 150 mm and l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 the model buckets represented field bucket foundations with a constant diameter of 15 m and varying skirt lengths a scale factor for length of 1 100 was applied to model buckets adopting the scaling laws proposed by wood 2004 the buckets were manufactured from a strong transparent plastic polycarbonate material with a young s modulus e of 2 41 gpa and poisson s ratio ν of 0 36 the skirt and lid thicknesses were 1 and 5 mm respectively the skirt and lid were sufficiently strong to resist deformations during pullout loading the bucket was ventilated with three holes on the lid to pass out air and water trapped inside the bucket during installation the holes were closed before applying the pullout load a fourth hole was drilled through the lid to facilitate attachment of the pore pressure transducer for measuring suction pressure below the lid table 1 summarises the test program of the study loading rates from 0 002 n s to 4 1 n s were applied to buckets with l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 this test program was sufficient to capture the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity and suction inside the bucket under drained partially drained and undrained conditions the extent of soil heaving inside the buckets was clearly observed because the model buckets were transparent the heave phenomena were not visualised by previous studies because the employed bucket models were opaque deformation of the bucket skirt might occur when polycarbonate buckets are installed in very dense soils this effect is attributed to the considerably small value of young s modulus 2 41 gpa for the polycarbonate material this young s modulus value is approximately 80 times smaller than that of commonly used materials such as steel e 210 gpa in addition the polycarbonate material is not resistant to scratching scratches on the bucket skirt can result in over prediction of skin resistance de la colina martínez et al 2019 however in this study bucket deformations did not occur because the model ground was loose bucket scratches were avoided through careful handling thus the effects of bucket material would not be significant 2 2 test equipment and procedure fig 2 shows the set up of the test equipment used to conduct the experimental tests the whole set up consisted of a circular soil container with a diameter of 600 mm and height of 650 mm a light weight loading container a water supply tank and a 1 mm diameter tension wire passing over a fixed two pulley system the instrumentation included a load cell 50 kgf pore pressure transducers p306a 05 two linear variable differential transformers lvdts sdp 200d i e 200 mm and a gtdl series data logger gtdl 620 the load cell measured the pullout load and pore pressure transducers 1 and 2 measured the suction force below the lid and tip of the bucket respectively the lvdts measured the bucket pullout displacement the data logger applied multiscan and multiload software programs to record analyse display and save experimental data to apply the pullout load on the bucket the control valve was adjusted to regulate a constant water flow rate into the loading container as water accumulated in the loading container the tension in the wire increased thus applying the pullout load on the bucket 2 3 ground preparation and properties the model ground was silica sand and its particle size distribution and soil properties are shown in fig 3 and table 2 respectively a 5 mm thick circular soil container with a diameter of 600 mm and height of 650 mm was put in place to accommodate the model ground the dimensions of the soil container were decided after conducting a series of preliminary fe analyses to investigate the effects of various boundary extents on pullout capacity the above geometric parameters were confirmed to have no effect on the pullout capacity of the buckets the model ground was prepared by applying the water pluviation method vaid and negussey 1988 the sand was first saturated in water for a period exceeding 48 h vicent et al 2019 the circular soil container was then filled with water a sieve astm no 40 was stacked on top of the soil box whilst ensuring that the mesh is submerged portions of saturated sand were evenly dispersed over the submerged mesh this prompted the sand particles to drop in water with a constant velocity and finally settling to form a uniform ground the dispersion of sand over the submerged mesh was continuously done until a targeted ground thickness of 550 mm was achieved the above procedures were applied to the model ground of each experimental test the average relative density of the model ground was 28 which revealed a loose state kaniraj 1988 the angle of friction was estimated as 30 5⁰ from φ 26⁰ 10d r 0 4c u 1 6log d 50 d r in fraction where c u uniformity coefficient and d 50 mean grain size in mm das 2017 alternatively φ can be estimated using φ 25⁰ 0 18d r d r in which gives φ 30⁰ das 2007 the two expressions give approximately equal values of φ fig 4 shows the average unit weight of the model ground γ sat γ sat was calculated from soil samples collected at increasing depths of the soil profile and found to be 17 3 kn m3 the ground was left to stand for 24 h before commencing bucket installation this time period was sufficient to allow maturity of the fresh ground and clear visibility of the ground surface the latter is significant during the process of bucket installation a 10 mm thick acrylic template 650 mm in diameter with a centre hole was used to guide the centering of the bucket the central hole diameter was 6 mm larger than the outer diameter of the bucket to allow for adjustments during bucket placement the template was positioned to match with the top edge of the soil container and by using the guide beam the bucket was lowered through the central hole to touch the ground surface the guide beam and vertical guide applied were similar to those applied by hung et al 2017 two inclinometers were placed on the lid of the bucket to monitor bucket tilting during installation the bucket was slowly penetrated into the ground velocity v 0 0625 mm s by incrementally adding weights over the vertical guide connected to the bucket bucket penetration was stopped at the instant when the lid made contact with the ground surface the contact between the lid and the ground surface was observed by looking through the open holes on the lid the applied penetration velocity was sufficiently small enough not to cause soil disturbances and excess pore water pressure generation inside the bucket this penetration velocity is supported by previous studies wang et al 2019 guo et al 2012 the air drainage holes on the lid of the bucket were closed before commencing the test the method of installation applied in lab tests affects model results luke et al 2003 conducted laboratory tests on 100 mm diameter caissons installed by using suction and dead weight the peak side resistance of caissons installed partially using suction was approximately 20 higher than that of caissons installed using dead weights kelly et al 2006 conducted laboratory tests on caissons l d 0 66 d 150 mm installed in sand by suction and pushing accumulated deformations of caissons installed using suction were larger than those of a pushed installation the difference was attributed to loosening of sand surrounding the caisson during suction installation comparison of laboratory test data with data from large field suction caissons l d 0 66 d 1500 mm installed with suction revealed that the disturbance due to suction is relatively less important in large field suction caissons suction installation may create a localised zone of disturbance in the region of soil surrounding the suction caisson the zone of disturbance does not increase proportionally to the diameter of the caisson kelly et al 2006 3 test results and discussion 3 1 pullout load and suction fig 5 illustrates the pullout load displacement curves of the buckets l d 1 5 1 0 and 0 5 the curves initially show an almost vertical trend which then falls after the pullout load has accumulated to some large values during the early periods of loading the pullout load is applied to the bucket but no bucket uplift occurs the reason is that the accumulating load is still smaller than the total skin resistance of the bucket immediately after the skin resistance has been exceeded the bucket starts to pull out subsequent loading results in significant bucket displacements the larger the loading rate the higher the load displacement curves for loading rates of 0 08 4 1 n s additional resistance to pullout comes from the suction generated inside the bucket during uplift fig 6 shows the suction pressure developed under the lid of the buckets suction pressure is defined as measured pore pressure minus hydrostatic pore pressure the suction pressure was measured by pore pressure transducer 1 attached on the lid of the bucket shown in fig 2 the pore pressure transducer moved along with the bucket during uplift this technique enabled the monitoring and capturing of suction pressure generated during bucket uplift the suction pressure increased with bucket uplift and loading rate the curves in fig 6 show that the larger the loading rate the larger the suction pressure generated inside the bucket at a small slow loading rate of 0 002 n s the suction pressure inside the bucket was very small and had negligible effect on the soil trapped inside the bucket as the loading rate increased the generated suction pressure increased this increased the volume of soil uplifted with the bucket fig 7 the gap that developed under the lid during uplift was filled with only water and decreased with the increase of the loading rate table 3 shows values for the gap ratio δy δ estimated on the basis of experimental observations δy is the length of the gap formed under the lid and δ is the pullout displacement of 30 mm the gap ratio indicates the drainage condition of the soil during pull out the gap ratio values of one δy δ 1 and zero δy δ 0 imply drained and undrained conditions respectively moreover the gap ratio values between one and zero 0 δy δ 1 indicate a partially drained condition δy δ 1 when loading rates are smaller than or equal to 0 002 n s because the bucket pulled out empty without soil plug δy δ 0 for large loading rates because the soil plug almost filled the bucket during uplift except for the drained condition δy was constant at a particular loading rate the full uplift of the soil plug for l d 0 5 was possible at 2 1 n s whilst that for l d 1 0 was at 4 1 n s this implies that the larger the l d ratio the larger the loading rate required to cause uplift of the full soil plug fig 8 shows the increase in pullout velocity and lid suction pressure with time at various loading rates and l d ratio the increasing trend of lid suction is similar to that of pullout velocity the suction pressure initially increases at a slow rate when the pullout velocity is less than approximately 0 25 mm s especially at slow loading rates pullout velocities over 0 25 mm s cause rapid increase of suction pressure inside the bucket at slow loading rates water seeping into the bucket can accumulate under the lid thus degrading the suction pressure inside the bucket at large fast loading rates e g 4 1 n s the bucket rapidly pulls out no gap forms under the lid because the time is too short to permit seepage flow into the bucket consequently the generated suction pressures are not lost 3 2 pullout capacity v0 the pullout capacity was estimated by applying the tangent intersection method illustrated in fig 9 graham et al 1982 hung et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 vicent et al 2020b two tangents were drawn to touch the early and later sections of each curve the coordinate w 0 v 0 on the curve corresponding to the intersection of the tangents defined the pullout capacity v 0 and the corresponding displacement w 0 to minimise overestimation of pullout capacities the analysis was limited to bucket displacements within 0 2d the estimated pullout capacities occurred at displacements within 0 03 0 1d this displacement range is comparable to the range of 0 05 0 1d reported as being sufficient to generate maximum capacities kelly et al 2004 therefore the pullout capacities obtained in this study were appropriate table 4 shows a summary of the pullout capacities and suction forces at various loading rates fig 10 shows the variation of pullout capacity with l d ratio and loading rate the pullout capacity increased almost linearly with the l d ratio at the slowest loading rate and this was somewhat nonlinear at high loading rate more than 2 1 n s however the average trend line shows that a linear relationship is acceptable fig 10 the measured pullout capacities fell between the bottom and top boundary lines for the drained v d and undrained v u conditions respectively the bottom boundary line v d matched pullout capacity data at the slowest loading rate of 0 002 n s whilst the top boundary line matched the extrapolated data for v u shown in fig 11 the shaded area represents cases of partially drained conditions with pullout capacities higher than v d but lower than v u the data points at 4 1 n s are close to the v u line exhibiting nearly undrained conditions the pullout capacity increased approximately linearly with the l d ratio as previously discussed the functions describing linear trends were applied to estimate pullout capacities of buckets for intermediate l d ratio increments of 50 l d 0 75 1 125 and 2 25 when the l d ratio increased from 0 5 to 0 75 and further to 1 125 the average percentage increases in the pullout capacities were 35 and 38 respectively when the l d ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 5 and further to 2 25 the average percentage increases in the pullout capacities were 40 and 44 respectively for a 50 successive increase in the l d ratio the average percentage increase in pullout capacities was 39 25 say 40 the above finding is significant considering l d ratios in the range of 0 5 2 25 moreover suction buckets with l d ratios between 0 5 and 1 0 have been found applicable in the offshore wind industry due to their ease of installation achmus and thicken 2014 in the drained condition the pullout capacity increased with the increase in l d ratio because increasing the embedment length increased the contact area between the soil and the skirt therefore the resistance to pullout increased due to the increase in total skin resistance the effect of change in l d on the pullout capacity was larger in the undrained condition compared to the drained condition this is evidenced by the change of slope for v u fig 10 the suction generated inside the bucket increased with the l d ratio and was sufficient to uplift the entire trapped soil plug a longer bucket skirt implies an increase in bucket volume the larger the volume of soil trapped the larger the weight of soil to be uplifted which results in increased pullout capacities in the drained condition the change in l d ratio only affects the skin resistance but in the undrained condition it affects both the skin resistance and suction fig 11 shows the trends of pullout capacity at increasing l d ratio and loading rate between 0 002 n s and 4 1 n s the pullout capacity increased nonlinearly with the loading rate beyond 4 1 n s the pullout capacity increased uniformly with the loading rate but at a substantially low rate before finally converging to constant values to clarify the trend of pullout capacity at large loading rates an additional test was performed which increased the loading rate up to 7 4 n s the bucket took less than 3 s to pullout a skirt length of 30 mm the pullout rate induced by 7 4 n s was higher than that induced by 4 1 n s 30 mm pullout displacement in 10 s the percentage differences between measured values of pullout capacity lid and tip suction at 4 1 n s and 7 4 n s were considerably small less than 3 the loading rate of 4 1 n s would satisfy the undrained condition the lid and tip suctions were determined as follows firstly the pullout capacity v 0 and the corresponding displacement w 0 were determined by applying the tangent intersection method as discussed above then w 0 was applied to the suction pressure displacement curves to determine lid and tip suctions corresponding to v 0 finally the estimated suction pressures were multiplied by the cross sectional area of the bucket to obtain lid and tip suction forces shown in table 4 fig 12 shows the variation of suction force under the lid f s0 lid with loading rate the trend for the increase of f s0 lid with the loading rate was similar to that for pullout capacity f s0 lid increased nonlinearly with the loading rate until a certain critical value of loading rate was reached beyond the critical value no considerable increase in the suction force was observed despite the increasing loading rate the lid suction was not evenly distributed inside the bucket but it decreased with the increase of depth to the bucket tip fig 13 shows the variation of tip suction f s0 tip with loading rate at various embedment depths f s0 tip increased nonlinearly with the l d ratio and loading rate table 5 summarises data for the proportions of lid suction to pullout capacity f s0 lid v 0 and ratios of tip suction to lid suction f s0 tip f s0 lid the data in table 5 is presented in fig 14 which shows the variation of f s0 lid v 0 fig 14a and f s0 tip f s0 lid fig 14b with loading rate at various l d ratios at loading rates larger than 1 0 n s the lid suction contributed over 70 of the pullout capacity in the nearly undrained conditions the ratios of tip to lid suctions were 0 54 0 45 and 0 46 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the f s0 tip f s0 lid ratio increased with the loading rate the tip suction was close to 50 of the lid suction in the nearly undrained condition the bottom resistance below the tip of the bucket is expected to increase with the increase of tip suction however due to seepage flow outside and underneath the bucket a tension crack develops below the bucket which limits the bottom resistance to uplift 3 2 1 drained and undrained pullout capacities the drained pullout out capacities v d were obtained by applying the slowest loading rate of 0 002 n s and setting the drainage air holes open as previously shown in fig 5 the pullout load accumulated for some time without the bucket undergoing any displacement a critical value v d of pullout load was reached beyond which the empty bucket pulled out smoothly at a constant pullout load when the pullout load exceeded the skin resistance the bucket rapidly pulled out and large displacements were observed the drained pullout capacities v d were estimated as 12 45 20 25 and 31 98 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the initial resistance of the bucket to uplift despite the accumulating pullout load is attributed to the skin resistance along the inner and outer faces of the bucket skirt theoretically the drained pullout capacity is equal to the summation of skin resistances along the inner r s inner and outer r s outer faces of the bucket skirt and the submerged weight of the bucket w b as shown by eq 1 das 1986 byrne 2000 1 v d r s outer r s inner w b 2 w h e r e r s o u t e r r s i n n e r γ l 2 k t a n δ π d l the total skin resistances r s were obtained by substituting values of w b and v d in eq 1 w b 4 91 5 0 and 5 1 n for l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively on average say w b 5 0 n the values of r s were estimated as 7 45 15 25 and 26 98 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively r s was used to compute r s o u t e r and r s i n n e r and the results were substituted in eq 2 to obtain the skin friction coefficient β ktanδ the ktanδ values were estimated as 0 38 0 20 and 0 15 for l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively table 6 β decreased non linearly with the increase in bucket embedment depth fig 15 this observed trend for β is supported by findings from previous studies fellenius 2014 rollins et al 2005 although the effects of ktanδ are not easy to separate houlsby and byrne 2005 k is known to be a function of k 0 the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest k k 0 is predicted to vary between 0 67 and 1 0 rollins et al 2005 k 0 σ h σ v where σ h and σ v are the insitu lateral and vertical effective stresses respectively as σ v increases with soil depth k 0 decreases which results in smaller values for k kulhawy 1984 the changes in σ h are substantially small because buckets comprise of thin skirts that minimise disturbance of soils surrounding the bucket the decrease of k as embedment depth increases contributes greatly to the decrease of β as the l d ratio increases eq 3 was proposed to predict β in buckets with various l d ratios the β values of this study were comparable with those predicted for an equivalent prototype bucket in medium dense sand the data points for medium dense sand were obtained by applying finite element analysis procedures discussed in the study of vicent et al 2020b medium dense sand was chosen for comparison because it has a higher relative density compared to the loose model ground this ensures that the peak friction angle in the model corresponds to that in full scale prototypes leblanc et al 2010 kelly et al 2006 vicent et al 2019 found that the stress state positions of loose used for the study and medium dense sands lie equi distant from the steady state line thus exhibiting a similar behaviour this finding is supported by altaee and fellenius 1994 who demonstrated that a loose model ground can behave similarly to the prototype ground if the stress states of the model and prototype grounds have equal proximity upsilon parameter to the steady state line 3 β 0 20704 l d 0 855 where β ktanδ l and d are the embedment length and diameter of the bucket respectively the effects of change in relative density of soil on β can be addressed by applying eq 4 proposed by vicent et al 2020b eq 4 generally predicts the average values of β and might not reflect the effects of the increase in l d ratio 4 β a v 0 0493 e 2 6525 t a n where is the angle of friction for the soil applying eq 4 to experimental data results β 0 23 in loose sand β ranges between 0 2 and 0 4 cfem 2006 the experimental values of β are comparable to β av eq 4 and fall in the range specified by cfem 2006 the undrained pullout capacity v u is characterised by uplift of the full soil plug as previously discussed nearly undrained conditions prevailed at a loading rate of 4 1 n s and more than 95 of the soil plug uplifted with the bucket therefore to obtain a proper estimate for the undrained pullout capacity a curve defined by a hyperbolic function was fitted into experimental data points fig 11 the fitted curve matched well with the experimental data the curve was extrapolated to obtain the ultimate values for pullout capacities the ultimate values defined the undrained pullout capacities v u and estimated as 40 81 75 94 and 98 48 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively following a similar approach the suction force f su under the lid corresponding to undrained pullout capacities was estimated as 28 23 50 73 and 71 47 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively fig 12 the suction force under the bucket lid converged to constant values in the undrained conditions and contributed approximately 69 67 and 73 of the pullout capacity at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively as shown in table 7 the pullout capacity under the undrained condition can be predicted by applying eq 5 vicent et al 2020a 5 v u w b w s o i l r s o u t e r f t e n s i l e f s e e p a g e where w b and w s o i l are the submerged weights for the bucket and soil respectively r s outer is the outer skirt resistance f tensile is the transient tensile capacity below the bucket tip and f seepage is the increase in external skin resistance due to downward seepage eq 5 considers the equilibrium of forces acting on the submerged bucket vicent et al 2020a the undrained pullout capacity parameters of eq 5 are shown in table 8 the undrained pullout capacities at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were estimated as 43 86 77 03 and 103 82 n respectively the submerged weights for the buckets w b were 4 91 5 0 and 5 10 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the difference between w b values was small because the polycarbonate material is light the submerged weight of the soil was calculated considering uplift of the full soil plug the outer skin resistance was estimated by applying eq 2 f tensile is equal to the difference between the suction force under the lid and the submerged weight of the soil f seepage was predicted using eq 6 and estimated as 6 91 13 67 and 13 76 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively 6 f s e e p a g e 1 2 i γ w l k t a n δ π d l where i is the hydraulic gradient due to downward seepage and other parameters are as previously described the hydraulic gradient i was estimated from pore pressure measurements at the tip of the outer bucket skirt the predicted i values were 1 42 1 33 and 0 8 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively eq 5 may not be easily applied in the field because f tensile and f seepage are difficult to determine to address this problem vicent et al 2020a proposed a simplified approach eq 7 to evaluate the pullout capacity however eq 7 was developed on the basis of data from 1 g experimental tests on an aluminium model bucket with l d 1 0 d 150 mm the current study further investigated whether the simplified approach is applicable to buckets with l d ratios larger or smaller than 1 0 7 v u w b w soil r s where w b and w soil are the bucket and soil weights respectively and r s r s outer f seepage assuming that f seepage is equal to r s inner eq 7 predicted the undrained pullout capacity as 36 4 67 01 and 101 47 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the v u predicted by eqs 5 and 7 were compared with extrapolated v u test from fig 11 as shown in table 8 the percentage differences between v u test and v u eq 5 were 7 2 1 42 and 5 18 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the percentage differences between v u test and v u eq 7 were 11 42 12 49 and 2 99 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the percentage differences between v u test and v u predicted using eqs 5 and 7 were substantially small although predictions by eq 5 showed smaller errors compared with predictions by eq 7 this is because the parameters for eq 5 were derived from experimental results the proposed equation is very simple and gives reasonable predictions for the pullout capacity a previous research proposed that the pullout capacity can be predicted by applying eq 8 as follows houlsby et al 2005 8 v o f s 0 l i d 1 2 l d k t a n δ where f s 0 l i d is the suction force under the lid at pullout capacity v 0 and other parameters are as previously described eq 8 is applicable to buckets with thin skirts and requires measurement of suction pressure generated inside the bucket during pullout the measured suction force f s u l i d from fig 12 and the calculated ktanδ table 6 were substituted in eq 8 the undrained pullout capacities v u were predicted as 38 96 71 02 and 103 63 n at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively v u test was comparable to v u eq 8 as this is shown by the small percentage differences less than 10 the percentage differences between v u test and v u eq 8 were 4 63 6 70 and 5 10 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the predictions by the simplified approach eq 7 were comparable to v u eq 8 the percentage differences between v u eq 7 and v u eq 8 were 6 79 5 81 and 2 11 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively fig 16 presents a comparison between v u predicted by the simplified approach with that predicted by other models discussed above a good agreement exists between predictions by the simplified approach and other models therefore the simplified approach whose parameters are easy to determine can be applied to predict the undrained pullout capacity of buckets with various l d ratios the v u predicted by the simplified approach was divided by v d drained capacity to estimate the v u v d ratio shown in table 9 the v u v d ratio is equal to 2 92 3 31 and 3 17 at l d 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively approximating to an average value of 3 13 v u v d 3 13 is approximately equal to v u v d 3 that was predicted for buckets in sand iskander et al 2002 and is 15 larger than v u v d 2 7 that was predicted in cohesive soil patel and singh 2019 the equations proposed by this study were applied to predict the drained and undrained pullout capacities of previous studies tables 10 and 11 show the comparison of the findings and the parameters are as previously described the pullout capacities predicted by this study were comparable to those predicted by previous studies of allersma et al 2000 cho and bang 2002 hung et al 2017 iskander et al 2002 and kulczykowski et al 2020 cho and bang 2002 analysed the pullout capacities of a series of suction piles l d 0 5 5 0 d 3 05 m in sand and clay in sand the suction pile uplifted without the soil plug when l d 3 42 in clay ground drained pullout occurred in suction piles with l d 0 8 allersma et al 2000 investigated the pullout capacity of model suction piles l d 1 167 d 600 mm in sand the tests were conducted at single 1 g and multiple gravity 150 g the two test conditions showed approximately equal peak loads which defined the drained pullout capacity iskander et al 2002 performed tests on a small scale caisson l d 2 0 d 100 mm in sand the drained pullout capacity was reached at a small displacement of 0 043d whereas the undrained pullout capacity occurred at a bucket displacement of 0 2d the pullout resistance in caissons installed using suction was 25 lower than that of caissons installed by pushing hung et al 2017 investigated the pullout capacity of buckets l d 0 5 and 1 0 in sand the findings were applied to study the effects of vertical cyclic loading on model buckets kulczykowski et al 2020 conducted 1 g experimental tests on a model bucket with l d 1 0 test results showed that the displacement rate significantly affected pullout resistance and lid suction but had little effect on the stress displacement relationship the drained pullout capacities were evaluated by applying eq 1 the coefficient for skin friction β applied to calculate r s was obtained by using eqs 3 and 4 the current study has various limitations the bucket models applied in this study are smaller compared to full scale bucket foundations therefore cavitation is absent because suction pressure generated beneath the model bucket is considerably smaller than the cavitation limit of 100 kpa thicken et al 2014 meanwhile cavitation may occur in full scale bucket foundations which limits the increase in suction pressure and pullout capacity furthermore full scale bucket foundations are predominantly loaded with cyclic loads of wind and waves the cyclic response is affected by several factors such as the magnitude of peak cyclic load number of applied load cycles frequency and inclination of the load el gharbawy and olson 1999 which are not addressed by the current study therefore the simplified approach may be applicable during preliminary design considering the above limitations 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of embedment depth on the pullout capacity of bucket foundations in sand 1 g model tests were conducted on polycarbonate model buckets with varying embedment ratios and loading rates the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the tripod bucket foundation system is a suitable foundation for supporting offshore wind turbine structures at intermediate water depth the stability of the entire tripod bucket system is considerably affected by the pullout loads uplifting the windward bucket the pullout of a single bucket is critical in the design of a stable tripod bucket system 2 the bucket pullout load is influenced by the change in drainage conditions of the soil inside and outside the bucket the change in drainage conditions can be due to changes in the loading rate and embedment ratio drained conditions occurred at substantially slow loading rates whilst undrained conditions occurred at considerably fast loading rates a partially drained loading condition was induced by intermediate loading rates 3 the suction force generated under drained conditions was substantially small and negligible when the loading rate was increased the suction pressure inside the bucket increased proportionally to the pullout load in the undrained conditions the suction force inside the bucket was substantially large and contributed the largest portion of the pullout capacity 4 the pullout capacity of the bucket increased approximately linearly with the bucket embedment ratio a 50 increase in embedment depth resulted in an average increase in pullout capacity of 40 under drained conditions the increase in bucket skirt length increased the bucket soil contact area which increased the skirt resistance to bucket uplift in the partially drained and undrained conditions the volume and weight of the entrapped soil increased with the bucket embedment ratio the increase of bucket embedment depth increased the seepage flow path thereby decreasing the seepage flow inside the bucket this minimised the loss of the generated suction thus increasing the pullout capacity 5 the drained pullout capacity was estimated by summing up the skin resistance along the inner and outer faces of the bucket skirt and the submerged weight of the bucket equations have been proposed to predict the skin friction coefficient β which can be applied to evaluate the skin resistance at various l d ratios the undrained pullout capacity was predicted by applying the proposed simplified approach which suggests that v u equals to the summation of the bucket weight soil weight and total skin resistance the approach reasonably predicted the undrained pullout capacities the pullout capacities predicted by the proposed approach were comparable to those predicted by previous models the simplified approach is easy to apply because it constitutes parameters whose values are easy to estimate and can be applied to buckets with various embedment ratios 6 the undrained pullout capacities predicted by the simplified approach were approximately three times larger than the drained pullout capacity credit authorship contribution statement vicent ssenyondo conceptualization investigation data curation writing original draft formal analysis
