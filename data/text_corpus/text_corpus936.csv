4680,semi infinite unconfined fractured strip shaped aquifer systems are common in alluvial plain margins but have received little attention in the hydrogeological community thus the aim of this study is to present semi analytical solutions of flow to a well in these aquifer systems two conceptual models are considered 1 an unconfined aquifer with a lateral fractured aquifer and a pumping well installed in the unconfined aquifer model i 2 an unconfined aquifer with a lateral fractured aquifer and a pumping well installed in the fractured aquifer model ii a transition zone is considered between two aquifers three dimensional groundwater flows are considered in unconfined fractured and transition zone aquifers homogeneous anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and instantaneous drainage water table condition are assumed first but can be relaxed to accommodate delayed drainage water table condition if needed the point sink source solutions are obtained via finite and infinite fourier transforms for space and laplace transform for time the line sink source solutions are obtained via integration along the desired direction the uniform flux and uniform head boundary conditions are considered for the pumping well the vertical distribution of the flux toward the well screen is explored the effects of inner well condition on the variation of the dimensionless drawdown and boundary depletion volume are investigated we investigate the influences of the hydraulic parameters of the transition zone on the spatial and temporal variations of the sensitivity of the drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system furthermore the influences of the transition zone on the spatial distribution of the drawdown are explored the results of this study can be utilized to evaluate head distribution in the aquifer system to calculate the water budget of the alluvial aquifers near a fractured one to analyze the influences of a transition zone on the head and flow

introduction pumping test data are commonly used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of aquifers using analytical models the infinite extent aquifers are commonly assumed in these models theis 1935 neuman 1974 moench 1996 zhan et al 2001 malama 2011 sedghi et al 2018 this assumption may not be valid in some hydrogeological systems in fact an unconfined aquifer is sometimes bounded by a fractured anticline aquifer from one side to form a patchy strip shaped semi infinite aquifer system a pumping well may be installed in the fractured anticline or the unconfined aquifer for instance in damghan meshed kerman and bafgh iran cretaceous and jurassic limestone aquifers are hydraulically connected to their adjacent alluvial aquifers issar 1969 in zagros mountains south western of iran synclines are filled with alluvial deposits to form unconfined aquifers these aquifers are often hydraulically separated from the underlying limestone aquifer by marl and clay formations the alluvial aquifers however are hydraulically connected to the fractured aquifers at their lateral boundaries and recharged from them with fresh water issar 1969 raeisi 2008 for instance the burazjan southwestern of iran alluvial aquifer is hydraulically connected to its adjacent fractured limestone layers of gisakan anticline mohammadi et al 2014 there is a fault zone between the burazjan aquifer and limestone layers of the gisakan anticline this fault zone significantly affects the water budget of the aquifer system mohammadi et al 2014 and does not impede groundwater flow kompani zare and moore 2001 the fault zones at the margins of alluvial plains are common in thick tectonic valleys aquifer systems blair 1987 sedghi and zhan 2018 and may lead to aquifer hydraulic zonation parallel to the alluvial plain margins fault zones usually fall into four categories from the hydrogeological framework namely localized conduits distributed conduits localized barriers and combined conduit barriers caine et al 1996 the distributed conduit can be simulated utilizing the equivalent porous medium conceptual model caine et al 1996 the hydraulic conductivity of this type of fault zone is depending on the aperture and interconnection of fractures in the damaged zone rawling et al 2001 the equivalent porous medium conceptual model is applicable to a fault zone in which the fault core where the permeability is reduced due to cementation development of clay smears fault gouge and cataclasis among other factors is absent or poorly developed caine et al 1996 ikari et al 2009 bense et al 2013 this kind of fault zone has been reported in literature agosta et al 2010 brogi et al 2010 sinisi et al 2016 especially in shallow fault zones bense et al 2003 in addition to marginal fault zone characteristic of alluvial plain sediment changes from the high energy coarse grained deposition near the margin to low energy fine grained deposition inland the hydraulic parameters of alluvial plain are changed with the same fashion as in alluvial fans samani and sedghi 2015 this leads to the formation of a transition zone near the alluvial plain margins as reported in literature sjodin et al 2001 zhou and herath 2017 to treat this hydraulically the zonation method can be utilized hill and tiedeman 2006 overall conceptual models consisting of the fractured and unconfined aquifers with a transition zone in between simulating a distributed conduit fault zone or coarse grain marginal sediment have never been studied in an analytical manner and should be considered to simulate pumping tests in such a geological setting unconfined aquifers were subject of numerous studies over many decades neuman 1972 1974 1975 moench 1995 zhan and zlotnik 2002 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 malama et al 2007 2008 malama 2011 mishra et al 2012 in some of these studies instantaneous water table drainage was considered neuman 1972 1974 in some other studies delayed water table drainage was assumed moench 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 or the flow in unsaturated zone above the water table was considered mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 all above mentioned studies were developed for infinite extent aquifers unconfined aquifers however often are bounded by hydrogeologic boundaries analytical solutions as well as image well methods may be used to model these aquifer types to convergent constant head or no flow boundaries forming wedge shaped aquifers todd and mays 2005 the image well method or finite fourier transforms may be employed chan 1976 chan et al 1978 yeh and chang 2006 sedghi et al 2009 two parallel boundaries forming strip aquifers are subjects of some analytical solutions groundwater flow to a pumping well near an unconfined confined aquifer chan et al 1977 and hydraulic parameter variation interface elango and swaminathan 1980 samani and sedghi 2015 were considered in some other researches unconfined fractured aquifer systems are considered by sedghi and samani 2015 sedghi and zhan 2019 and sedghi et al 2018 these solutions are applicable where an infinite extent fractured aquifer underlies the unconfined aquifer and are not applicable for the case of the semi infinite width unconfined finite width fractured strip shaped aquifer systems with a transition zone in between yeh and chang 2013 presented a rather comprehensive review on the available analytical models of groundwater to a well up to date there is no analytical solution of flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer with a fractured aquifer in its lateral boundary the aim of this study is therefore obtaining such analytical solutions two conceptual models are considered a semi infinite unconfined aquifer with a fractured aquifer in its left hand side boundary and a pumping well installed in the unconfined aquifer model i the same aquifer setting with a pumping well installed in the fractured aquifer model ii in both models a transition zone simulating either a distributed conduit transition zone or coarse grain marginal deposits exists between two aquifers this zone can be assimilated into the fractured or unconfined aquifer by equating its hydraulic parameters to those of the fractured or unconfined aquifer respectively the uniform head as well as uniform flux boundary conditions for the pumping well are considered and the flux distribution along the well screen for the case of the uniform head well is presented in the presented conceptual models the fractured aquifer is bounded by a no flow boundary at the left we should point out that the chosen left boundary of the fractured aquifer in above models are simply for the purpose of demonstration if necessary other types of left hand side boundaries can also be accommodated following similar procedures of this study the results of this study are presented in the form of drawdown curves boundary depletion volume curves sensitivity curves and maps and drawdown distribution maps the presented solutions for examples can be used for the following tasks analyzing the hydraulic behavior of the presented conceptual models helping groundwater management calculating the aquifer water budget and designing the pumping test to name a few 2 conceptual model 2 1 problem statement a schematic representation of the aquifer system is presented in fig 1 two conceptual models are considered a fractured aquifer is on the left hand side of the alluvial aquifer a vertical transition zone between two aquifers is assumed between x 0 and x xi the cartesian system is considered for the aquifer system the origin of the coordinate system is at the intecept of the fractured aquifer and the vertical transition zone and the base of the fractured aquifer the y axis is at the intersection of the transition zone and the fractured aquifer and the bottom of the aquifer system the x axis is at the intersection of the plain normal to the y axis where the pumping well exists and the bottom of aquifer system the z axis is the intersection of the x axis and the y axis with the origin at the bottom of the aquifer and it is positive upward all aquifers are infinite extent in the y direction the fractured aquifer width in the x direction is xf the alluvial aquifer is semi infinite in the x direction all aquifers are unconfined and with the same constant thickness of d a no flow boundary is considered at the left hand side of the fractured aquifer signifying a water divide or impermeable rocks the pumping well with an infiniestimal radius and a constant rate discharge is installed in the unconfined aquifer in model i and in the fractured aquifer in model ii it should be noted that the model can be flipped through 180 which would reverse the sides but the derived solutions would be equally applicable the partial differential equation governing the drawdown in the fractured aquifer is 1 k xf 2 s f x 2 k yf 2 s f y 2 k zf 2 s f z 2 γ s sf s f t where k xf k yf and k zf are the hydraulic conductivities of the fractured aquifer along the x y and z directions respectively lt 1 s f is the drawdwon in the fractured aquifer l s sf is the specific storage of the fractured aquifer l 1 and γ is the inter porosity flux term between the fracture domain and the rock matrix defined as park and zhan 2003 2 γ 3 k m r m s m r r r m where k m is the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix block lt 1 and r m is the radius of the spherical matrix block l it should be noted that the sperical matrix block may better simulate the fractured aquifer behaviour moench 1984 the flow in the spherical matrix block is governed by the following partial diffferential equation deruyck et al 1982 3 k m r 2 r r 2 s m r s sm s m t where s sm is the specific storage of the matrix block l 1 and s

is 6 s f x y z t 0 0 the no flow boundary at the bottom of the fractured aquifer is 7 s f z z 0 0 the water table boundary condition in the fractured aquifer assuming the drawdown of the water table is relatively small compared to the saturated thickness of the aquifer is neuman 1974 8 k zf s f z z d s yf s f t z d 0 where s yf is the specific yield of the fractured aquifer and d is the thicknesss of the fractured aquifer l eq 8 is the so called instantaneous drainage water table condition which has been subsequently improved by either a delayed drainage water table condition moench 1995 1996 1997 zhan and zlotnik 2002 or a condition considering coupled unsaturated saturated flow process in laplace domain which will be utilized in the problem solving procedures in this study the delayed drainage water table condition which is expressed in a temporal convolution form can be handled straightforwardly on the basis of the instantaneous drainage water table condition nevertheless this study will concentrate on the use of instantaneous drainage water table condition as an example of illutration the solution associated with the delayed drainage water table condition can be developed straightforwardly following similar procedures as the instantaneous drainage water table condition for more details of treating the delayed drainage water table condition in laplace domain one can consult zhan and zlotnik 2002 the consideration of coupled unsaturated saturated flow process for dealing with unconfined aquifer flow is considerably more complex than either the instantaneous or delayed draiange water table condtion thus will not be discussed in this study the no flow boundary condition at the left of the fractured aquifer is 9 s f x x x f 0 where x f is the width of the fractured aquifer l the following far distance boundary along the y axis in the fractured aquifer is considered 10 s f x y z t 0 the following partial differential equation governs the

where the subscript d represents the dimensionless term defined in table 1 and overbar represents the term in laplace domain hereinafter the superscript is used for the dimensionless drawdown at locations with x d x 0 d and the supperscript is used for the dimensionless drawdown at locations with x d x 0 d in the unconfined aquifer the following equation is used to caculate ω fn ω in and ω un by replacing ω n by these terms and ζ by ζ f ζ i and ζ u respectively 45 ω n tan ω n p ζ to calculate b ω fn b ω in and b ω un the following equation is utilized by replacing ω n by ω fn ω in and ω un respectively 46 b ω n 2 sin 2 ω n ω n the reason to use dimensionless terms instead of the dimensional terms here is to reduce parameter interference by simplifying the system of concern to a smaller

worth noting that the uniform flux assumption has been used to derive above line sink source solution there are tremendous discussion on the treatments of a line sink source such as uniform flux uniform head and mixed type and one can consult the works of penmatcha and aziz 1998 samani et al 2006 blumenthal and zhan 2016 wang and zhan 2017a 2017b for more details the general consensus is that the uniform flux approximation is the simplest to use among different treatments and it works the best when the point of concern is not very close to the line sink source for instance zhan et al 2001 pointed out that when the nearest distance between the point of concern to the wellbore is more than 10 times of the well diameter the difference between the uniform flux and uniform head treatments is less than 5 the mixed type is somewhat between the uniform flux and uniform head treatments and is much more difficult to deal with from an analytical point of view it is also notable that above three treatments do not acknowledge the head loss for water flow inside the line sink source such as flow inside a horizontal well for line sink sources that are considerably longer than the aquifer thickness more than a few hundreds of meters long the head loss for water flow inside the wellbore and for change of flow direction from perpendicular to the wellbore surface outside the wellbore to parallel with the wellbore axis inside the wellbore could be significant for such a scenario one probably has to use a coupled wellbore aquifer flow model wang and zhan 2017a b which will not be discussed in this study in the following the uniform flux solution is presented at first 2 3 1 uniform flux vertical well the solutions of a vertical partially penetrating well for the model i are 62

evaluation of the solution the laplace fourier domain solutions obtained in this work are used to calculate time domain dimensionless drawdown using the de hoog et al 1982 or stehfest 1970 numerical laplace inversion algorithm and gaussian quadrature for numerical evaluation of integrals arising from fourier transforms it should be noted that the stehfest 1970 algorithm is used to calculate the time domain drawdown this algorithm is faster yet acceptable especially for general well functions it should be noted that 8 terms are sufficient for graphical representation of the solution when using the stehfest 1970 algorithm 3 2 verification with modflow the modflow model can not directly simulate the fractured double porosity aquifer that is considered in one zone of our conceptual models thus to compare the results of our models to modflow we eliminate the inter porosity flow term from our models i e γ 0 and compare the resultant 3 zone single porosity models with their numerical counterparts a partially penetrating well screened from the depth of 1 m to 9 m and flow rate of 10 4 m s 1 is considered the other parameters are set to the default parameters values given in table 2 the intensive discertization scheme suggested by barrash and dougherty 1997 is used to conceptualize our modflow model the basic idea of such an discertization scheme is setting the dimension of the cell with the pumping well to wells radius and adjacent cells to about 0 0005 m the cell size increase away from the pumping well multiplying by 1 5 the results are illustrated in fig 2 good agreement between proposed model i and model ii black and red lines and the modflow model black and red markers are seen during the intermediate and late times during the early times however the discepency is noticeable but insignificant the early time discrepency between modflow and analytical models are also reported in previous works barrash and dougherty 1997 samani et al 2004 and is due to the discretization error 3 3 vertical distribution of flux for a uniform head well to explore the vertical distribution of flux to the pumping well for the uniform head case the screen is discretized to different segments two dimensionless time of 1 and 105 are considered the z 0 d 1 and z 0 d 2 are set to 0 1 and 0 9 other parameters are set to their default values that are given in table 2 the results are illustrated in fig 3 it is evident from the figure that the flux toward the well is higher at both ends of screen during the early and late times during the early times blue lines however the flux toward the well is higher near the water table this is due to the pore space drainage near the water table that results in higher inflow to the well to maintain the constant head condition in the well screen during the late time red lines when the gravity drainage decreases the inflow to the well is the same in both screen ends fig 3 also reveals that as the number of segments increases the calculated inflow becomes unstable near both ends of screen to rule out the influences of the gibbs phenomenon different fourier series terms are tested and it shows that 50 terms of fourier series are sufficient for graphical presentation of the discharge and drawdown distributions where the gibbs phenomenon refers to instability of the infinite series arising from the fourier transform near its boundaries or jumps e g pumping well gottlieb and shu 1997 in this work the well screen is discretized into 12 segments to increase the accuracy of the flux distribution to the well and avoid the instability of the solution where the instability of the solution by increasing the number of segments are reported in some previous works chang and chen 2003 wang and zhan 2017a 3 4 effects of distance from the aquifer interface the influences of the distance of the pumping well installed in the unconfined aquifer model i from the aquifer interface x 0 are investigated and the results are depicted in fig 4 the z 0 d 1 and z 0 d 2 are set to 0 1 and 0 9 and the dimensionless elevation of the piezometer zd is 0 6 uniform head markers and uniform flux lines well boundary condition are considered the dimensionless drawdowns are also compared with the neuman 1974 solution for the instantaneous drainage water table condition for the pumping well 500 m away from the two aquifer interface the uniform flux solution follows that of neuman 1974 showing that our solution is a generalization of the neuman 1974 solution comparing the drawdown produced by uniform head and uniform flux wells reveals that the drawdown of the uniform head well is less than that of uniform flux well during the early time this is due to less flux toward the well screen in its middle part where the piezometer is installed during the late time when the drawdown cone reaches the fractured aquifer the effect of the inner boundary condition of the pumping well is diminished as the alluvial aquifer can be recharged relatively quickly by the fractured aquifer which has a higher hydraulic conductivity considering conceptual model ii decreasing the distance from the aquifer interface slightly decreases the early time drawdown as the hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone is higher than that of the fractured aquifer fig 5 3 5 hydraulic behavior of the aquifer system in this section the scaled sensitivity of the drawdwon in the unconfined aquifer to the hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer is explored the influences of the parameters of the transition zone on the scaled sensitivity are tested the following equation is used to calculate the scaled sensitivity kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 80 s pi p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where s pi is the scaled sensitivity p i is the input parameter e g k xf or parameter ratio e g k xf k xu o is the output function of the system δ p i is the parameter or the parameter ratio increment that may be calculated as δ p i 10 3 p i to illustrate the scaled sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the conceptual model i to k xf k xu k yf k yu and s sm s sf fig 6 is constructed this figure shows that the absolute value of the scaled sensitivity to k xf k xu increases during the intermediate time when the cone of deperession reachs the fractured aquifer as the fractured aquifer extent along the x axis is limited the sensitivity of drawdown to k xf k xu is stablized during the late time butler and mcelwee 1990 the absolute scaled sensitivity to k yf k yu however keeps increasing the scaled sensitivity becomes more negative during the late time as the fractured aquifer extends to infinity along the y axis there is a slight increase in the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to s m s sf during the late time when the drawdown affects the fractured aquifer to stimulate the inter porosity flow the scaled sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the conceptual model ii to k xf k xu k yf k yu and s sm s sf is shown in fig 7 the sensitivity of drawdown to ratios of hydraulic parameters is almost similar to that of the conceptual model i in conceptual model ii the absolute sensitivity of the drawdown to s m s sf is more marked during the early and intermediate times at about dimensionless time of 1 0 than that in conceptual model i as the pumping well is installed in the fractured aquifer and the inter porosity flow comes into play earlier the late time increase of s m s sf is due to the release of water from the matrix blocks to the transition zone this water affects the late time drawdown the transition zone between the unconfined and fractured aquifer affects the scaled sensitivity of drawdown to ratios of hydraulic parameters to explore this figs 8 and 9 are constructed fig 8 illustrates the effects of the hydraulic parameters of the transition zone on the sensitivity of the drawdown in unconfined aquifer to k xf k xu as shown in this figure increasing k xi increases the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdwon to k xf k xu black lines as this parameter controls the hydraulic connection of the unconfined and fractured aquifers increasing k yi however decreases the absolute sensitivity of the drawdwon to k xf k xu red lines this is due to the fact that as hydraulic conductivity along the transition zone k yi increases this zone acts as a conduit and the drawdown in this zone significantly decreases thus the transition zone becomes a buffer zone that reduces the hydraulic connection of the unconfined and fractured aquifers increasing the specific storage or the specific yeild of the transition zone has almost the same effect figures are not shown to investigate the influences of the transition zone on the scaled sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdwon of the fractured aquifer to the ratios of k xf k xu fig 9 is constructed inspecting fig 9 reveals that increasing k xi and k yi increases the absolute sensitivity to k xf k xu during the intermediate time this is due to the fact that with a higher k xi and k yi more water is supplied to the fractured aquifer from the transition zone and the influences of k xf becomes significant during the late time however increasing k xi and k yi increases the contribution of the transition zone to the pumped water and this decreases the expansion of the cone of depression in the fractured aquifer leading to lower absolute sensitivity to k xf k xu during the late time furthermore the figure shows that during the late time decreasing k yi red line with triangle markers increases the absolute sensitivity comparing more than decreasing k xi black lines with triangle markers to sum up the horizontal anisotropy of the transition zone k xi k yi is proportional to the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the unconfined aquifer to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer conceptual model i from early to late times it is proportional to the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the fractured aquifer to its hydraulic parameters conceptual model ii during the late time the effects of the transition zone on the sensitivity of the drawdwon to other hydraluic parameters ratios are the same figures are not shown from a practical viewpoint when the transition zone simulates the fault zone with low horizontal anisotropy or the coarse grain sediments with high horizontal anisotropy the influences of the fractured aquifer on the drawdown in the unconfined aquifer decreases or increases from early to late times this occurs when the pumipng well is installed in the fractured aquifer and the drawdown is measured only during the late times we further explore the effects of the hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone along the x axis k xi by preparing the dimensionless drawdown difference map for the late time t d 10 6 this map prepared by differencing the dimensionless drawdwon map for k xi 0 01 from the same map for k xi 0 00001 the other parameters are set to the default values the drawdown difference map fig 10 shows that increasing k xi decreases the dimensionless drawdwon in the unconfined aquifer and increases the dimensionless drawdown in the fractured aquifer this is due to the drop in the hydraluic gradient in the transition zone along the x axis as k xi increases to test the effects of the hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone along the y axis fig 11 is prepared as fig 10 for k yi fig 11 illustrates that increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone k yi decreases the dimensionless drawdwon in the whole part of the aquifer system this is due to the fact that the transition zone with a high longitudal hydraulic conductivity k yi serves as a conduit i e distributed conduit fault zone and supplies the aquifer from the farfield groundwater this effect of fault zones to provide extra water to the aquifer has been previously discussed in some case studies e g mohammadi et al 2014 the influences of k xi on the temporal variation of the dimensionless drawdown are tested by preparing fig 12 the pumping well is installed in the unconfined aquifer model i at x 0 d 1 and y 0 d 0 the observation well is installed at x d 1 8 and y d 0 8 other parameters are set to default values given in table 2 the dimensionless drawdown curves are compared to the cases with constant head and no flow boundary instead of the transition zone obtained from the neuman 1974 solution and the method of the image wells the figure illustrates that increasing k xi decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdown as it facilitates the transfer of water from the fractured aquifer toward the unconfined one inspecting fig 12 also reveals that the sensitivity of the drawdwon to k xi decreases by increasing k xi curves of higher k xi are closer to each other it is due to the fact that as k xi increases the late time drawdown depends on the hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer not k xi a relatively small value of k xi however acts as a limiting factor to transfer of water from the fractured aquifer to the unconfined aquifer and significantly affects the drawdown we further investigate the effects of the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone k yi by preparing the dimensionless drawdown dimensionless time type curve for different k yi other parameters are the same as fig 12 the results are presented in fig 13 the figure shows that increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdown the late time dimensionless drawdown is not stabilized during the late time as in the case of constant head boundary blue line due to the expansion of the cone of depression in the fractured aquifer this figure shows that although increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone reduces the dimensionless drawdown this however does not completely mask the effects of the fractured aquifer on the drawdown during the late times this figure also shows that increasing k yi increases the sensitivity of the drawdown to k yi curves of lower k yi are closer to each other this is due to the fact that the transition zone with a higher k yi drains more water from the aquifer system toward the pumping well this magnifies the influences of the longitudinal hydraulic conductivity 3 6 boundary depletion volume in this section we discuss the effects of the pumping well configuration on the contribution of unconfined alluvial and fractured aquifers to the pumped water that is crucial in groundwater management model i is considered and the effects of vertical well partial penetration screen location and the distance of pumping well from the aquifer interface on the boundary depletion volume are tested the cumulative boundary depletion volume bdv dimensionless is calculated using eq 62 for the uniform flux pumping well following the same procedure as in sedghi and zhan 2020 as bdv 1 p x d 0 1 s fd d z d d y d x d 0 81 0 n 1 1 p 2 s i n ω un z

dimensional cumulative boundary depletion volume can be computede from the dimensionless bdv computed above using the variables defined in table 1 to explore the influences of the screen location on bdv fig 14 is prepared uniform flux lines and uniform head markers well boundary condition are compared the distances of x 0 10 m from the aquifer interface is considered as illustrated in the figure the bdv value for the uniform head well is less than that of the uniform flux well owing to the fact that inflow to the uniform head well is higher near the water table during the early times see section 3 2 thus the contribution of the water table drainage to the pumped water increases and this will reduce the contribution of the adjacent fractured aquifer to pumping this effect will eventually diminish over time for the same reason the shallow well screen z 0 d 1 6 and z 0 d 2 10 depletes less water volume from the adjacent fractured aquifer during the early time to test the effects the distance from the interface on the bdv fig 15 is constructed three distances from the interface 10 m 50 m and 80 m are considered fig 15 reveals that the effects of the screen depth on bdv is delayed but is not diminished as the distance from the interface of two aquifers increases fractured limestone aquifers are source of fresh water in some part of the world e g southwestern of iran therefore deep pumping wells deplete more fresh water from the adjacent fractured aquifer this may eventually affect the quality of the pumped well when the chemical constituents of groundwater in the unconfined alluvail aquifer and the adjacent unconfined fractured aquifer are different the same result is expected for the deep horizontal wells comparing to the shallow ones 3 7 aquifer parameter estimation one of the most important application of the presented solution is to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system utilizing the model i or model ii presented in this work one can estimate the hydraulic parameters of the adjacent fractured aquifer or unconfined aquifer using the drawdown data collected during a single pumping test performed in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined aquifer can be estimated using the early and intermediate time drawdown with the analytical models of the unconfined aquifer for instance the analytical models of neuman 1974 for the instantaneous drainage water table condition or moench 1997 for the delayed drainage water table condition the dimensionless drawdown curves of fig 4 can be utilized to specify the dimensionless time when the presented solution deviates from that of neuman 1974 in this section the late time sensitivity distribution map is presented to show the most sensitive parts of the aquifer system to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer considering the conceptual model i furthermore we prepare late time scaled sensitivity map of the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined aquifer for the pumping test that is performed in the fractured aquifer model ii these maps show the potential of the conceptual model ii to estimate hydraulic parameters of the adjacent unconfined aquifer the results of this section can be utilized to set up a cost effective pumping test fig 16 illustrates the spatial distribution of the scaled sensitivity of the drawdwon to k xf the sensitivity map sees its maximum absolute value near the pumping well in the unconfined aquifer the transition zone and the fractured aquifer this is due to the effects of k xf on the hydraulic connection of the unconfined and fractured aquifers the drawdown data of these parts of the aquifer system are the most valuable data to estimate k xf from the pumping test performed in the unconfined aquifer fig 17 is prepared as fig 16 considering k yf the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured aquifer along the y axis affects the flow of water in the fractured aquifer toward a point on its interface where the maximum water leaks toward the unconfined aquifer thus the sensitivity map sees its maximum absolute value near the pumping well in the fractured aquifer and the transition zone the observation well installed in these parts of the aquifer system collects drawdown data that are the most valuable to estimate k yf figs 18 and 19 show the spatial distribution of the scaled sensitivity of the drawdown to k xu and k yu for the pumping test performed in the fractured aquifer 20 m away from the interface of the transition zone as k xu controls the inflow from the unconfined aquifer to the transition zone and fractured aquifer the maximum scaled sensitivity to k xu is seen in the transition zone and fractured aquifer along the x axis passing through the pumping well fig 18 the maximum sensitivity to k yu is seen in the unconfined aquifer along the x axis passing through the pumping well fig 19 overall for the case that the pumping test is performed in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer the maximum sensitivity of the drawdown to k xf or k xu is seen in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer and the maximum sensitivity of the drawdown to k yf or k yu is seen in the fractured aquifer or unconfined aquifer 4 summary and conclusion in this work the semi analytical solutions of flow to a well in a strip shaped unconfined fractured aquifer system are obtained two conceptual models are considered a semi infinite unconfined aquifer with a fractured aquifer on its left hand side and a pumping well installed in the unconfined alluvial aquifer model i and the same aquifer setting with a pumping well installed in the fractured aquifer model ii in both conceptual models a transition zone is considered between the fractured and unconfined aquifers the uniform flux and uniform head boundary conditions in the pumping well are compared the following conclusions are reached from this work the early time flux to the uniform head pumping well is higher near the water table end of the screen due to the gravity drainage comparing to the deep end of the screen during the late time this difference is diminished the drawdown due to the uniform head well deviates from that of the uniform flux well during the early times this difference disappears during the late time when the lateral aquifer affects the drawdown deep pumping wells deplete more water from the adjacent fractured aquifer comparing to shallow ones and this may affect the quality of the pumped well when the chemical constituents of groundwater in these aquifers are different when pumping test is performed in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer the late time drawdown data collected from piezometers installing in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer near the transition zone are more sensitive to k xf or k xu the data collected from the fractured aquifer or unconfined aquifer near the transition zone are more sensitive to k yf or k yu and the data collected from the fractured quifer are more sensitive to s sm when the pumping well is installed in the unconfined aquifer model i increasing the horizontal anisotropy of the transition zone k xi k yi increases the absolute value of the sentitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer considering the conceptual model ii increasing the horizontal anisotropy of the transition zone k xi k yi increases the absolute value of the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer during the late times considering the conceptual model i increasing the hydraulic conductivity normal to the transition zone k xi increases the drawdown in the fractured aquifer as more water is depleted from it toward the unconfined aquifer increasing the hydraulic conductivity along the transition zone k yi however reduces the drawdown in the aquifer system as the transition zone serve as a conduit distributed conduit fault zone that transmits the far field groundwater toward the pumping well with a lower k xi the transition zone acts as a limiting factor to transfer of water from the fractured aquifer to the unconfined aquifer and significantly affects the drawdown increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone k yi decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdown the late time dimensionless drawdown is not stabilized during the late time as in the case of constant head boundary due to the expansion of the cone of depression in the fractured aquifer in fact high conductivity transition zone does not completely mask the effects of the fractured aquifer on the drawdown especially during the late times furthermore comparing models i and ii reveals that the following findings firstly the distance of the pumping well from the transition zone affects the late time drawdown in model i and early time drawdown in model ii secondly model ii is more sensitive to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer thirdly the influence of the ratio of k xi k yi on the sensitivity of the drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer is more marked in model i credit authorship contribution statement mohammad m sedghi conceptualization methodology software writing original draft hongbin zhan supervision writing original

4680,semi infinite unconfined fractured strip shaped aquifer systems are common in alluvial plain margins but have received little attention in the hydrogeological community thus the aim of this study is to present semi analytical solutions of flow to a well in these aquifer systems two conceptual models are considered 1 an unconfined aquifer with a lateral fractured aquifer and a pumping well installed in the unconfined aquifer model i 2 an unconfined aquifer with a lateral fractured aquifer and a pumping well installed in the fractured aquifer model ii a transition zone is considered between two aquifers three dimensional groundwater flows are considered in unconfined fractured and transition zone aquifers homogeneous anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and instantaneous drainage water table condition are assumed first but can be relaxed to accommodate delayed drainage water table condition if needed the point sink source solutions are obtained via finite and infinite fourier transforms for space and laplace transform for time the line sink source solutions are obtained via integration along the desired direction the uniform flux and uniform head boundary conditions are considered for the pumping well the vertical distribution of the flux toward the well screen is explored the effects of inner well condition on the variation of the dimensionless drawdown and boundary depletion volume are investigated we investigate the influences of the hydraulic parameters of the transition zone on the spatial and temporal variations of the sensitivity of the drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system furthermore the influences of the transition zone on the spatial distribution of the drawdown are explored the results of this study can be utilized to evaluate head distribution in the aquifer system to calculate the water budget of the alluvial aquifers near a fractured one to analyze the influences of a transition zone on the head and flow

introduction pumping test data are commonly used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of aquifers using analytical models the infinite extent aquifers are commonly assumed in these models theis 1935 neuman 1974 moench 1996 zhan et al 2001 malama 2011 sedghi et al 2018 this assumption may not be valid in some hydrogeological systems in fact an unconfined aquifer is sometimes bounded by a fractured anticline aquifer from one side to form a patchy strip shaped semi infinite aquifer system a pumping well may be installed in the fractured anticline or the unconfined aquifer for instance in damghan meshed kerman and bafgh iran cretaceous and jurassic limestone aquifers are hydraulically connected to their adjacent alluvial aquifers issar 1969 in zagros mountains south western of iran synclines are filled with alluvial deposits to form unconfined aquifers these aquifers are often hydraulically separated from the underlying limestone aquifer by marl and clay formations the alluvial aquifers however are hydraulically connected to the fractured aquifers at their lateral boundaries and recharged from them with fresh water issar 1969 raeisi 2008 for instance the burazjan southwestern of iran alluvial aquifer is hydraulically connected to its adjacent fractured limestone layers of gisakan anticline mohammadi et al 2014 there is a fault zone between the burazjan aquifer and limestone layers of the gisakan anticline this fault zone significantly affects the water budget of the aquifer system mohammadi et al 2014 and does not impede groundwater flow kompani zare and moore 2001 the fault zones at the margins of alluvial plains are common in thick tectonic valleys aquifer systems blair 1987 sedghi and zhan 2018 and may lead to aquifer hydraulic zonation parallel to the alluvial plain margins fault zones usually fall into four categories from the hydrogeological framework namely localized conduits distributed conduits localized barriers and combined conduit barriers caine et al 1996 the distributed conduit can be simulated utilizing the equivalent porous medium conceptual model caine et al 1996 the hydraulic conductivity of this type of fault zone is depending on the aperture and interconnection of fractures in the damaged zone rawling et al 2001 the equivalent porous medium conceptual model is applicable to a fault zone in which the fault core where the permeability is reduced due to cementation development of clay smears fault gouge and cataclasis among other factors is absent or poorly developed caine et al 1996 ikari et al 2009 bense et al 2013 this kind of fault zone has been reported in literature agosta et al 2010 brogi et al 2010 sinisi et al 2016 especially in shallow fault zones bense et al 2003 in addition to marginal fault zone characteristic of alluvial plain sediment changes from the high energy coarse grained deposition near the margin to low energy fine grained deposition inland the hydraulic parameters of alluvial plain are changed with the same fashion as in alluvial fans samani and sedghi 2015 this leads to the formation of a transition zone near the alluvial plain margins as reported in literature sjodin et al 2001 zhou and herath 2017 to treat this hydraulically the zonation method can be utilized hill and tiedeman 2006 overall conceptual models consisting of the fractured and unconfined aquifers with a transition zone in between simulating a distributed conduit fault zone or coarse grain marginal sediment have never been studied in an analytical manner and should be considered to simulate pumping tests in such a geological setting unconfined aquifers were subject of numerous studies over many decades neuman 1972 1974 1975 moench 1995 zhan and zlotnik 2002 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 malama et al 2007 2008 malama 2011 mishra et al 2012 in some of these studies instantaneous water table drainage was considered neuman 1972 1974 in some other studies delayed water table drainage was assumed moench 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 or the flow in unsaturated zone above the water table was considered mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 all above mentioned studies were developed for infinite extent aquifers unconfined aquifers however often are bounded by hydrogeologic boundaries analytical solutions as well as image well methods may be used to model these aquifer types to convergent constant head or no flow boundaries forming wedge shaped aquifers todd and mays 2005 the image well method or finite fourier transforms may be employed chan 1976 chan et al 1978 yeh and chang 2006 sedghi et al 2009 two parallel boundaries forming strip aquifers are subjects of some analytical solutions groundwater flow to a pumping well near an unconfined confined aquifer chan et al 1977 and hydraulic parameter variation interface elango and swaminathan 1980 samani and sedghi 2015 were considered in some other researches unconfined fractured aquifer systems are considered by sedghi and samani 2015 sedghi and zhan 2019 and sedghi et al 2018 these solutions are applicable where an infinite extent fractured aquifer underlies the unconfined aquifer and are not applicable for the case of the semi infinite width unconfined finite width fractured strip shaped aquifer systems with a transition zone in between yeh and chang 2013 presented a rather comprehensive review on the available analytical models of groundwater to a well up to date there is no analytical solution of flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer with a fractured aquifer in its lateral boundary the aim of this study is therefore obtaining such analytical solutions two conceptual models are considered a semi infinite unconfined aquifer with a fractured aquifer in its left hand side boundary and a pumping well installed in the unconfined aquifer model i the same aquifer setting with a pumping well installed in the fractured aquifer model ii in both models a transition zone simulating either a distributed conduit transition zone or coarse grain marginal deposits exists between two aquifers this zone can be assimilated into the fractured or unconfined aquifer by equating its hydraulic parameters to those of the fractured or unconfined aquifer respectively the uniform head as well as uniform flux boundary conditions for the pumping well are considered and the flux distribution along the well screen for the case of the uniform head well is presented in the presented conceptual models the fractured aquifer is bounded by a no flow boundary at the left we should point out that the chosen left boundary of the fractured aquifer in above models are simply for the purpose of demonstration if necessary other types of left hand side boundaries can also be accommodated following similar procedures of this study the results of this study are presented in the form of drawdown curves boundary depletion volume curves sensitivity curves and maps and drawdown distribution maps the presented solutions for examples can be used for the following tasks analyzing the hydraulic behavior of the presented conceptual models helping groundwater management calculating the aquifer water budget and designing the pumping test to name a few 2 conceptual model 2 1 problem statement a schematic representation of the aquifer system is presented in fig 1 two conceptual models are considered a fractured aquifer is on the left hand side of the alluvial aquifer a vertical transition zone between two aquifers is assumed between x 0 and x xi the cartesian system is considered for the aquifer system the origin of the coordinate system is at the intecept of the fractured aquifer and the vertical transition zone and the base of the fractured aquifer the y axis is at the intersection of the transition zone and the fractured aquifer and the bottom of the aquifer system the x axis is at the intersection of the plain normal to the y axis where the pumping well exists and the bottom of aquifer system the z axis is the intersection of the x axis and the y axis with the origin at the bottom of the aquifer and it is positive upward all aquifers are infinite extent in the y direction the fractured aquifer width in the x direction is xf the alluvial aquifer is semi infinite in the x direction all aquifers are unconfined and with the same constant thickness of d a no flow boundary is considered at the left hand side of the fractured aquifer signifying a water divide or impermeable rocks the pumping well with an infiniestimal radius and a constant rate discharge is installed in the unconfined aquifer in model i and in the fractured aquifer in model ii it should be noted that the model can be flipped through 180 which would reverse the sides but the derived solutions would be equally applicable the partial differential equation governing the drawdown in the fractured aquifer is 1 k xf 2 s f x 2 k yf 2 s f y 2 k zf 2 s f z 2 γ s sf s f t where k xf k yf and k zf are the hydraulic conductivities of the fractured aquifer along the x y and z directions respectively lt 1 s f is the drawdwon in the fractured aquifer l s sf is the specific storage of the fractured aquifer

block lt 1 and r m is the radius of the spherical matrix block l it should be noted that the sperical matrix block may better simulate the fractured aquifer behaviour moench 1984 the flow in the

is relatively small compared to the saturated thickness of the aquifer is neuman 1974 8 k zf s f z z d s yf s f t z d 0 where s yf is the specific yield of the fractured aquifer and d is the thicknesss of the fractured aquifer l eq 8 is the so called instantaneous drainage water table condition which has been subsequently improved by either a delayed drainage water table condition moench 1995 1996 1997 zhan and zlotnik 2002 or a condition considering coupled unsaturated saturated flow process in laplace domain which will be utilized in the problem solving procedures in this study the delayed drainage water table condition which is expressed in a temporal convolution form can be handled straightforwardly on the basis of the instantaneous drainage water table condition nevertheless this study will concentrate on the use of instantaneous drainage water table condition as an example of illutration the solution associated with the delayed drainage water table condition can be developed straightforwardly following similar procedures as the instantaneous drainage water table condition for more details of treating the delayed drainage water table condition in laplace domain one can consult zhan and zlotnik 2002 the consideration of coupled unsaturated saturated flow process for dealing with unconfined aquifer flow is considerably more complex than either the instantaneous or delayed draiange water table condtion thus will not be discussed in this study the no flow boundary condition at the left of the fractured aquifer is 9 s f x x x f 0 where x f is the width of the fractured aquifer l the following far distance boundary along the y axis in the fractured aquifer is considered 10 s f x y z t 0 the following partial differential equation governs the

worth noting that the uniform flux assumption has been used to derive above line sink source solution there are tremendous discussion on the treatments of a line sink source such as uniform flux uniform head and mixed type and one can consult the works of penmatcha and aziz 1998 samani et al 2006 blumenthal and zhan 2016 wang and zhan 2017a 2017b for more details the general consensus is that the uniform flux approximation is the simplest to use among different treatments and it works the best when the point of concern is not very close to the line sink source for instance zhan et al 2001 pointed out that when the nearest distance between the point of concern to the wellbore is more than 10 times of the well diameter the difference between the uniform flux and uniform head treatments is less than 5 the mixed type is somewhat between the uniform flux and uniform head treatments and is much more difficult to deal with from an analytical point of view it is also notable that above three treatments do not acknowledge the head loss for water flow inside the line sink source such as flow inside a horizontal well for line sink sources that are considerably longer than the aquifer thickness more than a few hundreds of meters long the head loss for water flow inside the wellbore and for change of flow direction from perpendicular to the wellbore surface outside the wellbore to parallel with the wellbore axis inside the wellbore could be significant for such a scenario one probably has to use a coupled wellbore aquifer flow model wang and zhan 2017a b which will not be

evaluation of the solution the laplace fourier domain solutions obtained in this work are used to calculate time domain dimensionless drawdown using the de hoog et al 1982 or stehfest 1970 numerical laplace inversion algorithm and gaussian quadrature for numerical evaluation of integrals arising from fourier transforms it should be noted that the stehfest 1970 algorithm is used to calculate the time domain drawdown this algorithm is faster yet acceptable especially for general well functions it should be noted that 8 terms are sufficient for graphical representation of the solution when using the stehfest 1970 algorithm 3 2 verification with modflow the modflow model can not directly simulate the fractured double porosity aquifer that is considered in one zone of our conceptual models thus to compare the results of our models to modflow we eliminate the inter porosity flow term from our models i e γ 0 and compare the resultant 3 zone single porosity models with their numerical counterparts a partially penetrating well screened from the depth of 1 m to 9 m and flow rate of 10 4 m s 1 is considered the other parameters are set to the default parameters values given in table 2 the intensive discertization scheme suggested by barrash and dougherty 1997 is used to conceptualize our modflow model the basic idea of such an discertization scheme is setting the dimension of the cell with the pumping well to wells radius and adjacent cells to about 0 0005 m the cell size increase away from the pumping well multiplying by 1 5 the results are illustrated in fig 2 good agreement between proposed model i and model ii black and red lines and the modflow model black and red markers are seen during the intermediate and late times during the early times however the discepency is noticeable but insignificant the early time discrepency between modflow and analytical models are also reported in previous works barrash and dougherty 1997 samani et al 2004 and is due to the discretization error 3 3 vertical distribution of flux for a uniform head well to explore the vertical distribution of flux to the pumping well for the uniform head case the screen is discretized to different segments two dimensionless time of 1 and 105 are considered the z 0 d 1 and z 0 d 2 are set to 0 1 and 0 9 other parameters are set to their default values that are given in table 2 the results are illustrated in fig 3 it is evident from the figure that the flux toward the well is higher at both ends of screen during the early and late times during the early times blue lines however the flux toward the well is higher near the water table this is due to the pore space drainage near the water table that results in higher inflow to the well to maintain the constant head condition in the well screen during the late time red lines when the gravity drainage decreases the inflow to the well is the same in both screen ends fig 3 also reveals that as the number of segments increases the calculated inflow becomes unstable near both ends of screen to rule out the influences of the gibbs phenomenon different fourier series terms are tested and it shows that 50 terms of fourier series are sufficient for graphical presentation of the discharge and drawdown distributions where the gibbs phenomenon refers to instability of the infinite series arising from the fourier transform near its boundaries or jumps e g pumping well gottlieb and shu 1997 in this work the well screen is discretized into 12 segments to increase the accuracy of the flux distribution to the well and avoid the instability of the solution where the instability of the solution by increasing the number of segments are reported in some previous works chang and chen 2003 wang and zhan 2017a 3 4 effects of distance from the aquifer interface the influences of the distance of the pumping well installed in the unconfined aquifer model i from the aquifer interface x 0 are investigated and the results are depicted in fig 4 the z 0 d 1 and z 0 d 2 are set to 0 1 and 0 9 and the dimensionless elevation of the piezometer zd is 0 6 uniform head markers and uniform flux lines well boundary condition are considered the dimensionless drawdowns are also compared with the neuman 1974 solution for the instantaneous drainage water table condition for the pumping well 500 m away from the two aquifer interface the uniform flux solution follows that of neuman 1974 showing that our solution is a generalization of the neuman 1974 solution comparing the drawdown produced by uniform head and uniform flux wells reveals that the drawdown of the uniform head well is less than that of uniform flux well during the early time this is due to less flux toward the well screen in its middle part where the piezometer is installed during the late time when the drawdown cone reaches the fractured aquifer the effect of the inner boundary condition of the pumping well is diminished as the alluvial aquifer can be recharged relatively quickly by the fractured aquifer which has a higher hydraulic conductivity considering conceptual model ii decreasing the distance from the aquifer interface slightly decreases the early time drawdown as the hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone is higher than that of the fractured aquifer fig 5 3 5 hydraulic behavior of the aquifer system in this section the scaled sensitivity of the drawdwon in the unconfined aquifer to the hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer is explored the influences of the parameters of the transition zone on the scaled sensitivity are tested the following equation is used to calculate the scaled sensitivity kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 80 s pi p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where s pi is the scaled sensitivity p i is the input parameter e g k xf or parameter ratio e g k xf k xu o is the output function of the system δ p i is the parameter or the parameter ratio increment that may be calculated as δ p i 10 3 p i to illustrate the scaled sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the conceptual model i to k xf k xu k yf k yu and s sm s sf fig 6 is constructed this figure shows that the absolute value of the scaled sensitivity to k xf k xu increases during the intermediate time when the cone of deperession reachs the fractured aquifer as the fractured aquifer extent along the x axis is limited the sensitivity of drawdown to k xf k xu is stablized during the late time butler and mcelwee 1990 the absolute scaled sensitivity to k yf k yu however keeps increasing the scaled sensitivity becomes more negative during the late time as the fractured aquifer extends to infinity along the y axis there is a slight increase in the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to s m s sf during the late time when the drawdown affects the fractured aquifer to stimulate the inter porosity flow the scaled sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the conceptual model ii to k xf k xu k yf k yu and s sm s sf is shown in fig 7 the sensitivity of drawdown to ratios of hydraulic parameters is almost similar to that of the conceptual model i in conceptual model ii the absolute sensitivity of the drawdown to s m s sf is more marked during the early and intermediate times at about dimensionless time of 1 0 than that in conceptual model i as the pumping well is installed in the fractured aquifer and the inter porosity flow comes into play earlier the late time increase of s m s sf is due to the release of water from the matrix blocks to the transition zone this water affects the late time drawdown the transition zone between the unconfined and fractured aquifer affects the scaled sensitivity of drawdown to ratios of hydraulic parameters to explore this figs 8 and 9 are constructed fig 8 illustrates the effects of the hydraulic parameters of the transition zone on the sensitivity of the drawdown in unconfined aquifer to k xf k xu as shown in this figure increasing k xi increases the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdwon to k xf k xu black lines as this parameter controls the hydraulic connection of the unconfined and fractured aquifers increasing k yi however decreases the absolute sensitivity of the drawdwon to k xf k xu red lines this is due to the fact that as hydraulic conductivity along the transition zone k yi increases this zone acts as a conduit and the drawdown in this zone significantly decreases thus the transition zone becomes a buffer zone that reduces the hydraulic connection of the unconfined and fractured aquifers increasing the specific storage or the specific yeild of the transition zone has almost the same effect figures are not shown to investigate the influences of the transition zone on the scaled sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdwon of the fractured aquifer to the ratios of k xf k xu fig 9 is constructed inspecting fig 9 reveals that increasing k xi and k yi increases the absolute sensitivity to k xf k xu during the intermediate time this is due to the fact that with a higher k xi and k yi more water is supplied to the fractured aquifer from the transition zone and the influences of k xf becomes significant during the late time however increasing k xi and k yi increases the contribution of the transition zone to the pumped water and this decreases the expansion of the cone of depression in the fractured aquifer leading to lower absolute sensitivity to k xf k xu during the late time furthermore the figure shows that during the late time decreasing k yi red line with triangle markers increases the absolute sensitivity comparing more than decreasing k xi black lines with triangle markers to sum up the horizontal anisotropy of the transition zone k xi k yi is proportional to the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the unconfined aquifer to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer conceptual model i from early to late times it is proportional to the absolute sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown of the fractured aquifer to its hydraulic parameters conceptual model ii during the late time the effects of the transition zone on the sensitivity of the drawdwon to other hydraluic parameters ratios are the same figures are not shown from a practical viewpoint when the transition zone simulates the fault zone with low horizontal anisotropy or the coarse grain sediments with high horizontal anisotropy the influences of the fractured aquifer on the drawdown in the unconfined aquifer decreases or increases from early to late times this occurs when the pumipng well is installed in the fractured aquifer and the drawdown is measured only during the late times we further explore the effects of the hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone along the x axis k xi by preparing the dimensionless drawdown difference map for the late time t d 10 6 this map prepared by differencing the dimensionless drawdwon map for k xi 0 01 from the same map for k xi 0 00001 the other parameters are set to the default values the drawdown difference map fig 10 shows that increasing k xi decreases the dimensionless drawdwon in the unconfined aquifer and increases the dimensionless drawdown in the fractured aquifer this is due to the drop in the hydraluic gradient in the transition zone along the x axis as k xi increases to test the effects of the hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone along the y axis fig 11 is prepared as fig 10 for k yi fig 11 illustrates that increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone k yi decreases the dimensionless drawdwon in the whole part of the aquifer system this is due to the fact that the transition zone with a high longitudal hydraulic conductivity k yi serves as a conduit i e distributed conduit fault zone and supplies the aquifer from the farfield groundwater this effect of fault zones to provide extra water to the aquifer has been previously discussed in some case studies e g mohammadi et al 2014 the influences of k xi on the temporal variation of the dimensionless drawdown are tested by preparing fig 12 the pumping well is installed in the unconfined aquifer model i at x 0 d 1 and y 0 d 0 the observation well is installed at x d 1 8 and y d 0 8 other parameters are set to default values given in table 2 the dimensionless drawdown curves are compared to the cases with constant head and no flow boundary instead of the transition zone obtained from the neuman 1974 solution and the method of the image wells the figure illustrates that increasing k xi decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdown as it facilitates the transfer of water from the fractured aquifer toward the unconfined one inspecting fig 12 also reveals that the sensitivity of the drawdwon to k xi decreases by increasing k xi curves of higher k xi are closer to each other it is due to the fact that as k xi increases the late time drawdown depends on the hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer not k xi a relatively small value of k xi however acts as a limiting factor to transfer of water from the fractured aquifer to the unconfined aquifer and significantly affects the drawdown we further investigate the effects of the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone k yi by preparing the dimensionless drawdown dimensionless time type curve for different k yi other parameters are the same as fig 12 the results are presented in fig 13 the figure shows that increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdown the late time dimensionless drawdown is not stabilized during the late time as in the case of constant head boundary blue line due to the expansion of the cone of depression in the fractured aquifer this figure shows that although increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone reduces the dimensionless drawdown this however does not completely mask the effects of the fractured aquifer on the drawdown during the late times this figure also shows that increasing k yi increases the sensitivity of the drawdown to k yi curves of lower k yi are closer to each other this is due to the fact that the transition zone with a higher k yi drains more water from the aquifer system toward the pumping well this magnifies the influences of the longitudinal hydraulic conductivity 3 6 boundary depletion volume in this section we discuss the effects of the pumping well configuration on the contribution of unconfined alluvial and fractured aquifers to the pumped water that is crucial in groundwater management model i is considered and the effects of vertical well partial penetration screen location and the distance of pumping well from the aquifer interface on the boundary depletion volume are tested the cumulative boundary depletion volume bdv dimensionless is calculated using eq 62 for the uniform flux pumping well following the same procedure as in sedghi and zhan 2020 as bdv 1 p x d 0 1 s fd d z d d y d x d 0 81 0 n 1 1 p 2 s i n ω un z

dimensional cumulative boundary depletion volume can be computede from the dimensionless bdv computed above using the variables defined in table 1 to explore the influences of the screen location on bdv fig 14 is prepared uniform flux lines and uniform head markers well boundary condition are compared the distances of x 0 10 m from the aquifer interface is considered as illustrated in the figure the bdv value for the uniform head well is less than that of the uniform flux well owing to the fact that inflow to the uniform head well is higher near the water table during the early times see section 3 2 thus the contribution of the water table drainage to the pumped water increases and this will reduce the contribution of the adjacent fractured aquifer to pumping this effect will eventually diminish over time for the same reason the shallow well screen z 0 d 1 6 and z 0 d 2 10 depletes less water volume from the adjacent fractured aquifer during the early time to test the effects the distance from the interface on the bdv fig 15 is constructed three distances from the interface 10 m 50 m and 80 m are considered fig 15 reveals that the effects of the screen depth on bdv is delayed but is not diminished as the distance from the interface of two aquifers increases fractured limestone aquifers are source of fresh water in some part of the world e g southwestern of iran therefore deep pumping wells deplete more fresh water from the adjacent fractured aquifer this may eventually affect the quality of the pumped well when the chemical constituents of groundwater in the unconfined alluvail aquifer and the adjacent unconfined fractured aquifer are different the same result is expected for the deep horizontal wells comparing to the shallow ones 3 7 aquifer parameter estimation one of the most important application of the presented solution is to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system utilizing the model i or model ii presented in this work one can estimate the hydraulic parameters of the adjacent fractured aquifer or unconfined aquifer using the drawdown data collected during a single pumping test performed in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined aquifer can be estimated using the early and intermediate time drawdown with the analytical models of the unconfined aquifer for instance the analytical models of neuman 1974 for the instantaneous drainage water table condition or moench 1997 for the delayed drainage water table condition the dimensionless drawdown curves of fig 4 can be utilized to specify the dimensionless time when the presented solution deviates from that of neuman 1974 in this section the late time sensitivity distribution map is presented to show the most sensitive parts of the aquifer system to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer considering the conceptual model i furthermore we prepare late time scaled sensitivity map of the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined aquifer for the pumping test that is performed in the fractured aquifer model ii these maps show the potential of the conceptual model ii to estimate hydraulic parameters of the adjacent unconfined aquifer the results of this section can be utilized to set up a cost effective pumping test fig 16 illustrates the spatial distribution of the scaled sensitivity of the drawdwon to k xf the sensitivity map sees its maximum absolute value near the pumping well in the unconfined aquifer the transition zone and the fractured aquifer this is due to the effects of k xf on the hydraulic connection of the unconfined and fractured aquifers the drawdown data of these parts of the aquifer system are the most valuable data to estimate k xf from the pumping test performed in the unconfined aquifer fig 17 is prepared as fig 16 considering k yf the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured aquifer along the y axis affects the flow of water in the fractured aquifer toward a point on its interface where the maximum water leaks toward the unconfined aquifer thus the sensitivity map sees its maximum absolute value near the pumping well in the fractured aquifer and the transition zone the observation well installed in these parts of the aquifer system collects drawdown data that are the most valuable to estimate k yf figs 18 and 19 show the spatial distribution of the scaled sensitivity of the drawdown to k xu and k yu for the pumping test performed in the fractured aquifer 20 m away from the interface of the transition zone as k xu controls the inflow from the unconfined aquifer to the transition zone and fractured aquifer the maximum scaled sensitivity to k xu is seen in the transition zone and fractured aquifer along the x axis passing through the pumping well fig 18 the maximum sensitivity to k yu is seen in the unconfined aquifer along the x axis passing through the pumping well fig 19 overall for the case that the pumping test is performed in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer the maximum sensitivity of the drawdown to k xf or k xu is seen in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer and the maximum sensitivity of the drawdown to k yf or k yu is seen in the fractured aquifer or unconfined aquifer 4 summary and conclusion in this work the semi analytical solutions of flow to a well in a strip shaped unconfined fractured aquifer system are obtained two conceptual models are considered a semi infinite unconfined aquifer with a fractured aquifer on its left hand side and a pumping well installed in the unconfined alluvial aquifer model i and the same aquifer setting with a pumping well installed in the fractured aquifer model ii in both conceptual models a transition zone is considered between the fractured and unconfined aquifers the uniform flux and uniform head boundary conditions in the pumping well are compared the following conclusions are reached from this work the early time flux to the uniform head pumping well is higher near the water table end of the screen due to the gravity drainage comparing to the deep end of the screen during the late time this difference is diminished the drawdown due to the uniform head well deviates from that of the uniform flux well during the early times this difference disappears during the late time when the lateral aquifer affects the drawdown deep pumping wells deplete more water from the adjacent fractured aquifer comparing to shallow ones and this may affect the quality of the pumped well when the chemical constituents of groundwater in these aquifers are different when pumping test is performed in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer the late time drawdown data collected from piezometers installing in the unconfined aquifer or fractured aquifer near the transition zone are more sensitive to k xf or k xu the data collected from the fractured aquifer or unconfined aquifer near the transition zone are more sensitive to k yf or k yu and the data collected from the fractured quifer are more sensitive to s sm when the pumping well is installed in the unconfined aquifer model i increasing the horizontal anisotropy of the transition zone k xi k yi increases the absolute value of the sentitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer considering the conceptual model ii increasing the horizontal anisotropy of the transition zone k xi k yi increases the absolute value of the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer during the late times considering the conceptual model i increasing the hydraulic conductivity normal to the transition zone k xi increases the drawdown in the fractured aquifer as more water is depleted from it toward the unconfined aquifer increasing the hydraulic conductivity along the transition zone k yi however reduces the drawdown in the aquifer system as the transition zone serve as a conduit distributed conduit fault zone that transmits the far field groundwater toward the pumping well with a lower k xi the transition zone acts as a limiting factor to transfer of water from the fractured aquifer to the unconfined aquifer and significantly affects the drawdown increasing the longitudal hydraulic conductivity of the transition zone k yi decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdown the late time dimensionless drawdown is not stabilized during the late time as in the case of constant head boundary due to the expansion of the cone of depression in the fractured aquifer in fact high conductivity transition zone does not completely mask the effects of the fractured aquifer on the drawdown especially during the late times furthermore comparing models i and ii reveals that the following findings firstly the distance of the pumping well from the transition zone affects the late time drawdown in model i and early time drawdown in model ii secondly model ii is more sensitive to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer thirdly the influence of the ratio of k xi k yi on the sensitivity of the drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer is more marked in model i credit authorship contribution statement mohammad m sedghi conceptualization methodology software writing original draft hongbin zhan supervision writing original

4681,intrusion of subsurface contaminants in vapor phase from groundwater into overlying buildings through cracks or other pathways poses potential risk to human health previous studies indicated that water table fluctuations may have significant impacts on vapor intrusion resulting in fluctuated concentrations of indoor volatile organic compounds vocs analytical solutions for vapor intrusion processes are flexible tools in predicting voc concentrations and assessing health risks of voc contaminated sites however an analytical solution considering the impacts of fluctuated water table is not available in this study an analytical model of the vapor intrusion with fluctuated water table was developed the voc transport in unsaturated zones was described by diffusion equation and the varying water table was treated as a moving boundary the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone induced by water table fluctuations were also considered and were described by a source term of the vapor diffusion the analytical solution was tested with its numerical solution the results indicate that the fluctuated water table affects the dynamics of vocs mainly in two ways changing the length of vapor migration path and delivering the residual vocs into the unsaturated zone the voc concentration at the outlet varies inversely with the water table fluctuation owing to the release processes of the residual vocs dominate the analytical solution matches well to the laboratory experiment data in an existing study and could be a simple tool for the risk assessment of vapor intrusion when

limited to steady or quasi steady vapor transport which are not capable of predicting fluctuated voc concentrations that are widely observed in the field folkes et al 2009 holton et al 2013 hosangadi et al 2017 strom et al 2019 usepa 2015a the voc concentration fluctuations can be ascribed to the diverse environmental forces such as transient air temperature wind ambient pressure and water table illangasekare et al 2014 usepa 2015b such temporal variations raise challenges in risk assessment of voc contaminated sites and could cause inapposite decision making for site management if one neglects the temporal variations of the voc concentration illangasekare et al 2014 the water table commonly fluctuates across different time scales liang and zhang 2013 2015 zhang and schilling 2004 which may be induced by rainfall events anthropogenic activities and streamflow water table fluctuations affect dissolution volatilization distribution and biodegradation of vocs in subsurface environments dobson et al 2007 kim and corapcioglu 2003 rezanezhad et al 2014 field and experimental observations indicate that water table fluctuations have significant impacts on vapor intrusion resulting in the dynamics of indoor voc concentrations usepa 2015a recently several studies have found that the water table fluctuation causes not only dynamics of voc concentrations but also increases in the magnitude of voc mass flux from soils guo et al 2019 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 picone et al 2012 qi et al 2020 thomson et al 1997 werner et al 2002 more specifically the dramatic rise of voc concentration was often observed following the fall of water table guo et al 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 johnson et al 2016 guo et al 2015 conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the effects of water table fluctuation on vapor intrusion the results indicated that the dynamics of water table caused dramatical fluctuations in emission fluxes of vocs especially for the cases of shallow water table and high permeability soils based on the experimental observations of guo et al 2015 guo et al 2019 qi et al 2020 proposed a one dimensional numerical model to simulate the non equilibrium transport of vocs in the soil with the fluctuated water table using hydrus 1d the results suggested that the soil texture the amplitude of water table fluctuation and the types of vocs all have significant impacts on the amplitude and magnitude of emission flux fluctuations moreover it should be noted that for the models of both guo et al 2015 and qi et al 2020 a time varying head is imposed on the lower boundary the water table locates on the position of the zero pressure head and it fluctuates with the time varying head boundary to our best knowledge an analytical model for vapor intrusion considering the water table fluctuation has not been reported in the previous literature therefore the goal of this study is to fill this knowledge gap by developing an analytical model of vapor intrusion to further investigate the impacts of the water table fluctuation in this study the vapor transport in the unsaturated zone from groundwater is described by the diffusion equation different from guo et al 2015 and qi et al 2020 the fluctuated water table is treated as a moving boundary and the mathematical model is solved analytically the residual contaminant in the unsaturated zone induced by the fluctuated water table is described by a source term of the vapor diffusion the proposed analytical model could be employed as a risk assessment tool of vapor intrusion this paper was organized as follows the mathematical model and its solution were first presented then the analytical solution was tested by comparing it with a numerical simulation built with comsol multiphysics the impacts of water table fluctuations and parameters were examined and the analytical solution was finally applied to the laboratory experiments 2 model and solution 2 1 mathematical model fig 1 illustrates the vapor intrusion pathway under the condition of the fluctuated water table the contaminant source is a groundwater voc plume that moves along with water table fluctuations dissolved vocs volatilize from groundwater with a constant vapor phase concentration of vocs c 0 in the air of soils and upward migrates in the unsaturated zone via gas diffusion after reaching the sub slab of the building z l voc will enter the building through cracks via gas advection induced by the indoor outdoor air pressure difference the elevation of water table h t changes with time for a range of 0 h t h m where h m is the maximum elevation of the water table in this study we focus on the transport behaviors of vocs and neglect the biodegradation of vocs the initial voc concentration in the unsaturated zone is assumed as zero on the basis of the previous studies johnson and ettinger 1991 ma et al 2020 yao et al 2013 the vapor phase diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism and the gas advection is commonly neglected for the vapor intrusion in the contaminated field therefore the transport of contaminant vapor in the unsaturated zone with the fluctuated water table can be described by the following governing equation 1a θ s w g c t d 2 c z 2 f z t h t z l t 0 where 1b θ s w g k oc f oc ρ b h θ w h θ g 1c d d g θ g 10 3 θ t 2 d w h θ w 10 3 θ t 2 the boundary and initial conditions are 2a c c 0 z h t 2b d c z q c 0 z l 2c c 0 t 0 where c is the vapor concentration in the unsaturated zone m l 3 d is the effective vapor diffusion coefficient in porous media l 2 t which is approximated by millington and quirk s equation 1c millington and quirk 1961 d g and d w are the diffusion coefficients in the air and water l 2 t respectively θ g and θ w are the air and water filled porosity l g a s w a t e r 3 l s o i l 3 respectively and θ t is the total porosity l p o r e s 3 l s o i l 3 k oc is the soil organic carbon water partition coefficient l 3 m f oc is the soil organic carbon content ρ b is the soil bulk density m s o i l l s o i l 3 h is henry s constant representing the water gas phase partitioning of the voc f z t is the mass per unit volume in unit time released from the volatilization of residual vocs in the unsaturated zone induced by the fluctuated water table m l 3 t which will be further explained later q is the gas entry velocity in the cracks of building l t moreover the diffusion coefficient of voc in the air is four or five orders of magnitude higher than that in the water therefore the gas phase diffusion of voc considerably dominates the voc transport in soils it should be noted that eq 2a represents a moving boundary the location of this boundary is determined by the water table in practice an arbitrary fluctuated water table can be approximately expressed by piecewise linear segments connecting points of water table measurements h i h t i at times t i fig 2 therefore the fluctuated water table can be approximated as 3a h t h i 1 α i t t i 1 t i 1 t t i i 1 2 3 t 0 0 where 3b α i h i h i 1 t i t i 1 in this study there is the following reason to consider the source term f z t in the vocs transport model as mentioned previously the higher voc concentration at the outlet is always observed when water table falls in the experiments of voc transport guo et al 2019 2015 mccarthy and johnson 1993 usepa 2012 werner et al 2002 this phenomenon can be ascribed to that the rising water table will carry some dissolved vocs into the unsaturated zone these dissolved vocs refer to residual vocs hereafter will be exposed to the unsaturated zone and will volatilize into the air after that the water table falls therefore these residual vocs will cause the voc concentration to increase when water table rises however the residual vocs will be submerged beneath the water table which blocks their release into the soil air causing the voc concentration to decrease in addition the volatilization rate of the residual vocs usually decreases with exposure time due to the reduction in the total mass of residual vocs it should be noted that the specific surface of water air interface in the unsaturated zone is larger than that in the saturated zone near the water table resulting in larger volatilization flux from the residual vocs this may cause the voc concentration in the unsaturated zone to be higher than that in the groundwater therefore to describe these processes the source term f z t is considered in the voc transport model which is controlled by both water table elevation and exposure time it can be written by the following formula 4 f z t ϑ z t g t where ϑ z t represents the impacts of the fluctuated water table and g t describes the time dependent decay of the source term for mathematical convenience we assume that the water table initially declines from the maximum elevation h m to the minimum elevation h 0 at time t 1 then the water table rises to the maximum elevation h m again at time t 2 the water table fluctuates repeatedly in this manner fig 3 in each time interval t 2 i 2 t t 2 i i 1 2 3 the source term f z t will appear in the region of h t z h m fig 3 therefore it can be written as the following formula 5 ϑ z t h z h t h z h m where h x is the heaviside step function which is defined as h x 0 x 0 1 x 0 as previously stated g t represents the rate of volatilization from the residual vocs for a given location of the unsaturated zone which will decrease over time we use the following exponential decay model to describe the decreasing source term 6 g t γ exp b t t p t i 1 t t i i 1 2 3 where γ is the volatilization rate of residual vocs m l 3 t b is the decay rate 1 t the subscript p in t p is defined as p 2 f l o o r i 1 2 f l o o r x is the floor function which is the round of x to the nearest integer that is less than or equal to x 2 2 analytical solution for convenience of mathematical treatment we defined the following dimensionless variables 7 z d z l c d c c 0 t d t d l 2 h d h l h id h i l q d ql d α id θ s w g α i l d f d fl 2 d c 0 b d θ s w g b l 2 d γ d θ s w g γ l 2 d c 0 substituting equation 7 into equation 1a yields 8 c d t d 2 c d z d 2 f d z d t d h d t d z d 1 t d 0 equation 8 is a diffusion equation with a moving boundary which is difficult to solve analytically to treat this problem the moving boundary can be transformed into a fixed boundary by introducing the following variable liang et al 2020 9 ξ d z d h d t d 0 ξ d 1 t d 0 this variable describes the effect of moving origin of z d coordinates and can be used as follows 10a c d z d c d ξ d ξ d z d c d t d t d z d c d ξ d 10b c d t d c d t d t d t d c d ξ d ξ d t d c d t d c d ξ d d h d d t d substituting equation 10 into equation 8 the boundary value problem becomes the advection dispersion equation with a time varying velocity as follows 11 c d t d 2 c d ξ d 2 v t d c d ξ d f d ξ d t d 0

elevation is much less than the depth of the water table i e h d t d 1 which results in 1 h d t d 1 therefore the boundary value problem 11 can be written as 13a c d t d 2 c d ξ d 2 v t d c d ξ d f d

equation 13a is an advection dispersion equation with a time varying velocity v t d which is not easy to solve analytically in this study we employ the recursive method that is proposed by liang et al 2020 to solve equation 13a the main idea of this method is to divide the modeling period into a series of sub time interval in which the velocity is constant based on the recursive method we mainly

is determined by the concentration at the end of the previous interval which requires the concentration for the first interval 0 t 1 d to be calculated firstly then the concentrations of the following time intervals can be obtained sequentially the analytical solution of eq 15 for any time interval can be obtained by green s function method the details of the derivation are presented in the

equation 9 into equation 16 2 3 comparison with numerical solution to test the validity of the analytical solution 16 we compared it with a numerical solution of equation 13 obtained by comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa a galerkin finite element software package more specifically the governing equation 13 was numerically solved by comosl using the partial differential equation solver the dimensionless parameter values are q d 5 γ d 200 b d 2 h md 0 2 and t id t id 1 1 to ensure sufficient accuracy of the numerical solution the element sizes of 0 001 and the time step of 0 01 were adopted fig 4 displays the changes of the voc concentration with times at two locations z d 0 5 and z d 0 75 fig 4a and with spatial coordinates of z d on two times t d 3 and t d 4 fig 4b with the fluctuated water table dashed curves in fig 4a the results indicate that the analytical solution 16 matches the numerical solution very well over the entire simulation period implying that the analytical solution appears to be sufficiently accurate to predict voc concentrations for the model of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of water table fluctuations in this study we are concerned with the dynamics of vocs caused by two factors 1 the change of length of voc transport pathway induced by the fluctuated water table wt and 2 the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone delivered by the fluctuated water table to gain insight into the impacts of these two factors we calculated the voc concentrations for three cases for case 1 steady wt the steady water table is considered h d 0 1 and the residual vocs induced by water table fluctuations is absent for case 2 fluctuated wt without source terms the water table fluctuates in the range of 0 h d 0 2 while the residual vocs are not considered as well γ d 0 for case 3 fluctuated wt with source terms the water table fluctuates in the range of 0 h d 0 2 and the residual vocs are considered γ d 200 the other parameters for the three cases are the same as those in fig 4 fig 5 illustrates the time varying changes of the voc concentration at z d 0 75 and the concentration profiles at t d 3 for the three cases the concentrations of the three cases increase in the early stages t d 0 5 owing to the impact of the zero initial concentration fig 5a for case 1 the concentration approaches a constant value c d 0 46 when t d 0 5 meaning the voc transport has reached a steady state unlike case 1 for both cases 2 and 3 the concentrations fluctuate periodically induced by the fluctuated water table for case 2 γ d 0 the concentration varies between 0 39 and 0 53 and the average concentration is close to that of case 1 steady wt for case 3 γ d 200 however the concentration varies between 0 49 and 0 62 and the averaged concentration is around 0 56 which is larger than that of case 2 meaning both amplitude and mean of concentration fluctuations are larger than those for the case of γ d 0 the phenomenon of higher concentrations at the outlet is consistent with the previous laboratory experiments and numerical simulations guo et al 2019 2015 qi et al 2020 usepa 2012 2015a 2015b werner et al 2002 the concentration fluctuations for the case of γ d 0 generally follows the water table fluctuations as expected this is because the rising water table shortens the migration pathway of vocs causing higher concentrations in the unsaturated zone on the contrary the concentration for the case of γ d 200 varies inversely with the water table specifically the voc concentration increases when the water table declines and the reverse is also true the pattern of concentration fluctuations in opposite to water table fluctuations has also widely been found in previous studies guo et al 2019 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 mccarthy and johnson 1993 picone et al 2012 qi et al 2020 thomson et al 1997 usepa 2012 werner et al 2002 the main reason is that the residual vocs in soils carried by groundwater will be exposed to the unsaturated zone and will volatilize into the air after the water table falls therefore these residual vocs will cause the concentration to rise when the water table rises however these residual vocs will be submerged beneath the water table which blocks their release into the soil air causing a decrease in concentrations in addition when the water table approaches the maximum elevation h d 0 2 the concentrations of cases 2 and 3 are almost the same in this situation the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone are completely submerged beneath the water table which causes vocs to volatilize only from groundwater as a result case 3 has the same mechanism as case 2 fig 5b presents the vertical concentration profiles for the three cases at t d 3 when the water table is the lowest for both cases 1 and 2 the concentration is linearly proportional to the depth and the minimum and the maximum concentrations respectively occur at the outlet and the water surface owing to the diffusion processes of vocs for the case of γ d 200 however the maximum concentration occurs in the location near the highest water table z d 0 2 owing to the enhanced volatilization of residual vocs in the region of 0 z d 0 2 it implies that part of voc vapor will migrate downward for this case it should be noted that in this case the maximum concentration c d 1 32 is larger than the concentration of the lower boundary which possibly happens because the residual vocs release more contaminant vapor into the air of the unsaturated zone causing larger voc concentrations besides the parameters of the source term γ d and b d will affect vocs release which will be discussed in the next section 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the parameters sensitivity analysis is an important tool to assess the impacts of different parameters on the vapor intrusion model which was implemented in the previous vapor intrusion modeling ma et al 2019 2016 picone et al 2012 picone et al 2012 developed a one dimensional numerical model to identify the key processes which control the vapor intrusion risks by sensitivity analysis they concluded that the retreating water table can lead to an high attenuation factor ma et al 2019 found that the bubble rising velocity in the saturated zone had the considerable impacts on the intensity and time of vapor intrusion when there are trapped air ganglia under water table ma et al 2016 conducted the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for abreu johnson numerical vapor intrusion model they suggested that the soil air permeability the indoor air exchange rate and the building depressurization are the key contributors to the uncertainties of the vapor intrusion model in this section we mainly investigate the impacts of dimensionless parameters h md q d γ d and b d on voc transport in the unsaturated zone the left column of fig 6 displays the changes of the dimensionless voc concentrations with the dimensionless time at z d 0 75 for different parameters and the right column displays the voc concentration profiles at t d 3 and t d 4 for different parameters the other parameters are the same as in fig 4 fig 6a and b present the impacts of the amplitude of water table fluctuations h md a larger h md results in larger magnitude and amplitude of the fluctuated concentration in the unsaturated zone fig 6a this can be ascribed to two factors first large h md leads to a significant change of the transport distance for vocs in the unsaturated zone causing a large amplitude of the concentration fluctuations second the more drastic fluctuations of water table the more residual vocs retained in the unsaturated zone which results in higher volatilization fluxes from the residual vocs causing a larger magnitude of the concentration fluctuation fig 6c and d present the impacts of the gas entry velocity in the foundation cracks of the building q d fig 6c shows that both magnitude and amplitude of concentration fluctuations increase with decreasing q d this is because a lower q d value implies that the gas convection through cracks of the building foundation is relatively weaker as a result larger mass of vocs accumulates in the soil beneath the foundation although lower q d leads to higher voc concentration the concentration gradient is smaller fig 6d meaning the mass flux into the building is lower this phenomenon has been recognized by the industry and this finding is commonly used to design the sub slab depressurization ssd mitigation system that is used to decrease or inhibit airflow q d by lowering the air pressure of the soils beneath the foundation usepa 2015a fig 6e h illustrate the impacts of the dimensionless volatilization rate γ d and the dimensionless decay rate b d of the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone on vocs transport as expected a larger γ d leads to larger magnitude and amplitude of the concentration fluctuations because more vocs volatilize into the soils fig 6e as for the decay rate b d however it has opposite effects on the voc transport in soils i e a larger b d which represents quicker decay of the mass of residual vocs will reduce both magnitude and amplitude of voc concentration fluctuations in soils fig 6g these impacts of γ d and b d on the voc concentrations can be observed more clearly in the vertical concentration profiles fig 6f and h moreover for different γ d the vertical voc concentration profiles approximately overlapped each other at t d 4 water table reaches the highest elevation which are displayed with the dashed lines in fig 6f it is also true for the cases of different b dashed lines in fig 6h this phenomenon results from that the residual vocs in the soil are fully submerged beneath the water table when h d 0 2 leading to no contribution of this part of vocs to the vertical voc migration in the unsaturated zone 4 application to laboratory experiments to demonstrate the practical capacity of the analytical model we used it to interpret the measured emission fluxes from a series of laboratory sand tank experiments conducted by guo et al 2015 in those experiments the effects of water table fluctuation on the voc emission from a groundwater plume were investigated the dimensions of the sand tank are 61 cm 10 cm 182 cm the constant head overflow devices and the stepper drives are used to simulate water table fluctuation the dissolved vocs with a constant concentration are introduced to the tank with the continuous lateral water flow that is used to represent a contaminated plume in groundwater the sweep gas flow at the headspace of the tank the outlet is controlled at a constant velocity and the voc mass flux at the outlet is obtained around every 1 5 h tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce are used in the experiments to investigate their transport behaviors under the conditions of fluctuated water table two types of soil play sand and silica sand quikrete holdings inc atlanta ga are used as packing materials of the tank for examining the impacts of the soil textures the details of the laboratory experiment can be found in guo et al 2015 in this study four groups of the laboratory experiments in guo et al 2015 are chosen for the practical application of the analytical model which are e1 for pce in play sand with the water table fluctuations of 10 cm d e2 for tce in play sand with the water table fluctuations of 10 cm d e3 for tce in silica sand with the water table fluctuations of 10 cm d and e4 for pce in play sand with the water table fluctuations of 5 cm d the measured mass flux at the outlet is normalized by dividing with the mass flux on t 0 fig 7 the gas flow at the outlet is approximately steady state as mentioned above meaning that the normalized mass flux is equal to the normalized concentration that is obtained by dividing with the concentration on t 0 therefore the normalized mass fluxes of e1 e4 are fitted by the normalized concentrations using the analytical model proposed by this study fig 7 the model parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the calculated and measured voc fluxes the estimated parameters and the root mean square error rmse between the calculated and observed data are summarized in table 1 fig 7 shows that the analytical model well agrees with experimental data for both rise and fall phases of water table in all cases moreover the analytical model managed to reproduce the experimental phenomenon that the fluctuation of concentrations of vocs is generally inverse to that of the water table the good performance in fitting experimental data reflects that the analytical model has great practicability and robustness in the prediction of vocs transport behaviors under the condition of the fluctuated water table fig 7 also shows that the more dramatic fluctuation of water table e1 e3 leads to the larger variations of emission fluxes which is consistent with the findings in fig 6 5 limitations of the analytical model several limitations should be addressed for better applications of the analytical model proposed in this study first the volatilization of residual vocs is described using a source term of the voc transport model and is assumed to exponentially decay with exposure time in practice however the releasing process of the residual vocs is more complicated e g it is affected by the dynamics of mass transfer across the water air interface induced by the fluctuated water table this process is more complicated than the exponential model which requires further experimental studies to understand the microscopic mechanisms and to develop a more appropriate model moreover the volatilization of the residual vocs may inversely affected voc concentrations in groundwater therefore the model region may need to be extended to the saturated zone which requires a more sophisticated mathematical model second the soil moisture content will change over time with the fluctuated water table which will affect the effective vapor diffusion coefficient d to consider this factor the distribution of soil moisture contents should be obtained for the fluctuated water table which can be obtained by solving the richards equation and the constitutive model of the soil moisture pressure qi et al 2020 in this way however the analytical solution of the vocs transport in the unsaturated zone is difficult to obtain owing to the complicated form of d the impacts of the soil moisture contents on the voc transport in the case of the fluctuated water table will be investigated in further research finally this study assumes that the change of water table elevation is much less than the depth of the water table which results in underestimation of the concentration by the analytical solution when the water table is very shallow although the analytical model is limited by the above assumptions it still reproduces the pattern of the voc transport with the fluctuated water table well this analytical model could be a simple tool for the risk assessment of vapor intrusion by specifically considering the impacts of the fluctuated water table 6 environmental implications the fluctuations of water table are widely induced by natural events and anthropogenic activities such as rainfall sea tides and groundwater extraction etc riparian and or coastal areas are usually economically well developed and densely populated where many industrial estates are located probably creating large numbers of contaminated sites of vocs for instance in san francisco bay area of ca there are reportedly 8000 contaminated sites within 5 km of the bay shoreline among which many sites have potential vapor intrusion risks qi et al 2020 many results of laboratory experiments field investigations and modeling results including this study demonstrated that water table fluctuations overall increase the entry flux or concentrations of vocs in both water table rising and falling phases for example both figs 3 and 7 indicate that water table fluctuations lead to higher sub slab soil concentration and fluxes of vocs relative to the case of steady water table the latest guide of usepa on vapor intrusion explains these facilitated impacts on voc subsurface transport by the mechanisms that the rising water table will bring the vapor source closer to buildings and the falling water table will induce the exposure of residual vocs in the unsaturated soil usepa 2015b such mechanisms are mathematically described by the proposed model the guide of usepa indicates that the water table fluctuation leads to elevated vapor concentrations and is one of the favorable factors that cause greater vapor intrusion potential or risk usepa 2015b in addition usepa also recommends that near source soil gas sampling should be considered in different seasons that coincide with groundwater fluctuations usepa 2015b as previously stated most current vapor intrusion models for practical risk assessments are steady state models it means these models cannot predict the dynamics of voc concentrations and will underestimate entry fluxes under the conditions of the dramatically fluctuated water table which ubiquitously occurs in the riparian and coastal areas this could cause inapposite decision making in the management and re development of contaminated sites and consequently result in potential human health risks to the residents nearby as previously presented the proposed model managed to reproduce the observed phenomena of the fluctuated voc concentrations with oscillations of water table via the mathematical treatments of the moving boundary and source term of the unsaturated residual vocs well fitting results with the experimental data imply that this model could be a simple tool for the risk assessment under the fluctuated conditions of water table further work should be carried out for the adjustment of the analytical model to specific sites to improve its practical applicability 7 conclusions in this study an analytical model of vapor intrusion was developed to investigate the effects of the fluctuated water table on voc emissions from the subsurface into buildings vapor contaminants volatilize from groundwater plume with a constant concentration and enter the overlying building with the airflow through foundation cracks the vapor transport in the unsaturated zone was described by the diffusion equation and the fluctuated water table was treated as the moving boundary the residual contaminants in the unsaturated zone induced by the fluctuated water table were also considered the analytical solutions were tested by numerical simulations using comsol multiphysics the sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impacts of the model parameters the analytical solution was also applied to the laboratory experiments the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 for the case without the sources term the voc concentration fluctuations generally follow the water table fluctuations owing to the moving water table shortens or lengthens the migration path of the voc in contrast for the case of considering sources term the voc concentration varies inversely with the fluctuation of water table owing to the residual vocs which will volatilize into the air of the soils after water table falls and in turn cause higher voc concentrations 2 a larger amplitude of water table fluctuations will cause larger magnitude and amplitude of the fluctuated concentration while a larger gas flux at the crack of the overlying building will reduce the magnitude and amplitude of the fluctuated concentration 3 the present solution matches the laboratory experiment data well this indicates that the analytical solution reproduces the pattern of the voc transport and it could be a simple tool for the risk assessment of vapor intrusion when

4681,intrusion of subsurface contaminants in vapor phase from groundwater into overlying buildings through cracks or other pathways poses potential risk to human health previous studies indicated that water table fluctuations may have significant impacts on vapor intrusion resulting in fluctuated concentrations of indoor volatile organic compounds vocs analytical solutions for vapor intrusion processes are flexible tools in predicting voc concentrations and assessing health risks of voc contaminated sites however an analytical solution considering the impacts of fluctuated water table is not available in this study an analytical model of the vapor intrusion with fluctuated water table was developed the voc transport in unsaturated zones was described by diffusion equation and the varying water table was treated as a moving boundary the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone induced by water table fluctuations were also considered and were described by a source term of the vapor diffusion the analytical solution was tested with its numerical solution the results indicate that the fluctuated water table affects the dynamics of vocs mainly in two ways changing the length of vapor migration path and delivering the residual vocs into the unsaturated zone the voc concentration at the outlet varies inversely with the water table fluctuation owing to the release processes of the residual vocs dominate the analytical solution matches well to the laboratory experiment data in an existing study and could be a simple tool for the risk assessment of vapor intrusion when

as vapor intrusion vi ma et al 2020 which could give rise to potential risks of cancer or chronic diseases after human exposure people commonly spend over 20 h per day indoors therefore the presence of hazardous vapor in buildings through vapor intrusion is of nonnegligible concern for human health klepeis et al 2001 olson and corsi 2002 tillman and weaver 2005 mathematical models are widely recommended to conduct risk assessment of vapor intrusion providing a line of evidence for decision making usepa 2015b a large number of numerical and analytical models have been developed to investigate the effects of different environmental factors on vapor intrusion including source concentration abreu et al 2009 mills et al 2007 parker 2003 source location abreu et al 2009 picone et al

vapor transport in soils based on previous radon intrusion models johnson and ettinger 1991 which is often referred to as the j e model that is a popular screen tool for vi risk assessment following the pioneering modelling work of johnson and ettinger 1991 various analytical models of vi have been developed to consider the impacts of different factors e g biodegradation of vocs devaull 2007 gas advection yao et al 2015 heterogeneous soils verginelli et al 2019 yao et al 2017a bubble migration in saturated zones ma et al 2019 and indoor air pressure yao et al 2020b most of these models are limited to steady or quasi steady vapor transport which are not capable of predicting fluctuated voc concentrations that are widely observed in the field folkes et al 2009 holton et al 2013 hosangadi et al 2017 strom et al 2019 usepa 2015a the voc concentration fluctuations can be ascribed to the diverse environmental forces such as transient air temperature wind ambient pressure and water table illangasekare et al 2014 usepa 2015b such temporal variations raise challenges in risk assessment of voc contaminated sites and could cause inapposite decision making for site management if one neglects the temporal variations of the voc concentration illangasekare et al 2014 the water table commonly fluctuates across different time scales liang and zhang 2013 2015 zhang and schilling 2004 which may be induced by rainfall events anthropogenic activities and streamflow water table fluctuations affect dissolution volatilization distribution and biodegradation of vocs in subsurface environments dobson et al 2007 kim and corapcioglu 2003 rezanezhad et al 2014 field and experimental observations indicate that water table fluctuations have significant impacts on vapor intrusion resulting in the dynamics of indoor voc concentrations usepa 2015a recently several studies have found that the water table fluctuation causes not only dynamics of voc concentrations but also increases in the magnitude of voc mass flux from soils guo et al 2019 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 picone et al 2012 qi et al 2020 thomson et al 1997 werner et al 2002 more specifically the dramatic rise of voc concentration was often observed following the fall of water table guo et al 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 johnson et al 2016 guo et al 2015 conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the effects of water table fluctuation on vapor intrusion the results indicated that the dynamics of water table caused dramatical fluctuations in emission fluxes of vocs especially for the cases of shallow water table and high permeability soils based on the experimental observations of guo et al 2015 guo et al 2019 qi et al 2020 proposed a one dimensional numerical model to simulate the non equilibrium transport of vocs in the soil with the fluctuated water table using hydrus 1d the results suggested that the soil texture the amplitude of water table fluctuation and the types of vocs all have significant impacts on the amplitude and magnitude of emission flux fluctuations moreover it should be noted that for the models of both guo et al 2015 and qi et al 2020 a time varying head is imposed on the lower boundary the water table locates on the position of the zero pressure head and it fluctuates with the time varying head boundary to our best knowledge an analytical model for vapor intrusion considering the water table fluctuation has not been reported in the previous literature therefore the goal of this study is to fill this knowledge gap by developing an analytical model of vapor intrusion to further investigate the impacts of the water table fluctuation in this study the vapor transport in the unsaturated zone from groundwater is described by the diffusion equation different from guo et al 2015 and qi et al 2020 the fluctuated water table is treated as a moving boundary and the mathematical model is solved analytically the residual contaminant in the unsaturated zone induced by the fluctuated water table is described by a source term of the vapor diffusion the proposed analytical model could be employed as a risk assessment tool of vapor intrusion this paper was organized as follows the mathematical model and its solution were first presented then the analytical solution was tested by comparing it with a numerical simulation built with comsol multiphysics the impacts of water table fluctuations and parameters were examined and the analytical solution was finally applied to the laboratory experiments 2 model and solution 2 1 mathematical model fig 1 illustrates the vapor intrusion pathway under the condition of the fluctuated water table the contaminant source is a groundwater voc plume that moves along with water table fluctuations dissolved vocs volatilize from groundwater with a constant vapor phase concentration of vocs c 0 in the air of soils and upward migrates in the unsaturated zone via gas diffusion after reaching the sub slab of the building z l voc will enter the building through cracks via gas advection induced by the indoor outdoor air pressure difference the elevation of water table h t changes with time for a range of 0 h t h m where h m is the maximum elevation of the water table in this study we focus on the transport behaviors of vocs and neglect the biodegradation of vocs the initial voc concentration in the unsaturated zone is assumed as zero on the basis of the previous studies johnson and ettinger 1991 ma et al 2020 yao et al 2013 the vapor phase diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism and the gas advection is commonly neglected for the vapor intrusion in the contaminated field therefore the transport of contaminant vapor in the unsaturated zone with the fluctuated water table can be described by the following governing equation 1a θ s w g c t d 2 c z 2 f z t h t z l t 0 where 1b θ s w g k oc f oc ρ b h θ w h θ g 1c d d g θ g 10 3 θ t 2 d w h θ w 10 3 θ t 2 the boundary and initial conditions are 2a c c 0 z h t 2b d c z q c 0 z l 2c c 0 t 0 where c is the vapor concentration in the unsaturated zone m l 3 d is the effective vapor diffusion coefficient in porous media l 2 t which is approximated by millington and quirk s equation 1c millington and quirk 1961 d g and d w are the diffusion coefficients in the air and water l 2 t respectively θ g and θ w are the air and water filled porosity l g a s w a t e r 3 l s o i l 3 respectively and θ t is the total porosity l p o r e s 3 l s o i l 3 k oc is the soil organic carbon water partition coefficient l 3 m f oc is the soil organic carbon content ρ b is the soil bulk density m s o i l l s o i l 3 h is henry s constant representing the water gas phase partitioning of the voc f z t is the mass per unit volume in unit time released from the volatilization of residual vocs in the unsaturated zone induced by the fluctuated water table m l 3 t which will be further explained later q is the gas entry velocity in the cracks of building l t moreover the diffusion coefficient of voc in the air is four or five orders of magnitude higher than that in the water therefore the gas phase diffusion of voc considerably dominates the voc transport in soils it should be noted that eq 2a represents a moving boundary the location of this boundary is determined by the water table in practice an arbitrary fluctuated water table can be approximately expressed by piecewise linear segments connecting points of water table measurements h i h t i at times t i fig 2 therefore the fluctuated water table can be approximated as 3a h t h i 1 α i t t i 1 t i 1 t t i i 1 2 3 t 0 0 where 3b α i h i h i 1 t i t i 1 in this study there is the following reason to consider the source term f z t in the vocs transport model as mentioned previously the higher voc concentration at the outlet is always observed when water table falls in the experiments of voc transport guo et al 2019 2015 mccarthy and johnson 1993 usepa 2012 werner et al 2002 this phenomenon can be ascribed to that the rising water table will carry some dissolved vocs into the unsaturated zone these dissolved vocs refer to residual vocs hereafter will be exposed to the unsaturated zone and will volatilize into the air after that the water table falls therefore these residual vocs will cause the voc concentration to increase when water table rises however the residual vocs will be submerged beneath the water table which blocks their release into the soil air causing the voc concentration to decrease in addition the volatilization rate of the residual vocs usually decreases with exposure time due to the reduction in the total mass of residual vocs it should be noted that the specific surface of water air interface in the unsaturated zone is larger than that in the saturated zone near the water table resulting in larger volatilization flux from the residual vocs this may cause the voc concentration in the unsaturated zone to be higher than that in the groundwater therefore to describe these processes the source term f z t is considered in the voc transport model which is controlled by both water table elevation and exposure time it can be written by the following formula 4 f z t ϑ z t g t where ϑ z t represents the impacts of the fluctuated water table and g t describes the time dependent decay of the source term for mathematical convenience we assume that the water table initially declines from the maximum elevation h m to the minimum elevation h 0 at time t 1 then the water table rises to the maximum elevation h m again at time t 2 the water table fluctuates repeatedly in this manner fig 3 in each time interval t 2 i 2 t t 2 i i 1 2 3 the source term f z t will appear in the region of h t z h m fig 3 therefore it can be written as the following formula 5 ϑ z t h z h t h z h m where h x is the heaviside step function which is defined as h x 0 x 0 1 x 0 as previously stated g t represents the rate of volatilization from the residual vocs for a given location of the unsaturated zone which will decrease over time we use the following exponential decay model to describe the decreasing source term 6 g t γ exp b t t p t i 1 t t i i 1 2 3 where γ is the volatilization rate of residual vocs m l 3 t b is the decay rate 1 t the subscript p in t p is defined as p 2 f l o o r i 1 2 f l o o r x is the floor function which is the round of x to the nearest integer that is less than or equal to x 2 2 analytical solution for convenience of mathematical treatment we defined the following dimensionless variables 7 z d z l c d c c 0 t d t d l 2 h d h l h id h i l q d ql d α id θ s w g α i l d f d fl 2 d c 0 b d θ s w g b l 2 d γ d θ s w g γ l 2 d c 0 substituting equation 7 into equation 1a yields 8 c d t d 2 c d z d 2 f d z d t d h d t d z d 1 t d 0 equation 8 is a diffusion equation with a moving boundary which is difficult to solve analytically to treat this problem the moving boundary can be transformed into a fixed boundary by introducing the following variable liang et al 2020 9 ξ d z d h d t d 0 ξ d 1 t d 0 this variable describes the effect of moving origin of z d coordinates and can be used as follows 10a c d z d c d ξ d ξ d z d c d t d t d z d c d ξ d 10b c d t d c d t d t d t d c d ξ d ξ d t d c d t d c d ξ d d h d d t d substituting equation 10 into equation 8 the boundary value problem becomes the advection dispersion equation with a time varying velocity as follows 11 c d t d 2 c d ξ d 2 v t d c d ξ d f d ξ d t d 0

elevation is much less than the depth of the water table i e h d t d 1 which results in 1 h d t d 1 therefore the boundary value problem 11 can be written as 13a c d t d 2 c d ξ d 2 v t d c d ξ d f d ξ d t d 0 ξ d 1 t d 0 13b c d 1 ξ d 0 13c c d ξ d q d c d 0 ξ d 1 13d c d 0 t d 0 where 14a f d ξ d t d g d t d h ξ d h ξ d h d t d h md 14b g d t d γ d exp b d t d t pd t id 1 t d t id i 1 2 3 equation 13a is an advection dispersion equation with a time varying velocity v t d which is not easy to solve analytically in this study we employ the recursive method that is proposed by liang et al 2020 to solve equation 13a the main idea of this method is to divide the modeling period into a series of sub time interval in which the velocity is constant based on the recursive method we mainly consider the boundary value problem in a time interval t id 1 t id 15a c d t d 2 c d ξ d 2 α id c d ξ d f d ξ d t d 0 ξ d 1 t id 1 t d t id 15b c d 1 ξ d 0 15c c d ξ d q d c d 0 ξ d 1 15d c d c d t id 1 ξ d t d t id 1 equation 15a is an advection dispersion equation with a constant velocity α id which can be solved analytically it should be noted that the initial condition 15d of each time interval is determined by the concentration at the end of the previous interval which requires the concentration for the first interval 0 t 1 d to be calculated firstly then the concentrations of the following time intervals can be obtained sequentially the analytical solution of eq 15 for any time interval can be obtained by green s function method the details of the derivation are presented in the supporting information the analytical solution of eq 15 can be written as 16 c d t d ξ d e t d ξ d φ ic ξ d t d φ bc ξ d t d φ s ξ d t d t id 1 t d t id where 17a e t d ξ d exp α id 2 ξ d α id 2 4 t d

the definitions of parameters a 1 a 2 a 3 b n β n η n e 1 e 2 f 1 f 2 g g 1 g 2 h i t i are presented in supporting information the solution in the z coordinate system can be obtained by substituting equation 9 into equation 16 2 3 comparison with numerical solution to test the validity of the analytical solution 16 we compared it with a numerical solution of equation 13 obtained by comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa a galerkin finite element software package more specifically the governing equation 13 was numerically solved by comosl using the partial differential equation solver the dimensionless parameter values are q d 5 γ d 200 b d 2 h md 0 2 and t id t id 1 1 to ensure sufficient accuracy of the numerical solution the element sizes of 0 001 and the time step of 0 01 were adopted fig 4 displays the changes of the voc concentration with times at two locations z d 0 5 and z d 0 75 fig 4a and with spatial coordinates of z d on two times t d 3 and t d 4 fig 4b with the fluctuated water table dashed curves in fig 4a the results indicate that the analytical solution 16 matches the numerical solution very well over the entire simulation period implying that the analytical solution appears to be sufficiently accurate to predict voc concentrations for the model of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of water table fluctuations in this study we are concerned with the dynamics of vocs caused by two factors 1 the change of length of voc transport pathway induced by the fluctuated water table wt and 2 the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone delivered by the fluctuated water table to gain insight into the impacts of these two factors we calculated the voc concentrations for three cases for case 1 steady wt the steady water table is considered h d 0 1 and the residual vocs induced by water table fluctuations is absent for case 2 fluctuated wt without source terms the water table fluctuates in the range of 0 h d 0 2 while the residual vocs are not considered as well γ d 0 for case 3 fluctuated wt with source terms the water table fluctuates in the range of 0 h d 0 2 and the residual vocs are considered γ d 200 the other parameters for the three cases are the same as those in fig 4 fig 5 illustrates the time varying changes of the voc concentration at z d 0 75 and the concentration profiles at t d 3 for the three cases the concentrations of the three cases increase in the early stages t d 0 5 owing to the impact of the zero initial concentration fig 5a for case 1 the concentration approaches a constant value c d 0 46 when t d 0 5 meaning the voc transport has reached a steady state unlike case 1 for both cases 2 and 3 the concentrations fluctuate periodically induced by the fluctuated water table for case 2 γ d 0 the concentration varies between 0 39 and 0 53 and the average concentration is close to that of case 1 steady wt for case 3 γ d 200 however the concentration varies between 0 49 and 0 62 and the averaged concentration is around 0 56 which is larger than that of case 2 meaning both amplitude and mean of concentration fluctuations are larger than those for the case of γ d 0 the phenomenon of higher concentrations at the outlet is consistent with the previous laboratory experiments and numerical simulations guo et al 2019 2015 qi et al 2020 usepa 2012 2015a 2015b werner et al 2002 the concentration fluctuations for the case of γ d 0 generally follows the water table fluctuations as expected this is because the rising water table shortens the migration pathway of vocs causing higher concentrations in the unsaturated zone on the contrary the concentration for the case of γ d 200 varies inversely with the water table specifically the voc concentration increases when the water table declines and the reverse is also true the pattern of concentration fluctuations in opposite to water table fluctuations has also widely been found in previous studies guo et al 2019 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 mccarthy and johnson 1993 picone et al 2012 qi et al 2020 thomson et al 1997 usepa 2012 werner et al 2002 the main reason is that the residual vocs in soils carried by groundwater will be exposed to the unsaturated zone and will volatilize into the air after the water table falls therefore these residual vocs will cause the concentration to rise when the water table rises however these residual vocs will be submerged beneath the water table which blocks their release into the soil air causing a decrease in concentrations in addition when the water table approaches the maximum elevation h d 0 2 the concentrations of cases 2 and 3 are almost the same in this situation the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone are completely submerged beneath the water table which causes vocs to volatilize only from groundwater as a result case 3 has the same mechanism as case 2 fig 5b presents the vertical concentration profiles for the three cases at t d 3 when the water table is the lowest for both cases 1 and 2 the concentration is linearly proportional to the depth and the minimum and the maximum concentrations respectively occur at the outlet and the water surface owing to the diffusion processes of vocs for the case of γ d 200 however the maximum concentration occurs in the location near the highest water table z d 0 2 owing to the enhanced volatilization of residual vocs in the region of 0 z d 0 2 it implies that part of voc vapor will migrate downward for this case it should be noted that in this case the maximum concentration c d 1 32 is larger than the concentration of the lower boundary which possibly happens because the residual vocs release more contaminant vapor into the air of the unsaturated zone causing larger voc concentrations besides the parameters of the source term γ d and b d will affect vocs release which will be discussed in the next section 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the parameters sensitivity analysis is an important tool to assess the impacts of different parameters on the vapor intrusion model which was implemented in the previous vapor intrusion modeling ma et al 2019 2016 picone et al 2012 picone et al 2012 developed a one dimensional numerical model to identify the key processes which control the vapor intrusion risks by sensitivity analysis they concluded that the retreating water table can lead to an high attenuation factor ma et al 2019 found that the bubble rising velocity in the saturated zone had the considerable impacts on the intensity and time of vapor intrusion when there are trapped air ganglia under water table ma et al 2016 conducted the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for abreu johnson numerical vapor intrusion model they suggested that the soil air permeability the indoor air exchange rate and the building depressurization are the key contributors to the uncertainties of the vapor intrusion model in this section we mainly investigate the impacts of dimensionless parameters h md q d γ d and b d on voc transport in the unsaturated zone the left column of fig 6 displays the changes of the dimensionless voc concentrations with the dimensionless time at z d 0 75 for different parameters and the right column displays the voc concentration profiles at t d 3 and t d 4 for different parameters the other parameters are the same as in fig 4 fig 6a and b present the impacts of the amplitude of water table fluctuations h md a larger h md results in larger magnitude and amplitude of the fluctuated concentration in the unsaturated zone fig 6a this can be ascribed to two factors first large h md leads to a significant change of the transport distance for vocs in the unsaturated zone causing a large amplitude of the concentration fluctuations second the more drastic fluctuations of water table the more residual vocs retained in the unsaturated zone which results in higher volatilization fluxes from the residual vocs causing a larger magnitude of the concentration fluctuation fig 6c and d present the impacts of the gas entry velocity in the foundation cracks of the building q d fig 6c shows that both magnitude and amplitude of concentration fluctuations increase with decreasing q d this is because a lower q d value implies that the gas convection through cracks of the building foundation is relatively weaker as a result larger mass of vocs accumulates in the soil beneath the foundation although lower q d leads to higher voc concentration the concentration gradient is smaller fig 6d meaning the mass flux into the building is lower this phenomenon has been recognized by the industry and this finding is commonly used to design the sub slab depressurization ssd mitigation system that is used to decrease or inhibit airflow q d by lowering the air pressure of the soils beneath the foundation usepa 2015a fig 6e h illustrate the impacts of the dimensionless volatilization rate γ d and the dimensionless decay rate b d of the residual vocs in the unsaturated zone on vocs transport as expected a larger γ d leads to larger magnitude and amplitude of the concentration fluctuations because more vocs volatilize into the soils fig 6e as for the decay rate b d however it has opposite effects on the voc transport in soils i e a larger b d which represents quicker decay of the mass of residual vocs will reduce both magnitude and amplitude of voc concentration fluctuations in soils fig 6g these impacts of γ d and b d on the voc concentrations can be observed more clearly in the vertical concentration profiles fig 6f and h moreover for different γ d the vertical voc concentration profiles approximately overlapped each other at t d 4 water table reaches the highest elevation which are displayed with the dashed lines in fig 6f it is also true for the cases of different b dashed lines in fig 6h this phenomenon results from that the residual vocs in the soil are fully submerged beneath the water table when h d 0 2 leading to no contribution of this part of vocs to the vertical voc migration in the unsaturated zone 4 application to laboratory experiments to demonstrate the practical capacity of the analytical model we used it to interpret the measured emission fluxes from a series of laboratory sand tank experiments conducted by guo et al 2015 in those experiments the effects of water table fluctuation on the voc emission from a groundwater plume were investigated the dimensions of the sand tank are 61 cm 10 cm 182 cm the constant head overflow devices and the stepper drives are used to simulate water table fluctuation the dissolved vocs with a constant concentration are introduced to the tank with the continuous lateral water flow that is used to represent a contaminated plume in groundwater the sweep gas flow at the headspace of the tank the outlet is controlled at a constant velocity and the voc mass flux at the outlet is obtained around every 1 5 h tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce are used in the experiments to investigate their transport behaviors under the conditions of fluctuated water table two types of soil play sand and silica sand quikrete holdings inc atlanta ga are used as packing materials of the tank for examining the impacts of the soil textures the details of the laboratory experiment can be found in guo et al 2015 in this study four groups of the laboratory experiments in guo et al 2015 are chosen for the practical application of the analytical model which are e1 for pce in play sand with the water table fluctuations of 10 cm d e2 for tce in play sand with the water table fluctuations of 10 cm d e3 for tce in silica sand with the water table fluctuations of 10 cm d and e4 for pce in play sand with the water table fluctuations of 5 cm d the measured mass flux at the outlet is normalized by dividing with the mass flux on t 0 fig 7 the gas flow at the outlet is approximately steady state as mentioned above meaning that the normalized mass flux is equal to the normalized concentration that is obtained by dividing with the concentration on t 0 therefore the normalized mass fluxes of e1 e4 are fitted by the normalized concentrations using the analytical model proposed by this study fig 7 the model parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the calculated and measured voc fluxes the estimated parameters and the root mean square error rmse between the calculated and observed data are summarized in table 1 fig 7 shows that the analytical model well agrees with experimental data for both rise and fall phases of water table in all cases moreover the analytical model managed to reproduce the experimental phenomenon that the fluctuation of concentrations of vocs is generally inverse to that of the water table the good performance in fitting experimental data reflects that the analytical model has great practicability and robustness in the prediction of vocs transport behaviors under the condition of the fluctuated water table fig 7 also shows that the more dramatic fluctuation of water table e1 e3 leads to the larger variations of emission fluxes which is consistent with the findings in fig 6 5 limitations of the analytical model several limitations should be addressed for better applications of the analytical model proposed in this study first the volatilization of residual vocs is described using a source term of the voc transport model and is assumed to exponentially decay with exposure time in practice however the releasing process of the residual vocs is more complicated e g it is affected by the dynamics of mass transfer across the water air interface induced by the fluctuated water table this process is more complicated than the exponential model which requires further experimental studies to understand the microscopic mechanisms and to develop a more appropriate model moreover the volatilization of the residual vocs may inversely affected voc concentrations in groundwater therefore the model region may need to be extended to the saturated zone which requires a more sophisticated mathematical model second the soil moisture content will change over time with the fluctuated water table which will affect the effective vapor diffusion coefficient d to consider this factor the distribution of soil moisture contents should be obtained for the fluctuated water table which can be obtained by solving the richards equation and the constitutive model of the soil moisture pressure qi et al 2020 in this way however the analytical solution of the vocs transport in the unsaturated zone is difficult to obtain owing to the complicated form of d the impacts of the soil moisture contents on the voc transport in the case of the fluctuated water table will be investigated in further research finally this study assumes that the change of water table elevation is much less than the depth of the water table which results in underestimation of the concentration by the analytical solution when the water table is very shallow although the analytical model is limited by the above assumptions it still reproduces the pattern of the voc transport with the fluctuated water table well this analytical model could be a simple tool for the risk assessment of vapor intrusion by specifically considering the impacts of the fluctuated water table 6 environmental implications the fluctuations of water table are widely induced by natural events and anthropogenic activities such as rainfall sea tides and groundwater extraction etc riparian and or coastal areas are usually economically well developed and densely populated where many industrial estates are located probably creating large numbers of contaminated sites of vocs for instance in san francisco bay area of ca there are reportedly 8000 contaminated sites within 5 km of the bay shoreline among which many sites have potential vapor intrusion risks qi et al 2020 many results of laboratory experiments field investigations and modeling results including this study demonstrated that water table fluctuations overall increase the entry flux or concentrations of vocs in both water table rising and falling phases for example both figs 3 and 7 indicate that water table fluctuations lead to higher sub slab soil concentration and fluxes of vocs relative to the case of steady water table the latest guide of usepa on vapor intrusion explains these facilitated impacts on voc subsurface transport by the mechanisms that the rising water table will bring the vapor source closer to buildings and the falling water table will induce the exposure of residual vocs in the unsaturated soil usepa 2015b such mechanisms are mathematically described by the proposed model the guide of usepa indicates that the water table fluctuation leads to elevated vapor concentrations and is one of the favorable factors that cause greater vapor intrusion potential or risk usepa 2015b in addition usepa also recommends that near source soil gas sampling should be considered in different seasons that coincide with groundwater fluctuations usepa 2015b as previously stated most current vapor intrusion models for practical risk assessments are steady state models it means these models cannot predict the dynamics of voc concentrations and will underestimate entry fluxes under the conditions of the dramatically fluctuated water table which ubiquitously occurs in the riparian and coastal areas this could cause inapposite decision making in the management and re development of contaminated sites and consequently result in potential human health risks to the residents nearby as previously presented the proposed model managed to reproduce the observed phenomena of the fluctuated voc concentrations with oscillations of water table via the mathematical treatments of the moving boundary and source term of the unsaturated residual vocs well fitting results with the experimental data imply that this model could be a simple tool for the risk assessment under the fluctuated conditions of water table further work should be carried out for the adjustment of the analytical model to specific sites to improve its practical applicability 7 conclusions in this study an analytical model of vapor intrusion was developed to investigate the effects of the fluctuated water table on voc emissions from the subsurface into buildings vapor contaminants volatilize from groundwater plume with a constant concentration and enter the overlying building with the airflow through foundation cracks the vapor transport in the unsaturated zone was described by the diffusion equation and the fluctuated water table was treated as the moving boundary the residual contaminants in the unsaturated zone induced by the fluctuated water table were also considered the analytical solutions were tested by numerical simulations using comsol multiphysics the sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impacts of the model parameters the analytical solution was also applied to the laboratory experiments the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 for the case without the sources term the voc concentration fluctuations generally follow the water table fluctuations owing to the moving water table shortens or lengthens the migration path of the voc in contrast for the case of considering sources term the voc concentration varies inversely with the fluctuation of water table owing to the residual vocs which will volatilize into the air of the soils after water table falls and in turn cause higher voc concentrations 2 a larger amplitude of water table fluctuations will cause larger magnitude and amplitude of the fluctuated concentration while a larger gas flux at the crack of the overlying building will reduce the magnitude and amplitude of the fluctuated concentration 3 the present solution matches the laboratory experiment data well this indicates that the analytical solution reproduces the pattern of the voc transport and it could be a simple tool for the risk assessment of vapor intrusion when

4682,rainfall simulators are devices used in studies on erosion and water infiltration in soil and have different classifications and operating characteristics most of these devices simulate rainfall with constant precipitation intensity pi which does not represent the characteristics of natural rainfalls and may lead to significant differences in studies on soil and water losses here we have developed an automatic pi control system for a rotating simulator equipped with nozzles through the regulation of the shutter disc rotation to simulate different rainfall patterns we have set up an electronic control system that acts on the motor power frequency inverter allowing the user to enter the desired rainfall pattern through a text file recorded on a micro sd memory card for evaluation purposes different rainfall patterns were programmed for 40 min duration with maximum pi peaks of 110 mm h 1 and total depth of 30 mm the new panel of the modified simulator built with user friendly interface enables the selection of the desired rainfall pattern and the operating mode manual or automatic the rainfalls were adequately simulated and even with variation in pi the modified simulator showed application uniformity above 75 keywords water erosion simulated rainfall rainfall intensities rainfall uniformity kinetic energy electronic control system 1 introduction the search for sustainable use of soil resources is one of the main motivations for the study on erosion and the development of conservation practices that mitigate this natural process commonly accentuated by anthropic action the world demand for food fiber and fuel and the increase in areas with agricultural production and pastures have intensified erosion merten and minella 2013 the erosive process is associated with large scale factors such as global warming lal et al 2011 and with the characteristics of rainfall climate management topography as well as soil types and cover hamanaka et al 2019 and is considered a global concern because it degrades the natural resources of soil and water leading to major economic losses in countries of tropical climate water erosion is the main cause of losses in the agricultural yield of food crops resulting in increased production cost and environmental contamination andrade et al 2011 soil losses can be generated with natural rainfall or through rainfall simulators which are tools used in hydrogeomorphological or hydrological studies in the field and in the laboratory askoy et al 2012 related to runoff infiltration and sediment loss due to use cover and management in different soil classes sarasty et al 2017 boulange et al 2019 these devices make it possible to simulate rainfall with different characteristics precipitation duration and intensity and have been used to evaluate soil erodibility mhaske et al 2019 and the impact of revegetation askoy et al 2012 besides generating information that validates conservation practices and models for estimating soil losses provided that they have characteristics similar to those of natural rainfall such as drop diameter and kinetic energy munster et al 2006 in addition to being simple portable and economical mhaske et al 2019 the simulators should have low water consumption iserloh et al 2012 precise control of precipitation intensity and provide a relationship between simulated natural rainfall kinetic energy and uniformity above 75 alves sobrinho et al 2008 according to the form of production of the drops morin et al 1967 rainfall simulators are classified into two categories being equipped with drippers composed of capillary tubes or with nozzles which operate with a wide range of precipitation intensity and drop diameter enabling the formation of a more random drop falling pattern similar to that of natural rain the simulator developed by alves sobrinho et al 2008 called infiasper operates with two pressurized nozzles and is one of the most used devices in brazil to simulate rainfall with constant precipitation pattern according to previous calibration carvalho et al 2015 panachuki et al 2015 valim et al 2016 almeida et al 2018 marques et al 2019 moraes et al 2019 however as natural rainfall events are variable in space and time assouline 2009 the natural process of soil loss is best reproduced when the simulators have mechanisms for varying the intensity during the occurrence of precipitation nielsen et al 2019 according to alavinia et al 2019 rainfalls simulated with constant intensity do not represent the characteristics of natural rainfalls leading to significant differences in the results of soil losses the combination of different precipitation intensities during rainfall is called a rainfall pattern luo et al 2020 and is considered one of the main factors that influence soil erosion huihui et al 2016 rainfall pattern classified as delayed when the peak of precipitation intensity occurs on the final third of the rain flanagan et al 1988 tends to generate higher rates of soil loss and runoff volume considering that the highest intensity occurs in water saturated soil wang et al 2016 sofia et al 2019 therefore the possibility of adapting and updating the original control panel of infiasper with the application of a rotation microcontroller to obtain different pre set rainfall patterns is a fundamental improvement in its operation and consequently in the quality of the obtained data the study was conceived based on the hypothesis that the variation in the shutter disc rotation in the rainfall simulator infiasper alves sobrinho et al 2008 makes it possible to change precipitation intensity and obtain different rainfall patterns with no simultaneous alteration in the shutter opening thus the objective of this study was to evaluate whether the variation in the shutter disc rotation associated with its opening enables the obtaining of different rainfall patterns in the rainfall simulator infiasper 2 material and methods the rainfall simulator used in this study was the infiasper developed by alves sobrinho et al 2002 2008 composed of five independent modules which facilitate transport and operation in the field fig 1 it has two fixed spray nozzles veejet 80 150 model which must be positioned at 2 30 m height from the ground during operation fig 2 a the nozzles are located above the shutter s overlapping discs fig 2b whose rotation is defined by the input frequency of the shutter motor using the frequency inverter installed on rainfall simulator panel fig 2c traditionally the device is used with constant rotation and the precipitation intensity pi is obtained by adjusting the opening of rotating shutter s discs the water that does not pass through the disc opening is collected by blocking device for intercepting water that redirects it to a deposit reducing the demand for water thus as the flow applied by the nozzles is constant for a given water pressure the larger the disc opening the greater the amount of water that passes through them and consequently the greater the pi however we conducted tests in the laboratory to evaluate the possibility of varying pi in response to the variation in the rotation of the shutter s discs thus for better adjustment in frequency variation a 10 kω potentiometer was installed in the control port of the frequency inverter which was previously set to remote mode fig 3 shows the electrical diagram of the motor pump drive circuits consisting of a switch s1 contactor switch k1 thermal relay tr1 and the shutter activation and rotation control circuit composed of a switch s2 frequency inverter inv and potentiometer p1 for the rotations of 140 200 260 400 600 and 800 rpm and disc openings of 33 44 56 and 60 mm the pi was evaluated in tests with duration of 10 min and pressure of 27 6 kpa in the nozzles the consumption cw and efficiency of water application ew were also evaluated for the same rotations and openings during 3 minute tests the cw represents the volume of water applied by simulator collected manually at the exit of the nozzles while the ew is the ratio between the volume of water collected in simulator runoff collector fig 1 and cw considering the structure of the device and the shutter openings rotation values below 140 rpm favor the undesirable intermittency of rainfall directed to the flow collector on the other hand rotations above 800 rpm cause instability of the simulator structure and direct the water out of the simulator significantly reducing its efficiency and precipitation uniformity with the results obtained from this first evaluation a multiple regression analysis was carried out in order to select the best model for the estimation of pi from rotation and disc opening data the regression models were analyzed using the minimal squares method and the significance of the estimated coefficients and the adequacy of the model were tested using the t test and analysis of variance respectively at 5 probability all statistical analyzes were conducted using the r software package version 3 6 0 after identifying the disc opening that generated the best results and maintaining the previous rotations we evaluated the water pressures in the nozzles of 20 7 and 34 6 kpa for which we measured the pi and the coefficient of uniformity cu according to christiansen 1942 eq 1 1 c u 1 i 1 n x i x x n where xi is individual water amount per rain collector ml x is the arithmetic mean of applied water amount per rain collector ml and n is the total number of rain collectors in the calibration tray 0 7 m2 corresponding to the simulator runoff collector we used a grid of 25 collectors with area of 50 cm2 with the most adequate disc opening and water pressure we conducted tests to determine the average volumetric diameter of the drops using the flour method kathiravelu et al 2016 in these tests the drops are collected on a tray containing sifted wheat flour and positioned at 30 cm height from the ground to avoid the splash effect after 5 s under rainfall the collected material is covered with a thin layer of flour and remains at rest drying in the air for 24 h after this time the material is placed in a microwave oven for 3 min garcia et al 2014 for complete drying dry granules are then separated by sieving through 4 0 2 0 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 mm meshes and weighed on an electronic scale to obtain the average mass of the granules considering that the drops have a spherical shape their diameter and volume were determined using the equations presented by iserloh et al 2013 the accumulated volume and the average diameter of drops retained on each sieve were used to determine the average diameter shown by 50 of the drops d50 the data of pi d50 water pressure fall height and applied water depth were used to calculate the fall time the initial and final velocities of the drop the kinetic energy of simulated rainfall kes and its relationship with the kinetic energy of natural rainfall with equivalent intensity ken the calculations were performed using a computational routine developed according to the methodology described by alves sobrinho et al 2008 after evaluating the device under different shutter rotations a new control panel was built for the infiasper which enabled the simulation of rainfall with variable intensity in time for this we set up an electronic control system that enables the user to enter rainfall patterns using an sd memory card which is read by a microcontroller and sends analog signal to the frequency inverter acting on the shutter rotation the control system has a user interface equipped with buttons which enable the selection of the desired rainfall pattern and the mode of operation manual precipitation intensity controlled by potentiometer or automatic precipitation intensity controlled by data on the memory card these features provide flexibility for the user in rainfall simulation tests meeting the most diverse demands in research the new control panel is composed of frequency inverter thermal relay contactor switch arduino mega 2560 microcontroller relay module 10 kω potentiometer micro sd card module and electronic circuit for user interface composed of buttons and other basic components the relay module is responsible for changing the simulation function from manual to automatic besides enabling the activation of the thermal relay contactor switch set that controls the motor pump activation after receiving the information through the arduino s pwm pulse width modulation analog port or through the potentiometer manual mode the frequency inverter is able to control the level of rotation of the device s shutter the microcontroller is responsible for controlling the relay module and frequency inverter according to the embedded program in c language whose algorithm is presented in fig 4 data of rainfall patterns are obtained by reading the micro sd card on which the corresponding files are recorded with text file extension txt therefore in each reading of the selected file the microcontroller sends the analog signal to the frequency inverter corresponding to the previously calibrated rotation values in the flowchart the routines associated with the variables i give access to the rainfall patterns recorded on the micro sd card in which the indices 1 2 3 and 4 correspond respectively to the advanced intermediate delayed and custom patterns as indicated the custom pattern is defined by the user and for testing purposes the inverted intermediate was used delays of 0 1 s correspond to the delays employed in the programming after choosing the routine the confirmation button is activated and after 1 min the arduino begins transmitting the information to the frequency inverter and starting the rainfall simulation which can have a maximum duration of 60 min t 60 the equation presented in fig 5 made it possible to calculate the rotation as a function of the desired pi enabling the construction of the rainfall patterns evaluated and the programming of the microcontroller of the new infiasper panel for evaluation of the device rainfalls of 40 min duration were simulated with maximum pi of 110 mm h 1 and total depth of 30 mm fig 6 these values represent the ip and the average depth of intense rainfall in the region of seropédica state of rio de janeiro brazil carvalho et al 2005 where the study was developed the minimum pi adopted is 20 0 mm h 1 and every minute it varies according to the rainfall pattern other pi and depths can be programmed and applied by the simulator by changing the application time and or the device s settings such as opening of the discs and water pressure in the nozzles according to mohamadi and kavian 2015 rainfall patterns of the types advanced intermediate inverted intermediate and delayed were programmed and new tests were conducted with the new panel with three repetitions for each of the aforementioned rainfall patterns in addition to the constant pi pattern in each test rainfall uniformity cu and water consumption cw were evaluated in addition to pi variability in the collection channel presented in the following classes pi 20 20 pi 25 25 pi 30 30 pi 35 35 pi 40 40 pi 45 45 pi 50 and pi greater than 50 mm h 1 in other words pi variability is presented in classes from 5 to 5 mm h 1 in order to check the operation of infiasper with the new panel in field conditions some tests were carried out in an area with soil classified as ultisol of medium texture with 540 150 and 310 g kg 1 of sand silt and clay respectively in the 0 27 cm layer almeida et al 2019 the soil layer from 0 to 20 cm was tilled with two operations with a disc harrow and one with a leveling harrow with the same programming used in laboratory the data were collected and compared with the results obtained in the same experimental area by almeida et al 2019 using the traditional infiasper and oliveira et al 2010 using an intermittent rainfall simulator according to meyer and harmon 1979 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation intensity water consumption and efficiency with the tested rotations 140 200 260 400 600 and 800 rpm and disc openings 33 44 56 and 60 mm the device showed pi ranging from 0 7 to 123 4 mm h 1 cw from 0 02 to 2 53 l min 1 and ew from 41 2 to 56 8 table 1 these results indicate the ability of the equipment to apply rains with different pi values which resembles natural events that normally do not present constant intensity these values indicate that infiasper is more efficient and requires lower water volume than the 13 simulators evaluated by irseloh et al 2013 which had ew ranging from 4 2 to 49 3 and cw from 0 48 to 3 24 l min 1 for fixed pi from 37 to 75 mm h 1 precipitation intensity increases with the reduction in shutter rotation and increase in disc opening according to equation 2 there is a polynomial relationship of two factors rotation and opening which had adjusted r2 of 0 985 with significance of the parameters p 0 01 the equation enables the estimation of pi for other values of opening opn and rotation rot within the range of evaluated values giving versatility to the simulator and facilitating the planning of new studies 2 pi 63 38 0 38 opn 0 1579 rot 0 03019 opn 2 0 0001361 rot 2 0 00169366 opn rot according to the preliminary results the 56 mm opening was adopted for the continuity of the tests since it provided on average higher values of ew and the desired range of pi 3 2 coefficient of uniformity and operating pressure for the different pressures evaluated the cu ranged from 54 2 to 81 4 with the highest values associated with the lowest rotations and consequently the highest intensities table 2 the decrease in uniformity with increasing rotation for a given opening of the discs is a consequence of the greater dispersion of water out of the runoff collector for rotations greater than 260 rpm cu is lower than 75 hence considered not suitable for rainfall simulators alves sobrinho et al 2002 however this fact does not indicate limitation of the device because in rainfalls simulated with variable intensity cu should be evaluated along the entire event and not at specific intensities among the simulators evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 cu values ranged from 60 6 to 97 8 operating with pi of 51 and 48 mm h 1 respectively these devices belong to the same category as infiasper but have a circular collector channel as the mean cu values were above 70 we chose to maintain the water pressure in the nozzles of 27 6 kpa in the sequence of the proposed evaluation tests given the wider range of pi values 3 3 kinetic energy and drop diameter for the different rotations of the discs d50 values ranged from 1 45 to 2 20 mm fig 7 and are consistent with those found by kavian et al 2019 and naves et al 2020 the simulators evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 showed d50 ranging from 0 5 to 5 0 mm it is worth mentioning that drop diameter is a function of several factors such as water pressure type of nozzle and fall height besides this the reduction in the average diameter of drops for rotation above 260 rpm occurs due to the impact between them caused by the drag in response to the increased turbulence in the water jet regardless of its value the most important point is that the device must be able to simulate rainfall with kinetic energy similar to that of natural rainfall for the rotations and other characteristics adopted the kinetic energy of the rainfall ranged from 17 82 to 23 73 j m 2 mm 1 simulating the natural rainfall from 73 82 to 88 03 table 3 3 4 development of control panel and evaluation of precipitation patterns from the proposed flowchart fig 4 a new electrical scheme was developed fig 8 enabling the construction of the new infiasper control panel fig 9 the activation buttons present in the original panel fig 3 were replaced by relays rl1 rl2 rl3 and rl4 which make it possible to choose the simulator s operation mode manual or automatic the activation of the motor pump and the activation and control of the shutter rotation from the electronic system controller composed of the microcontroller micro sd card and interface buttons menu and next leds test adv int del menu ok additionally an emergency button has been inserted for full interruption of inverter operation b0 during the tests no failures were identified in the configuration of the controller through the interface developed demonstrating its robustness and simplicity which is important for a rainfall simulator especially for operation under field conditions in addition there was adequate communication between the components and no failures were identified during the tests after conducting new tests we found that the spatial distribution of pi is similar between the rainfall patterns tested fig 10 and similar to that obtained for the device called tübingen evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 despite the variation of pi during the rainfall application cu values higher than 75 indicate adequacy of the device in the simulation of different rainfall patterns and are higher than those presented in table 2 for constant pi as the mean cw of all patterns was 1 0 l min 1 and the ew was 51 4 we found that infiasper with the proposed modifications is more efficient in water application than the models evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 which had efficiencies ranging from 4 2 to 49 3 from the characterization and evaluations carried out we can confirm the viability of the device in obtaining rainfall with regional hydrological characteristics according to carvalho et al 2005 3 5 field testing the simulator was evaluated under field conditions following the patterns of the fig 6 and the results are presented in the form of surface runoff and soil loss rate fig 11 runoff was monitored up to 50 min as it continues even after the end of the simulated rains the simulated rainfalls with constant and inverted intermediate patterns did not provide runoff and consequently soil losses in the intermediate and delayed patterns the pi peak occurs when the superficial layers of the soil are already wet which potentializes the runoff and erosion process mainly in the absence of land cover carvalho et al 2012 the soil losses obtained are different than those found in other studies carried out in the same experimental area but with simulated rainfall of different characteristics using the traditional infiasper almeida et al 2019 obtained a maximum soil loss rate of 9 5 g m 2h 1 after 25 min of rain with pi constant of 76 5 mm h 1 with an intermittent rainfall simulator oliveira et al 2010 found 36 2 66 3 and 86 2 g m 2h 1 of soil loss respectively for advanced intermediate and delayed patterns when simulated rains with the same characteristics were applied however the tests were carried out after preparing of soil towards the slope simulating critical runoff conditions which is why higher soil loss values were obtained the results presented in these articles are also associated with the form of rain application and the type of equipment used either by constant pi or by intermittent application situations that do not fully represent the natural rainfall conditions therefore it is possible to verify that the erosive process is consistent with the applied rain depending also on the land cover and soil properties and preparation even with the promising results using the new panel of infiasper measurements of soil and water losses from rainfall simulators should be carried out with caution and whenever possible compared to natural rain events 4 conclusions the installation of electronic components in the infiasper control panel makes it possible to vary shutter rotation during its operation according to previous programming enabling the simulation of rainfalls with different rainfall patterns rainfalls with pi peaks of 110 mm h 1 and duration of 40 min were adequately simulated by the device with uniformity above 75 it is possible to simulate other rainfall patterns with different pi and

to significant differences in the results of soil losses the combination of different precipitation intensities during rainfall is called a rainfall pattern luo et al 2020 and is considered one of the main factors that influence soil erosion huihui et al 2016 rainfall pattern classified as delayed when the peak of precipitation intensity occurs on the final third of the rain flanagan et al 1988 tends to generate higher rates of soil loss and runoff volume considering that the highest intensity occurs in water saturated soil wang et al 2016 sofia et al 2019 therefore the possibility of adapting and updating the original control panel of infiasper with the application of a rotation microcontroller to obtain different pre set rainfall patterns is a fundamental improvement in its operation and consequently in the quality of the obtained data the study was conceived based on the hypothesis that the variation in the shutter disc rotation in the rainfall simulator infiasper alves sobrinho et al 2008 makes it possible to change precipitation intensity and obtain different rainfall patterns with no simultaneous alteration in the shutter opening thus the objective of this study was to evaluate whether the variation in the shutter disc rotation associated with its opening enables the obtaining of different rainfall patterns in the rainfall simulator infiasper 2 material and methods the rainfall simulator used in this study was the infiasper developed by alves sobrinho et al 2002 2008 composed of five independent modules which facilitate transport and operation in the field fig 1 it has two fixed spray nozzles veejet 80 150 model which must be positioned at 2 30 m height from the ground during operation fig 2 a the nozzles are located above the shutter s overlapping discs fig 2b whose rotation is defined by the input frequency of the shutter motor using the frequency inverter installed on rainfall simulator panel fig 2c traditionally the device is used with constant rotation and the precipitation intensity pi is obtained by adjusting the opening of rotating shutter s discs the water that does not pass through the disc opening is collected by blocking device for intercepting water that redirects it to a deposit reducing the demand for water thus as the flow applied by the nozzles is constant for a given water pressure the larger the disc opening the greater the amount of water that passes through them and consequently the greater the pi however we conducted tests in the laboratory to evaluate the possibility of varying pi in response to the variation in the rotation of the shutter s discs thus for better adjustment in frequency variation a 10 kω potentiometer was installed in the control port of the frequency inverter which was previously set to remote mode fig 3 shows the electrical diagram of the motor pump drive circuits consisting of a switch s1 contactor switch k1 thermal relay tr1 and the shutter activation and rotation control circuit composed of a switch s2 frequency inverter inv and potentiometer p1 for the rotations of 140 200 260 400 600 and 800 rpm and disc openings of 33 44 56 and 60 mm the pi was evaluated in tests with duration of 10 min and pressure of 27 6 kpa in the nozzles the consumption cw and efficiency of water application ew were also evaluated for the same rotations and openings during 3 minute tests the cw represents the volume of water applied by simulator collected manually at the exit of the nozzles while the ew is the ratio between the volume of water collected in simulator runoff collector fig 1 and cw considering the structure of the device and the shutter openings rotation values below 140 rpm favor the undesirable intermittency of rainfall directed to the flow collector on the other hand rotations above 800 rpm cause instability of the simulator structure and direct the water out of the simulator significantly reducing its efficiency and precipitation uniformity with the results obtained from this first evaluation a multiple regression analysis was carried out in order to select the best model for the estimation of pi from rotation and disc opening data the regression models were analyzed using the minimal squares method and the significance of the estimated coefficients and the adequacy of the model were tested using the t test and analysis of variance respectively at 5 probability all statistical analyzes were conducted using the r software package version 3 6 0 after identifying the disc opening that generated the best results and maintaining the previous rotations we evaluated the water pressures in the nozzles of 20 7 and 34 6 kpa for which we measured the pi and the coefficient of uniformity cu according to christiansen 1942 eq 1 1 c u 1 i 1 n x i x x n where xi is individual water amount per rain collector ml x is the arithmetic mean of applied water amount per rain collector ml and n is the total number of rain collectors in the calibration tray 0 7 m2 corresponding to the simulator runoff collector we used a grid of 25 collectors with area of 50 cm2 with the most adequate disc opening and water pressure we conducted tests to determine the average volumetric diameter of the drops using the flour method kathiravelu et al 2016 in these tests the drops are collected on a tray containing sifted wheat flour and positioned at 30 cm height from the ground to avoid the splash effect after 5 s under rainfall the collected material is covered with a thin layer of flour and remains at rest drying in the air for 24 h after this time the material is placed in a microwave oven for 3 min garcia et al 2014 for complete drying dry granules are then separated by sieving through 4 0 2 0 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 mm meshes and weighed on an electronic scale to obtain the average mass of the granules considering that the drops have a spherical shape their diameter and volume were determined using the equations presented by iserloh et al 2013 the accumulated volume and the average diameter of drops retained on each sieve were used to determine the average diameter shown by 50 of the drops d50 the data of pi d50 water pressure fall height and applied water depth were used to calculate the fall time the initial and final velocities of the drop the kinetic energy of simulated rainfall kes and its relationship with the kinetic energy of natural rainfall with equivalent intensity ken the calculations were performed using a computational routine developed according to the methodology described by alves sobrinho et al 2008 after evaluating the device under different shutter rotations a new control panel was built for the infiasper which enabled the simulation of rainfall with variable intensity in time for this we set up an electronic control system that enables the user to enter rainfall patterns using an sd memory card which is read by a microcontroller and sends analog signal to the frequency inverter acting on the shutter rotation the control system has a user interface equipped with buttons which enable the selection of the desired rainfall pattern and the mode of operation manual precipitation intensity controlled by potentiometer or automatic precipitation intensity controlled by data on the memory card these features provide flexibility for the user in rainfall simulation tests meeting the most diverse demands in research the new control panel is composed of frequency inverter thermal relay contactor switch arduino mega 2560 microcontroller relay module 10 kω potentiometer micro sd card module and electronic circuit for user interface composed of buttons and other basic components the relay module is responsible for changing the simulation function from manual to automatic besides enabling the activation of the thermal relay contactor switch set that controls the motor pump activation after receiving the information through the arduino s pwm pulse width modulation analog port or through the potentiometer manual mode the frequency inverter is able to control the level of rotation of the device s shutter the microcontroller is responsible for controlling the relay module and frequency inverter according to the embedded program in c language whose algorithm is presented in fig 4 data of rainfall patterns are obtained by reading the micro sd card on which the corresponding files are recorded with text file extension txt therefore in each reading of the selected file the microcontroller sends the analog signal to the frequency inverter corresponding to the previously calibrated rotation values in the flowchart the routines associated with the variables i give access to the rainfall patterns recorded on the micro sd card in which the indices 1 2 3 and 4 correspond respectively to the advanced intermediate delayed and custom patterns as indicated the custom pattern is defined by the user and for testing purposes the inverted intermediate was used delays of 0 1 s correspond to the delays employed in the programming after choosing the routine the confirmation button is activated and after 1 min the arduino begins transmitting the information to the frequency inverter and starting the rainfall simulation which can have a maximum duration of 60 min t 60 the equation presented in fig 5 made it possible to calculate the rotation as a function of the desired pi enabling the construction of the rainfall patterns evaluated and the programming of the microcontroller of the new infiasper panel for evaluation of the device rainfalls of 40 min duration were simulated with maximum pi of 110 mm h 1 and total depth of 30 mm fig 6 these values represent the ip and the average depth of intense rainfall in the region of seropédica state of rio de janeiro brazil carvalho et al 2005 where the study was developed the minimum pi adopted is 20 0 mm h 1 and every minute it varies according to the rainfall pattern other pi and depths can be programmed and applied by the simulator by changing the application time and or the device s settings such as opening of the discs and water pressure in the nozzles according to mohamadi and kavian 2015 rainfall patterns of the types advanced intermediate inverted intermediate and delayed were programmed and new tests were conducted with the new panel with three repetitions for each of the aforementioned rainfall patterns in addition to the constant pi pattern in each test rainfall uniformity cu and water consumption cw were evaluated in addition to pi variability in the collection channel presented in the following classes pi 20 20 pi 25 25 pi 30 30 pi 35 35 pi 40 40 pi 45 45 pi 50 and pi greater than 50 mm h 1 in other words pi variability is presented in classes from 5 to 5 mm h 1 in order to check the operation of infiasper with the new panel in field conditions some tests were carried out in an area with soil classified as ultisol of medium texture with 540 150 and 310 g kg 1 of sand silt and clay respectively in the 0 27 cm layer almeida et al 2019 the soil layer from 0 to 20 cm was tilled with two operations with a disc harrow and one with a leveling harrow with the same programming used in laboratory the data were collected and compared with the results obtained in the same experimental area by almeida et al 2019 using the traditional infiasper and oliveira et al 2010 using an intermittent rainfall simulator according to meyer and harmon 1979 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation intensity water consumption and efficiency with the tested rotations 140 200 260 400 600 and 800 rpm and disc openings 33 44 56 and 60 mm the device showed pi ranging from 0 7 to 123 4 mm h 1 cw from 0 02 to 2 53 l min 1 and ew from 41 2 to 56 8 table 1 these results indicate the ability of the equipment to apply rains with different pi values which resembles natural events that normally do not present constant intensity these values indicate that infiasper is more efficient and requires lower water volume than the 13 simulators evaluated by irseloh et al 2013 which had ew ranging from 4 2 to 49 3 and cw from 0 48 to 3 24 l min 1 for fixed pi from 37 to 75 mm h 1 precipitation intensity increases with the reduction in shutter rotation and increase in disc opening according to equation 2 there is a polynomial relationship of two factors rotation and opening which had adjusted r2 of 0 985 with significance of the parameters p 0 01 the equation enables the estimation of pi for other values of opening opn and rotation rot within the range of evaluated values giving versatility to the simulator and facilitating the planning of new studies 2 pi 63 38 0 38 opn 0 1579 rot 0 03019 opn 2 0 0001361 rot 2 0 00169366 opn rot according to the preliminary results the 56 mm opening was adopted for the continuity of the tests since it provided on average higher values of ew and the desired range of pi 3 2 coefficient of uniformity and operating pressure for the different pressures evaluated the cu ranged from 54 2 to 81 4 with the highest values associated with the lowest rotations and consequently the highest intensities table 2 the decrease in uniformity with increasing rotation for a given opening of the discs is a consequence of the greater dispersion of water out of the runoff collector for rotations greater than 260 rpm cu is lower than 75 hence considered not suitable for rainfall simulators alves sobrinho et al 2002 however this fact does not indicate limitation of the device because in rainfalls simulated with variable intensity cu should be evaluated along the entire event and not at specific intensities among the simulators evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 cu values ranged from 60 6 to 97 8 operating with pi of 51 and 48 mm h 1 respectively these devices belong to the same category as infiasper but have a circular collector channel as the mean cu values were above 70 we chose to maintain the water pressure in the nozzles of 27 6 kpa in the sequence of the proposed evaluation tests given the wider range of pi values 3 3 kinetic energy and drop diameter for the different rotations of the discs d50 values ranged from 1 45 to 2 20 mm fig 7 and are consistent with those found by kavian et al 2019 and naves et al 2020 the simulators evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 showed d50 ranging from 0 5 to 5 0 mm it is worth mentioning that drop diameter is a function of several factors such as water pressure type of nozzle and fall height besides this the reduction in the average diameter of drops for rotation above 260 rpm occurs due to the impact between them caused by the drag in response to the increased turbulence in the water jet regardless of its value the most important point is that the device must be able to simulate rainfall with kinetic energy similar to that of natural rainfall for the rotations and other characteristics adopted the kinetic energy of the rainfall ranged from 17 82 to 23 73 j m 2 mm 1 simulating the natural rainfall from 73 82 to 88 03 table 3 3 4 development of control panel and evaluation of precipitation patterns from the proposed flowchart fig 4 a new electrical scheme was developed fig 8 enabling the construction of the new infiasper control panel fig 9 the activation buttons present in the original panel fig 3 were replaced by relays rl1 rl2 rl3 and rl4 which make it possible to choose the simulator s operation mode manual or automatic the activation of the motor pump and the activation and control of the shutter rotation from the electronic system controller composed of the microcontroller micro sd card and interface buttons menu and next leds test adv int del menu ok additionally an emergency button has been inserted for full interruption of inverter operation b0 during the tests no failures were identified in the configuration of the controller through the interface developed demonstrating its robustness and simplicity which is important for a rainfall simulator especially for operation under field conditions in addition there was adequate communication between the components and no failures were identified during the tests after conducting new tests we found that the spatial distribution of pi is similar between the rainfall patterns tested fig 10 and similar to that obtained for the device called tübingen evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 despite the variation of pi during the rainfall application cu values higher than 75 indicate adequacy of the device in the simulation of different rainfall patterns and are higher than those presented in table 2 for constant pi as the mean cw of all patterns was 1 0 l min 1 and the ew was 51 4 we found that infiasper with the proposed modifications is more efficient in water application than the models evaluated by iserloh et al 2013 which had efficiencies ranging from 4 2 to 49 3 from the characterization and evaluations carried out we can confirm the viability of the device in obtaining rainfall with regional hydrological characteristics according to carvalho et al 2005 3 5 field testing the simulator was evaluated under field conditions following the patterns of the fig 6 and the results are presented in the form of surface runoff and soil loss rate fig 11 runoff was monitored up to 50 min as it continues even after the end of the simulated rains the simulated rainfalls with constant and inverted intermediate patterns did not provide runoff and consequently soil losses in the intermediate and delayed patterns the pi peak occurs when the superficial layers of the soil are already wet which potentializes the runoff and erosion process mainly in the absence of land cover carvalho et al 2012 the soil losses obtained are different than those found in other studies carried out in the same experimental area but with simulated rainfall of different characteristics using the traditional infiasper almeida et al 2019 obtained a maximum soil loss rate of 9 5 g m 2h 1 after 25 min of rain with pi constant of 76 5 mm h 1 with an intermittent rainfall simulator oliveira et al 2010 found 36 2 66 3 and 86 2 g m 2h 1 of soil loss respectively for advanced intermediate and delayed patterns when simulated rains with the same characteristics were applied however the tests were carried out after preparing of soil towards the slope simulating critical runoff conditions which is why higher soil loss values were obtained the results presented in these articles are also associated with the form of rain application and the type of equipment used either by constant pi or by intermittent application situations that do not fully represent the natural rainfall conditions therefore it is possible to verify that the erosive process is consistent with the applied rain depending also on the land cover and soil properties and preparation even with the promising results using the new panel of infiasper measurements of soil and water losses from rainfall simulators should be carried out with caution and whenever possible compared to natural rain events 4 conclusions the installation of electronic components in the infiasper control panel makes it possible to vary shutter rotation during its operation according to previous programming enabling the simulation of rainfalls with different rainfall patterns rainfalls with pi peaks of 110 mm h 1 and duration of 40 min were adequately simulated by the device with uniformity above 75 it is possible to simulate other rainfall patterns with different pi and duration by changing the settings on the device s panel credit authorship contribution statement pietro menezes sanchez macedo conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing review

4683,three alternative groundwater flow models were evaluated for beijing plain china the first model am1 was constructed with the thin layer approach in which all 9 model layers including five aquifers separated by four aquitards are continuously present in the same model area the second model am2 was constructed with the quasi 3d approach in which the hydrogeological formations were classified into five aquifer units consisting of mixed permeable and semi permeable layers at different depth ranges the third model am3 was constructed with the true layer approach in which aquifers and aquitards were defined according to hydrostratigraphic properties and model layers are absent in the area where corresponding hydrogeological formations intersect bedrocks all 3 models were calibrated with the parameter optimization method under the steady state flow condition with the same hydrological stresses and observation data all three models fit to observations well with the similar calibration criteria values furthermore aic and bic information criteria could not distinguish three alternative models only kic could identify am3 as the best model major differences of the three alternative models were identified from a hydrogeological perspective the am1 model depicted an illusion through contour maps that groundwater was present everywhere in the deep aquifers the model computed larger vertical leakages because more abstraction rates were assigned improperly in deep aquifers the am2 model was able to compute regional groundwater balances and depicted spatial groundwater level variations however the am2 model computed longer groundwater travel times around the wellfield and should not be used for the delineation of the well field protection zones and contaminant transport simulation the am3 model could not only compute the regional groundwater balances and describe spatial groundwater distribution in deep confined aquifers but also delineate the capture zone of the wellfield it can therefore be used for simulating contaminant transport furthermore the am3 model is suitable to construct a coupled regional and local flow model for simulating a managed aquifer recharge scheme keywords beijing plain alluvial aquifers alternative groundwater models multi model comparisons hydrogeological interpretations model applications 1 introduction groundwater is the major source of the water supply in many mega cities especially in arid and semi arid regions howard and gelo 2001 vaux 2011 wheater et al 2010 as one of the biggest cities in the world with a population of more than 20 million beijing china has suffered from serious water shortages since the end of the last century wei 2005 the annual water consumption in the city is higher than 3 8 billion m3 yang and zehnder 2001 and more than 60 is supplied from groundwater exploitation beijing water authority 2019 because of the continuous drought since 1999 emergency well fields were constructed and operated leading to a significant increase in the groundwater pumping rate the over exploitation of groundwater has depleted the groundwater storage and caused a series of environmental problems the continuous decline of groundwater levels drying streams and drying shallow wells zhou et al 2013 moreover the city still suffers from water shortages and other environmental problems such as ecosystem degradation and land subsidence chen et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 to mitigate the groundwater depletion and improve the security of the urban water supply a managed aquifer recharge mar project in the northeast area of beijing was planned the chaobai river channel near the largest groundwater pumping site in beijing will be used to construct infiltration basins to replenish the shallow aquifer it is necessary to construct an effective groundwater flow model with respect to the mar site for assessing and optimizing the project however this is a challenge because of the complexity in hydrogeological conditions and human activities in the beijing plain furthermore the boundaries of the local model must be linked to the regional flow conditions a plausible solution is to construct a local groundwater model coupled with a regional model from which the boundary conditions of the local model can be obtained moreover coupling models of different spatial scales provides the two way iterative feedback between them which also helps to analyse the influence of water use change at local scale on the larger region uncertainties of groundwater modelling come from 1 conceptual hydrogeological framework 2 boundary conditions 3 hydrogeological parameters and 4 hydrological stresses a large amount of literature deals with uncertainties originated from hydrogeological parameters wu and zeng 2013 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 and monte carlo simulation alberti et al 2018 hassan et al 2009 moeck et al 2020 were mostly used methods for quantifying model uncertainties from uncertain parameters problems in the conceptualisation of groundwater systems was recognised some time ago bredehoeft 2005 in recent years development and assessment of alternative conceptual models have been received increasing attention enemark et al 2019 rojas et al 2008 developed a method by combining generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation and bayesian model averaging to quantify conceptual model uncertainties and illustrated this with a hypothetical case different classifications of the aquifer systems and boundary conditions can result in alternative conceptual models anderson et al 2015 beven 2018 it is preferred to have different ways of conceptualizing physical structures flow processes and spatial variabilities anderson et al 2015 neuman and wierenga 2003 to reduce the model uncertainty the physical structures could be conceptualized in different levels of complexity and with alternative interpretations aphale and tonjes 2017 elshall and tsai 2014 foglia et al 2013 flow processes especially groundwater recharge or boundary conditions can also be determined and depicted by different approaches ye et al 2010 spatial variabilities can be conceptualized differently by considering the level of complexity foglia et al 2007 schöniger et al 2014 conceptual models could be evaluated by different criteria and rank methods the selection of models is generally guided by three principles parsimony maximum likelihood and hydrologic consistency the parsimony principle favours model simplicity whereas the maximum likelihood principle favours models having a better fit with the observations enemark et al 2019 the hydrologic consistency principle is applied by researchers to evaluate the suitability of the model structures for the modelling objectives martinez and gupta 2011 shafii and tolson 2015 the models can be ranked by different techniques the most commonly used techniques are information criteria ic poeter and hill 2007 and generalized likelihood uncertain estimation glue beven and binley 1992 the ic is to assess the bias of the models to the observations and the model complexity akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 1973 corrected aic aicc sugiura 1978 bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and kashyap information criterion kic kashyap 1982 are mostly used in the model ranking a model with lower aic aicc bic and kic is preferred emiliano et al 2014 in this study we assessed three alternative models of simulating regional groundwater flow in the beijing plain china the objectives of the study were to compare three alternative models from both the model calibration perspective and hydrogeological perspective although all three models were calibrated to the observed groundwater heads equally well they differ largely in estimating vertical leakages cross the model layers representing spatial distribution of groundwater resources and delineating the capture zone of the wellfield the results from this study enrich the literature on real world case studies for alternative groundwater model development and assessment they also provide guidelines for developing a proper conceptual model for a specific groundwater resources management objective 2 material and methods 2 1 study area beijing city 39 28 41 05 n 115 25 117 30 e is located in the north eastern part of china fig 1 a surrounded by hebei province and tianjin city the total area of beijing is 16 800 km2 with 62 mountainous area and 38 plain area with the temperate monsoon climate summer is hot and humid while winter is cold and dry the average annual temperature is 12 c the average annual precipitation and open pan water evaporation are 593 mm and 1728 mm respectively the temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven on average 75 of rainfall occurs in the rainy season from june to september there are two main rivers in the plain yongding river and chaobai river which together count for more than 90 of the surface runoff in the area zhou et al 2012 in geology the beijing plain consists of several alluvial fans and plains formed by the two main rivers and several small streams the thickness of the quaternary deposits varies from 30 m to more than 500 m zhang et al 2008 the plain is surrounded by mountains on the west and north and has the characteristic of a piedmont plain as shown in fig 1b in each river basin the aquifer system transits from an unconfined single layer aquifer with gravel sands near the mountain front to semi confined multi layer aquifers with fine sands and clays in the lowland area groundwater is recharged from several sources precipitation infiltration into the top aquifer accounts for more than half of the total groundwater recharge in the plain area other sources include surface water leakage lateral flow from the mountain area irrigation return flow in the suburb area and pipe leakage in the urban area there are also several ways of groundwater discharge including evapotranspiration drainage along lower streams and abstraction for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes 2 2 three alternative models alternative models can be formed either by different hydrostratigraphic interpretations of geological formations enemark et al 2019 or by different discretisation of numerical model layers rojas et al 2008 zhou and herath 2017 hydrostratigraphic classifications of borehole logs are the basis for developing alternative models a regional groundwater flow model of the beijing plain was developed and used for scenario analysis of sustainable groundwater resources development zhou et al 2012 the alluvial aquifer system was classified into 5 aquifers separated by 4 aquitards based on limited borehole logs from about 500 boreholes nine model layers were used to represent every aquifer and aquitard in the areas where some aquifer or aquitard is absent a thin model layer extends this approach is termed as the thin layer approach and the resulting numerical model is named the first alternative model am1 in the am1 model all model layers continuously present in the same model area in this study a total of more than 1800 well documented borehole logs were collected and analysed most boreholes were drilled in the last 10 years for implementing a national groundwater monitoring programme fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of geological boreholes in the beijing plain boreholes that penetrate the bedrocks were used to determine the basement elevation of the aquifer system deep boreholes with a depth of more than 200 m were used as primary boreholes for hydrostratigraphic classifications the quaternary sediments were classified into 33 soil types with different properties in the grain size roundness and sorting these 33 soil types were further categorized into eight hydrogeological formations by merging the soil types with similar permeability for each borehole log adjacent sandy formations with high permeability were grouped as aquifers and those clayey sediments including discontinuous find sands with lower permeability were grouped as aquitards for the deepest borehole logs five aquifers alternating with four aquitards were identified two typical primary borehole profiles are displayed in fig 2b by projecting the hydrostratigraphic classifications of the borehole data in the plain three hydrogeological zones can be distinguished the single layer zone the transition zone and the multi layered zone as is shown in fig 2a the single layer zone exists at the edge of the west and north plain the aquifer in this zone exists in the entire plain and consists of mainly poorly sorted cobbles and gravels with very high permeability the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of this aquifer can be up to 200 m d the multi layered zone covers a large part of plain area alternating permeable and semi permeable formations were grouped into five aquifers and separated by four aquitards the aquifers consist of multiple medium to coarse sand layers and the aquitards consist of multiple silt and clayey sand layers a narrow belt of the transition zone exists between the single layer and multi layered zones the transition zone contains 2 3 aquifers varying spatially deposits gradually change from gravels to a mixture of sands and gravels clayey sand and silt layers also exist forming several continuous aquifers and aquitards conventionally the aquifer systems were distinguished into four aquifer groups according to their depths for groundwater resources development monitoring and management in the beijing plain in general the first aquifer group is the phreatic aquifer in the single layer zone and the semi confined aquifers less than 50 m below the surface in other zones the second third and fourth aquifer groups are the semi confined aquifers in the depth of 50 100 m 100 180 m 180 300 m and deeper than 300 m below the ground surface in this study a fifth aquifer group was defined below the depth of 400 m in agreement with the hydrostratigraphic classifications fig 3 a groundwater abstractions are mainly for agricultural use in the first aquifer group for domestic water supply in the second and third aquifer groups and for industrial water supply in the fourth and fifth aquifer groups a groundwater model consisting of five model layers corresponding to these five aquifer groups was developed as the second alternative model named as am2 the objective of the am2 model is to test whether the conventional conceptualisation of the aquifer systems is sufficient for the purposes of groundwater resources management and monitoring the physical structure of the am 2 model is shown in fig 3b the computational cost of am2 is the lowest because the numbers of model layers and active cells are the smallest among the three models a third alternative conceptualisation of the hydrostratigraphic classifications is shown in fig 3c in the deepest plain area the aquifer systems consist of five aquifers separated by four aquitards the deeper aquifers and aquitards are truncated with the bedrock towards the mountains in the numerical model discretisation a model layer terminates in the area where the representing aquifer or aquitard intersects with bedrock this approach is termed as the true layer approach and the resulting numerical model is the third alternative model am3 in the am3 model model layers are absent in the area where the corresponding aquifer and or aquitards are absent therefore the model areas differ in different model layers the top and bottom elevations of the model are the same for three alternative models the top elevation was taken from the dem model of 90 m resolution the bottom elevation was the basement of the bedrock and which was treated as a no flow boundary for all models the top and bottom elevations of other model layers were interpolated from borehole log classifications there are two different types of lateral boundary conditions for models the plain is receiving lateral inflow from the mountain area in the west and north which was estimated from previous hydrogeological surveys and was treated as a specified flow boundary in this study the other sides is the administrative boundary of beijing and simulated as head dependent flow boundaries all models consist of similar parameter zones however the parameterization of am2 is different from the am1 and am3 models the horizontal kh and vertical kv hydraulic conductivity parameter zones for am1 and am3 were actual values determined by the lithological types combined with structural geological maps initial values were obtained by the results of pumping tests and empirical values however model layers in the am2 model consist of the mixed aquifer and aquitard the vertical hydraulic conductivity values were obtained by calculating an equivalent hydraulic conductivity value as the harmonic mean of the vertical hydraulic conductive values of the aquifer and aquitard for each parameter zone beijing plain went through a long term relatively wet period from 1985 to 1998 14 years and observed monthly groundwater levels varied in stationary state groundwater flow can be considered to be in a steady state condition in this period in the year of 1995 a groundwater resources assessment project was carried out in the beijing plain groundwater recharges and discharges were estimated and were made available for the construction of the steady state groundwater flow models hydrological stresses and their simulations were kept the same for all three models table 1 the groundwater modelling system gms10 4 aquaveo 2017 was used to create the conceptual model of inflow and outflow components and then converted to modflow packages modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 for flow simulation recharge from precipitation infiltration was estimated for different zones based on spatial distribution of precipitations and infiltration coefficients irrigation return flow and pipe leakage were specified for different districts as areal recharge all areal recharges were converted to modflow recharge package lateral inflow coming from the mountain area was defined as specified flow boundary and was simulated with modflow well package injection rates rivers and canals were delineated and conceptualized as a specified inflow source and were also simulated with modflow well package injection rates evapotranspiration in the shallow groundwater areas was simulated with modflow evt package groundwater abstractions were categorised as domestic water supply wells agricultural wells and industrial wells agricultural wells were pumping groundwater in the shallow aquifer located in the top modelling layer industrial wells were pumping groundwater in deeper aquifers there are two different types of domestic water supply wells distributed wells operated in small towns and centralized wells operated by drinking water supply companies all groundwater abstractions were merged in modflow well package for the simulation lateral flow from the administrative boundary was defined as head dependant flow boundary and simulated with modflow general head boundary package in total there are 202 observation wells in the plain with different depths most of the observation wells penetrate the shallow aquifers all the observation wells were assigned to the corresponding model layers according to their depths 2 3 set up of the numerical models the first model layer covers the same model area for all three models the finite difference grid for modflow model consists of 116 rows and 138 columns with a regular cell size of 1000 m 1000 m the am1 model consists of 9 model layers corresponding to 5 aquifers and 4 aquitards all 9 model layers cover the same model area since a thin model layer was extended to the same model boundary in areas where aquifer or aquitard is absent the am2 model consists of 5 model layers corresponding to five aquifer groups the am3 model consists of 9 model layers but the model layer stops in areas where aquifer or aquitard is absent the gms utility of truncation was used to cut off model areas with the basement elevation the grid cells outside the aquifer or aquitard areas were made inactive fig 4 shows the model grid in the same row for three models and their differences can be clearly seen the same modflow packages were used for all three models table 1 the layer property package lpf was used to represent hydraulic properties of the aquifers and aquitards the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values were specified for every parameter zone input data for modflow packages were converted from gms conceptual model coverages systematically 2 4 model calibration and sensitivity analysis all three models were calibrated to observed groundwater heads in 202 observation wells firstly manual calibration with the traditional trial and error method was applied hydraulic conductivities groundwater recharge and pumping depth of the distributed water supply wells were adjusted to get a better fit to observed groundwater heads pest doherty 2010 was then applied to optimize the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities and estimate the parameter sensitivities of the three models important parameters and observations can be identified by statistics such as composite scaled sensitivity css and leverage css is calculated as 1 css j j 1 n dss ij 2 n where j denotes the j th parameter in the model n is the total number of observations dss ij is the dimensionless scaled sensitivity which is calculated as 2 dss ij ω i 1 2 b j y i b j where ω i is the weight for observation i in this case all the observations have equivalent weight as 1 b j is the value of parameter j y i b i is the derivative of the simulated value of observation y i with respect to parameter b j a larger absolute dss value indicates that the parameter b j is more sensitive to the estimation of observation y i the importance of observations to parameter estimation can be evaluated with the leverage of the observations calculated as 3 l i x i t x t ω x 1 x i where x is a sensitivity matrix with elements equal to y i b i and x i is the ith row of x ω is the weight matrix on observations it reflects the correlation between the parameters and observations the range of leverage is from 0 to 1 the closer it is to 1 the higher the observation contributes to the parameter estimation 2 5 multi model analysis the three alternative models were evaluated using information criteria including the aic aicc bic and kic akaike information criteria aic and aicc are defined as 4 aic n ln σ 2 2 k 5 aicc n ln σ 2 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 6 σ 2 swsr n 7 swsr i 1 n ω i y i y i b 2 where k npe 1 npe is the number of process model parameters σ2 is the mean square error swsr is the sum of weighted squared residuals y i b is model calculated groundwater heads using calibrated parameter group b bayesian information criterion is defined as 8 bic n ln σ 2 k ln n kashyap information criterion is defined as schenk et al 2018 9 kic n ln σ 2 k 1 ln 2 π ln x t ω x where x is the sensitivity matrix the model with smaller aic aicc bic and kic values is considered the better model ucode poeter et al 2014 was used to compute akaike bayesian kashyap information criteria 2 6 delineation of wellfield capture zone one of the main objectives of applying a regional groundwater flow model is to manage and protect well fields for drinking water supply delineation of the capture zone of a well field is very important for the protection of potable groundwater resources one of the largest well fields in beijing plain no 8 well field is located in the chaobai river alluvial fan in the northeast model area the well field consists of pumping wells abstracting a total of 449 530 m3 day according to pumping well depths abstraction rates were assigned in the first third and fifth model layers in the am1 model first and second model layers in the am2 model and the first and third model layers in the am3 model one hundred particles were placed evenly in a circle around every well block at different model layers and tracked backwards until arriving at recharge areas the area encircled by all pathlines forms the capture area modpath pollock 1994 was used to compute pathlines based on the computed cell by cell flow components from modflow model with the endpoint mode of the modpath simulation water particles entering the abstraction well cells can be traced backward until the points of recharge the capture zones of the large well field in the model domain can be defined by the final locations of these water particles with the pathline mode of the modpath simulation groundwater traveling time can be obtained for each particle and cumulative groundwater travel time of all particles can be calculated for a well field 3 results 3 1 results of model calibration and sensitivity analysis fig 5 compares the model calibration of the three alternative models in general the performance of the three models is equally good the mean differences between the simulated and observed groundwater levels for am1 am2 and am3 are 0 80 1 82 m and 2 22 m respectively am2 and am3 slightly underestimated groundwater levels on average which can be seen from the greater number of points below the diagonal line in the scatter plots the root means square errors are 7 02 6 43 and 6 37 respectively for three models the coefficients of determination for the three models are 0 790 0 832 and 0 838 respectively the contour maps of groundwater levels in five aquifers from the three models are presented in fig 6 there are distinct differences between contour maps firstly only the extent of the first aquifer is the same for all the models however many dry model cells occur in am1 because am1 assumed a small thickness of the first aquifer so that the computed groundwater levels were below the bottom of the aquifer in the yongding river alluvial fan secondly the aquifer area becomes smaller with the increase of depth in the am2 and am3 models while the aquifer area remains the same in the am1 model both am2 and am3 follow the actual extent of the aquifers so that the aquifer seams out towards the mountain front however the am1 model used a thin layer approach so that the modelled aquifers extend to the same boundary with a very small thickness 1 0 m in the area where the aquifers are absent the am1 model gives a false illusion that deep groundwater continuously presents everywhere in all aquifers computed groundwater balance components were checked table 2 and compared with the groundwater resources assessment of beijing plain in 1995 the total volume of the inflow and the outflow of the three alternative models are approximately the same the areal recharge and abstraction are the same for all models small differences exist in the water exchange through ghb boundaries and evapotranspiration rate which are caused by differences in computed groundwater levels from the three models it shows that all three models can compute the same regional groundwater balance under steady state conditions fig 7 shows the composite scaled sensitivity css of parameter zones with the 30 most sensitive parameters large differences can be observed in most of the sensitive hydraulic conductivities from the three models the most sensitive 30 parameters in the am1 model include horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aquifer layers 3 1 5 7 and 9 and several vertical hydraulic conductivities in aquitard layers 2 6 4 and 8 sensitive parameters in the am2 model consist of mostly horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aquifer layers 1 and 3 and some vertical hydraulic conductivities in aquitard layers 4 and 6 several vertical hydraulic conductivities are also sensitive the most sensitive hydraulic conductivities in the am3 model consist of mostly horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aquifer layer1 a few in layer 3 plus some vertical hydraulic conductivities in aquitard layer 2 in all models a number of vertical hydraulic conductivity parameters in the aquitards are sensitive indicating that leakages through aquitards are important flow components for deep semi confined aquifers fig 8 a shows 50 observations with the highest leverage lij values for the three models all observations are important for the calibration of hydraulic conductivity parameter values however most important observations are found in the upper 3 aquifers in the am2 and am3 models while observations in deep aquifers are also important for the am1 model fig 8a furthermore the observations with high leverage have different spatial distributions in the three models fig 8b the pattern of spatial distribution and locations of aquifers of most important observations are similar in the am2 and am3 models the major difference in am1 is that the most important observations in the middle model area are located in deeper semi confined aquifers 4 and 5 corresponding to the deepest cone of depression fig 8b 3 2 results of multi model analysis table 3 presents the information criteria calculated by ucode 2014 for the three models in general there is no significant difference in aic aicc and bic values from the models however the kic value from the am3 model is much smaller than the am1 and am2 models all models are informative for computing groundwater levels at locations of observation wells 3 3 computation of travel times and delineation of the capture zone fig 9 presents capture zones delineated by the alternative models the shape of the capture zone indicates clearly the sources of water to the wells groundwater to the wells located at the top unconfined aquifer mainly comes from river leakage and areal recharge while groundwater flowing to the wells located in the semi confined aquifer comes from leakage and boundary inflow large differences can be observed from capture zones delineated by the three models the capture areas of the wells in the first aquifer delineated by the am1 am2 and am3 models are about 43 1 km2 51 7 km2 and 65 1 km2 respectively the maximum areas of the capture zone for the well field delineated by am1 am2 and am3 are about 334 7 km2 284 6 km2 and 291 0 km2 respectively the am1 model computed a small capture zone in the first aquifer because a small abstraction rate was assigned in this aquifer however the am1 model computed the largest capture zone of the wellfield since large amount of abstractions were assigned in the deep aquifers the cumulative travel time distribution is usually used as an indicator for water quality of the well field moel et al 2006 particle travel times in fig 9 were analysed statistically and cumulative travel time distributions were plotted in fig 10 the cumulative travel time curves of the am1 and am3 models are similar while the curve of am2 shows a significant delay effect the mean travel times of all water particles from recharge areas to arrive at the well fields were about 33 years 72 years and 39 years respectively estimated from the am1 am2 and am3 models the am2 model computed longer travel times for shorter pathlines in aquifer 1 4 discussion 4 1 statistical model comparisons the conventional model calibration was evaluated using statistical criteria such as mean residual errors root mean squared errors and coefficient determination information criteria were introduced in recent years for multi model comparisons the commonly used information criteria are aic aicc bic and kic from the model calibration statistics all 3 models could fit to observed groundwater levels with very small differences am1 model is less biased with a small mean residual error but slightly larger root mean squared error am2 and am3 perform equally well with smaller root mean squared errors but lager mean residual errors indicating underestimation of groundwater levels the information criteria not only consider the squared residual errors but also the trade off between the number of observed data and number of parameters estimated the parametrisation for a proper model requires that the number of model parameters should be smaller than the number of observations hill and tiedeman 2007 in all three alternative models for the beijing plain the number of parameters optimised by ucode is much smaller than the number of observations the same number of observations were used for computing information criteria with more less the same number of parameters therefore larger values in aic aicc and bic from am1 model are mainly attributed to larger mean squared residual errors there are no differences in these values between the am2 and am3 models since their mean squared residual errors are almost the same a number of researchers are in favour of using kic for multi model comparison schenk et al 2018 since kic is the only criterion including the fisher information term which considers the quality of observations and parameter estimates ye et al 2008 the kic value of the am3 model is less than half of those of the am1 and am2 models which is caused by the fisher information term therefore am3 can be considered as a relatively better model according to kic criterion 4 2 hydrogeological interpretations the three alternative models for the beijing plain differ largely on the conceptualization of aquifers and aquitards and their areal extents since the bedrock of the beijing plain undulates and uplifts towards the mountain front the area extents of aquifers and aquitards differ the am1 model used the same model area for 9 model layers and assumed a thin model layer extending to the whole model area when the actual aquifers and aquitards are absent the am2 and am3 models used the actual extent of hydrogeological units so that the model areas are different for each model layer unlike the am3 model that classifies the stratigraphic formations into five aquifers separated by 4 aquitards the am2 model groups the stratigraphic formations into 5 aquifer units therefore differences in vertical discretisation may result in differences in vertical leakages table 4 presents the results of computed vertical flow from a top model layer to an adjacent lower model layer as vertical leakage am2 and am3 computed similar downward leakage since they used the same hydrostratigraphic classifications downward leakages computed from the am1 model are in general larger than the am2 and am3 models the hydrostratigraphic classifications in the am1 model is different from other 2 models the am1 model assumed a thin top unconfined aquifer less than 50 m and more abstractions were located in aquifers 2 3 and 4 since groundwater in the deeper semi confined aquifer originates only from vertical leakage from top aquifers larger groundwater abstractions in deeper aquifers were fed by larger leakages in am1 model hydrogeologically the am1 model provided an illusion that deep groundwater presents everywhere in the beijing plain and computed a large amount of vertical leakage due to inaccurate vertical classification of aquifers and aquitards based on limited borehole data the am2 and am3 models improved vertical classifications of hydrostratigraphic formations with much more borehole data and placed abstraction wells in proper aquifers these two models conceptually represent more realistically hydrogeological structures in the beijing plain from groundwater resources management and monitoring perspectives the am2 model can perform equally well compared to the am3 model since both models produced similar contour maps of groundwater levels fig 6 computed the same regional water balance table 2 and vertical leakage table 4 however the am2 model has a larger aquifer thickness layer 1 and 2 combined comparing to am3 and therefore larger transmissivity values it computed a flatter hydraulic gradient around the wellfield compared to the am3 model concerning the calculation of the groundwater travel times particles were placed in a circle around the well at the middle of the aquifer height travel distances from the well location to surface recharge area are also longer thus the am2 model should not be used to compute travel time and delineate the capture zone due to the shortcomings in the conceptual model structure however from the principle of parsimony hill and tiedeman 2007 the am2 model can be considered for groundwater resources management and monitoring in the beijing plain since the model has a simpler structure the am3 model can adequately represent vertical flow velocities through the aquitards which are required to delineate wellfield protection areas and simulate contaminant plume movement for these purposes the am3 model must be used 4 3 perspective for further applications another important objective of groundwater modelling in the beijing plain is to investigate the feasibility of using managed aquifer recharge mar as a management tool to sustain groundwater resources development especially for drinking water supply potential sites for mar are alluvial fans in the yongding river and chaobai river catchments for this purpose a locally refined groundwater model in which the model cell size is much smaller than the infiltration pond should be used to simulate the mar scheme the boundaries of the local model should be linked to the regional model so that interactions between the local and regional models are assured the methods for coupling regional and local models are the newly developed local grid refinement lgr method mehl and hill 2006 and the unstructured grid method usg method panday et al 2013 modflow lgr can simulate the groundwater flow in a block shaped high resolution local model a child model coupled with the coarser regional model a mother model the child model and the mother model can be simultaneously run for the coupled interactions the modflow usg is flexible to refine grids for a local area and more model layers to better represent the mar scheme for both methods a functional regional model is required the regional model am3 constructed with true layer approach is suitable for simulating the mar scheme with the coupled regional and local models on going research on testing modflow lgr and modflow usg for the design and simulation of the mar scheme in the chaobai river catchment is undertaken with the am3 model however detailed hydrogeological data are necessary 5 conclusions three alternative regional groundwater flow models for the beijing plain were evaluated in this study the first alternative model am1 was constructed with the thin layer approach so that all model layers are continuously distributed in the same model area the am2 model was constructed by a quasi 3d approach which neglected the existence of aquitards in the system and conceptualized the groundwater system as five continuous aquifers the am3 model was constructed with the true layer approach so that aquifers and aquitards are separated and model layers are absent in the area where corresponding hydrogeological units intersect bedrock the parameter optimization method was used to optimize hydraulic conductivity values for all models and the multi model analysis was used to compare the relative performance of the three models the differences in depicting contour maps computing water balance and leakages delineating capture zones together with travel times were analysed statistically the am1 model can fit observations equally well and produce similar information criteria values compared to the am2 and am3 models the major deficits of the am1 model include a fictitious presence of deep aquifers with thin model layers b a very thin top unconfined aquifer and c improper allocations of more abstractions in deeper aquifers due to these deficits the am1 model depicts false contour maps in deep aquifers computes larger vertical leakages and delineates a smaller capture area in the top aquifer the am2 model produces satisfactory model calibration statistics and provides similar information criteria values the am2 model can also compute regional groundwater balances and vertical leakages however the am2 model computes longer travel times around the wellfield since it assumes much thicker aquifers and neglects aquitards therefore the am2 model can be used for groundwater resources management and monitoring purposes but is inadequate to perform particle tracking and contaminant transport simulations am3 is a more realistic groundwater model for the alluvial aquifer system in beijing plain am3 gives the smallest root mean squared error for the model calibration and a much smaller kic value for information model comparison hydrogeologically am3 can fulfil all tasks of groundwater resources management monitoring and wellfield capture zone delineation am3 is suitable for contaminant transport simulation and simulation of managed aquifer recharge in future studies in conclusion statistical and information criteria alone might not be sufficient to identify best alternative groundwater models due to the limitation of observations hydrogeological interpretation is equally important for assessing multiple alternative models a simplified quasi 3d model may be sufficient for regional groundwater resources planning and management but a multiple aquifer aquitard conceptual model is more accurate to perform particle tracking and contaminant transport simulations credit authorship contribution statement sida liu methodology software validation

4683,three alternative groundwater flow models were evaluated for beijing plain china the first model am1 was constructed with the thin layer approach in which all 9 model layers including five aquifers separated by four aquitards are continuously present in the same model area the second model am2 was constructed with the quasi 3d approach in which the hydrogeological formations were classified into five aquifer units consisting of mixed permeable and semi permeable layers at different depth ranges the third model am3 was constructed with the true layer approach in which aquifers and aquitards were defined according to hydrostratigraphic properties and model layers are absent in the area where corresponding hydrogeological formations intersect bedrocks all 3 models were calibrated with the parameter optimization method under the steady state flow condition with the same hydrological stresses and observation data all three models fit to observations well with the similar calibration criteria values furthermore aic and bic information criteria could not distinguish three alternative models only kic could identify am3 as the best model major differences of the three alternative models were identified from a hydrogeological perspective the am1 model depicted an illusion through contour maps that groundwater was present everywhere in the deep aquifers the model computed larger vertical leakages because more abstraction rates were assigned improperly in deep aquifers the am2 model was able to compute regional groundwater balances and depicted spatial groundwater level variations however the am2 model computed longer groundwater travel times around the wellfield and should not be used for the delineation of the well field protection zones and contaminant transport simulation the am3 model could not only compute the regional groundwater balances and describe spatial groundwater distribution in deep confined aquifers but also delineate the capture zone of the wellfield it can therefore be used for simulating contaminant transport furthermore the am3 model is suitable to construct a coupled regional and local flow model for simulating a managed aquifer recharge scheme keywords beijing plain alluvial aquifers alternative groundwater models multi model comparisons hydrogeological interpretations model applications 1 introduction groundwater is the major source of the water supply in many mega cities especially in arid and semi arid regions howard and gelo 2001 vaux 2011 wheater et al 2010 as one of the biggest cities in the world with a population of more than 20 million beijing china has suffered from serious water shortages since the end of the last century wei 2005 the annual water consumption in the city is higher than 3 8 billion m3 yang and zehnder 2001 and more than 60 is supplied from groundwater exploitation beijing water authority 2019 because of the continuous drought since 1999 emergency well fields were constructed and operated leading to a significant increase in the groundwater pumping rate the over exploitation of groundwater has depleted the groundwater storage and caused a series of environmental problems the continuous decline of groundwater levels drying streams and drying shallow wells zhou et al 2013 moreover the city still suffers from water shortages and other environmental problems such as ecosystem degradation and land subsidence chen et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 to mitigate the groundwater depletion and improve the security of the urban water supply a managed aquifer recharge mar project in the northeast area of beijing was planned the chaobai river channel near the largest groundwater pumping site in beijing will be used to construct infiltration basins to replenish the shallow aquifer it is necessary to construct an effective groundwater flow model with respect to the mar site for assessing and optimizing the project however this is a challenge because of the complexity in hydrogeological conditions and human activities in the beijing plain furthermore the boundaries of the local model must be linked to the regional flow conditions a plausible solution is to construct a local groundwater model coupled with a regional model from which the boundary conditions of the local model can be obtained moreover coupling models of different spatial scales provides the two way iterative feedback between them which also helps to analyse the influence of water use change at local scale on the larger region uncertainties of groundwater modelling come from 1 conceptual hydrogeological framework 2 boundary conditions 3 hydrogeological parameters and 4 hydrological stresses a large amount of literature deals with uncertainties originated from hydrogeological parameters wu and zeng 2013 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 and monte carlo simulation alberti et al 2018 hassan et al 2009 moeck et al 2020 were mostly used methods for quantifying model uncertainties from uncertain parameters problems in the conceptualisation of groundwater systems was recognised some time ago bredehoeft 2005 in recent years development and assessment of alternative conceptual models have been received increasing attention enemark et al 2019 rojas et al 2008 developed a method by combining generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation and bayesian model averaging to quantify conceptual model uncertainties and illustrated this with a hypothetical case different classifications of the aquifer systems and boundary conditions can result in alternative conceptual models anderson et al 2015 beven 2018 it is preferred to have different ways of conceptualizing physical structures flow processes and spatial variabilities anderson et al 2015 neuman and wierenga 2003 to reduce the model uncertainty the physical structures could be conceptualized in different levels of complexity and with alternative interpretations aphale and tonjes 2017 elshall and tsai 2014 foglia et al 2013 flow processes especially groundwater recharge or boundary conditions can also be determined and depicted by different approaches ye et al 2010 spatial variabilities can be conceptualized differently by considering the level of complexity foglia et al 2007 schöniger et al 2014 conceptual models could be evaluated by different criteria and rank methods the selection of models is generally guided by three principles parsimony maximum likelihood and hydrologic consistency the parsimony principle favours model simplicity whereas the maximum likelihood principle favours models having a better fit with the observations enemark et al 2019 the hydrologic consistency principle is applied by researchers to evaluate the suitability of the model structures for the modelling objectives martinez and gupta 2011 shafii and tolson 2015 the models can be ranked by different techniques the most commonly used techniques are information criteria ic poeter and hill 2007 and generalized likelihood uncertain estimation glue beven and binley 1992 the ic is to assess the bias of the models to the observations and the model complexity akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 1973 corrected aic aicc sugiura 1978 bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and kashyap information criterion kic kashyap 1982 are mostly used in the model ranking a model with lower aic aicc bic and kic is preferred emiliano et al 2014 in this study we assessed three alternative models of simulating regional groundwater flow in the beijing plain china the objectives of the study were to compare three alternative models from both the model calibration perspective and hydrogeological perspective although all three models were calibrated to the observed groundwater heads equally well they differ largely in estimating vertical leakages cross the model layers representing spatial distribution of groundwater resources and delineating the capture zone of the wellfield the results from this study enrich the literature on real world case studies for alternative groundwater model development and assessment they also provide guidelines for developing a proper conceptual model for a specific groundwater resources management objective 2 material and methods 2 1 study area beijing city 39 28 41 05 n 115 25 117 30 e is located in the north eastern part of china fig 1 a surrounded by hebei province and tianjin city the total area of beijing is 16 800 km2 with 62 mountainous area and 38 plain area with the temperate monsoon climate summer is hot and humid while winter is cold and dry the average annual temperature is 12 c the average annual precipitation and open pan water evaporation are 593 mm and 1728 mm respectively the temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven on average 75 of rainfall occurs in the rainy season from june to september there are two main rivers in the plain yongding river and chaobai river which together count for more than 90 of the surface runoff in the area zhou et al 2012 in geology the beijing plain consists of several alluvial fans and plains formed by the two main rivers and several small streams the thickness of the quaternary deposits varies from 30 m to more than 500 m zhang et al 2008 the plain is surrounded by mountains on the west and north and has the characteristic of a piedmont plain as shown in fig 1b in each river basin the aquifer system transits from an unconfined single layer aquifer with gravel sands near the mountain front to semi confined multi layer aquifers with fine sands and clays in the lowland area groundwater is recharged from several sources precipitation infiltration into the top aquifer accounts for more than half of the total groundwater recharge in the plain area other sources include surface water leakage lateral flow from the mountain area irrigation return flow in the suburb area and pipe leakage in the urban area there are also several ways of groundwater discharge including evapotranspiration drainage along lower streams and abstraction for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes 2 2 three alternative models alternative models can be formed either by different hydrostratigraphic interpretations of geological formations enemark et al 2019 or by different discretisation of numerical model layers rojas et al 2008 zhou and herath 2017 hydrostratigraphic classifications of borehole logs are the basis for developing alternative models a regional groundwater flow model of the beijing plain was developed and used for scenario analysis of sustainable groundwater resources development zhou et al 2012 the alluvial aquifer system was classified into 5 aquifers separated by 4 aquitards based on limited borehole logs from about 500 boreholes nine model layers were used to represent every aquifer and aquitard in the areas where some aquifer or aquitard is absent a thin model layer extends this approach is termed as the thin layer approach and the resulting numerical model is named the first alternative model am1 in the am1 model all model layers continuously present in the same model area in this study a total of more than 1800 well documented borehole logs were collected and analysed most boreholes were drilled in the last 10 years for implementing a national groundwater monitoring programme fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of geological boreholes in the beijing plain boreholes that penetrate the bedrocks were used to determine the basement elevation of the aquifer system deep boreholes with a depth of more than 200 m were used as primary boreholes for hydrostratigraphic classifications the quaternary sediments were classified into 33 soil types with different properties in the grain size roundness and sorting these 33 soil types were further categorized into eight hydrogeological formations by merging the soil types with similar permeability for each borehole log adjacent sandy formations with high permeability were grouped as aquifers and those clayey sediments including discontinuous find sands with lower permeability were grouped as aquitards for the deepest borehole logs five aquifers alternating with four aquitards were identified two typical primary borehole profiles are displayed in fig 2b by projecting the hydrostratigraphic classifications of the borehole data in the plain three hydrogeological zones can be distinguished the single layer zone the transition zone and the multi layered zone as is shown in fig 2a the single layer zone exists at the edge of the west and north plain the aquifer in this zone exists in the entire plain and consists of mainly poorly sorted cobbles and gravels with very high permeability the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of this aquifer can be up to 200 m d the multi layered zone covers a large part of plain area alternating permeable and semi permeable formations were grouped into five aquifers and separated by four aquitards the aquifers consist of multiple medium to coarse sand layers and the aquitards consist of multiple silt and clayey sand layers a narrow belt of the transition zone exists between the single layer and multi layered zones the transition zone contains 2 3 aquifers varying spatially deposits gradually change from gravels to a mixture of sands and gravels clayey sand and silt layers also exist forming several continuous aquifers and aquitards conventionally the aquifer systems were distinguished into four aquifer groups according to their depths for groundwater resources development monitoring and management in the beijing plain in general the first aquifer group is the phreatic aquifer in the single layer zone and the semi confined aquifers less than 50 m below the surface in other zones the second third and fourth aquifer groups are the semi confined aquifers in the depth of 50 100 m 100 180 m 180 300 m and deeper than 300 m below the ground surface in this study a fifth aquifer group was defined below the depth of 400 m in agreement with the hydrostratigraphic classifications fig 3 a groundwater abstractions are mainly for agricultural use in the first aquifer group for domestic water supply in the second and third aquifer groups and for industrial water supply in the fourth and fifth aquifer groups a groundwater model consisting of five model layers corresponding to these five aquifer groups was developed as the second alternative model named as am2 the objective of the am2 model is to test whether the conventional conceptualisation of the aquifer systems is sufficient for the purposes of groundwater resources management and monitoring the physical structure of the am 2 model is shown in fig 3b the computational cost of am2 is the lowest because the numbers of model layers and active cells are the smallest among the three models a third alternative conceptualisation of the hydrostratigraphic classifications is shown in fig 3c in the deepest plain area the aquifer systems consist of five aquifers separated by four aquitards the deeper aquifers and aquitards are truncated with the bedrock towards the mountains in the numerical model discretisation a model layer terminates in the area where the representing aquifer or aquitard intersects with bedrock this approach is termed as the true layer approach and the resulting numerical model is the third alternative model am3 in the am3 model model layers are absent in the area where the corresponding aquifer and or aquitards are absent therefore the model areas differ in different model layers the top and bottom elevations of the model are the same for three alternative models the top elevation was taken from the dem model of 90 m resolution the bottom elevation was the basement of the bedrock and which was treated as a no flow boundary for all models the top and bottom elevations of other model layers were interpolated from borehole log classifications there are two different types of lateral boundary conditions for models the plain is receiving lateral inflow from the mountain area in the west and north which was estimated from previous hydrogeological surveys and was treated as a specified flow boundary in this study the other sides is the administrative boundary of beijing and simulated as head dependent flow boundaries all models consist of similar parameter zones however the parameterization of am2 is different from the am1 and am3 models the horizontal kh and vertical kv hydraulic conductivity parameter zones for am1 and am3 were actual values determined by the lithological types combined with structural geological maps initial values were obtained by the results of pumping tests and empirical values however model layers in the am2 model consist of the mixed aquifer and aquitard the vertical hydraulic conductivity values were obtained by calculating an equivalent hydraulic conductivity value as the harmonic mean of the vertical hydraulic conductive values of the aquifer and aquitard for each parameter zone beijing plain went through a long term relatively wet period from 1985 to 1998 14 years and observed monthly groundwater levels varied in stationary state groundwater flow can be considered to be in a steady state condition in this period in the year of 1995 a groundwater resources assessment project was carried out in the beijing plain groundwater recharges and discharges were estimated and were made available for the construction of the steady state groundwater flow models hydrological stresses and their simulations were kept the same for all three models table 1 the groundwater modelling system gms10 4 aquaveo 2017 was used to create the conceptual model of inflow and outflow components and then converted to modflow packages modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 for flow simulation recharge from precipitation infiltration was estimated for different zones based on spatial distribution of precipitations and infiltration coefficients irrigation return flow and pipe leakage were specified for different districts as areal recharge all areal recharges were converted to modflow recharge package lateral inflow coming from the mountain area was defined as specified flow boundary and was simulated with modflow well package injection rates rivers and canals were delineated and conceptualized as a specified inflow source and were also simulated with modflow well package injection rates evapotranspiration in the shallow groundwater areas was simulated with modflow evt package groundwater abstractions were categorised as domestic water supply wells agricultural wells and industrial wells agricultural wells were pumping groundwater in the shallow aquifer located in the top modelling layer industrial wells were pumping groundwater in deeper aquifers there are two different types of domestic water supply wells distributed wells operated in small towns and centralized wells operated by drinking water supply companies all groundwater abstractions were merged in modflow well package for the simulation lateral flow from the administrative boundary was defined as head dependant flow boundary and simulated with modflow general head boundary package in total there are 202 observation wells in the plain with different depths most of the observation wells penetrate the shallow aquifers all the observation wells were assigned to the corresponding model layers according to their depths 2 3 set up of the numerical models the first model layer covers the same model area for all three models the finite difference grid for modflow model consists of 116 rows and 138 columns with a regular cell size of 1000 m 1000 m the am1 model consists of 9 model layers corresponding to 5 aquifers and 4 aquitards all 9 model layers cover the same model area since a thin model layer was extended to the same model boundary in areas where aquifer or aquitard is absent the am2 model consists of 5 model layers corresponding to five aquifer groups the am3 model consists of 9 model layers but the model layer stops in areas where aquifer or aquitard is absent the gms utility of truncation was used to cut off model areas with the basement elevation the grid cells outside the aquifer or aquitard areas were made inactive fig 4 shows the model grid in the same row for three models and their differences can be clearly seen the same modflow packages were used for all three models table 1 the layer property package lpf was used to represent hydraulic properties of the aquifers and aquitards the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values were specified for every parameter zone input data for modflow packages were converted from gms conceptual model coverages systematically 2 4 model calibration and sensitivity analysis all three models were calibrated to observed groundwater heads in 202 observation wells firstly manual calibration with the traditional trial and error method was applied hydraulic conductivities groundwater recharge and pumping depth of the distributed water supply wells were adjusted to get a better fit to observed groundwater heads pest doherty 2010 was then applied to optimize the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities and estimate the parameter sensitivities of the three models important parameters and observations can be identified by statistics such as composite scaled sensitivity css and leverage css is calculated as 1 css j j 1 n dss ij 2 n where j denotes the j th parameter in the model n is the total number of observations dss ij is the dimensionless scaled sensitivity which is calculated as 2 dss ij ω i 1 2 b j y i b j where ω i is the weight for observation i in this case all the observations have equivalent weight as 1 b j is the value of parameter j y i b i is the derivative of the simulated value of observation y i with respect to parameter b j a larger absolute dss value indicates that the parameter b j is more sensitive to the estimation of observation y i the importance of observations to parameter estimation can be evaluated with the leverage of the observations calculated as 3 l i x i t x t ω x 1 x i where x is a sensitivity matrix with elements equal to y i b i and x i is the ith row of x ω is the weight matrix on observations it reflects the correlation between the parameters and observations the range of leverage is from 0 to 1 the closer it is to 1 the higher the observation contributes to the parameter estimation 2 5 multi model analysis the three alternative models were evaluated using information criteria including the aic aicc bic and kic akaike information criteria aic and aicc are defined as 4 aic n ln σ 2 2 k 5 aicc n ln σ 2 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 6 σ 2 swsr n 7 swsr i 1 n ω i y i y i b 2 where k npe 1 npe is the number of process model parameters σ2 is the mean square error swsr is the sum of weighted squared residuals y i b is model calculated groundwater heads using calibrated parameter group b bayesian information criterion is defined as 8 bic n ln σ 2 k ln n kashyap information criterion is defined as schenk et al 2018 9 kic n ln σ 2 k 1 ln 2 π ln x t ω x where x is the sensitivity matrix the model with smaller aic aicc bic and kic values is considered the better model ucode poeter et al 2014 was used to compute akaike bayesian kashyap information criteria 2 6 delineation of wellfield capture zone one of the main objectives of applying a regional groundwater flow model is to manage and protect well fields for drinking water supply delineation of the capture zone of a well field is very important for the protection of potable groundwater resources one of the largest well fields in beijing plain no 8 well field is located in the chaobai river alluvial fan in the northeast model area the well field consists of pumping wells abstracting a total of 449 530 m3 day according to pumping well depths abstraction rates were assigned in the first third and fifth model layers in the am1 model first and second model layers in the am2 model and the first and third model layers in the am3 model one hundred particles were placed evenly in a circle around every well block at different model layers and tracked backwards until arriving at recharge areas the area encircled by all pathlines forms the capture area modpath pollock 1994 was used to compute pathlines based on the computed cell by cell flow components from modflow model with the endpoint mode of the modpath simulation water particles entering the abstraction well cells can be traced backward until the points of recharge the capture zones of the large well field in the model domain can be defined by the final locations of these water particles with the pathline mode of the modpath simulation groundwater traveling time can be obtained for each particle and cumulative groundwater travel time of all particles can be calculated for a well field 3 results 3 1 results of model calibration and sensitivity analysis fig 5 compares the model calibration of the three alternative models in general the performance of the three models is equally good the mean differences between the simulated and observed groundwater levels for am1 am2 and am3 are 0 80 1 82 m and 2 22 m respectively am2 and am3 slightly underestimated groundwater levels on average which can be seen from the greater number of points below the diagonal line in the scatter plots the root means square errors are 7 02 6 43 and 6 37 respectively for three models the coefficients of determination for the three models are 0 790 0 832 and 0 838 respectively the contour maps of groundwater levels in five aquifers from the three models are presented in fig 6 there are distinct differences between contour maps firstly only the extent of the first aquifer is the same for all the models however many dry model cells occur in am1 because am1 assumed a small thickness of the first aquifer so that the computed groundwater levels were below the bottom of the aquifer in the yongding river alluvial fan secondly the aquifer area becomes smaller with the increase of depth in the am2 and am3 models while the aquifer area remains the same in the am1 model both am2 and am3 follow the actual extent of the aquifers so that the aquifer seams out towards the mountain front however the am1 model used a thin layer approach so that the modelled aquifers extend to the same boundary with a very small thickness 1 0 m in the area where the aquifers are absent the am1 model gives a false illusion that deep groundwater continuously presents everywhere in all aquifers computed groundwater balance components were checked table 2 and compared with the groundwater resources assessment of beijing plain in 1995 the total volume of the inflow and the outflow of the three alternative models are approximately the same the areal recharge and abstraction are the same for all models small differences exist in the water exchange through ghb boundaries and evapotranspiration rate which are caused by differences in computed groundwater levels from the three models it shows that all three models can compute the same regional groundwater balance under steady state conditions fig 7 shows the composite scaled sensitivity css of parameter zones with the 30 most sensitive parameters large differences can be observed in most of the sensitive hydraulic conductivities from the three models the most sensitive 30 parameters in the am1 model include horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aquifer layers 3 1 5 7 and 9 and several vertical hydraulic conductivities in aquitard layers 2 6 4 and 8 sensitive parameters in the am2 model consist of mostly horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aquifer layers 1 and 3 and some vertical hydraulic conductivities in aquitard layers 4 and 6 several vertical hydraulic conductivities are also sensitive the most sensitive hydraulic conductivities in the am3 model consist of mostly horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aquifer layer1 a few in layer 3 plus some vertical hydraulic conductivities in aquitard layer 2 in all models a number of vertical hydraulic conductivity parameters in the aquitards are sensitive indicating that leakages through aquitards are important flow components for deep semi confined aquifers fig 8 a shows 50 observations with the highest leverage lij values for the three models all observations are important for the calibration of hydraulic conductivity parameter values however most important observations are found in the upper 3 aquifers in the am2 and am3 models while observations in deep aquifers are also important for the am1 model fig 8a furthermore the observations with high leverage have different spatial distributions in the three models fig 8b the pattern of spatial distribution and locations of aquifers of most important observations are similar in the am2 and am3 models the major difference in am1 is that the most important observations in the middle model area are located in deeper semi confined aquifers 4 and 5 corresponding to the deepest cone of depression fig 8b 3 2 results of multi model analysis table 3 presents the information criteria calculated by ucode 2014 for the three models in general there is no significant difference in aic aicc and bic values from the models however the kic value from the am3 model is much smaller than the am1 and am2 models all models are informative for computing groundwater levels at locations of observation wells 3 3 computation of travel times and delineation of the capture zone fig 9 presents capture zones delineated by the alternative models the shape of the capture zone indicates clearly the sources of water to the wells groundwater to the wells located at the top unconfined aquifer mainly comes from river leakage and areal recharge while groundwater flowing to the wells located in the semi confined aquifer comes from leakage and boundary inflow large differences can be observed from capture zones delineated by the three models the capture areas of the wells in the first aquifer delineated by the am1 am2 and am3 models are about 43 1 km2 51 7 km2 and 65 1 km2 respectively the maximum areas of the capture zone for the well field delineated by am1 am2 and am3 are about 334 7 km2 284 6 km2 and 291 0 km2 respectively the am1 model computed a small capture zone in the first aquifer because a small abstraction rate was assigned in this aquifer however the am1 model computed the largest capture zone of the wellfield since large amount of abstractions were assigned in the deep aquifers the cumulative travel time distribution is usually used as an indicator for water quality of the well field moel et al 2006 particle travel times in fig 9 were analysed statistically and cumulative travel time distributions were plotted in fig 10 the cumulative travel time curves of the am1 and am3 models are similar while the curve of am2 shows a significant delay effect the mean travel times of all water particles from recharge areas to arrive at the well fields were about 33 years 72 years and 39 years respectively estimated from the am1 am2 and am3 models the am2 model computed longer travel times for shorter pathlines in aquifer 1 4 discussion 4 1 statistical model comparisons the conventional model calibration was evaluated using statistical criteria such as mean residual errors root mean squared errors and coefficient determination information criteria were introduced in recent years for multi model comparisons the commonly used information criteria are aic aicc bic and kic from the model calibration statistics all 3 models could fit to observed groundwater levels with very small differences am1 model is less biased with a small mean residual error but slightly larger root mean squared error am2 and am3 perform equally well with smaller root mean squared errors but lager mean residual errors indicating underestimation of groundwater levels the information criteria not only consider the squared residual errors but also the trade off between the number of observed data and number of parameters estimated the parametrisation for a proper model requires that the number of model parameters should be smaller than the number of observations hill and tiedeman 2007 in all three alternative models for the beijing plain the number of parameters optimised by ucode is much smaller than the number of observations the same number of observations were used for computing information criteria with more less the same number of parameters therefore larger values in aic aicc and bic from am1 model are mainly attributed to larger mean squared residual errors there are no differences in these values between the am2 and am3 models since their mean squared residual errors are almost the same a number of researchers are in favour of using kic for multi model comparison schenk et al 2018 since kic is the only criterion including the fisher information term which considers the quality of observations and parameter estimates ye et al 2008 the kic value of the am3 model is less than half of those of the am1 and am2 models which is caused by the fisher information term therefore am3 can be considered as a relatively better model according to kic criterion 4 2 hydrogeological interpretations the three alternative models for the beijing plain differ largely on the conceptualization of aquifers and aquitards and their areal extents since the bedrock of the beijing plain undulates and uplifts towards the mountain front the area extents of aquifers and aquitards differ the am1 model used the same model area for 9 model layers and assumed a thin model layer extending to the whole model area when the actual aquifers and aquitards are absent the am2 and am3 models used the actual extent of hydrogeological units so that the model areas are different for each model layer unlike the am3 model that classifies the stratigraphic formations into five aquifers separated by 4 aquitards the am2 model groups the stratigraphic formations into 5 aquifer units therefore differences in vertical discretisation may result in differences in vertical leakages table 4 presents the results of computed vertical flow from a top model layer to an adjacent lower model layer as vertical leakage am2 and am3 computed similar downward leakage since they used the same hydrostratigraphic classifications downward leakages computed from the am1 model are in general larger than the am2 and am3 models the hydrostratigraphic classifications in the am1 model is different from other 2 models the am1 model assumed a thin top unconfined aquifer less than 50 m and more abstractions were located in aquifers 2 3 and 4 since groundwater in the deeper semi confined aquifer originates only from vertical leakage from top aquifers larger groundwater abstractions in deeper aquifers were fed by larger leakages in am1 model hydrogeologically the am1 model provided an illusion that deep groundwater presents everywhere in the beijing plain and computed a large amount of vertical leakage due to inaccurate vertical classification of aquifers and aquitards based on limited borehole data the am2 and am3 models improved vertical classifications of hydrostratigraphic formations with much more borehole data and placed abstraction wells in proper aquifers these two models conceptually represent more realistically hydrogeological structures in the beijing plain from groundwater resources management and monitoring perspectives the am2 model can perform equally well compared to the am3 model since both models produced similar contour maps of groundwater levels fig 6 computed the same regional water balance table 2 and vertical leakage table 4 however the am2 model has a larger aquifer thickness layer 1 and 2 combined comparing to am3 and therefore larger transmissivity values it computed a flatter hydraulic gradient around the wellfield compared to the am3 model concerning the calculation of the groundwater travel times particles were placed in a circle around the well at the middle of the aquifer height travel distances from the well location to surface recharge area are also longer thus the am2 model should not be used to compute travel time and delineate the capture zone due to the shortcomings in the conceptual model structure however from the principle of parsimony hill and tiedeman 2007 the am2 model can be considered for groundwater resources management and monitoring in the beijing plain since the model has a simpler structure the am3 model can adequately represent vertical flow velocities through the aquitards which are required to delineate wellfield protection areas and simulate contaminant plume movement for these purposes the am3 model must be used 4 3 perspective for further applications another important objective of groundwater modelling in the beijing plain is to investigate the feasibility of using managed aquifer recharge mar as a management tool to sustain groundwater resources development especially for drinking water supply potential sites for mar are alluvial fans in the yongding river and chaobai river catchments for this purpose a locally refined groundwater model in which the model cell size is much smaller than the infiltration pond should be used to simulate the mar scheme the boundaries of the local model should be linked to the regional model so that interactions between the local and regional models are assured the methods for coupling regional and local models are the newly developed local grid refinement lgr method mehl and hill 2006 and the unstructured grid method usg method panday et al 2013 modflow lgr can simulate the groundwater flow in a block shaped high resolution local model a child model coupled with the coarser regional model a mother model the child model and the mother model can be simultaneously run for the coupled interactions the modflow usg is flexible to refine grids for a local area and more model layers to better represent the mar scheme for both methods a functional regional model is required the regional model am3 constructed with true layer approach is suitable for simulating the mar scheme with the coupled regional and local models on going research on testing modflow lgr and modflow usg for the design and simulation of the mar scheme in the chaobai river catchment is undertaken with the am3 model however detailed hydrogeological data are necessary 5 conclusions three alternative regional groundwater flow models for the beijing plain were evaluated in this study the first alternative model am1 was constructed with the thin layer approach so that all model layers are continuously distributed in the same model area the am2 model was constructed by a quasi 3d approach which neglected the existence of aquitards in the system and conceptualized the groundwater system as five continuous aquifers the am3 model was constructed with the true layer approach so that aquifers and aquitards are separated and model layers are absent in the area where corresponding hydrogeological units intersect bedrock the parameter optimization method was used to optimize hydraulic conductivity values for all models and the multi model analysis was used to compare the relative performance of the three models the differences in depicting contour maps computing water balance and leakages delineating capture zones together with travel times were analysed statistically the am1 model can fit observations equally well and produce similar information criteria values compared to the am2 and am3 models the major deficits of the am1 model include a fictitious presence of deep aquifers with thin model layers b a very thin top unconfined aquifer and c improper allocations of more abstractions in deeper aquifers due to these deficits the am1 model depicts false contour maps in deep aquifers computes larger vertical leakages and delineates a smaller capture area in the top aquifer the am2 model produces satisfactory model calibration statistics and provides similar information criteria values the am2 model can also compute regional groundwater balances and vertical leakages however the am2 model computes longer travel times around the wellfield since it assumes much thicker aquifers and neglects aquitards therefore the am2 model can be used for groundwater resources management and monitoring purposes but is inadequate to perform particle tracking and contaminant transport simulations am3 is a more realistic groundwater model for the alluvial aquifer system in beijing plain am3 gives the smallest root mean squared error for the model calibration and a much smaller kic value for information model comparison hydrogeologically am3 can fulfil all tasks of groundwater resources management monitoring and wellfield capture zone delineation am3 is suitable for contaminant transport simulation and simulation of managed aquifer recharge in future studies in conclusion statistical and information criteria alone might not be sufficient to identify best alternative groundwater models due to the limitation of observations hydrogeological interpretation is equally important for assessing multiple alternative models a simplified quasi 3d model may be sufficient for regional groundwater resources planning and management but a multiple aquifer aquitard conceptual model is more accurate to perform particle tracking and contaminant transport simulations credit authorship contribution statement sida liu methodology software validation

4684,recent literature on model evaluation has highlighted the need particularly in an interdisciplinary problem and team setting to go beyond the evaluation of results and outputs of a problem solving pathway process and monitor and evaluate the pathway itself to improve ongoing activities undertaken by the research team that best achieve the desired impact by reflecting on what decisions have been made the reasons influences and effects of each decision such evaluation can improve the learning process of stakeholders and researchers the authors have designed a formative self reflective monitoring and evaluation m e process and applied it to an integrated assessment and modelling project in the campaspe catchment part of the murray darling basin in victoria australia the m e process consists of six steps 1 review of documents to understand research goals priorities and records 2 pathway assessment 3 reflective meetings with each team member 4 analysis of qualitative data from meetings to capture perceived strengths weaknesses successes and failures and suggested actions objections and goals 5 survey to elicit feedback on identified goals objectives and actions and 6 a report of approved actions based on the conducted survey of team members four overall goals and constituent objectives were identified with 42 actions and between 37 and 42 of these actions appear to have support for adoption the evaluation indicated the benefits of the enhanced m e approach to realise a more adaptive and effective problem solving modelling and assessment project keywords reflection evaluation monitoring pathways participatory modelling integrated water resources management 1 introduction the self reflective approach to monitoring and evaluation of interdisciplinary team research proposed in this paper is motivated by studies encountered by the authors in the field of integrated water resources management iwrm the approach applies equally well however to interdisciplinary team research in many settings it is well accepted that iwrm is above all a process ibisch et al 2016 molle 2008 that promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximise outcomes around economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems and the environment gwp 2000 as with most complex environmental problems requiring an interdisciplinary approach to their management the science and implementation of iwrm tends to require that integrated socio environmental systems ses modelling play a crucial role in the process integrated ses modelling attempts to represent the complexities between the human and biophysical drivers and associated outcomes of interest for which there are presently several software platforms kelly letcher et al 2013 the integrated modelling can involve several distinct or overlapping purposes that may include understanding the dynamics of the associated socio environmental system identifying and sharing perspectives of the different interest groups facilitating co learning among those groups and evaluating and communicating decision options for improving system outcomes e g badham et al 2019 kelly letcher et al 2013 zare et al 2017 these purposes largely require amalgamating structuring and sharing relevant knowledge from multiple scientific disciplines and the multiple perspectives of stakeholders researchers and when linked closely to policy decision makers jakeman and letcher 2003 laniak et al 2013 madani et al 2014 rotmans and van asselt 1996 voinov and bousquet 2010 zare et al 2019 integrated modelling in the water research sector in terms of publications at least has increased during the last 50 years and has passed its conception formation and practice stages and now is in a maturity stage zare et al 2017 like any other participatory and transdisciplinary research in its maturity stage integrated modelling research and practice benefits from applying reflexive approaches to dig deeper into and go beyond current practice popa et al 2015 seidl 2015 a common approach to such reflection involves evaluation of modelling projects often undertaken at the end of a modelling activity and for a single purpose usually model output assessment more complete evaluation perspectives are however being increasingly considered by viewing integrated modelling as a social and technical process that considers such contextual factors as project efficiency model accessibility credibility saliency legitimacy satisfaction application and impact hamilton et al 2019 this wider paradigm of recognising and assessing integrated modelling as a social process rather than just a technical procedure suggests there is a critical need to evaluate the pathway of the model development process and the product jakeman et al 2006 and not just the output and model results hamilton et al 2019 essentially such a pathway is an adaptively adjusted set of steps including decision forks and points for reflection and iteration zare et al 2020 it can be accompanied by a pathway diagram as a graphical illustration of the project s pathway this can be used to share as a common language and flexible framework to achieve a coherent description of a modelling process explicitly showing the steps involved and decisions and points at which stakeholders are involved zare et al 2019 the quality of practices used through the modelling pathway affects the results moallemi et al 2020 and in our case of integrated water assessment and modelling defines its effectiveness badham et al 2019 in response to the fact that traditional evaluation of the modelling pathway process typically happens if at all at the final output stage to assess the model and its results bandara 2007 researchers have argued for evaluation of the project pathway while the work is still ongoing alvarez et al 2010 badham et al 2019 hamilton et al 2019 the rationale for this is to understand and improve the effectiveness of both the immediate and any future modelling evaluation should be part of an iterative and adaptive process that links and has the potential to engage interested scientists decision makers interest groups and the broader public towards achieving impact beyond the merely technical performance of a model hamilton et al 2019 moreover the monitoring and evaluation process ideally is an integral activity during all steps of participatory planning processes hassenforder et al 2016 to help in realising an adaptive pathway that allows team members to aim for ambitious outcomes and modify their activities over time to achieve them van mierlo et al 2010 process evaluation in turn relies on transparency about the research process particularly the value laden assumptions and subjective choices made by modellers khatami et al 2019 van der sluijs 2002 the perceptions of both the problem and results are largely dependent on the cumulative effects of individual choices at each decision fork moallemi et al 2020 these methodological choices are influenced by a variety of human factors such as different cognitive behavioural and mental frameworks as well as the biases beliefs heuristics experiences and values of those involved glynn et al 2017 hämäläinen et al 2013 madani and khatami 2015 although the need for a new paradigm of evaluation in modelling has previously been highlighted hamilton et al 2019 hansson and polk 2018 little attention has been paid to developing and testing the practical processes required to deliver on these evaluation needs evaluation of an ongoing modelling process in transdisciplinary and complex problem solving projects such as occurs in the iwrm context that considers human factors needs critical systemic and reflexive approaches arkesteijn et al 2015 reflexive monitoring approaches encourage the practitioners and researchers to observe analyse reflect and adjust their actions van mierlo et al 2010 purposeful and ongoing reflection through the integrated modelling pathway is particularly vital to facilitate the necessary and timely iteration and consequently to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the modelling process zare et al 2020 reflexive monitoring as treated here is based on the reflective practices literature thus section 2 discusses the insights from reflective practices and the distinctions between different forms of reflexivity in more detail this paper designs and applies a formative and self reflective approach to monitoring and evaluation specifically tailored to an iwrm project in the campaspe catchment in north central victoria which is part of the murray darling basin australia the campaspe project is being implemented by a specialist team of interdisciplinary researchers see section 3 1 largely from the integrated catchment assessment and management centre icam at the australian national university which has a focus on integrated catchment modelling and assessment the lead author who led the evaluation process is affiliated with icam but did not have any role in the campaspe project other than evaluating it as an involved outsider discussed in section 2 3 over the last two decades icam researchers have engaged with the topic of evaluation from different perspectives initially the evaluation focus was on the evaluation of the model performance against its objectives e g bennett et al 2013 jakeman et al 2006 subsequent augmentation of this has included evaluation in the context of limited data hamilton et al 2015 and analysis of success factors of modelling outcomes as learnt from 15 australian water resource projects in which icam was involved merritt et al 2017 recent work has provided a comprehensive overview of the process methods and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of modelling projects hamilton et al 2019 as well as providing a comprehensive list of procedural questions to consider at the different phases and steps of the modelling process badham et al 2019 this paper is the latest stage in this evolving journey focusing on the research question how can a team of researchers engage in formative reflective evaluation to improve the effectiveness of their own integrated modelling pathway and the choices therein the remainder of the article is organised as follows section 2 presents foundational concepts of reflective and reflexive approaches the distinction between them and their connection with evaluation it also discusses relevant literature on facilitation of a reflexive monitoring process section 3 presents the case study and the monitoring and evaluation process developed the data analysis and results of the monitoring and evaluation of the case study are presented in section 4 which includes results with respect to the pathway of the project opportunities for improvement arising from reflective meetings and team member perceptions of proposed actions section 5 discusses the insights gained from this research 2 insights from reflective practices 2 1 what is a reflective approach the need to shift from conventional common evaluation approaches which are largely summative to formative approaches is more critical in multidisciplinary projects facing complex issues in such projects effective adaptation in response to changing circumstances is essential hamilton et al 2019 zare 2020 formative evaluation occurs during a process so as to modify the activities involved to improve that process patton 2006 result oriented evaluation or impact evaluation judges the gained results against the objectives set for the project while a reflective approach facilitates and provokes an ongoing and integral activity to enable adaptivity during the project roux et al 2010 it is believed that evaluation leads to reflection but experience suggests this is rarely the case roux et al 2010 therefore it is recommended to explicitly plan for and adopt reflective communication and documentation to identify pitfalls along the project pathway and adapt that path in a timely fashion to new information and circumstances zare et al 2020 the definition of reflection may differ among disciplines and even within a discipline finlay 2008 but is commonly described as a dynamic open unpredictable and deliberate process in which people think about past or ongoing experience to evaluate inform and improve future choices decisions or actions collier 2010 reynolds 2011 zare et al 2020 a reflective cycle is a process of reflection which involves a number of steps that involve describing the event and situation expressing the sentiments and thinking around it then assessing and analysing it and finally concluding and setting an action plan gibbs 1988 reflection is recognised as an important factor to strengthen multi disciplinary inter disciplinary and transdisciplinary research consortia cochrane et al 2017 popa et al 2015 wickson et al 2006 it can provide a systematic and critical approach to increase awareness of researchers about influencing factors such as biases beliefs values heuristics and thinking methods on the decisions and choices during the journey along the modelling pathway moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 these influencing factors impact the problem conceptualisation as well as the development of the method of investigation and the solution moallemi and köhler 2019 wickson et al 2006 therefore reflection is recommended to practitioners to craft active and aware decisions and to be more conscious of their practice collier 2010 schön 1983 while reflection suggests observing and examining our practice and decisions as objectively as possible reflexivity however is regarded as a subjective process of actually exposing or questioning the reasons behind our practice including surfacing assumptions innate biases beliefs heuristics and values in other words reflexivity is a complexification of thinking and experience or thinking about the experience which is related to but qualitatively different from reflection hibbert et al 2010 in social processes reflexivity refers to a collaborative process of acknowledgement critical deliberation and mutual learning on values assumptions and understandings that might produce new meanings heuristics and stakeholder identities popa et al 2015 we use self reflection interchangeably with reflexivity meaning a process of critically thinking and examining one s practices and decisions in order to learn from it and which might lead to change in the decisions we recognise that other definitions are possible and that reflexivity and reflection are sometimes used interchangeably chivers 2003 finlay 2008 hibbert et al 2010 reflective practice which schön 1983 discusses at length is linked closely with problem solving research approaches and forms of enquiry the need for more widespread reflective practice is highlighted in several studies because more theoretically driven research sometimes lacks a sense of critical distance or reflexivity about its own products and procedures ball 1997 botha et al 2017 outlined the need for reflexive monitoring to support processes of co innovation and their institutional embedding mauthner and doucet 2003 argued the need for reflexivity in qualitative data analysis to improve awareness of influential issues affecting one s analysis such as the context of research and assumptions in data based methods thus self reflection counters the biases that the researcher brings to their research in order to conduct self reflection the researchers and practitioners should be motivated open minded and self aware to be able to describe experiences critically analyse them connect new to existing knowledge and make judgements about the value of experience atkins and murphy 1993 2 2 reflexive monitoring evaluation a distinct literature exists on reflexive monitoring and evaluation m e which involves team members reflecting on a project and their performance to support learning from the exchange of ideas and reflection rijswijk et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 reflexive m e encourages participants to regularly reflect on aims practices and other aspects of the project thereby helping to keep a project coherent and efficient whilst avoiding mapping out and committing to an inflexible pathway beforehand van mierlo et al 2010 a reflexive m e approach can take the form of individual or collective reflection collective or communal reflection in addition to individual reflection is critical for transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research such as in the iwrm context because individuals or groups from multiple disciplines and perspectives inform and transform each other throughout the project pathway in respects that cannot typically be captured by a single individual wickson et al 2006 the reflection should happen frequently zare 2020 suggested the use of reflective communication at the end of each project phase to validate confirm or debunk results and or the success of the phase and to assist in efficiently reaching objectives by identifying the need for iteration as early as possible as one example of reflexive m e roux et al 2010 suggested a framework to facilitate the co reflection process during a transdisciplinary research project in order to help shape the processes behaviours and relationships required for achieving the goal they argued that the suggested framework and co reflection process could help achieve social learning and broad accountability across the stakeholders to enable learning by doing in the co reflection process they argued that supportive regular co reflection workshops should take place from the commencement of a program the interactive learning approach regeer et al 2009 is another example which used reflexivity from a similar point of view van mierlo et al 2010 suggest a reflexive monitoring cycle as a practical guideline to put that reflexive monitoring into practice which is aligned with the reflective cycle gibbs 1988 the reflexive monitoring cycle consists of observation of what is happening in the project analysis which can be performed by a monitor or the project manager alone or together with the project participants a collective analysis to clarify the various perspectives of the participants and finally reflection on assumptions and values personal actions and other topics based on the preceding steps and potentially adjustment and adaptation of the project reflexive m e approaches bear some similarity in methods to other iterative evaluation approaches but differ in their emphasis for instance holzer et al 2018 suggest an iterative approach to evaluate transdisciplinary research on socio ecological systems the suggested approach uses in depth interviews to understand the context of research and examples of successes and failures in a subsequent step a survey is used to collect quantitative data from a larger group the analysis of which feeds into focus group discussions and a final report a deliberate strength of this approach is the use of multiple complementary methods of data collection that adaptively build on each other within a grounded theory context without prior hypotheses the emphasis however is on collecting data rather than specifically to facilitate reflection by the project participants themselves 2 3 facilitation of a reflective monitoring process embedding reflective evaluation into transdisciplinary research is not always easy as it challenges skillsets identities and role perceptions of researchers a facilitator can provide useful support to ensure that reflective evaluation is carried out with an open spirit and no intent to blame rijswijk et al 2015 labelled this role a reflexive monitor who helps the team to challenge and change assumptions practices and underlying institutions in the design or management of a project through an on going process of evaluation in an action research setting the reflexive monitor role is context dependent and there is no fixed recipe for it however focusing on developing solutions to a problem and taking a flexible adaptive approach are essential elements in ensuring that monitoring and evaluation are effective a spectrum for reflexive monitors ranges from appreciative inquiry to critical analysis rijswijk et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 in an appreciative inquiry role the reflexive monitor is an involved participant in the project and helps to build a safe environment for the team to find solutions based on what works within the project in a critical analysis role the reflexive monitor is an involved outsider and helps to build insights within the project team a reflexive monitor can be somewhere between these two ends based on the context and the situation and their role might change during the project from one side to the other side of the spectrum it is crucial that the monitor not fulfil too many other tasks within the project to help maintain a critical analysis the monitors can help keep the level of ambition up in the team by asking appreciative questions to facilitate valuable reflection rijswijk et al 2015 in this paper we use the term monitor to refer to individuals designing implementing and managing the self reflective monitoring and evaluation process in the campaspe the first author the monitor was not responsible for any project component but was involved in many workshops and meetings as an observer and therefore could be placed near the critical analysis end of the spectrum as an involved outsider rijswijk et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 according to rolfe et al 2001 the reflexive monitor can ask three simple forms of questions to facilitate reflection on a situation what so what and now what what is the problem was my role happened were the consequences so what was going through my mind should i have done do i know about what happened now now what do i need to do broader issues have been raised might happen now the first question covers the descriptive level of reflection the second question aims for theory and knowledge building the final question can make the most significant contribution to practice rolfe et al 2001 because it precisely asks about essential action to change the situation more generally an in depth reflective interview is reported to be an important effective tool chivers 2003 and has been used in other project evaluation research in an instructive example kunseler et al 2015 examined two foresight projects of the pbl netherlands environmental assessment agency to explore how foresight researchers in practice attempt to balance salience credibility and legitimacy while generating knowledge in interaction with policy makers and other social actors they collected data using participant observation interviewing and document analysis they became actively involved in the projects and contributed to team evaluation they used an evaluation form with open ended questions which gave the team member the ability to express his or her individual experiences of the process they complemented these reflection forms with a group discussion to reflect upon these experiences and identify lessons learnt as well as with interviews of internal peers who were distantly involved or experts in the topic who helped to complete the lessons learnt the combination of individual and group reflection guided by a monitor is a common tool that is adopted here 3 campaspe project integrated assessment of water allocation and use opportunities this paper describes reflection on the campaspe integrated assessment and modelling iam project which started in 2012 and whilst mature in that the associated integrated model had largely been built was ongoing at the time of this research in order to explore scenarios and undertake uncertainty assessments this project was initiated as a partnership between the murray darling basin authority mdba the australian national university anu and flinders university focused on the campaspe catchment which is located in north central victoria and part of the murray darling basin in australia fig 1 the aim of the project was to conduct an integrated assessment of water allocation and use opportunities in the campaspe partly in response to but going beyond the shorter term issues in the murray darling basin plan iwanaga et al 2020 which defines environmental objectives such as increasing water availability for the environment north central catchment management authority 2014 the project team includes expertise in the social sciences hydrology climatology hydrogeology policy ecology agriculture economics computer science and in participatory integrated assessment and modelling an integrated modelling exercise was devised and used to study interactions between natural and human systems going beyond the mdb plan s specific objectives with respect to quantifying industry water diversions that are environmentally sustainable the integrated model and an associated engagement process were developed to study the consequences of various possible futures that considers climate water policy both current policy and conjunctive surface groundwater use innovations and on farm irrigation management on outcomes that include indicators related to groundwater sustainability farm profits and river ecology the model is described in iwanaga et al 2020 2018 stakeholders were involved at all stages of the integrated assessment and modelling from scoping to problem framing and formulation to model parameterisation and evaluation of assessment outcomes through several workshops meetings and interviews ticehurst and curtis 2019 the pathway taken by the project is further analysed in section 4 1 4 method formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluation of the campaspe project the formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluation process undertaken consists of six steps fig 2 this process was designed based on a synthesis of methods from a number of sources gibbs 1988 holzer et al 2018 kunseler et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 zare et al 2020 to fit the needs and general context of the campaspe project this m e process for the project was designed and applied once during 2019 when the social farm and economy policy and ecology studies in the campaspe project had been completed but surface water groundwater and integrated modelling were still ongoing it was applied to test its usefulness and as a proof of concept the time steps of any m e exercise will depend on the nature and the duration of project but for a project like the campaspe one that involves several disciplines and sectors a reflective activity about every year seems needed and we expect that every six months may be better in the first step of our formative and self reflective m e the documents of the project were reviewed by the monitor to understand research goals priorities and the history of events activities decisions and outputs and then a pathway assessment was constructed step 2 in the third step the monitor carried out a reflective meeting with one team member from each project component covering the social sciences hydrology climatology hydrogeology policy ecology agriculture economics computer science and in participatory integrated assessment and modelling a total of 10 meetings most of the components comprised one main researcher whereas social and groundwater had more than one although all were invited it was decided to nominate just one researcher from each discipline to undertake the reflection meeting analysis of qualitative data from those meetings was the next step in order to identify perceived strengths weaknesses successes and failures based on the resulting list of goals objectives and actions a survey was designed to obtain team members feedback on the identified opportunities to improve the project pathway and those activities needed to achieve that aim lastly a report of approved actions based on the collective reflective survey was compiled and sent to team members the next sub sections discuss this process in more detail 4 1 step 1 2 review of documents pathway assessment in the first step of the formative and self reflective m e process fig 2 the project plan and documents were reviewed to understand the goals objectives achievements challenges and to characterise the pathway of the project furthermore team members were asked to provide all the documents relating to their discipline sector project component that they had produced and used to communicate as well as any feedback and reflection that they received about those documents from stakeholders other team members or decision makers the received documents were then studied and analysed a pathway diagram as defined in section 1 was produced based on the documents step 2 naturally reflecting the context and circumstances of the project zare et al 2019 these two interlinked steps and the resulting pathway diagram helped the reflexive monitor to gain sufficient knowledge and attain a holistic understanding of the project before initiating the reflective meetings 4 2 step 3 reflective meetings the m e process continued with a series of reflective meetings facilitated by the monitor each meeting involved the first author as the involved outsider monitor and one of the team members who was responsible for a specific discipline sectoral study at the start of each meeting its purpose was clarified as being an evaluation of the campaspe project collecting their reflections to improve the next steps as well as the pathways for future projects and the m e process to date was explained as well the pathway diagram was provided as a reference to help recall events and to prompt comments on them the monitor facilitated the meeting with a semi structured agenda and asked general open ended questions consistent with the suggestions of rolfe et al 2001 so as to focus on what so what and now what section 2 3 in this case the questions used included what are your general reflections on the project so what are the lessons learnt that you think are worth passing on to others and now what do you suggest others should adopt or avoid what are the decisions that you wouldn t make if you were in the same situation again so what will you change if you were to start the campaspe project again any change in decisions taken approaches and activities now what do you think could improve the campaspe project pathway the monitor used the questions as prompts to facilitate the discussion rather than driving it gibbs 1988 the interview continued with a discussion on the interesting ideas and issues that emerged during the reflection an underlying aim was to establish an atmosphere of trust regarded as critical to facilitate such interviews and produce an open reflection because the fear of mistakes could cause avoidance of creative thinking and prevent learning lahtinen et al 2017 which is one of the values of reflection notes were taken immediately after the meetings rather than during them in order to keep discussion informal the reports of the conducted semi structured meetings were sent back to the participants who were requested to carefully look at whether the summaries reflected their views and to edit explain or expand any points that they wished as is standard practice for ensuring validity in qualitative analysis creswell 2003 4 3 step 4 5 analysing the reflective meetings survey during the reflective meetings some issues were identified by team members to improve change or adapt the process the meetings also identified good practices to be kept and continued in step four a collective list consisting of issues and good practices confirmed by individual team members was made along with associated suggested actions and goals about different aspects of the project this list was structured into overall goals subordinate objectives and related actions some actions points or goals emerged at several points during individual meetings and some suggested actions were added by the monitor based on literature in order to complete the description of objectives the structured list of goals objectives and actions was then formulated as a survey to elicit collective reflection on the next steps a survey can be considered as a light weight alternative to a co reflection workshop roux et al 2010 it was sent to the team members in order to get their approval of whether they thought that each action would be effective or not and whether they would be willing to apply it or not figure s1 in the supplementary materials displays the survey interface the following description of the survey was sent to the team this survey is intended to support reflection on research practices within our group it includes five pages discussing four goals with several possible objectives we could aim for and specific actions we can take these ideas have mostly come out directly from discussions about the campaspe project with some suggested based on the interpretation of discussions and review of the project documents the four different goals identified are improving documentation improving communication improving project process and improving modelling process the question now is what actions do we think would be effective and worth pursuing and are there any other goals objectives or actions which you think we need to consider 4 4 step 6 results analysis and reporting at the final step the results of the survey were analysed and reported to the team the report was sent to everyone who was involved in the evaluation the primary result from the survey comprises the raw rating data based on the distribution of ratings for each action a five degree effectiveness range 2 1 0 1 2 was utilised where if someone selected an action to be ineffective and they would not apply it then the value of that action is 2 and if the action is considered effective and they would apply it the value is 2 with seven respondents the total score therefore ranges from 14 to 14 there are many ways in which individual ratings of the actions could be aggregated to determine which actions should be implemented this uncertainty is recognised by evaluating the results in multiple ways the rating data are aggregated in three ways with a consensus rule majority rule and score voting rule with respect to the consensus rule only actions that all team members support i e assigning a score of 1 or 2 were accepted and actions that all team members opposed i e score of 2 or 1 were rejected with the majority rule actions with majority support i e four or more team members out of seven were accepted and actions that the majority opposed were rejected with the score voting rule the score of each action was calculated and actions were considered accepted when they had a total score above a threshold 4 out of 14 for all rules the classification of actions that were neither accepted nor rejected was considered to be indeterminate 5 data analysis and results this section is organized around the following parts first the pathway diagram for the project is described and discussed second potential opportunities for improvement in the project are presented as a list of goals objectives and actions which are the result of reflective meetings and finally the results of the survey based on team member perceptions of proposed objectives and actions are discussed 5 1 pathway diagram the pathway diagram fig 3 was outlined based on collected project documents it shows communication activities such as the meetings between team members team and stakeholders team and steering committee it also shows the outputs and the documentations the diagram is recognised to be only as complete and accurate as the documents used to create it the first version of the diagram was presented in the reflective meetings which helped to fill some gaps as expected the effort to outline the pathway diagram was found to be a learning by doing process which helped the monitor to gain more knowledge about the project and acquire a holistic perspective on the process also during the reflective meetings it helped the team members in recalling the process the decision forks and activities in order to reflect on them and in illustrating specific opportunities for improvement with nearly all team members referring to it at some point to clarify their explanations and collectively it helped the monitor and team members to build a shared and clear understanding of the project the aim of using the pathway diagram is to facilitate dialogue in the reflective meetings by providing a shared reference point and the current level of detail fits this purpose however the pathway diagram could be used as a communication and documentation tool which would require more detail about decisions zare et al 2020 the campaspe project was a complex project which involved several disciplines working together such that going into the next level of detail in the diagramming i e individual decisions would make it too complicated to understand in a reflective meeting more details about the participatory process and modelling decisions are published by ticehurst and curtis 2019 5 2 opportunities for improvement the team members are overall quite experienced in integrated assessment and modelling so unsurprisingly the project has produced insights into future opportunities in the management of water in the catchment as well as an understanding of the interplay of factors affecting catchment health e g iwanaga et al 2018 as iam dictates the project operates with participatory and collaborative features as essential underpinnings to success in terms of processes the project follows best practices in model scoping and development listening to stakeholders and building the model according to their needs badham et al 2019 jakeman et al 2006 the model developed in the project also shows promise to feed into further analyses and there is anecdotal evidence that initial discussions with stakeholders have prompted further work towards operationalising conjunctive water use principles given that the development of iam is in a maturity stage zare et al 2017 team members recognised the need to support further progress by examining project practices more deeply and were keen to join the first author s experiment in designing and testing an m e reflexive process to sharpen their practices thus the emphasis in this paper is on improvements in practices and so the positive aspects of the project are not further discussed here analysis of the reflective meetings resulted in potential improvements that can be placed in four main categories documentation communication project process and modelling process table 1 the following section provides more detail on each issue where possible goals and actions are tied to the case study but in general they are presented at a relatively high level and details are omitted to protect the privacy of individuals the list of actions for each objective is outlined in the supplementary materials table s1 the numbering in the next sections refer to goal objective and action numbers respectively 5 2 1 goal 1 improving documentation during the reflective meetings a lack of sufficient and effective documentation was identified as an underlying cause of several issues and delays in the project in this regard improving documentation coverage reflection and management of project documents have been set as achievable objectives and for each of these objectives several actions are suggested the project evaluation suggested that there is a need to enhance and refine the coverage of documentation objective 1 1 in such a way that the entire research process is transparent and clear thus it was proposed that the documentation should materialise regularly actions 1 1 7 1 1 8 with sufficient information and the level of detail should cover the decisions and methodological options in such a way as to be as transparent as possible actions 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 6 the need for planning the documentation in the first step of the project was highlighted action 1 1 2 and metadata summaries and easy to understand fact sheets for each document could convey the meaning and aim of each document to people who will not read the detail actions 1 1 4 1 1 5 objective 1 2 suggests increasing the amount of reflection that was undertaken during the project in addition to expanding the current level coverage and frequency of reflection activities action 1 2 1 formalisation of requests to reflect on documentation and specifically on choices made could accelerate the reflection process actions 1 2 2 and 1 2 3 some reflection activities had already been performed fig 3 and these have supported project adaptivity however more structured reflection activities to perform the reflection are suggested furthermore it was considered that the process of creating sharing using and managing the knowledge and information within the team between the team and other parties could be expanded objective 1 3 namely the project team could improve management and organisation of documents and files to keep up to date and easy to access records of the project including through document management action 1 3 1 version control action 1 3 2 and folder structures action 1 3 4 also responsibility for project knowledge management could be assigned as a formal role action 1 3 3 5 2 2 goal 2 improving communication the second goal aims to further improve communication during the project in order to strengthen the ability of the team to consistently achieve a project pathway that is more transparent agile adaptive and effective three objectives were set in order to achieve this overarching goal focusing on improving each aspect of communication in this type of project 1 communication between team members 2 communication between the team and external partners and 3 communication between stakeholders and modellers improving communication among team members can further enhance the transfer of knowledge within the team which is crucial to achieving integrated research success as well as producing an integrated model it was seen that the communication between team members objective 2 1 could benefit from planning for communication in the first phase of the project action 2 1 1 holding more regular formal meetings and additional informal gatherings and team bonding activities actions 2 1 2 and 2 1 3 objective 2 2 dealt with identifying possible improvements to communication with external partners who were recognised throughout the project to be an important part of the team objective 2 2 collaborating with external partners is a valuable way to use others expertise but it requires managing communication and improving mutual project management in a way that distance and differences in work style do not reduce the efficiency of the project it was suggested to have additional more regular meetings and communications with external partners actions 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 besides explicitly appointing someone such as leader or project manager specifically assigned to manage external partner interactions action 2 2 3 the general understanding of the project its aim process and outputs would benefit from improvement in the communication between stakeholders and modellers objective 2 3 thereby integrating stakeholders ideas more opportunely into the modelling process and better enabling their reflection on the modelling process this communication would be more effective if modellers were involved more frequently in stakeholder engagement workshops action 2 3 1 and also if the results of other workshops were reported to modellers regularly action 2 3 2 in the campaspe project regular meetings of the research group significantly enhanced its ability to be reflective meetings happened at different levels such as within two disciplines e g policy and social all disciplines all team members team and stakeholders team and steering committee and social research group with stakeholders fig 4 illustrates these interactions through the meetings the communication within the team was mostly through the integrated modelling group person and at their request 5 2 3 goal 3 improving project process during the reflective meetings many issues were raised around the iam process and the need for facilitating integration throughout the project objective 3 1 and improving project effectiveness and efficiency objective 3 2 in this regard improved documentation and communication as considered in the previous objectives are valuable action 3 1 3 another suggestion was assigning a person in a project manager or synthesis position to facilitate the collaboration within the team action 3 1 1 and a synthesis position with a proper amount of time expertise and authority action 3 1 2 it was felt this would be beneficial even though the team members were experienced in iam project collaboration however the constrained budget would have made it difficult to have such a synthesis position another specific suggestion involved the suggestion of organizing brainstorming meetings between modellers and social scientists to enhance the extant connection between the social studies and the modelling process action 3 2 4 furthermore improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of the project pathway is always possible with any complex interdisciplinary project with a constrained budget objective 3 2 project management issues budget time efficiency etc could be given more dedicated attention to optimise the use of resources regular and ongoing planning action 3 2 1 preferably as a team activity action 3 2 2 was seen as valuable to assist in enhancing the effectiveness objective with a less limited budget a dedicated project manager could be assigned to improve project effectiveness and efficiency not just to facilitate collaboration and integration action 3 2 3 in a follow up survey team members responded that reflective m e would be valuable for the project if the extra time and resources would be budgeted for reflection activities they were more than willing to take part in more reflective m e activities if the time and budget needed were considered and available from the outset of the project because they saw value in reflective m e and not just for improving the current project they also valued the benefit for future projects especially those involving multi issue multi institutional endeavours with large teams it was viewed as particularly useful to communicate about differences and lessons learnt 5 2 4 goal 4 improving the modelling process the fourth goal aims to improve the modelling process in addition to improving efficiency objective 4 1 improved awareness around behavioural phenomena such as biases beliefs values and heuristics e g glynn 2017 glynn et al 2017 moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 affecting the pathway could assist in controlling their negative side effects objective 4 2 it was established that the efficiency of the modelling process could be improved by an accumulation of several actions such as instituting model testing practices continuously action 4 1 1 and confirming details of the data sets and key assumptions in group meetings to avoid inconsistencies action 4 1 2 similarly sharing each model component specification with other team members in a meeting was considered important to reduce the time to achieve compatibility between model components action 4 1 3 further expanding the use of version control action 4 1 4 is suggested not just for managing code but as a way of structuring software development helping to manage versions of the model and of communication between modellers of different disciplines enhanced communication and more coherent processes in general action 4 1 5 as discussed in previous goals could also improve the modelling process additionally the team suggested that the project could benefit more from exploring and discussing techniques that could be used to either address changes that unexpectedly constrain a pathway or seek new opportunities to advance the project action 4 1 6 three actions were suggested to deal with the negative effects of behavioural phenomena such as biases beliefs values and heuristics on choices and to reduce the risk of taking poor paths in the project glynn 2017 glynn et al 2017 moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 the first action in this respect is to apply debiasing techniques danielsen 2015 such as using a devil s advocate to decrease status quo bias within the team and increase awareness around decisions status quo bias is the tendency for people to like things to stay relatively the same and not to use new techniques methods and tools action 4 2 1 applying pathway diagrams action 4 2 2 and better communication about decisions action 4 2 3 are the other suggested actions to improve awareness around behavioural phenomena and control their negative effects 5 3 team member perceptions of proposed objectives and actions as discussed in steps 4 and 5 in section 3 2 3 the survey was sent to each team member to ask for feedback on the goals objectives and actions the survey was a collective reflection on the result of individual reflective meetings which had two main aims first identifying actions members of the group would like to proceed with and second evaluating to what extent the group supports the actions the survey also helped in sharing suggestions understanding the variation in opinions within the group and evaluating to what extent individuals were able to critically reflect on their own work as discussed in section 3 2 4 there is an inherent subjectiveness about how the opinions of the team members should be aggregated that is not easily resolved therefore the results are reported according to all three rules consensus majority and score voting that allow the team members to form their own opinion around how to proceed the full table of results is shown in the supplementary materials in this section the main points of the survey results are discussed with a summary presented in table 1 it was hypothesised that adoption of new actions in this type of transdisciplinary project team is not a situation in which a majority rule is likely to be acceptable and indeed consensus is not expected so scoring approaches provide an alternative view as shown in table 1 the consensus method left most of the actions 35 actions out of 42 undetermined with just seven actions approved and none rejected the most approved actions were by the majority rule where 39 actions were approved and three actions were rejected when requiring a score greater than 4 14 most actions were considered as approved nevertheless five actions were rejected this result shows that even if these actions originated from individual reflective meetings most actions were supported by collective thinking seven actions received clear support meaning that there were no objections or hesitations and that team members were willing to apply them all ratings were 1 or 2 these actions consisted of improvements to the modelling process adopt version control for all modelling work and deciding on the model component specification in a meeting improving communication establish a project communications plan in the first step of the project and ensure that better communication is clearly incentivised not just deliverables and reports and in teamwork issues people fully supported the suggestion to report the stakeholder engagement process in regular formal meetings to other team members in order to consider it in the modelling process better team communication and improving team coherence to improve the modelling process and also the need for improved communication about decisions informing other team members about decisions and getting their reflection can help to make consistent decisions across the team a follow up survey regarding the voting rules indicated that consensus was not required a majority was considered sufficient but decisions by project leaders or nuanced discussion of implications would likely be more important than adoption of more complex voting rules such as the scoring rule there were six actions with different outcomes depending on the voting rule used supplementary materials table s2 based on the comments section in the survey these actions may not gain approval due to several common objections aversion to formal arrangements imposition on time and not enough knowledge or lack of clear explanation about the action aversion to formal arrangements could be a major factor for two actions where responsibilities were suggested and the majority were unwilling to accept or reject them the suggestion to send a formal reflection request with each document action 1 2 2 was undetermined according to the consensus rule and rejected according to majority and score rules four of the team members gave a score of zero suggesting they were unsure and only three team members supported it action 3 1 2 suggests having a defined position role within the team for integration no one was against this suggestion and it was approved by the score but did not achieve a majority as four people were unsure this action was therefore undetermined according to the consensus rule rejected by majority rule and approved by the score in these two actions 1 2 2 and 3 1 2 the possibility of being too rigid and not having flexibility was cautioned in comments and it was suggested to instead aim for an agile team where the project manager s role is distributed between team members which may require upskilling in agile practices the imposition on time is the main concern for three actions actions 1 1 7 1 1 8 and 2 3 2 which suggested having more regular documentation and increasing modellers involvement in the stakeholder workshops and discussions all three actions had just two opponents one person was unsure and four others supported the actions so they were approved by a majority however they were rejected by the score based on the comments from those two opponents time demands were a big concern about these suggestions mentioning time constraints and already overloaded duties the issue of restriction of time and budget raises the need for a rough cost and benefit analysis based on approximate salaries see supplementary materials a three round reflective m e would take around 21 h for team member reflection activities meetings surveys and discussions and 63 days of a reflective evaluator costing about 41 000 while this is a substantial cost it is quite reasonable given that the cost of 7 full time staff for 3 years is on the order of 2m given that the benefits of prevention of issues are difficult to estimate ex ante manager and funder perceptions are likely to be important as noted previously the team does consider reflection valuable if appropriate time and resources are set aside some actions were not clearly explained in the survey which might have affected the responses one example is the suggestion to use a pathway diagram action 4 2 2 as part of improving awareness of behavioural phenomena but it was not explicit enough and did not provide an example to clarify the suggested action team members mentioned that they were not confident enough of how to use the pathway diagram and being a new tool zare et al 2020 2019 its benefits are not well known so some team members indicated they were undetermined about this action although the other ones supported it therefore this action was undetermined according to the consensus rule and rejected according to majority and score rules as a final task in the m e team members were asked to give their overall comments and suggestions and if there were any missed actions that could support achieving each goal based on the received comments a new goal was suggested related to improving project planning design and setting objectives around impact pathways resourcing monitoring evaluation and learning three new actions were added 1 upskilling learning and teaching new skills based on the latest developments in research methods 2 adapting project management style by team consensus at the beginning of the project and 3 expanding activities to accomplish reflection via various means 6 discussion this research paper is an attempt to address the research question how can a team of researchers engage in formative reflective evaluation to improve their own iam pathway a formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluating process was designed for and applied to the campaspe catchment case study in attempting to establish a proof of concept for answering this question 6 1 the need for reflective monitoring and evaluation as discussed in section 2 2 the need for m e has been well highlighted in the literature m e processes should be adaptive and flexible in the face of complex problem solving interdisciplinary multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research where experts from various disciplines with different perspectives and value systems work together therefore this paper argues that increasing adoption of reflective practices can advance m e one mechanism for reflective m e is adjusting the project pathway in response to new information and knowledge gained through the process the suggested m e is thus a formative process that will help the research adapt to new information needs and changes and make the evaluation more effective and efficient rather than being a judgmental evaluation at the end of the process when it is too late to fix any failures the effect of improving awareness and transparency around decisions on successful and on time iteration and adaptation in the project process has been reported previously zare et al 2020 reflection or questioning our practices and decisions rather than just describing them helps team members to think critically in order to improve project decisions and learn from the experience it is also important to enable learning from the process and making subsequent recommendations for future actions and practices moallemi et al 2018 moreover reflecting on the process empowers deliberate or system 2 thinking kahneman 2011 which leads to more appropriate and informed decisions there is also benefit to be gained in specifically considering through m e the effects of beliefs biases heuristics and values bbhvs on decisions simon 1956 and consequently the opportunities to improve the taken pathway glynn et al 2017 moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 and during m e the dead ends failures and changes in decisions are reported which helps to prise open the black box aspect of the modelling process thereby playing a critical role in transparency and improving the pathway zare et al 2020 many changes in decisions were discussed in campaspe m e meetings where each team member described the story of the project reflected on the process and compared the planned version with what actually happened in this way the m e process helped improve the level of transparency as needed to establish trust in the process it was felt that this monitoring process would assist in making key decisions in a timely fashion and consequently would make the process more adaptive gregory et al 2006 in the campaspe case study reflection meetings section 3 2 2 the set of questions asked by the monitor helped the team members in making decisions about future changes by eliciting desired goals and actions 6 2 effectiveness of the formative and self reflective evaluation as mentioned previously the focus of this research was on demonstrating a designed self reflective m e process in an iwrm project a follow up survey indicated that team members were open to applying or testing this process again though not all saw clear benefits in this proof of concept due to its timing at a mature stage in the project see supplementary materials the results showed that actions suggested by individuals fit within collective goals and there was a shared understanding of the issues also the team members were aware of points which could improve their project participation and in a safe and nonjudgmental environment they were willing to share their ideas so there was no need for a third party to do an independent evaluation also the team members expressed their willingness to adapt their performance or way of working perhaps reinforced by expressing the opportunities to improve themselves rather than a third party telling them what the problem is and what they should do the reflective m e for campaspe project resulted in a set of goals objectives and actions for the next steps of the project and planned foresight studies on iwrm issues document analysis of project plans meeting notes and discussion memos enabled additional insight into what had transpired in the project and provided more transparency about the project and the decisions taken moreover it was seen that regular reflective meetings could support keeping the project more coherent efficient and on track by suggested actions which means being adaptive rather than sticking to strict planning beforehand in reflective meetings team members were critical about their own performance when they were asked to reflect on themselves this reflection is therefore a way of influencing behavioural phenomena affecting methodological choices one observation during the meetings was that the team members engaged constructively with a critical focus on their own decisions actions and performance rather than on that of other team members even when they acknowledged any drawback across the team still they strove to suggest a way that they could support others to overcome that problem at the time of this analysis the social farm and economy policy and ecology studies in the campaspe project had been completed but aspects of the surface water groundwater and integrated modelling were ongoing as was the scenario exploration and uncertainty analysis of the model therefore some team members were reflecting on past actions and others were reflecting on the ongoing process consequently the lessons of this paper s research and the report on the action plan are valuable outputs for the ongoing work in the project especially with respect to potential modifications in the final portion of the project pathway moreover the other disciplinary sectoral researchers who are not active in the project anymore felt that they could use the results as lessons learnt for forthcoming projects in step 5 of the process fig 2 a survey was used to obtain team member approval of the suggested actions and goals this was felt to be more appropriate for a team whose members have worked together for several years than a group discussion or a workshop the latter run the risk of increasing group thinking bias and experimenting with new reflection techniques can be a positive disruptor to the status quo the survey had the advantage of letting everyone reflect on the actions and goals at their own speed and time availability however a well designed workshop could be used instead of a survey or as a complement to it as a way of seeking consensus and increasing understanding of the discussed actions an attendant aspiration of this research was to evaluate to what extent individuals were able to reflect on their own work critically the results showed that the collective reflection and thinking through the survey accords well with the individual reflections in the reflective meetings 6 3 implementation challenges not surprisingly there were challenges and difficulties involved in designing and undertaking the formative and self reflective m e process fig 2 in a way that fits our purpose of improving the iam project pathway and the choices therein one of the challenges was acting in the critical and sensitive role of the reflexive monitor which requires a high degree of trust making fielke et al 2017 suggest that a reflexive monitor should primarily focus on the aspects of a project that are possible to influence as that will be most productive they discussed the importance of being open about what reflexive monitoring can achieve and the importance of clarifying the role of the monitor at the beginning of the project therefore at the same time as steps 1 2 fig 2 were carried out the monitor engaged informally with all team members briefly discussing the m e process and asking for advice this appeared to be helpful to foster an environment of trust and to create the space for reflection within the project team which is critical for reflective m e fielke et al 2017 as noted in section 2 1 there are misunderstandings and difficulties associated with defining applying and explaining reflective practice effectively finlay 2008 and reflection is sometimes seen as an unstructured process of criticizing and judging to point out drawbacks not having a practical tool and process of reflection practice could result in not practising it one of the main contributions of this research is stepping forward from the general quote of reflection is beneficial into designing and examining a practical process fig 2 the designed process can be used as a guideline and it is possible to customize it to fit the purpose of other projects hevner 2007 one of the critical points during the meetings was to play the role of facilitator and not to lead and influence the discussion the choice of follow up questions and their wording needed to remain nonjudgmental which is not always easy the key to the challenge of providing a safe reflective environment in this research without apportionment of blame was to focus the investigation on what questions rather than why questions section 3 2 2 what questions aim at the actions and events and ways to improve they are more action oriented and aligned with motivating people to think in terms of constructive actions rather than theorizing regarding past decisions eurich 2019 in contrast why questions can be limiting and invite biases and justifications the set of what so what and now what discussed in section 3 2 2 can also be thought of as covering past present and future actions this way of conducting the reflection proved to be a practical method to apply the schön 1983 description of reflective practice as a dialogue of thinking and doing through which one becomes more skilful 6 4 future of this research while the designed m e process was considered successful and appears promising for other applications it would be advantageous in future for the formative and reflective monitoring and evaluation be a part of any complex participatory project from the outset and to undertake it continuously in several stages to keep things simple the survey described the actions as alternatives whereas in reality it is likely that change will occur with groups or sequences of actions follow up exploration of alternative project governance arrangements may be of interest further research should be undertaken to investigate the effect of having a regular reflective m e on the iam pathway and on its outcomes when different theoretical underpinnings are used notably contrasting our more grounded approach with methods based on theory of change butler et al 2016 taplin and clark 2012 and other outcome focused evaluation frameworks for adaptive co management projects plummer and armitage 2007 and as a note of caution despite the benefits of applying formative and reflective m e in increasing awareness and control the negative effects of individual biases and behavioural influences team thinking bias might increase application of debiasing techniques generally is an important issue for future research and more research in this regard is worthwhile moallemi et al 2020 7 conclusions this paper argues for the need to combine conventional common evaluation approaches which typically ensue at the end of a project with an ongoing formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluating process from the outset to realise a more adaptive and effective modelling project a practical step by step monitoring and evaluation process has been designed and and tested here in a multidisciplinary project of integrated water resource assessment and modelling the enhanced m e process combines several approaches used in the literature including adopting a path perspective hämäläinen and lahtinen 2016 zare et al 2020 2019 focusing on behavioural phenomena glynn et al 2017 hämäläinen et al 2013 the use of reflective communication and meetings roux et al 2010 zare et al 2020 based on reflective practices gibbs 1988 schön 1983 reflexive evaluation arkesteijn et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 and monitoring and evaluation practices hassenforder et al 2016 van mierlo et al 2010 the formative and self reflective m e consists of six steps 1 review of documents 2 pathway assessment 3 reflective meetings 4 analysis 5 survey and 6 reporting the analysis demonstrates that a team of researchers can monitor and evaluate their own research effectively at least if they possess some experience in team projects thereby feeding into adaptive processes that benefit the project s success the results from the enhanced m e process were consistent with the observation that iwrm is in a maturity stage zare et al 2017 with the research team striving to focus on further improvements in behavioural management and operational factors to complement the success of technical aspects of the project this complementarity emphasises the importance of considering the modelling process as a socio technical process rather than a purely technical one and of providing well designed opportunities for expert practitioners to efficiently and comfortably express their ideas for improving that socio technical process credit authorship contribution statement

4684,recent literature on model evaluation has highlighted the need particularly in an interdisciplinary problem and team setting to go beyond the evaluation of results and outputs of a problem solving pathway process and monitor and evaluate the pathway itself to improve ongoing activities undertaken by the research team that best achieve the desired impact by reflecting on what decisions have been made the reasons influences and effects of each decision such evaluation can improve the learning process of stakeholders and researchers the authors have designed a formative self

keywords reflection evaluation monitoring pathways participatory modelling integrated water resources management 1 introduction the self reflective approach to monitoring and evaluation of interdisciplinary team research proposed in this paper is motivated by studies encountered by the authors in the field of integrated water resources management iwrm the approach applies equally well however to interdisciplinary team research in many settings it is well accepted that iwrm is above all a process ibisch et al 2016 molle 2008 that promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximise outcomes around economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems and the environment gwp 2000 as with most complex environmental problems requiring an interdisciplinary approach to their management the science and implementation of iwrm tends to require that integrated socio environmental systems ses modelling play a crucial role in the process integrated ses modelling attempts to represent the complexities between the human and biophysical drivers and associated outcomes of interest for which there are presently several software platforms kelly letcher et al 2013 the integrated modelling can involve several distinct or overlapping purposes that may include understanding the dynamics of the associated socio environmental system identifying and sharing perspectives of the different interest groups facilitating co learning among those groups and evaluating and communicating decision options for improving system outcomes e g badham et al 2019 kelly letcher et al 2013 zare et al 2017 these purposes largely require amalgamating structuring and sharing relevant knowledge from multiple scientific disciplines and the multiple perspectives of stakeholders researchers and when linked closely to policy decision makers jakeman and letcher 2003 laniak et al 2013 madani et al 2014 rotmans and van asselt 1996 voinov and bousquet 2010 zare et al 2019 integrated modelling in the water research sector in terms of publications at least has increased during the last 50 years and has passed its conception formation and practice stages and now is in a maturity stage zare et al 2017 like any other participatory and transdisciplinary research in its maturity stage integrated modelling research and practice benefits from applying reflexive approaches to dig deeper into and go beyond current practice popa et al 2015 seidl 2015 a common approach to such reflection involves evaluation of modelling projects often undertaken at the end of a modelling activity and for a single purpose usually model output assessment more complete evaluation perspectives are however being increasingly considered by viewing integrated modelling as a social and technical process that considers such contextual factors as project efficiency model accessibility credibility saliency legitimacy satisfaction application and impact hamilton et al 2019 this wider paradigm of recognising and assessing integrated modelling as a social process rather than just a technical procedure suggests there is a critical need to evaluate the pathway of the model development process and the product jakeman et al 2006 and not just the output and model results hamilton et al 2019 essentially such a pathway is an adaptively adjusted set of steps including decision forks and points for reflection and iteration zare et al 2020 it can be accompanied by a pathway diagram as a graphical illustration of the project s pathway this can be used to share as a common language and flexible framework to achieve a coherent description of a modelling process explicitly showing the steps involved and decisions and points at which stakeholders are involved zare et al 2019 the quality of practices used through the modelling pathway affects the results moallemi et al 2020 and in our case of integrated water assessment and modelling defines its effectiveness badham et al 2019 in response to the fact that traditional evaluation of the modelling pathway process typically happens if at all at the final output stage to assess the model and its results bandara 2007 researchers have argued for evaluation of the project pathway while the work is still ongoing alvarez et al 2010 badham et al 2019 hamilton et al 2019 the rationale for this is to understand and improve the effectiveness of both the immediate and any future modelling evaluation should be part of an iterative and adaptive process that links and has the potential to engage interested scientists decision makers interest groups and the broader public towards achieving impact beyond the merely technical performance of a model hamilton et al 2019 moreover the monitoring and evaluation process ideally is an integral activity during all steps of participatory planning processes hassenforder et al 2016 to help in realising an adaptive pathway that allows team members to aim for ambitious outcomes and modify their activities over time to achieve them van mierlo et al 2010 process evaluation in turn relies on transparency about the research process particularly the value laden assumptions and subjective choices made by modellers khatami et al 2019 van der sluijs 2002 the perceptions of both the problem and results are largely dependent on the cumulative effects of individual choices at each decision fork moallemi et al 2020 these methodological choices are influenced by a variety of human factors such as different cognitive behavioural and mental frameworks as well as the biases beliefs heuristics experiences and values of those involved glynn et al 2017 hämäläinen et al 2013 madani and khatami 2015 although the need for a new paradigm of evaluation in modelling has previously been highlighted hamilton et al 2019 hansson and polk 2018 little attention has been paid to developing and testing the practical processes required to deliver on these evaluation needs evaluation of an ongoing modelling process in transdisciplinary and complex problem solving projects such as occurs in the iwrm context that considers human factors needs critical systemic and reflexive approaches arkesteijn et al 2015 reflexive monitoring approaches encourage the practitioners and researchers to observe analyse reflect and adjust their actions van mierlo et al 2010 purposeful and ongoing reflection through the integrated modelling pathway is particularly vital to facilitate the necessary and timely iteration and consequently to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the modelling process zare et al 2020 reflexive monitoring as treated here is based on the reflective practices literature thus section 2 discusses the insights from reflective practices and the distinctions between different forms of reflexivity in more detail this paper designs and applies a formative and self reflective approach to monitoring and evaluation specifically tailored to an iwrm project in the campaspe catchment in north central victoria which is part of the murray darling basin australia the campaspe project is being implemented by a specialist team of interdisciplinary researchers see section 3 1 largely from the integrated catchment assessment and management centre icam at the australian national university which has a focus on integrated catchment modelling and assessment the lead author who led the evaluation process is affiliated with icam but did not have any role in the campaspe project other than evaluating it as an involved outsider discussed in section 2 3 over the last two decades icam researchers have engaged with the topic of evaluation from different perspectives initially the evaluation focus was on the evaluation of the model performance against its objectives e g bennett et al 2013 jakeman et al 2006 subsequent augmentation of this has included evaluation in the context of limited data hamilton et al 2015 and analysis of success factors of modelling outcomes as learnt from 15 australian water resource projects in which icam was involved merritt et al 2017 recent work has provided a comprehensive overview of the process methods and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of modelling projects hamilton et al 2019 as well as providing a comprehensive list of procedural questions to consider at the different phases and steps of the modelling process badham et al 2019 this paper is the latest stage in this evolving journey focusing on the research question how can a team of researchers engage in formative reflective evaluation to improve the effectiveness of their own integrated modelling pathway and the choices therein the remainder of the article is organised as follows section 2 presents foundational concepts of reflective and reflexive approaches the distinction between them and their connection with evaluation it also discusses relevant literature on facilitation of a reflexive monitoring process section 3 presents the case study and the monitoring and evaluation process developed the data analysis and results of the monitoring and evaluation of the case study are presented in section 4 which includes results with respect to the pathway of the project opportunities for improvement arising from reflective meetings and team member perceptions of proposed actions section 5 discusses the insights gained from this research 2 insights from reflective practices 2 1 what is a reflective approach the need to shift from conventional common evaluation approaches which are largely summative to formative approaches is more critical in multidisciplinary projects facing complex issues in such projects effective adaptation in response to changing circumstances is essential hamilton et al 2019 zare 2020 formative evaluation occurs during a process so as to modify the activities involved to improve that process patton 2006 result oriented evaluation or impact evaluation judges the gained results against the objectives set for the project while a reflective approach facilitates and provokes an ongoing and integral activity to enable adaptivity during the project roux et al 2010 it is believed that evaluation leads to reflection but experience suggests this is rarely the case roux et al 2010 therefore it is recommended to explicitly plan for and adopt reflective communication and documentation to identify pitfalls along the project pathway and adapt that path in a timely fashion to new information and circumstances zare et al 2020 the definition of reflection may differ among disciplines and even within a discipline finlay 2008 but is commonly described as a dynamic open unpredictable and deliberate process in which people think about past or ongoing experience to evaluate inform and improve future choices decisions or actions collier 2010 reynolds 2011 zare et al 2020 a reflective cycle is a process of reflection which involves a number of steps that involve describing the event and situation expressing the sentiments and thinking around it then assessing and analysing it and finally concluding and setting an action plan gibbs 1988 reflection is recognised as an important factor to strengthen multi disciplinary inter disciplinary and transdisciplinary research consortia cochrane et al 2017 popa et al 2015 wickson et al 2006 it can provide a systematic and critical approach to increase awareness of researchers about influencing factors such as biases beliefs values heuristics and thinking methods on the decisions and choices during the journey along the modelling pathway moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 these influencing factors impact the problem conceptualisation as well as the development of the method of investigation and the solution moallemi and köhler 2019 wickson et al 2006 therefore reflection is recommended to practitioners to craft active and aware decisions and to be more conscious of their practice collier 2010 schön 1983 while reflection suggests observing and examining our practice and decisions as objectively as possible reflexivity however is regarded as a subjective process of actually exposing or questioning the reasons behind our practice including surfacing assumptions innate biases beliefs heuristics and values in other words reflexivity is a complexification of thinking and experience or thinking about the experience which is related to but qualitatively different from reflection hibbert et al 2010 in social processes reflexivity refers to a collaborative process of acknowledgement critical deliberation and mutual learning on values assumptions and understandings that might produce new meanings heuristics and stakeholder identities popa et al 2015 we use self reflection interchangeably with reflexivity meaning a process of critically thinking and examining one s practices and decisions in order to learn from it and which might lead to change in the decisions we recognise that other definitions are possible and that reflexivity and reflection are sometimes used interchangeably chivers 2003 finlay 2008 hibbert et al 2010 reflective practice which schön 1983 discusses at length is linked closely with problem solving research approaches and forms of enquiry the need for more widespread reflective practice is highlighted in several studies because more theoretically driven research sometimes lacks a sense of critical distance or reflexivity about its own products and procedures ball 1997 botha et al 2017 outlined the need for reflexive monitoring to support processes of co innovation and their institutional embedding mauthner and doucet 2003 argued the need for reflexivity in qualitative data analysis to improve awareness of influential issues affecting one s analysis such as the context of research and assumptions in data based methods thus self reflection counters the biases that the researcher brings to their research in order to conduct self reflection the researchers and practitioners should be motivated open minded and self aware to be able to describe experiences critically analyse them connect new to existing knowledge and make judgements about the value of experience atkins and murphy 1993 2 2 reflexive monitoring evaluation a distinct literature exists on reflexive monitoring and evaluation m e which involves team members reflecting on a project and their performance to support learning from the exchange of ideas and reflection rijswijk et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 reflexive m e encourages participants to regularly reflect on aims practices and other aspects of the project thereby helping to keep a project coherent and efficient whilst avoiding mapping out and committing to an inflexible pathway beforehand van mierlo et al 2010 a reflexive m e approach can take the form of individual or collective reflection collective or communal reflection in addition to individual reflection is critical for transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research such as in the iwrm context because individuals or groups from multiple disciplines and perspectives inform and transform each other throughout the project pathway in respects that cannot typically be captured by a single individual wickson et al 2006 the reflection should happen frequently zare 2020 suggested the use of reflective communication at the end of each project phase to validate confirm or debunk results and or the success of the phase and to assist in efficiently reaching objectives by identifying the need for iteration as early as possible as one example of reflexive m e roux et al 2010 suggested a framework to facilitate the co reflection process during a transdisciplinary research project in order to help shape the processes behaviours and relationships required for achieving the goal they argued that the suggested framework and co reflection process could help achieve social learning and broad accountability across the stakeholders to enable learning by doing in the co reflection process they argued that supportive regular co reflection workshops should take place from the commencement of a program the interactive learning approach regeer et al 2009 is another example which used reflexivity from a similar point of view van mierlo et al 2010 suggest a reflexive monitoring cycle as a practical guideline to put that reflexive monitoring into practice which is aligned with the reflective cycle gibbs 1988 the reflexive monitoring cycle consists of observation of what is happening in the project analysis which can be performed by a monitor or the project manager alone or together with the project participants a collective analysis to clarify the various perspectives of the participants and finally reflection on assumptions and values personal actions and other topics based on the preceding steps and potentially adjustment and adaptation of the project reflexive m e approaches bear some similarity in methods to other iterative evaluation approaches but differ in their emphasis for instance holzer et al 2018 suggest an iterative approach to evaluate transdisciplinary research on socio ecological systems the suggested approach uses in depth interviews to understand the context of research and examples of successes and failures in a subsequent step a survey is used to collect quantitative data from a larger group the analysis of which feeds into focus group discussions and a final report a deliberate strength of this approach is the use of multiple complementary methods of data collection that adaptively build on each other within a grounded theory context without prior hypotheses the emphasis however is on collecting data rather than specifically to facilitate reflection by the project participants themselves 2 3 facilitation of a reflective monitoring process embedding reflective evaluation into transdisciplinary research is not always easy as it challenges skillsets identities and role perceptions of researchers a facilitator can provide useful support to ensure that reflective evaluation is carried out with an open spirit and no intent to blame rijswijk et al 2015 labelled this role a reflexive monitor who helps the team to challenge and change assumptions practices and underlying institutions in the design or management of a project through an on going process of evaluation in an action research setting the reflexive monitor role is context dependent and there is no fixed recipe for it however focusing on developing solutions to a problem and taking a flexible adaptive approach are essential elements in ensuring that monitoring and evaluation are effective a spectrum for reflexive monitors ranges from appreciative inquiry to critical analysis rijswijk et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 in an appreciative inquiry role the reflexive monitor is an involved participant in the project and helps to build a safe environment for the team to find solutions based on what works within the project in a critical analysis role the reflexive monitor is an involved outsider and helps to build insights within the project team a reflexive monitor can be somewhere between these two ends based on the context and the situation and their role might change during the project from one side to the other side of the spectrum it is crucial that the monitor not fulfil too many other tasks within the project to help maintain a critical analysis the monitors can help keep the level of ambition up in the team by asking appreciative questions to facilitate valuable reflection rijswijk et al 2015 in this paper we use the term monitor to refer to individuals designing implementing and managing the self reflective monitoring and evaluation process in the campaspe the first author the monitor was not responsible for any project component but was involved in many workshops and meetings as an observer and therefore could be placed near the critical analysis end of the spectrum as an involved outsider rijswijk et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 according to rolfe et al 2001 the reflexive monitor can ask three simple forms of questions to facilitate reflection on a situation what so what and now what what is the problem was my role happened were the consequences so what was going through my mind should i have done do i know about what happened now now what do i need to do broader issues have been raised might happen now the first question covers the descriptive level of reflection the second question aims for theory and knowledge building the final question can make the most significant contribution to practice rolfe et al 2001 because it precisely asks about essential action to change the situation more generally an in depth reflective interview is reported to be an important effective tool chivers 2003 and has been used in other project evaluation research in an instructive example kunseler et al 2015 examined two foresight projects of the pbl netherlands environmental assessment agency to explore how foresight researchers in practice attempt to balance salience credibility and legitimacy while generating knowledge in interaction with policy makers and other social actors they collected data using participant observation interviewing and document analysis they became actively involved in the projects and contributed to team evaluation they used an evaluation form with open ended questions which gave the team member the ability to express his or her individual experiences of the process they complemented these reflection forms with a group discussion to reflect upon these experiences and identify lessons learnt as well as with interviews of internal peers who were distantly involved or experts in the topic who helped to complete the lessons learnt the combination of individual and group reflection guided by a monitor is a common tool that is adopted here 3 campaspe project integrated assessment of water allocation and use opportunities this paper describes reflection on the campaspe integrated assessment and modelling iam project which started in 2012 and whilst mature in that the associated integrated model had largely been built was ongoing at the time of this research in order to explore scenarios and undertake uncertainty assessments this project was initiated as a partnership between the murray darling basin authority mdba the australian national university anu and flinders university focused on the campaspe catchment which is located in north central victoria and part of the murray darling basin in australia fig 1 the aim of the project was to conduct an integrated assessment of water allocation and use opportunities in the campaspe partly in response to but going beyond the shorter term issues in the murray darling basin plan iwanaga et al 2020 which defines environmental objectives such as increasing water availability for the environment north central catchment management authority 2014 the project team includes expertise in the social sciences hydrology climatology hydrogeology policy ecology agriculture economics computer science and in participatory integrated assessment and modelling an integrated modelling exercise was devised and used to study interactions between natural and human systems going beyond the mdb plan s specific objectives with respect to quantifying industry water diversions that are environmentally sustainable the integrated model and an associated engagement process were developed to study the consequences of various possible futures that considers climate water policy both current policy and conjunctive surface groundwater use innovations and on farm irrigation management on outcomes that include indicators related to groundwater sustainability farm profits and river ecology the model is described in iwanaga et al 2020 2018 stakeholders were involved at all stages of the integrated assessment and modelling from scoping to problem framing and formulation to model parameterisation and evaluation of assessment outcomes through several workshops meetings and interviews ticehurst and curtis 2019 the pathway taken by the project is further analysed in section 4 1 4 method formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluation of the campaspe project the formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluation process undertaken consists of six steps fig 2 this process was designed based on a synthesis of methods from a number of sources gibbs 1988 holzer et al 2018 kunseler et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 zare et al 2020 to fit the needs and general context of the campaspe project this m e process for the project was designed and applied once during 2019 when the social farm and economy policy and ecology studies in the campaspe project had been completed but surface water groundwater and integrated modelling were still ongoing it was applied to test its usefulness and as a proof of concept the time steps of any m e exercise will depend on the nature and the duration of project but for a project like the campaspe one that involves several disciplines and sectors a reflective activity about every year seems needed and we expect that every six months may be better in the first step of our formative and self reflective m e the documents of the project were reviewed by the monitor to understand research goals priorities and the history of events activities decisions and outputs and then a pathway assessment was constructed step 2 in the third step the monitor carried out a reflective meeting with one team member from each project component covering the social sciences hydrology climatology hydrogeology policy ecology agriculture economics computer science and in participatory integrated assessment and modelling a total of 10 meetings most of the components comprised one main researcher whereas social and groundwater had more than one although all were invited it was decided to nominate just one researcher from each discipline to undertake the reflection meeting analysis of qualitative data from those meetings was the next step in order to identify perceived strengths weaknesses successes and failures based on the resulting list of goals objectives and actions a survey was designed to obtain team members feedback on the identified opportunities to improve the project pathway and those activities needed to achieve that aim lastly a report of approved actions based on the collective reflective survey was compiled and sent to team members the next sub sections discuss this process in more detail 4 1 step 1 2 review of documents pathway assessment in the first step of the formative and self reflective m e process fig 2 the project plan and documents were reviewed to understand the goals objectives achievements challenges and to characterise the pathway of the project furthermore team members were asked to provide all the documents relating to their discipline sector project component that they had produced and used to communicate as well as any feedback and reflection that they received about those documents from stakeholders other team members or decision makers the received documents were then studied and analysed a pathway diagram as defined in section 1 was produced based on the documents step 2 naturally reflecting the context and circumstances of the project zare et al 2019 these two interlinked steps and the resulting pathway diagram helped the reflexive monitor to gain sufficient knowledge and attain a holistic understanding of the project before initiating the reflective meetings 4 2 step 3 reflective meetings the m e process continued with a series of reflective meetings facilitated by the monitor each meeting involved the first author as the involved outsider monitor and one of the team members who was responsible for a specific discipline sectoral study at the start of each meeting its purpose was clarified as being an evaluation of the campaspe project collecting their reflections to improve the next steps as well as the pathways for future projects and the m e process to date was explained as well the pathway diagram was provided as a reference to help recall events and to prompt comments on them the monitor facilitated the meeting with a semi structured agenda and asked general open ended questions consistent with the suggestions of rolfe et al 2001 so as to focus on what so what and now what section 2 3 in this case the questions used included what are your general reflections on the project so what are the lessons learnt that you think are worth passing on to others and now what do you suggest others should adopt or avoid what are the decisions that you wouldn t make if you were in the same situation again so what will you change if you were to start the campaspe project again any change in decisions taken approaches and activities now what do you think could improve the campaspe project pathway the monitor used the questions as prompts to facilitate the discussion rather than driving it gibbs 1988 the interview continued with a discussion on the interesting ideas and issues that emerged during the reflection an underlying aim was to establish an atmosphere of trust regarded as critical to facilitate such interviews and produce an open reflection because the fear of mistakes could cause avoidance of creative thinking and prevent learning lahtinen et al 2017 which is one of the values of reflection notes were taken immediately after the meetings rather than during them in order to keep discussion informal the reports of the conducted semi structured meetings were sent back to the participants who were requested to carefully look at whether the summaries reflected their views and to edit explain or expand any points that they wished as is standard practice for ensuring validity in qualitative analysis creswell 2003 4 3 step 4 5 analysing the reflective meetings survey during the reflective meetings some issues were identified by team members to improve change or adapt the process the meetings also identified good practices to be kept and continued in step four a collective list consisting of issues and good practices confirmed by individual team members was made along with associated suggested actions and goals about different aspects of the project this list was structured into overall goals subordinate objectives and related actions some actions points or goals emerged at several points during individual meetings and some suggested actions were added by the monitor based on literature in order to complete the description of objectives the structured list of goals objectives and actions was then formulated as a survey to elicit collective reflection on the next steps a survey can be considered as a light weight alternative to a co reflection workshop roux et al 2010 it was sent to the team members in order to get their approval of whether they thought that each action would be effective or not and whether they would be willing to apply it or not figure s1 in the supplementary materials displays the survey interface the following description of the survey was sent to the team this survey is intended to support reflection on research practices within our group it includes five pages discussing four goals with several possible objectives we could aim for and specific actions we can take these ideas have mostly come out directly from discussions about the campaspe project with some suggested based on the interpretation of discussions and review of the project documents the four different goals identified are improving documentation improving communication improving project process and improving modelling process the question now is what actions do we think would be effective and worth pursuing and are there any other goals objectives or actions which you think we need to consider 4 4 step 6 results analysis and reporting at the final step the results of the survey were analysed and reported to the team the report was sent to everyone who was involved in the evaluation the primary result from the survey comprises the raw rating data based on the distribution of ratings for each action a five degree effectiveness range 2 1 0 1 2 was utilised where if someone selected an action to be ineffective and they would not apply it then the value of that action is 2 and if the action is considered effective and they would apply it the value is 2 with seven respondents the total score therefore ranges from 14 to 14 there are many ways in which individual ratings of the actions could be aggregated to determine which actions should be implemented this uncertainty is recognised by evaluating the results in multiple ways the rating data are aggregated in three ways with a consensus rule majority rule and score voting rule with respect to the consensus rule only actions that all team members support i e assigning a score of 1 or 2 were accepted and actions that all team members opposed i e score of 2 or 1 were rejected with the majority rule actions with majority support i e four or more team members out of seven were accepted and actions that the majority opposed were rejected with the score voting rule the score of each action was calculated and actions were considered accepted when they had a total score above a threshold 4 out of 14 for all rules the classification of actions that were neither accepted nor rejected was considered to be indeterminate 5 data analysis and results this section is organized around the following parts first the pathway diagram for the project is described and discussed second potential opportunities for improvement in the project are presented as a list of goals objectives and actions which are the result of reflective meetings and finally the results of the survey based on team member perceptions of proposed objectives and actions are discussed 5 1 pathway diagram the pathway diagram fig 3 was outlined based on collected project documents it shows communication activities such as the meetings between team members team and stakeholders team and steering committee it also shows the outputs and the documentations the diagram is recognised to be only as complete and accurate as the documents used to create it the first version of the diagram was presented in the reflective meetings which helped to fill some gaps as expected the effort to outline the pathway diagram was found to be a learning by doing process which helped the monitor to gain more knowledge about the project and acquire a holistic perspective on the process also during the reflective meetings it helped the team members in recalling the process the decision forks and activities in order to reflect on them and in illustrating specific opportunities for improvement with nearly all team members referring to it at some point to clarify their explanations and collectively it helped the monitor and team members to build a shared and clear understanding of the project the aim of using the pathway diagram is to facilitate dialogue in the reflective meetings by providing a shared reference point and the current level of detail fits this purpose however the pathway diagram could be used as a communication and documentation tool which would require more detail about decisions zare et al 2020 the campaspe project was a complex project which involved several disciplines working together such that going into the next level of detail in the diagramming i e individual decisions would make it too complicated to understand in a reflective meeting more details about the participatory process and modelling decisions are published by ticehurst and curtis 2019 5 2 opportunities for improvement the team members are overall quite experienced in integrated assessment and modelling so unsurprisingly the project has produced insights into future opportunities in the management of water in the catchment as well as an understanding of the interplay of factors affecting catchment health e g iwanaga et al 2018 as iam dictates the project operates with participatory and collaborative features as essential underpinnings to success in terms of processes the project follows best practices in model scoping and development listening to stakeholders and building the model according to their needs badham et al 2019 jakeman et al 2006 the model developed in the project also shows promise to feed into further analyses and there is anecdotal evidence that initial discussions with stakeholders have prompted further work towards operationalising conjunctive water use principles given that the development of iam is in a maturity stage zare et al 2017 team members recognised the need to support further progress by examining project practices more deeply and were keen to join the first author s experiment in designing and testing an m e reflexive process to sharpen their practices thus the emphasis in this paper is on improvements in practices and so the positive aspects of the project are not further discussed here analysis of the reflective meetings resulted in potential improvements that can be placed in four main categories documentation communication project process and modelling process table 1 the following section provides more detail on each issue where possible goals and actions are tied to the case study but in general they are presented at a relatively high level and details are omitted to protect the privacy of individuals the list of actions for each objective is outlined in the supplementary materials table s1 the numbering in the next sections refer to goal objective and action numbers respectively 5 2 1 goal 1 improving documentation during the reflective meetings a lack of sufficient and effective documentation was identified as an underlying cause of several issues and delays in the project in this regard improving documentation coverage reflection and management of project documents have been set as achievable objectives and for each of these objectives several actions are suggested the project evaluation suggested that there is a need to enhance and refine the coverage of documentation objective 1 1 in such a way that the entire research process is transparent and clear thus it was proposed that the documentation should materialise regularly actions 1 1 7 1 1 8 with sufficient information and the level of detail should cover the decisions and methodological options in such a way as to be as transparent as possible actions 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 6 the need for planning the documentation in the first step of the project was highlighted action 1 1 2 and metadata summaries and easy to understand fact sheets for each document could convey the meaning and aim of each document to people who will not read the detail actions 1 1 4 1 1 5 objective 1 2 suggests increasing the amount of reflection that was undertaken during the project in addition to expanding the current level coverage and frequency of reflection activities action 1 2 1 formalisation of requests to reflect on documentation and specifically on choices made could accelerate the reflection process actions 1 2 2 and 1 2 3 some reflection activities had already been performed fig 3 and these have supported project adaptivity however more structured reflection activities to perform the reflection are suggested furthermore it was considered that the process of creating sharing using and managing the knowledge and information within the team between the team and other parties could be expanded objective 1 3 namely the project team could improve management and organisation of documents and files to keep up to date and easy to access records of the project including through document management action 1 3 1 version control action 1 3 2 and folder structures action 1 3 4 also responsibility for project knowledge management could be assigned as a formal role action 1 3 3 5 2 2 goal 2 improving communication the second goal aims to further improve communication during the project in order to strengthen the ability of the team to consistently achieve a project pathway that is more transparent agile adaptive and effective three objectives were set in order to achieve this overarching goal focusing on improving each aspect of communication in this type of project 1 communication between team members 2 communication between the team and external partners and 3 communication between stakeholders and modellers improving communication among team members can further enhance the transfer of knowledge within the team which is crucial to achieving integrated research success as well as producing an integrated model it was seen that the communication between team members objective 2 1 could benefit from planning for communication in the first phase of the project action 2 1 1 holding more regular formal meetings and additional informal gatherings and team bonding activities actions 2 1 2 and 2 1 3 objective 2 2 dealt with identifying possible improvements to communication with external partners who were recognised throughout the project to be an important part of the team objective 2 2 collaborating with external partners is a valuable way to use others expertise but it requires managing communication and improving mutual project management in a way that distance and differences in work style do not reduce the efficiency of the project it was suggested to have additional more regular meetings and communications with external partners actions 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 besides explicitly appointing someone such as leader or project manager specifically assigned to manage external partner interactions action 2 2 3 the general understanding of the project its aim process and outputs would benefit from improvement in the communication between stakeholders and modellers objective 2 3 thereby integrating stakeholders ideas more opportunely into the modelling process and better enabling their reflection on the modelling process this communication would be more effective if modellers were involved more frequently in stakeholder engagement workshops action 2 3 1 and also if the results of other workshops were reported to modellers regularly action 2 3 2 in the campaspe project regular meetings of the research group significantly enhanced its ability to be reflective meetings happened at different levels such as within two disciplines e g policy and social all disciplines all team members team and stakeholders team and steering committee and social research group with stakeholders fig 4 illustrates these interactions through the meetings the communication within the team was mostly through the integrated modelling group person and at their request 5 2 3 goal 3 improving project process during the reflective meetings many issues were raised around the iam process and the need for facilitating integration throughout the project objective 3 1 and improving project effectiveness and efficiency objective 3 2 in this regard improved documentation and communication as considered in the previous objectives are valuable action 3 1 3 another suggestion was assigning a person in a project manager or synthesis position to facilitate the collaboration within the team action 3 1 1 and a synthesis position with a proper amount of time expertise and authority action 3 1 2 it was felt this would be beneficial even though the team members were experienced in iam project collaboration however the constrained budget would have made it difficult to have such a synthesis position another specific suggestion involved the suggestion of organizing brainstorming meetings between modellers and social scientists to enhance the extant connection between the social studies and the modelling process action 3 2 4 furthermore improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of the project pathway is always possible with any complex interdisciplinary project with a constrained budget objective 3 2 project management issues budget time efficiency etc could be given more dedicated attention to optimise the use of resources regular and ongoing planning action 3 2 1 preferably as a team activity action 3 2 2 was seen as valuable to assist in enhancing the effectiveness objective with a less limited budget a dedicated project manager could be assigned to improve project effectiveness and efficiency not just to facilitate collaboration and integration action 3 2 3 in a follow up survey team members responded that reflective m e would be valuable for the project if the extra time and resources would be budgeted for reflection activities they were more than willing to take part in more reflective m e activities if the time and budget needed were considered and available from the outset of the project because they saw value in reflective m e and not just for improving the current project they also valued the benefit for future projects especially those involving multi issue multi institutional endeavours with large teams it was viewed as particularly useful to communicate about differences and lessons learnt 5 2 4 goal 4 improving the modelling process the fourth goal aims to improve the modelling process in addition to improving efficiency objective 4 1 improved awareness around behavioural phenomena such as biases beliefs values and heuristics e g glynn 2017 glynn et al 2017 moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 affecting the pathway could assist in controlling their negative side effects objective 4 2 it was established that the efficiency of the modelling process could be improved by an accumulation of several actions such as instituting model testing practices continuously action 4 1 1 and confirming details of the data sets and key assumptions in group meetings to avoid inconsistencies action 4 1 2 similarly sharing each model component specification with other team members in a meeting was considered important to reduce the time to achieve compatibility between model components action 4 1 3 further expanding the use of version control action 4 1 4 is suggested not just for managing code but as a way of structuring software development helping to manage versions of the model and of communication between modellers of different disciplines enhanced communication and more coherent processes in general action 4 1 5 as discussed in previous goals could also improve the modelling process additionally the team suggested that the project could benefit more from exploring and discussing techniques that could be used to either address changes that unexpectedly constrain a pathway or seek new opportunities to advance the project action 4 1 6 three actions were suggested to deal with the negative effects of behavioural phenomena such as biases beliefs values and heuristics on choices and to reduce the risk of taking poor paths in the project glynn 2017 glynn et al 2017 moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 the first action in this respect is to apply debiasing techniques danielsen 2015 such as using a devil s advocate to decrease status quo bias within the team and increase awareness around decisions status quo bias is the tendency for people to like things to stay relatively the same and not to use new techniques methods and tools action 4 2 1 applying pathway diagrams action 4 2 2 and better communication about decisions action 4 2 3 are the other suggested actions to improve awareness around behavioural phenomena and control their negative effects 5 3 team member perceptions of proposed objectives and actions as discussed in steps 4 and 5 in section 3 2 3 the survey was sent to each team member to ask for feedback on the goals objectives and actions the survey was a collective reflection on the result of individual reflective meetings which had two main aims first identifying actions members of the group would like to proceed with and second evaluating to what extent the group supports the actions the survey also helped in sharing suggestions understanding the variation in opinions within the group and evaluating to what extent individuals were able to critically reflect on their own work as discussed in section 3 2 4 there is an inherent subjectiveness about how the opinions of the team members should be aggregated that is not easily resolved therefore the results are reported according to all three rules consensus majority and score voting that allow the team members to form their own opinion around how to proceed the full table of results is shown in the supplementary materials in this section the main points of the survey results are discussed with a summary presented in table 1 it was hypothesised that adoption of new actions in this type of transdisciplinary project team is not a situation in which a majority rule is likely to be acceptable and indeed consensus is not expected so scoring approaches provide an alternative view as shown in table 1 the consensus method left most of the actions 35 actions out of 42 undetermined with just seven actions approved and none rejected the most approved actions were by the majority rule where 39 actions were approved and three actions were rejected when requiring a score greater than 4 14 most actions were considered as approved nevertheless five actions were rejected this result shows that even if these actions originated from individual reflective meetings most actions were supported by collective thinking seven actions received clear support meaning that there were no objections or hesitations and that team members were willing to apply them all ratings were 1 or 2 these actions consisted of improvements to the modelling process adopt version control for all modelling work and deciding on the model component specification in a meeting improving communication establish a project communications plan in the first step of the project and ensure that better communication is clearly incentivised not just deliverables and reports and in teamwork issues people fully supported the suggestion to report the stakeholder engagement process in regular formal meetings to other team members in order to consider it in the modelling process better team communication and improving team coherence to improve the modelling process and also the need for improved communication about decisions informing other team members about decisions and getting their reflection can help to make consistent decisions across the team a follow up survey regarding the voting rules indicated that consensus was not required a majority was considered sufficient but decisions by project leaders or nuanced discussion of implications would likely be more important than adoption of more complex voting rules such as the scoring rule there were six actions with different outcomes depending on the voting rule used supplementary materials table s2 based on the comments section in the survey these actions may not gain approval due to several common objections aversion to formal arrangements imposition on time and not enough knowledge or lack of clear explanation about the action aversion to formal arrangements could be a major factor for two actions where responsibilities were suggested and the majority were unwilling to accept or reject them the suggestion to send a formal reflection request with each document action 1 2 2 was undetermined according to the consensus rule and rejected according to majority and score rules four of the team members gave a score of zero suggesting they were unsure and only three team members supported it action 3 1 2 suggests having a defined position role within the team for integration no one was against this suggestion and it was approved by the score but did not achieve a majority as four people were unsure this action was therefore undetermined according to the consensus rule rejected by majority rule and approved by the score in these two actions 1 2 2 and 3 1 2 the possibility of being too rigid and not having flexibility was cautioned in comments and it was suggested to instead aim for an agile team where the project manager s role is distributed between team members which may require upskilling in agile practices the imposition on time is the main concern for three actions actions 1 1 7 1 1 8 and 2 3 2 which suggested having more regular documentation and increasing modellers involvement in the stakeholder workshops and discussions all three actions had just two opponents one person was unsure and four others supported the actions so they were approved by a majority however they were rejected by the score based on the comments from those two opponents time demands were a big concern about these suggestions mentioning time constraints and already overloaded duties the issue of restriction of time and budget raises the need for a rough cost and benefit analysis based on approximate salaries see supplementary materials a three round reflective m e would take around 21 h for team member reflection activities meetings surveys and discussions and 63 days of a reflective evaluator costing about 41 000 while this is a substantial cost it is quite reasonable given that the cost of 7 full time staff for 3 years is on the order of 2m given that the benefits of prevention of issues are difficult to estimate ex ante manager and funder perceptions are likely to be important as noted previously the team does consider reflection valuable if appropriate time and resources are set aside some actions were not clearly explained in the survey which might have affected the responses one example is the suggestion to use a pathway diagram action 4 2 2 as part of improving awareness of behavioural phenomena but it was not explicit enough and did not provide an example to clarify the suggested action team members mentioned that they were not confident enough of how to use the pathway diagram and being a new tool zare et al 2020 2019 its benefits are not well known so some team members indicated they were undetermined about this action although the other ones supported it therefore this action was undetermined according to the consensus rule and rejected according to majority and score rules as a final task in the m e team members were asked to give their overall comments and suggestions and if there were any missed actions that could support achieving each goal based on the received comments a new goal was suggested related to improving project planning design and setting objectives around impact pathways resourcing monitoring evaluation and learning three new actions were added 1 upskilling learning and teaching new skills based on the latest developments in research methods 2 adapting project management style by team consensus at the beginning of the project and 3 expanding activities to accomplish reflection via various means 6 discussion this research paper is an attempt to address the research question how can a team of researchers engage in formative reflective evaluation to improve their own iam pathway a formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluating process was designed for and applied to the campaspe catchment case study in attempting to establish a proof of concept for answering this question 6 1 the need for reflective monitoring and evaluation as discussed in section 2 2 the need for m e has been well highlighted in the literature m e processes should be adaptive and flexible in the face of complex problem solving interdisciplinary multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research where experts from various disciplines with different perspectives and value systems work together therefore this paper argues that increasing adoption of reflective practices can advance m e one mechanism for reflective m e is adjusting the project pathway in response to new information and knowledge gained through the process the suggested m e is thus a formative process that will help the research adapt to new information needs and changes and make the evaluation more effective and efficient rather than being a judgmental evaluation at the end of the process when it is too late to fix any failures the effect of improving awareness and transparency around decisions on successful and on time iteration and adaptation in the project process has been reported previously zare et al 2020 reflection or questioning our practices and decisions rather than just describing them helps team members to think critically in order to improve project decisions and learn from the experience it is also important to enable learning from the process and making subsequent recommendations for future actions and practices moallemi et al 2018 moreover reflecting on the process empowers deliberate or system 2 thinking kahneman 2011 which leads to more appropriate and informed decisions there is also benefit to be gained in specifically considering through m e the effects of beliefs biases heuristics and values bbhvs on decisions simon 1956 and consequently the opportunities to improve the taken pathway glynn et al 2017 moallemi et al 2020 zare et al 2020 and during m e the dead ends failures and changes in decisions are reported which helps to prise open the black box aspect of the modelling process thereby playing a critical role in transparency and improving the pathway zare et al 2020 many changes in decisions were discussed in campaspe m e meetings where each team member described the story of the project reflected on the process and compared the planned version with what actually happened in this way the m e process helped improve the level of transparency as needed to establish trust in the process it was felt that this monitoring process would assist in making key decisions in a timely fashion and consequently would make the process more adaptive gregory et al 2006 in the campaspe case study reflection meetings section 3 2 2 the set of questions asked by the monitor helped the team members in making decisions about future changes by eliciting desired goals and actions 6 2 effectiveness of the formative and self reflective evaluation as mentioned previously the focus of this research was on demonstrating a designed self reflective m e process in an iwrm project a follow up survey indicated that team members were open to applying or testing this process again though not all saw clear benefits in this proof of concept due to its timing at a mature stage in the project see supplementary materials the results showed that actions suggested by individuals fit within collective goals and there was a shared understanding of the issues also the team members were aware of points which could improve their project participation and in a safe and nonjudgmental environment they were willing to share their ideas so there was no need for a third party to do an independent evaluation also the team members expressed their willingness to adapt their performance or way of working perhaps reinforced by expressing the opportunities to improve themselves rather than a third party telling them what the problem is and what they should do the reflective m e for campaspe project resulted in a set of goals objectives and actions for the next steps of the project and planned foresight studies on iwrm issues document analysis of project plans meeting notes and discussion memos enabled additional insight into what had transpired in the project and provided more transparency about the project and the decisions taken moreover it was seen that regular reflective meetings could support keeping the project more coherent efficient and on track by suggested actions which means being adaptive rather than sticking to strict planning beforehand in reflective meetings team members were critical about their own performance when they were asked to reflect on themselves this reflection is therefore a way of influencing behavioural phenomena affecting methodological choices one observation during the meetings was that the team members engaged constructively with a critical focus on their own decisions actions and performance rather than on that of other team members even when they acknowledged any drawback across the team still they strove to suggest a way that they could support others to overcome that problem at the time of this analysis the social farm and economy policy and ecology studies in the campaspe project had been completed but aspects of the surface water groundwater and integrated modelling were ongoing as was the scenario exploration and uncertainty analysis of the model therefore some team members were reflecting on past actions and others were reflecting on the ongoing process consequently the lessons of this paper s research and the report on the action plan are valuable outputs for the ongoing work in the project especially with respect to potential modifications in the final portion of the project pathway moreover the other disciplinary sectoral researchers who are not active in the project anymore felt that they could use the results as lessons learnt for forthcoming projects in step 5 of the process fig 2 a survey was used to obtain team member approval of the suggested actions and goals this was felt to be more appropriate for a team whose members have worked together for several years than a group discussion or a workshop the latter run the risk of increasing group thinking bias and experimenting with new reflection techniques can be a positive disruptor to the status quo the survey had the advantage of letting everyone reflect on the actions and goals at their own speed and time availability however a well designed workshop could be used instead of a survey or as a complement to it as a way of seeking consensus and increasing understanding of the discussed actions an attendant aspiration of this research was to evaluate to what extent individuals were able to reflect on their own work critically the results showed that the collective reflection and thinking through the survey accords well with the individual reflections in the reflective meetings 6 3 implementation challenges not surprisingly there were challenges and difficulties involved in designing and undertaking the formative and self reflective m e process fig 2 in a way that fits our purpose of improving the iam project pathway and the choices therein one of the challenges was acting in the critical and sensitive role of the reflexive monitor which requires a high degree of trust making fielke et al 2017 suggest that a reflexive monitor should primarily focus on the aspects of a project that are possible to influence as that will be most productive they discussed the importance of being open about what reflexive monitoring can achieve and the importance of clarifying the role of the monitor at the beginning of the project therefore at the same time as steps 1 2 fig 2 were carried out the monitor engaged informally with all team members briefly discussing the m e process and asking for advice this appeared to be helpful to foster an environment of trust and to create the space for reflection within the project team which is critical for reflective m e fielke et al 2017 as noted in section 2 1 there are misunderstandings and difficulties associated with defining applying and explaining reflective practice effectively finlay 2008 and reflection is sometimes seen as an unstructured process of criticizing and judging to point out drawbacks not having a practical tool and process of reflection practice could result in not practising it one of the main contributions of this research is stepping forward from the general quote of reflection is beneficial into designing and examining a practical process fig 2 the designed process can be used as a guideline and it is possible to customize it to fit the purpose of other projects hevner 2007 one of the critical points during the meetings was to play the role of facilitator and not to lead and influence the discussion the choice of follow up questions and their wording needed to remain nonjudgmental which is not always easy the key to the challenge of providing a safe reflective environment in this research without apportionment of blame was to focus the investigation on what questions rather than why questions section 3 2 2 what questions aim at the actions and events and ways to improve they are more action oriented and aligned with motivating people to think in terms of constructive actions rather than theorizing regarding past decisions eurich 2019 in contrast why questions can be limiting and invite biases and justifications the set of what so what and now what discussed in section 3 2 2 can also be thought of as covering past present and future actions this way of conducting the reflection proved to be a practical method to apply the schön 1983 description of reflective practice as a dialogue of thinking and doing through which one becomes more skilful 6 4 future of this research while the designed m e process was considered successful and appears promising for other applications it would be advantageous in future for the formative and reflective monitoring and evaluation be a part of any complex participatory project from the outset and to undertake it continuously in several stages to keep things simple the survey described the actions as alternatives whereas in reality it is likely that change will occur with groups or sequences of actions follow up exploration of alternative project governance arrangements may be of interest further research should be undertaken to investigate the effect of having a regular reflective m e on the iam pathway and on its outcomes when different theoretical underpinnings are used notably contrasting our more grounded approach with methods based on theory of change butler et al 2016 taplin and clark 2012 and other outcome focused evaluation frameworks for adaptive co management projects plummer and armitage 2007 and as a note of caution despite the benefits of applying formative and reflective m e in increasing awareness and control the negative effects of individual biases and behavioural influences team thinking bias might increase application of debiasing techniques generally is an important issue for future research and more research in this regard is worthwhile moallemi et al 2020 7 conclusions this paper argues for the need to combine conventional common evaluation approaches which typically ensue at the end of a project with an ongoing formative and self reflective monitoring and evaluating process from the outset to realise a more adaptive and effective modelling project a practical step by step monitoring and evaluation process has been designed and and tested here in a multidisciplinary project of integrated water resource assessment and modelling the enhanced m e process combines several approaches used in the literature including adopting a path perspective hämäläinen and lahtinen 2016 zare et al 2020 2019 focusing on behavioural phenomena glynn et al 2017 hämäläinen et al 2013 the use of reflective communication and meetings roux et al 2010 zare et al 2020 based on reflective practices gibbs 1988 schön 1983 reflexive evaluation arkesteijn et al 2015 van mierlo et al 2010 and monitoring and evaluation practices hassenforder et al 2016 van mierlo et al 2010 the formative and self reflective m e consists of six steps 1 review of documents 2 pathway assessment 3 reflective meetings 4 analysis 5 survey and 6 reporting the analysis demonstrates that a team of researchers can monitor and evaluate their own research effectively at least if they possess some experience in team projects thereby feeding into adaptive processes that benefit the project s success the results from the enhanced m e process were consistent with the observation that iwrm is in a maturity stage zare et al 2017 with the research team striving to focus on further improvements in behavioural management and operational factors to complement the success of technical aspects of the project this complementarity emphasises the importance of considering the modelling process as a socio technical process rather than a purely technical one and of providing well designed opportunities for expert practitioners to efficiently and comfortably express their ideas for improving that socio technical process credit authorship contribution statement
