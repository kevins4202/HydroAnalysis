18625,lindane γ hexachlorocyclohexane and its isomers hch are some of the most common and most easily detected organochlorine pesticides in the environment the widespread distribution of lindane is due to its use as an insecticide accompanied by its persistence and bioaccumulation whereas hch were disposed of as waste in unmanaged landfills unfortunately certain hch especially the most reactive ones γ and α hch are harmful to the central nervous system and to reproductive and endocrine systems therefore development of suitable remediation methods is needed to remove them from contaminated soil and water this paper provides a short history of the use of lindane and a description of the properties of hch as well as their determination methods the main focus of the paper however is a review of oxidative and reductive treatment methods although these methods of hch remediation are popular there are no review papers summarising their principles history advantages and disadvantages furthermore recent advances in the chemical treatment of hch are discussed and risks concerning these processes are given graphical abstract image 1 keywords hexachlorocyclohexane lindane remediation oxidation reduction pops 1 history of hch contamination in the middle of the 20th century hexachlorocyclohexane hch was identified as a new insecticide the substance was first created and made available as an insecticide in france however it was probably first synthesized in 1825 by michael faraday danopoulos et al 1953 szydło 2017 for its synthesis chlorine is dissolved in an excess of benzene and this solution is exposed in a photoreactor to an intense uv irradiation the obtained mixture of hch isomers is washed and dried and is marketed as technical grade hch technical hch it was also quickly found that the remarkable insecticidal properties of hch are almost entirely associated with only one of the isomers γ part of only 10 15 of the technical hch so back then it was called ganarnexane which was first isolated at the beginning of the 20th century by van der linden and further named lindane in his honor this new compound quickly replaced derris which was then in short supply for the control of the flea beetle it also proved to be very effective not only in the control of many agricultural and horticultural pests but also in trials against locusts and industrial insects such as cockroaches crickets bed bugs flies etc therefore its production was increased and the compound was widely applied moreover it was introduced for the first time in the 1950s as a scabicide for human use danopoulos et al 1953 in 1953 there was the first circumstantial evidence that γ hch could be toxic for humans danopoulos et al 1953 seventy nine people exposed to a mixture of hch isomers used in the home including on clothes bed covers and the skin were identified with initial symptoms like headaches vertigo lassitude and myalgia followed by stomatitis intestinal colic and diarrhoea danopoulos et al 1953 cns central nervous system disease symptoms were also observed including blindness mental confusion convulsions and dysarthria moreover one patient died as a result of liver and kidney failure nowadays there are numerous studies focusing on the toxicity of hch to humans including evidence of their carcinogenicity bradley et al 2016 many adverse reactions and deaths associated to γ hch being used in the medical field have been reported anand et al 2016 battisti et al 2013 bradley et al 2016 croom et al 2015 di et al 2016 ennaceur 2017 he et al 2017 li et al 2016

of india exposure to β hch was directly associated to a risk for alzheimer disease in the population singh et al 2013 the situation and worldwide use of hch has become such an issue that these substances have been banned in several countries at least 52 and by many international agreements and treaties e g great lakes binational toxics strategy us and canada rotterdam convention and others vijgen et al 2011 on 10 may 2009 at the 4th meeting of the conference of parties it was decided that β hch α hch and γ hch will be included on 26 august 2009 to the persistent organic pollutants list pops at the stockholm convention vijgen et al 2011 although the persistence of lindane and especially that of β hch is large turnbull created a table of approximate half lives t 1 2 of organochlorine pesticides in the environment concluding that the persistence of lindane is shorter in comparison to e g hexachlorobenzene or ddt hester et al 1995 lindane persistence was determined to be in air 2 days in water 3 weeks in soil 2 months in sediment 8 months hester et al 1995 similar values were reported by herbst and esch 1991 however it was also noted therein that the half time of lindane degradation in field can be as long as three years moreover spontaneous environmental transformations of hch as well as their mobility are some of the highest among organochlorine pesticides ocps bioaccumulation of hch has been reported in many biological species e g in algae kováčik et al 2018 plants battisti et al 2017 sediment invertebrates kolaříková et al 2013 terrestrial isopods santos et al 2003 polar bears wiberg et al 2000 fish guo et al 2008 and human tissue güttes et al 1998 it was determined that the lindane background concentration in the environment can be linked to its use as a pesticide based on a model calculation indeed the lindane concentration in plants air and topsoil peaked in 1983 and decreased rapidly after the ban on hch however in the deeper soil layer 58 60 cm it did not reach maximum values until 1993 after which it decreased dramatically sun et al 2016 furthermore lindane emissions in europe persist beyond the provisions of existing legislation despite the marked decreasing trend which is evident through the interpretation of monitoring and modelling results vizcaíno and pistocchi 2010 besides the background hch contamination there are several hch

2013 and oceania mueller et al 2008 the antarctic and artic cincinelli et al 2011 table 1 fig 1 due to the global dimension of hch contamination enormous research effort has been made for the assessment of their biological and chemical degradation hua et al 2017 phillips et al 2005 from these biological methods were found to be very intriguing and therefore many research and review papers have been published focusing on the anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation of hch haider 1979 macrae et al 1969 nagata et al 2007 in addition there is an immense amount of literature on the decomposition of pure hch waste by physical methods such as incineration or plasma arc e g felsot et al 2003 biological and chemical methods are used in the remediation of dissolved hch plumes spreading in surface water or groundwater however despite the presence of many articles on the chemical degradation of hch fig 2 there is currently no review article in which individual chemical oxidative and reductive remediation methods for hch treatment would be discussed 2 properties and determination methods of hch 2 1 properties of hch hch isomers differ in their 3 dimensional structure as the chlorines have various positions on the cyclohexane ring technical hch that was used in the past and is still used in developing countries consists of approximately depending on the purification process 60 70 of α hch 5 12 of β hch 10 15 of γ hch active pesticide 6 10 of δ hch 1 4 of ε hch and up to 5 heptachlorocyclohexane hech responsible for the weak odour of technical hch and octachlorocyclohexane fernández et al 2013 fiedler 1993 in addition to the diverse nature of technical hch random isomers can be generated in the process called isomerisation although who in their 1991 report stated that there is no evidence that isomerisation of lindane to α hch takes place ipcs 1991 this behaviour was observed by benezet and matsmura back in 1973 when they were investigating the metabolic fate of lindane in the environment they showed that the conversion of lindane to α hch therein referred to as γ bhc and α bhc respectively in the environment could be microbial when a medium was enriched with coenzyme nad benezet and matsumura 1973 also vonk and quirijns 1979 studied the conversion of lindane to α hch in soil by escherichia coli they reported that this conversion was not found under aerobic conditions but only under anaerobic conditions vonk and quirijns 1979 moreover they have concluded that this bioisomerisation can occur due to the formation of intermediates γ pentachlorocyclohex 1 ene γ tetrachlorocyclohex 1 ene or hexachlorocyclohexene which can play a role of precursors to α hch lodha et al 2007 calculated the first order bioisomerisation kinetics of γ hch to α hch by pseudomonas aeruginosa to be 0 0474 day 1 there is also some evidence of photoisomerization in air of γ hch to α hch however this process is probably not of environmental significance walker et al 1999 from all of the hch isomers β α and γ hch can be regarded as the most environmentally significant with α and γ being the most toxic and β the most persistent due to the lack of axial chlorides that are more susceptible towards hydroxylation see fig 3 table 2 shows the physical and chemical properties of α hch β hch and γ hch such as melting point water solubility k oa octanol air partition coefficient k ow octanol water partition coefficient k aw air water partition coefficient and k haa humic acid air partition coefficient the partitioning behaviour of β hch diverges from that of the other two investigated isomers in the fact that it concentrates more in the aqueous or organic phases than in the gaseous phase due to this and the above mentioned chemical stability β hch has substantially different environmental pathways and fate higher k oa and k haa values imply stronger retention of this isomer in plant foliage and soils which means that the bioaccumulation of β hch is more efficient due to low metabolic conversion low reactivity and a greater affinity to adipose tissue xiao et al 2004 another important property is that hch are not stable in an alkaline environment in 1912 van der linden reported the instability of hch in the presence of alkaline li et al 2011 the rates at which lindane is transformed through β elimination in the ph range of 2 7 were determined by liu et al 2003 lindane transformation was very slow at low ph until 7 4 the pk of the apparent rate constant is about 3 3 whereas it increased rapidly as ph increased to 12 the slope of pk ph is around 1 it could be concluded that base catalysed hydrolysis is probably a 1st order reaction with respect to oh at ph 7 4 and at ph 7 4 neutral and acid catalysed hydrolysis is expected to be a 0th order reaction with respect to oh the main products of these reactions are one unstable pentachlorocyclohexene and three trichlorobenzene congeners liu et al 2003 santos et al 2018a 2018b 2 2 determination of hch and related transformation products many analytical techniques were reported as being suitable for the detection of hch derived compounds thermogravimetric venugopal et al 1980 electrochemical anirudhan and alexander 2015 berger et al 2016 masibi et al 2018 photoelectrochemical wang et al 2013 and fourier transform infrared spectroscopic ftir bernini et al 2016 methods are commonly used however concerning real environmental matrices and requirement where all hch originating compounds should be determined over 40 chemical individuals none of them can compete with gas chromatography coupled to either flame ionisation electron capture or mass spectrometric detection nerín et al 2003 santos et al 2018a hch derived compounds as well as compounds synthesized during the lindane production process can be divided into the following four groups table s1 1 the five hch isomers and hepta hecch and also octa occch chlorinated cyclohexanes berger et al 2016 2 the group of unstable transition products pentachlorocyclohexenes pcch and tetrachlorocyclohexadienes tcdn trichlorcyclohexadienol dnol 2 5 dichloro 2 5 cyclohexadiene 1 4 diol 2 5 ddol without existing analytical standards 3 the group of chlorobenzenes 12 individuals and benzene 4 the group of chlorophenols 17 individuals and chloroquinones the existence of unquantifiable intermediates from group 1 is the reason why mass balance or chlorine number němeček et al 2016 determination is not possible in the case of hch transformations to date there has not been a single run protocol to cover the analysis of all hch derived compounds using gas chromatography the procedure usually consists of at least two independent injections firstly 17 individual chlorophenols group 4 are determined as their acetylated derivatives after reaction with acetic anhydride in a potassium carbonate buffer en 12673 and chlorophenols together with hch and higher chlorobenzenes tri tetra penta hexa are gc separated on a stationary phase column consisting of 95 pdms 5 phenyl methylpolysiloxane eisert and levsen 1996 santos et al 2018a secondly more volatile fractions of products such as benzene mono chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzenes are gc separated on a stationary phase column consisting of 94 pdms 6 cyanopropylphenyl liu and ho 2000 as for the pre injection step automated solid phase micro extraction spme can replace traditional techniques in both cases antos et al 2015 chromatographic techniques combined with mass spectrometry for isotopic analyses can be successfully used for the assessment of sources and transformation processes of hch mass spectrometric detection provides identity confirmation in each sample at the highest accuracy due to the addition of isotopically labelled internal standards for example kohli et al 2017 in their work investigated the possibility of using compound specific stable isotope analysis csia for the assessment of quantitative and qualitative hch degradation this research focused in the ability of csia to recognise different hch sources and to discern between biodegraded and non biodegraded hch similarly bashir et al 2015 developed a new csia method for determining the carbon isotope ratios by using gas chromatography and gc irms zhang et al 2014 also investigated csia for characterising reaction mechanisms they reported that this method could be used to evaluate field data for determining the biological and chemical conversion of α hch csia coupled with enantiomer specific stable isotope analysis and with enantiomeric fraction determination can be used to characterise the chiral contaminant transformation for determination of the environmental fate of α hch badea et al 2011 created an enantiomer specific stable carbon isotope analysis esia the authors stated that the isotope fractionation can be utilised to assess the biodegradation and characterise the source of α hch 3 chemical degradation of hch this section will be devoted to the main point of the article i e the chemical degradability of hch isomers hch degradation can be obtained by several different techniques by using both chemical and biological methods boyle et al 1999 elliott et al 2009 phillips et al 2005 singh et al 2012 zinovyev et al 2004 in particular the biological aerobic and anaerobic transformation of hch has been investigated in many papers and reviews haider 1979 macrae et al 1969 nagata et al 2007 and therefore it is not covered in this review article similarly physical decontamination approaches e g thermal araújo et al 2016 minghui et al 1996 and sorption on various matrices enriquez victorero et al 2014 hua et al 2017 pandey et al 1999 sawicki and mercier 2006 silvani et al 2019 sprynskyy et al 2008 wadaskar et al 2006 yang et al 2013 most often activated carbon are not considered here chemically hch can react in several ways fig 4 by substitution reaction not relevant for environmental remediation oxidative elimination including free radical addition and reductive elimination which can have the form of dihaloelimination two chlorine atoms are eliminated from the molecule or hydrogenolysis replacing the chlorine atom with a hydrogen atom which is rare in the case of hch treatment another type of reaction is β elimination no change in the net charge of the molecule for example base mediated transformation of hch both oxidative and reductive hch remediation methods are presented in table 3 along with the treatment conditions and other parameters of the remediated system the mean energy values for splitting the c c c h and c cl bonds are 83 85 96 99 and 79 kcal mol moldoveanu 2005 respectively at 25 c for the representative compounds therefore the c cl bonds are the most vulnerable of the hch structures and accordingly the most probable points of other species attack the exact point of the reactant s attack on hch also depends on the regioselectivity expressed in zaitsev s rule the alkene formed in greatest amount is the one that corresponds to the removal of the hydrogen from the β carbon having the fewest hydrogen substituents and stereoselectivity preferred anti periplanar 180 arrangement of h and cl in the transition state li et al 2011 scudder 2013 3 1 chemical oxidation chemical oxidation can be divided into non radical and radical pathways the latter being most often reported in hch degradation we can distinguish two oxidative radicals that are reported most frequently for oxidation of chlorinated organics hydroxyl oh and sulphate radicals so4 the processes that involve reactions of hydroxyl radical are called advanced oxidation processes or techniques aops or aots whereas the ones involving the sulphate radical are sulphate radical based oxidation processes sr ops reactions that involve sr ops are different to reactions of the hydroxyl radical the sulphate radical mainly reacts through the electron transfer reaction while the hydroxyl radical favours addition reactions and hydrogen abstraction the different reaction mechanisms of these radicals can explain why the reaction rate constants of the sulphate radical with various substances have a larger spread than that of oh most common contaminants have functional groups that can be attacked by the hydroxyl radical wacławek et al 2017 it is believed that the hydroxyl radical can dehydrogenate hch to form hexachlorobenzenes hcbs afterwards addition of the hydroxyl radical to the hcb ring can cause elimination of the chlorides until reaching the most stable trichlorobenzenes see below senthilnathan and philip 2010 fig 5 on the other hand it was reported khan et al 2017 wacławek et al 2016a that the sulphate radical reacts by causing elimination of the hcl molecule from hch with a further yield of pentachlorocyclohexane pcch the resulting pcch is stabilised in two half chair conformations which can still have as a minimum one trans diaxial hcl pair accessible for elimination upon successive hcl removal pcch can yield tetrachlorocyclohexadiene which is unstable and susceptible to further hcl elimination resulting in the formation of 1 2 4 1 2 3 and 1 3 5 trichlorobenzene these chlorobenzenes can be further hydroxylated to form stable products trichlorophenols interestingly chlorophenols were also detected by kubátová et al 2002 in degradation experiments of γ hch in subcritical water both oh and so4 can eventually react with these aromatic by products due to the high reaction rate constants between the aromatic double bonds located in the chlorophenols chlorobenzenes and the radicals yielding at the beginning simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and finally carbon dioxide and water senthilnathan and philip 2010 wacławek et al 2017 however it should be noted that sometimes the oxidative treatments could cause an increase in toxicity due to more toxic products of oxidation processes even techniques that use green reagents e g photocatalysis or hydrogen peroxide reactions can cause an increase in the toxicity of a processed solution it was e g determined that dioxins could be generated during the oxidation of chlorophenols evans and dellinger 2005 that could be generated during the oxidation of hch dioxins are extremely dangerous and persistent hrabák et al 2016 and could be used as a poison e g polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins and dibenzofurans pcdd fs was used during an attempted poisoning of the ex president of ukraine viktor yushchenko sorg et al 2009 3 1 1 advanced oxidation processes aop advanced oxidation processes aop involve hydroxyl radials hydroxyl radicals are one of the strongest oxidants known standard reduction potential e 0 2 7 v h oh h2o and are often used for remediation of various inorganic and organic contaminants the most popular precursors of hydroxyl radicals are ozone hydrogen peroxide and photocatalytic reactions boczkaj and fernandes 2017 derco et al 2015 dionysiou et al 2000 gkika et al 2004 hiskia et al 2000 ismail et al 2015 khaydarov et al 2013 kudlek et al 2017 several research groups in the last few decades have studied the hch degradation by different approaches in the aop field fu et al 2004 senthilnathan and philip 2012 including the influence of matrix constituents on the reaction rates grannas et al 2012 probably the first to report hydroxyl radical degradation of hch specifically lindane were guillard et al 1995 and hiskia et al 1997 who reported the photocatalytic degradation of lindane by uv light on tio2 and polyoxometallates respectively guillard et al 1995 mainly focused on the reaction intermediates and overall mechanism of lindane transformation they determined that the six chci groups of γ hch were converted not only into ccl and ch groups but also into ch2cl ch2 cci2 chcl2 ch3 and ccl3 groups which suggested that many reactions have taken place on this basis further research developed supplementing and confirming the majority of their conclusions byrappa et al 2000 guo et al 2000 krishnamurthy and bai 2010 zaleska et al 2000 guo et al 2000 reported the photocatalytic hch degradation by microporous polyoxometalates poms sio2 under uv irradiation the hch was completely removed and mineralised to carbon dioxide and hcl moreover the authors determined that the proposed degradation pathway of the hch follows langmuir hinshelwood first order kinetics similar work was done by krishnamurthy and bai 2010 byrappa et al 2000 and zaleska et al 2000 who determined α hch as an oxidation intermediate of lindane the research of murayama et al 2002 and senthilnathan and philip 2010 focused more on the modification of titanium dioxide and its impact on the oxidation of lindane tio2 pillared fluorine mica and n doped tio2 exhibited higher activity for hch oxidation than bare tio2 another photodegradation approach was studied by fu et al 2005 who investigated the possibility of using α fe2o3 for the photodegradation of lindane and the effect of fulvic acid on it they reported that α fe2o3 promoted the photodegradation of lindane while the presence of fulvic acid had a negative effect on the reaction they also proposed the degradation pathway and observed the generation of chlorobenzenes continuing with the photo oxidation field an interesting laboratory design simulating in situ conditions was reported by xue et al 2013 who performed the photoconversion of lindane by uv irradiation in ice snow and water in their research the authors investigated the effect of ions fe2 no2 hco3 no3 and showed that the photoconversion of lindane is faster in snow and slower in ice fe2 enhanced the photoconversion in water and ice while in snow it showed little effects also similarly to the work of zaleska et al 2000 α hch was determined as one of the by products of oxidation at the start of the 21st century researchers started to experiment more with other precursors of hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide and ozone in example nienow et al 2008 reported the fast decomposition of lindane by uv h2o2 best at neutral ph and similarly to the lindane photodegradation studies fu et al 2005 fulvic or humic acid adversely impacted the reaction also nitoi et al 2013 studied the kinetics and mechanisms for lindane degradation by a similar photo fenton reaction the same process as uv h2o2 but with the addition of ferrous iron during the photo oxidation experiments they identified trichlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene as the intermediates after 2 h and 4 h of irradiation the chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations were reduced and 95 and 99 91 of the total organic carbon was removed respectively begum and gautam 2012 were probably the first to study the oxidation of lindane and endosulfan by ozone in more detail the degradation product of lindane was 1 hexene indicating the fission of the cyclohexane ring however at a high ph the ph varied from 9 to 12 at which lindane could be unstable homolková et al 2015 moreover as it was also the first study to report hydrogenolysis of lindane further research should probably be conducted in order to confirm the results cruz gonzález et al 2018 compared the above mentioned methods fenton photo fenton and o3 for the removal of β hch in a synthetic h2o solution as could be predicted β hch was determined to have higher persistence towards oxidation than lindane they found that treatment with the fenton method is not effective for β hch degradation and after 5 h of the reaction its concentration was still around 15 on the contrary uv vis irradiation reached 100 of degradation within 5 h ozonation shows similar but reduced degradation rates in comparison to uv processes initial identification of products of degradation of the photo fenton process showed a compound of summation formula c3h3cl2 probably 1 3 dichloroprop 1 ene as the most abundant fragment very recently electrochemical oxidation of hch has gained popularity especially through the contributions of the group of carmen m dominguez and mehmet a oturan dominguez et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d two of their works focused more on the removal of lindane and another two on hch in contaminated groundwater they investigated different anode platinum and boron doped diamond and cathode carbon felt carbon sponge and stainless steel materials for lindane degradation dominguez et al 2018d the best results were obtained for a boron doped diamond and carbon felt as the anode and cathode respectively these electrodes were further implemented for hch removal from the groundwater dominguez et al 2018a 2018c values of total organic carbon toc were applied as an indicator of hch concentrations and significant mineralisation 90 was observed after 4 h and 400 ma they reported that inorganic salts played a negative effect in the electrochemical process with current densities 100 ma which may have been due to a high consumption of hydroxyl radicals the study of various current densities 50 1000 ma and fe2 concentrations 0 0 5 mm showed the most effective current density at 400 ma for these electrodes dominguez et al 2018b muñoz morales et al 2017 focused on the mineralisation of lindane in soil by surfactant aided soil washing and electrochemical processes they reported very fast lindane oxidation similar very recent work was done by dominguez et al 2018f who has also used a nonionic surfactant for soil flushing followed by successful oxidation of hch isomers 3 1 2 sulphate radical based oxidation processes sr op the sulphate radical is another very strong oxidizing species e 0 2 6 v so4 so4 2 that has been of interest among researchers over recent years this radical can be formed by the activation of peroxydisulphate pds and peroxymonosulphate pms under photo heat transition metal ozone heterogeneous or alkaline catalysed conditions wacławek et al 2018 2017 2015 the first publication cao et al 2008 on the use of the sulphate radical generated from pds for the removal of lindane was made by jiasheng cao et al in 2008 they conducted an experiment with the oxidation of lindane by pds activated with ferrous iron the final products were determined to be carbon dioxide and chloride indicating complete mineralisation of lindane the method was more effective for the removal of lindane in situ in comparison to the classical fenton reaction due to the longer duration of pds in water which resulted in the slow and steady oxidation of lindane a comparison of the classical aops and sr ops for hch removal from artificially spiked sand was reported by the usman group usman et al 2014 the oxidation process was carried out using hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide fe2 sodium persulfate sodium pds fe2 and permanganate interestingly they reported that fe2 improved the oxidation efficiency of hydrogen peroxide but decreased the oxidation activity of pds in their further work usman et al 2017 they used the same oxidants for testing the removal of lindane and β hch in soil under water saturated unsaturated flow through conditions the oxidation was achieved using hydrogen peroxide and pds in the presence of fe2 or permanganate and they reported better degradation efficiencies of β hch by pds and permanganate compared to hydrogen peroxide peng et al 2015 and wacławek et al 2016b reported different pds activation methods namely heat 40 c ph fe iii edta in soil and electrochemical in water respectively while heat activated pds was effective for γ hch degradation within 14 days of reaction and lindane was transformed to trichlorobenzene by ph activation fe iii edta was not an efficient method for lindane degradation in soil however again it should be noted that there was a possible standard alkaline mediated transformation of lindane to chlorobenzenes which were further degraded by pds since the ph was more than or around 12 furthermore the great efficacy of pds activated by electro activation was shown by wacławek et al 2016b they observed that under optimal conditions the pseudo 1st order reaction rate constant of lindane degradation was 0 04 min 1 that was higher in comparison to the rate constant previously detected by cao et al 2008 0 0083 min 1 in the pds fe2 system but lower in comparison to the one observed by khan et al 2016 0 124 min 1 in the pms fe2 uv system very recent work by santos et al 2018b confirmed these conclusions whereby in an alkali activation persulfate at ph 12 hch isomers transformed to trichlorobenzenes mainly 1 2 4 tcb and those products were further oxidized by sr ops it should be mentioned that the hydroxyl ions in excess not only promote the formation of sulphate radicals from persulfate but also mediate generation of hydroxyl radicals from so4 furman et al 2010 sra et al 2014 our group was probably one of the first to evaluate the efficiency of hch isomer degradation by pms activated by cobalt ions wacławek et al 2016a we were also one of the first to determine 2 4 6 trichlorophenol as a stable intermediate of hch oxidation by sr ops the topic was investigated by khan et al 2016 who focused on lindane degradation by pms activated by fe2 the process became more efficient with uv irradiation due the possible regeneration of fe2 the authors reported 92 2 of total organic carbon removal and the release of 96 4 of the chloride ions after 180 min of uv irradiation lindane removal was also improved by increasing the fe2 concentration 10 1000 μm or the pms concentration 50 1000 μm khan et al 2017 described that in a uv pms system 254 nm the rate of lindane degradation depended on the different initial ph at ph 4 5 8 and 8 the rate of degradation was 86 92 and 55 respectively the changes in the rate of degradation may be connected to the different concentrations of oh and so4 they also reported that the addition of humic acid or inorganic anions inhibited the degradation reaction as a summary the sulphate radical has been found to be effective for hch removal and the proposed possible oxidation pathway can be found in fig 6 what should be also noted is that some of those methods are slowly starting to be applied in situ for example isco in the form of an alkaline activated peroxydisulfate was injected at the hch contaminated site

interest recently due to their implication in the remediation of a diverse spectrum of common environmental contaminants and non toxic end products i e fe ii fe iii according to our knowledge only one work of homolková et al 2015 has investigated the degradation of lindane with ferrate although under the investigated conditions lindane was transformed into trichlorobenzene isomers as the final product the authors concluded that the high ph of the fe iv solution initiated β elimination of hch rather than the high oxidation reduction potential orp of the solution ferrate probably cannot be used for hch removal under the given conditions it should be mentioned here that alkaline mediated hch transformations generate extremely toxic pcdd f as trace reaction impurities an example of such an undesirable remedial treatment in brazil was described by torres et al 2013 3 1 4 catalytic oxidation catalytic oxidation is a process that involves oxidative treatment of compounds in the presence of catalysts a common application of such treatment is the oxidation of organics by the oxygen in air in the presence of catalyst several alkaline treated materials have been used for the catalytic oxidation of hch for example salvador et al 2002 studied the decomposition of lindane with naoh treated sepiolite under microwave irradiation lindane was dehydrohalogenated by sepiolite to pentachlorocyclohexene and trichlorobenzene as well as being oxidized to co2 rozdyalovskaya and chekryshkin 2013 reported the deep oxidation of lindane on molten eutectic mixtures of alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates with or without the addition of v2o5 cuo and nano3 in the temperature range of 400 750 c the highest activity was exhibited when using molten catalysts based on an eutectic mixture of carbonates of alkali metals with the addition of 10 wt v2o5 and cuo rozdyalovskaya and chekryshkin 2013 except carbon monoxide and dioxide there could be found other products of lindane incomplete oxidation depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst used such as tri di and monochlorobenzenes 3 2 chemical reduction the chemical reduction of hch has been reported to a greater extent than oxidation this is mainly due to the increasing interest in nano scale zero valent iron nzvi soukupova et al 2015 and the easiness in which this iron can reduce all hch isomers the principal abiotic degradation pathways of hch include two reduction oriented types metal mediated dihaloelimination and dehydrohalogenation or β elimination hydrogenolysis can theoretically occur under acidic conditions however it has rarely been reported moreover in 2011 the tremendous work of dan elliott and w x zhan group li et al 2011 touched on many major and minor aspects of reductive hch dehalogenation and many reductive mechanisms this section has been divided into several parts concerning the history and recent advances in gamma irradiation and the metal and non metal reduction of hch 3 2 1 γ radiolysis radiolytically formed solvated electrons can be used to reduce many organic molecules alipour et al 1983 these reactions occur differently in water because of the additional formation of hydroxyl radicals le caër 2011 hamada et al 1977 studied the effects of solvated electrons and determined that lindane underwent more decomposition than the other hch isomers the experiments were performed in 2 propanol except for hcl and acetone they found four major products of lindane decomposition which were determined to be isomers of penta and tetrachlorocyclohexane mohamed et al 2009 performed a very similar experiment in water the tests were carried out in the presence of either humic acid nitrous oxide or both to remove 50 and 90 of lindane the absorbed doses required were 17 97 and 28 79 kgy respectively the presence of humic acid nitrous oxide or both did not influence the radiolytic lindane degradation furthermore no reaction products except the chloride ion were found suggesting that because the reactions were performed in water hydroxyl radicals as products of the water radiolysis degraded all of the formed products 3 2 2 zero valent iron nzvi has gained significant interest in the environmental engineering field over the last two decades therefore it is not surprising that the use of nzvi for the remediation of hch has been studied by many authors probably the first work on this topic was made by elliott et al 2008 who performed laboratory experiments with 2 2 27 0 g l 1 nzvi and determined that more than 95 of the hch could be removed within 48 h they determined the trend in the degradation rate i e γ α β δ in their further paper elliott et al 2009 studied the lindane dehalogenation mechanism they found that a key reaction intermediate was γ 3 4 5 6 tetrachlorocyclohexene from lindane dihaloelimination through the axial chlorides and traces of other degradation products including biphenyl and benzene but only in experiments with a high concentration carried out in 1 to 1 ethanol water solution while in the case of nzvi up to 80 of the cl from the γ hch resulted as dissolved cl but only 38 of the expected cl concentration was detected for the experiments carried out with micro scale zero valent iron mzvi elliott et al 2009 at the same time joo and zhao 2008 and wang et al 2009 examined the degradation of γ hch using stabilised nzvi under anaerobic and aerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions the tests showed that nzvi can be used as strong electron donors and degrade 1 mg l of γ hch iron concentration 0 5 g l with a trace amount of pd 0 05 0 8 of fe as a catalyst it was also reported that the nanoparticles under aerobic conditions can induce fenton like reactions that can lead to the oxidative removal of 65 of lindane under identical conditions carboxymethyl cellulose cmc reduced the concentration of hydroxyl radicals by nearly 50 and hindered the oxidation of the pollutants however particle stabilisation largely enhanced the anoxic degradation moreover it was determined that chlorobenzene and benzene were the two end products of lindane dechlorination and no other products were detected amongst these 2 end products benzene was determined as the major one and chlorobenzene the minor one in all of the systems tested fig 7 lacinova et al 2013 reported hch degradation by different zvi sizes nano micro and macro not surprisingly the results showed that the efficiency of hch degradation was best for nzvi in the concentration of 0 5 g l however hch were completely degraded in all of the systems it was also reported that the different hch isomers were degraded with different efficiencies α γ β δ ε and the results were more or less consistent with those reported by elliott et al 2008 and dominguez et al 2016b later san román et al 2016 focused on the effect of modifying the surface of nzvi on lindane degradation nzvi modified with polyethylene glycol reacted with lindane very fast so that 99 9 of the lindane was removed after 72 h similarly dominguez et al 2016a assessed the effect of different salts on the reaction and stability of mzvi batch tests indicated that increasing the concentration of mzvi or the reaction temperature enhanced lindane removal the continuous mode demonstrated a high stability of mzvi the addition of ions had no effect on the lindane degradation and in the case of hco3 and cl the lindane dechlorination was even promoted most of the reported experiments were performed in the aqueous phase however only very few researchers have investigated the reactions in unsaturated soil in example singh et al 2011 described the complete removal of lindane from spiked soil 10 μg g using 1 6 g l of nzvi and a reaction time of 24 h also yang et al 2010 described the use of nzvi for hch degradation in the soil taken from a manufacturing plant interestingly they reported that nzvi cannot degrade less stable isomers α γ and δ but easily remove the most stable one β hch it was also concluded that zvi can be successfully used for in situ hch remediation dominguez et al 2018e in fact lately at the jaworzno site poland a bio reactive barrier filled among others with zero valent iron was built and is being continuously used for the removal of hch and chlorobenzenes from the groundwater therein https www interreg central eu content node amiiga html 3 2 3 bi metallic fe based nanoparticles bimetallic nanoparticles nps are composed of two different metals nzvi is considered as an unstable material and although it reacts quickly with the pollutants after time its surface is covered with an oxide layer with a growing thickness and this process can decrease its reaction rates with other substances ertl et al 2017 therefore incorporation of a second stable metal on its surface can greatly increase the longevity of the material as well as the rates at which the reactions proceed zhang 2003 for example reported one hundred fold enhancement of the dechlorination rate of trichloroethene tce by nano fe pd bimetallic nps have also attracted interest for the removal of hch three metals in a significantly smaller concentration compared to iron were used for the synthesis of a bimetallic iron material with subsequent lindane removal pd manickam et al 2013 nagpal et al 2010 singh et al 2012 cu chang et al 2011 schlimn and heitz 1996 and ni yang and sun 2015 nagpal et al 2010 have shown the complete removal of lindane from 5 mg l after 5 min of reaction using a np concentration of 0 5 g l the final degradation product was cyclohexane which could indicate a completely different reaction mechanism hydrogenolysis to bare nzvi moreover 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene and or chlorinated benzenes were not detected as reaction by products on the contrary to the reactions of bare nzvi with hch li et al 2011 the two contributions from ritu singh and virendra misra manickam et al 2013 singh et al 2012 focused on the degradation of lindane in contaminated soil they reported total lindane degradation using 0 2 g l of fe pd nps after 6 h of incubation contrary to the results of nagpal et al 2010 tri chlorobenzene di chlorobenzene pentachlorocyclohexene and benzene where identified as the reaction products moreover they tested these nps in an integrated system with the sphingomonas sp strain nm05 manickam et al 2013 the removal of lindane using an integrated nano bio technique showed improved efficiency 1 7 2 1 times greater compared to the use of only either fe pd nps or the sphingomonas sp strain nm05 the cell growth study showed potential growth of nm05 in the presence of nps other metals can also be coupled with nzvi to obtain bimetallic nps with enhanced catalytic activity for hch removal chang et al 2011 reported the removal of lindane by zvi amended with cu and incorporated with granular activated carbon ac through the adsorption of lindane the addition of ac made its degradation faster and 99 of lindane was degraded after a reaction time of 165 min also yang and sun 2015 coupled zvi with ni as well as stabilised them by cmc which resulted in significantly enhanced colloidal stability and the ensuing nps were used for the degradation of lindane they reported that after a reaction time of 5 min the lindane 10 mg l was completely removed not only bimetallic materials containing fe were reported for reductive lindane removal aginhotri et al 2011 studied dechlorination of lindane by bimetallic mg0 pd 4 in a mixed water acetone phase 1 1 v v acetone increased the solubility of the lindane and facilitated the dechlorination process lindane was completely dechlorinated and converted to benzene 3 2 4 other homogeneous and heterogeneous reductive methods pd was used solely for reduction of hch before its use in a bimetallic system with fe schüth and reinhard 1998 reported the hydrogenation and hydrodechlorination of aromatic compounds such as lindane chlorobenzene and naphthalene by pd on alumina in hydrogen saturated water pd al2o3 h2 they reported that lindane was dehydrochlorinated to benzene as it was mentioned before the reactions of dechlorination seemed to be substantially faster than reactions of hydrogenation an extension of this work was made by zinovyev et al 2004 who reported the dehalogenation of γ hch in a heterogeneous catalytic reduction system pd pt and raney ni metal catalyst made up of isooctane and aqueous koh phases and aliquat 336 as a phase transfer agent the study reported the transformation of γ hch to 1 2 4 tricholorobenzene in 5 10 min at 50 c and atmospheric pressure if both aqueous koh and aliquat 336 are present dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination are co promoted several years later mertens et al 2007 reported the use of bio pd for the removal of lindane pd nps were made by precipitation on the biomass of shewanella oneidensis bio pd showed catalytic activity for lindane dechlorination and benzene was identified as the reaction product bio pd employed in a membrane reactor technology removed lindane 98 from 10 mg l from contaminated water after 24 h before the use of sulfidic fe or even nzvi liu et al 2003 reported the abiotic transformation of γ hch in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems containing fes in the homogeneous system they evaluated the transformation of lindane to chlorobenzenes as a function of the ph value the half live of lindane was reduced from approximately 1136 and 126 days to approximately 55 and 50 days in a heterogeneous system at ph 6 9 and 8 3 respectively similarly paknikar et al 2005 reported the possibility of lindane degradation by fes nps stabilised by a polymer extract from basidiomycetous fungus itajahia sp these nps were able to degrade lindane at a concentration of 5 mg l with an efficiency of 94 in 8 h and were stable at room temperature moreover they could be freeze dried without changing any physical properties one of the advantages of this method was found to be the growth of a lin1 culture degrading hch and the settling of fes which could be further eliminated by e g filtration nomura et al 2012 used a different approach for lindane degradation they investigated the mechanochemical removal of lindane using a planetary ball mill in the presence of cao chlorobenzenes and 1 3 4 5 6 pentachlorocyclohexene were identified as intermediates while dichlorobenzenes monochlorobenzene and benzene were found as the final products lindane was completely dechlorinated using this process lately non metal catalysis has gained popularity mainly due to its amazing properties as well as its relative environmental friendliness srivastava et al 2011 were probably the first to discover that similarly to tce molecules lindane can be chemisorbed on the surface of nanocarbons they reported the interaction between fullerene and lindane the molecule surface bonding that interact among them showed that such nanocarbons can be used for lindane removal yang et al 2018 achieved lindane dehydrochlorination by nitrogen containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes n mwcnts they reported that at a ph of 7 9 dehydrochlorination could be achieved by the nitrogen functional group of n mwcnts after 3 cycles the removal of γ hch was still as high as 98 8 showing the good stability and reusability of this material trichlorobenzene isomers and γ 1 3 4 5 6 pentachlorocyclohexene were identified as the final and intermediate products also sen gupta et al 2015 reported the conversion of lindane to trichlorobenzene isomers on a reduced graphene oxide silver composite in a very recent report wang and liang 2018 reported the possibility of lindane degradation using tea extracts and ferrous iron tea extracts containing polyphenols can be used as a reducing and chelating agent green tea extract had a better reducing capability compared to other teas lindane reduction was achieved after 3 h at a ph of 10 the authors reported that increasing the concentration of the green tea extract from 0 05 to 1 g without changing the fe2 concentration increased the lindane removal rates they determined that the main degradation mechanism of this system was reductive dechlorination as well as base catalysed hydrolysis 4 conclusions this review covers chemical degradation methods for the treatment of hch especially lindane the main mechanisms for the chemical degradation of hch were determined to be oxidative reductive or β elimination over many years photocatalytic treatment fenton reagent ozone electro oxidation as well as treatment with persulfates have been considered to be effective for hch oxidation the oxidative pathways for hch degradation remain poorly understood however from the literature survey we can conclude that hch dehydrogenation to chlorobenzenes with subsequent chloride elimination is possibly the main mechanism of oh mediated hch elimination on the other hand the sulphate radical can react slightly differently through the dehydrochlorination of hch to pentachlorocyclohexane tetrachlorocyclohexadiene and the formation of stable 1 2 4 1 2 3 and 1 3 5 trichlorobenzenes and trichlorophenols most authors stated that these aromatic hydrocarbons could be ultimately transformed by oh and so4 to carbon dioxide and water the oxidative processes are often very fast however they are very dependent on the water matrix constituents moreover there is a possibility for creation of very toxic by products on the other hand reductive methods are the most widely used for hch removal from which zvi is the most popular the mechanisms of these reactions mainly involve metal mediated dihaloelimination however different pathways through the hydrogenation of lindane by bimetallic fe pd nps have been reported in contrary to the oxidative treatments the reductive reactions are often much slower but they are less dependent on the water matrix dissolved organic matter and anions and are less capable for creating toxic by products in conclusion chemical hch treatment is not only important from the perspective of the environment but it can also help

18625,lindane γ hexachlorocyclohexane and its isomers hch are some of the most common and most easily detected organochlorine pesticides in the environment the widespread distribution of lindane is due to its use as an insecticide accompanied by its persistence and bioaccumulation whereas hch were disposed of as waste in unmanaged landfills unfortunately certain hch especially the most reactive ones γ and α hch are harmful to the central nervous system and to reproductive and endocrine systems therefore development of suitable remediation methods is needed to remove them from contaminated soil and water this paper provides a short history of the use of lindane and a description of the properties of hch as well as their determination methods the main focus of the paper however is a review of oxidative and reductive treatment methods although these methods of hch remediation are popular there are no review papers summarising their principles history advantages and disadvantages furthermore recent advances in the chemical treatment of hch are discussed and risks concerning these processes are given graphical abstract image 1 keywords hexachlorocyclohexane lindane remediation oxidation reduction pops 1 history of hch contamination in the middle of the 20th century hexachlorocyclohexane hch was identified as a new insecticide the substance was first created and made available as an insecticide in france however it was probably first synthesized in 1825 by michael faraday danopoulos et al 1953 szydło 2017 for its synthesis chlorine is dissolved in an excess of benzene and this solution is exposed in a photoreactor to an intense uv irradiation the obtained mixture of hch isomers is washed and dried and is marketed as technical grade hch technical hch it was also quickly found that the remarkable insecticidal properties of hch are almost entirely associated with only one of the isomers γ part of only 10 15 of the technical hch so back then it was called ganarnexane which was first isolated at the beginning of the 20th century by van der linden and further named lindane in his honor this new compound quickly replaced derris which was then in short supply for the control of the flea beetle it also proved to be very effective not only in the control of many agricultural and horticultural pests but also in trials against locusts and industrial insects such as cockroaches crickets bed bugs flies etc therefore its production was increased and the compound was widely applied moreover it was introduced for the first time in the 1950s as a scabicide for human use danopoulos et al 1953 in 1953 there was the first circumstantial evidence that γ hch could be toxic for humans danopoulos et al 1953 seventy nine people exposed to a mixture of hch isomers used in the home including on clothes bed covers and the skin were identified with initial symptoms like headaches vertigo lassitude and myalgia followed by stomatitis intestinal colic and diarrhoea danopoulos et al 1953 cns central nervous system disease symptoms were also observed including blindness mental confusion convulsions and dysarthria moreover one patient died as a result of liver and kidney failure nowadays there are numerous studies focusing on the toxicity of hch to humans including evidence of their carcinogenicity bradley et al 2016 many adverse reactions and deaths associated to γ hch being used in the medical field have been reported anand et al 2016 battisti et al 2013 bradley et al 2016 croom et al 2015 di et al 2016 ennaceur 2017 he et al 2017 li et al 2016

of india exposure to β hch was directly associated to a risk for alzheimer disease in the population singh et al 2013 the situation and worldwide use of hch has become such an issue that these substances have been banned in several countries at least 52 and by many international agreements and treaties e g great lakes binational toxics strategy us and canada rotterdam convention and others vijgen et al 2011 on 10 may 2009 at the 4th meeting of the conference of parties it was decided that β hch α hch and γ hch will be included on 26 august 2009 to the persistent organic pollutants list pops at the stockholm convention vijgen et al 2011 although the persistence of lindane and especially that of β hch is large turnbull created a table of approximate half lives t 1 2 of organochlorine pesticides in the environment concluding that the persistence of lindane is shorter in comparison to e g hexachlorobenzene or ddt hester et al 1995 lindane persistence was determined to be in air 2 days in water 3 weeks in soil 2 months in sediment 8 months hester et al 1995 similar values were reported by herbst and esch 1991 however it was also noted therein that the half time of lindane degradation in field can be as long as three years moreover spontaneous environmental transformations of hch as well as their mobility are some of the highest among organochlorine pesticides ocps bioaccumulation of hch has been reported in many biological species e g in algae kováčik et al 2018 plants battisti et al 2017 sediment invertebrates kolaříková et al 2013 terrestrial isopods santos et al 2003 polar bears wiberg et al 2000 fish guo et al 2008 and human tissue güttes et al 1998 it was determined that the lindane background concentration in the environment can be linked to its use as a pesticide based on a model calculation indeed the lindane concentration in plants air and topsoil peaked in 1983 and decreased rapidly after the ban on hch however in the deeper soil layer 58 60 cm it did not reach maximum values until 1993 after which it decreased dramatically sun et al 2016 furthermore lindane emissions in europe persist beyond the provisions of existing legislation despite the marked decreasing trend which is evident through the interpretation of monitoring and modelling results vizcaíno and pistocchi 2010 besides the background hch contamination there are several hch

2013 and oceania mueller et al 2008 the antarctic and artic cincinelli et al 2011 table 1 fig 1 due to the global dimension of hch contamination enormous research effort has been made for the assessment of their biological and chemical degradation hua et al 2017 phillips et al 2005 from these biological methods were found to be very intriguing and therefore many research and review papers have been published focusing on the anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation of hch haider 1979 macrae et al 1969 nagata et al 2007 in addition there is an immense amount of literature on the decomposition of pure hch waste by physical methods such as incineration or plasma arc e g felsot et al 2003 biological and chemical methods are used in the remediation of dissolved hch plumes spreading in surface water or groundwater however despite the presence of many articles on the chemical degradation of hch fig 2 there is currently no review article in which individual chemical oxidative and reductive remediation methods for hch treatment would be discussed 2 properties and determination methods of hch 2 1 properties of hch hch isomers differ in their 3 dimensional structure as the chlorines have various positions on the cyclohexane ring technical hch that was used in the past and is still used in developing countries consists of approximately depending on the purification process 60 70 of α hch 5 12 of β hch 10 15 of γ hch active pesticide 6 10 of δ hch 1 4 of ε hch and up to 5 heptachlorocyclohexane hech responsible for the weak odour of technical hch and octachlorocyclohexane fernández et al 2013 fiedler 1993 in addition to the diverse nature of technical hch random isomers can be generated in the process called isomerisation although who in their 1991 report stated that there is no evidence that isomerisation of lindane to α hch takes place ipcs 1991 this behaviour was observed by benezet and matsmura back in 1973 when they were investigating the metabolic fate of lindane in the environment they showed that the conversion of lindane to α hch therein referred to as γ bhc and α bhc respectively in the environment could be microbial when a medium was enriched with coenzyme nad benezet and matsumura 1973 also vonk and quirijns 1979 studied the conversion of lindane to α hch in soil by escherichia coli they reported that this conversion was not found under aerobic conditions but only under anaerobic conditions vonk and quirijns 1979 moreover they have concluded that this bioisomerisation can occur due to the formation of intermediates γ pentachlorocyclohex 1 ene γ tetrachlorocyclohex 1 ene or hexachlorocyclohexene which can play a role of precursors to α hch lodha et al 2007 calculated the first order bioisomerisation kinetics of γ hch to α hch by pseudomonas aeruginosa to be 0 0474 day 1 there is also some evidence of photoisomerization in air of γ hch to α hch however this process is probably not of environmental significance walker et al 1999 from all of the hch isomers β α and γ hch can be regarded as the most environmentally significant with α and γ being the most toxic and β the most persistent due to the lack of axial chlorides that are more susceptible towards hydroxylation see fig 3 table 2 shows the physical and chemical properties of α hch β hch and γ hch such as melting point water solubility k oa octanol air partition coefficient k ow octanol water partition coefficient k aw air water partition coefficient and k haa humic acid air partition coefficient the partitioning behaviour of β hch diverges from that of the other two investigated isomers in the fact that it concentrates more in the aqueous or organic phases than in the gaseous phase due to this and the above mentioned chemical stability β hch has substantially different environmental pathways and fate higher k oa and k haa values imply stronger retention of this isomer in plant foliage and soils which means that the bioaccumulation of β hch is more efficient due to low metabolic conversion low reactivity and a greater affinity to adipose tissue xiao et al 2004 another important property is that hch are not stable in an alkaline environment in 1912 van der linden reported the instability of hch in the presence of alkaline li et al 2011 the rates at which lindane is transformed through β elimination in the ph range of 2 7 were determined by liu et al 2003 lindane transformation was very slow at low ph until 7 4 the pk of the apparent rate constant is about 3 3 whereas it increased rapidly as ph increased to 12 the slope of pk ph is around 1 it could be concluded that base catalysed hydrolysis is probably a 1st order reaction with respect to oh at ph 7 4 and at ph 7 4 neutral and acid catalysed hydrolysis is expected to be a 0th order reaction with respect to oh the main products of these reactions are one unstable pentachlorocyclohexene and three trichlorobenzene congeners liu et al 2003 santos et al 2018a 2018b 2 2 determination of hch and related transformation products many analytical techniques were reported as being suitable for the detection of hch derived compounds thermogravimetric venugopal et al 1980 electrochemical anirudhan and alexander 2015 berger et al 2016 masibi et al 2018 photoelectrochemical wang et al 2013 and fourier transform infrared spectroscopic ftir bernini et al 2016 methods are commonly used however concerning real environmental matrices and requirement where all hch originating compounds should be determined over 40 chemical individuals none of them can compete with gas chromatography coupled to either flame ionisation electron capture or mass spectrometric detection nerín et al 2003 santos et al 2018a hch derived compounds as well as compounds synthesized during the lindane production process can be divided into the following four groups table s1 1 the five hch isomers and hepta hecch and also octa occch chlorinated cyclohexanes berger et al 2016 2 the group of unstable transition products pentachlorocyclohexenes pcch and tetrachlorocyclohexadienes tcdn trichlorcyclohexadienol dnol 2 5 dichloro 2 5 cyclohexadiene 1 4 diol 2 5 ddol without existing analytical standards 3 the group of chlorobenzenes 12 individuals and benzene 4 the group of chlorophenols 17 individuals and chloroquinones the existence of unquantifiable intermediates from group 1 is the reason why mass balance or chlorine number němeček et al 2016 determination is not possible in the case of hch transformations to date there has not been a single run protocol to cover the analysis of all hch derived compounds using gas chromatography the procedure usually consists of at least two independent injections firstly 17 individual chlorophenols group 4 are determined as their acetylated derivatives after reaction with acetic anhydride in a potassium carbonate buffer en 12673 and chlorophenols together with hch and higher chlorobenzenes tri tetra penta hexa are gc separated on a stationary phase column consisting of 95 pdms 5 phenyl methylpolysiloxane eisert and levsen 1996 santos et al 2018a secondly more volatile fractions of products such as benzene mono chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzenes are gc separated on a stationary phase column consisting of 94 pdms 6 cyanopropylphenyl liu and ho 2000 as for the pre injection step automated solid phase micro extraction spme can replace traditional techniques in both cases antos et al 2015 chromatographic techniques combined with mass spectrometry for isotopic analyses can be successfully used for the assessment of sources and transformation processes of hch mass spectrometric detection provides identity confirmation in each sample at the highest accuracy due to the addition of isotopically labelled internal standards for example kohli et al 2017 in their work investigated the possibility of using compound specific stable isotope analysis csia for the assessment of quantitative and qualitative hch degradation this research focused in the ability of csia to recognise different hch sources and to discern between biodegraded and non biodegraded hch similarly bashir et al 2015 developed a new csia method for determining the carbon isotope ratios by using gas chromatography and gc irms zhang et al 2014 also investigated csia for characterising reaction mechanisms they reported that this method could be used to evaluate field data for determining the biological and chemical conversion of α hch csia coupled with enantiomer specific stable isotope analysis and with enantiomeric fraction determination can be used to characterise the chiral contaminant transformation for determination of the environmental fate of α hch badea et al 2011 created an enantiomer specific stable carbon isotope analysis esia the authors stated that the isotope fractionation can be utilised to assess the biodegradation and characterise the source of α hch 3 chemical degradation of hch this section will be devoted to the main point of the article i e the chemical degradability of hch isomers hch degradation can be obtained by several different techniques by using both chemical and biological methods boyle et al 1999 elliott et al 2009 phillips et al 2005 singh et al 2012 zinovyev et al 2004 in particular the biological aerobic and anaerobic transformation of hch has been investigated in many papers and reviews haider 1979 macrae et al 1969 nagata et al 2007 and therefore it is not covered in this review article similarly physical decontamination approaches e g thermal araújo et al 2016 minghui et al 1996 and sorption on various matrices enriquez victorero et al 2014 hua et al 2017 pandey et al 1999 sawicki and mercier 2006 silvani et al 2019 sprynskyy et al 2008 wadaskar et al 2006 yang et al 2013 most often activated carbon are not considered here chemically hch can react in several ways fig 4 by substitution reaction not relevant for environmental remediation oxidative elimination including free radical addition and reductive elimination which can have the form of dihaloelimination two chlorine atoms are eliminated from the molecule or hydrogenolysis replacing the chlorine atom with a hydrogen atom which is rare in the case of hch treatment another type of reaction is β elimination no change in the net charge of the molecule for example base mediated transformation of hch both oxidative and reductive hch remediation methods are presented in table 3 along with the treatment conditions and other parameters of the remediated system the mean energy values for splitting the c c c h and c cl bonds are 83 85 96 99 and 79 kcal mol moldoveanu 2005 respectively at 25 c for the representative compounds therefore the c cl bonds are the most vulnerable of the hch structures and accordingly the most probable points of other species attack the exact point of the reactant s attack on hch also depends on the regioselectivity expressed in zaitsev s rule the alkene formed in greatest amount is the one that corresponds to the removal of the hydrogen from the β carbon having the fewest hydrogen substituents and stereoselectivity preferred anti periplanar 180 arrangement of h and cl in the transition state li et al 2011 scudder 2013 3 1 chemical oxidation chemical oxidation can be divided into non radical and radical pathways the latter being most often reported in hch degradation we can distinguish two oxidative radicals that are reported most frequently for oxidation of chlorinated organics hydroxyl oh and sulphate radicals so4 the processes that involve reactions of hydroxyl radical are called advanced oxidation processes or techniques aops or aots whereas the ones involving the sulphate radical are sulphate radical based oxidation processes sr ops reactions that involve sr ops are different to reactions of the hydroxyl radical the sulphate radical mainly reacts through the electron transfer reaction while the hydroxyl radical favours addition reactions and hydrogen abstraction the different reaction mechanisms of these radicals can explain why the reaction rate constants of the sulphate radical with various substances have a larger spread than that of oh most common contaminants have functional groups that can be attacked by the hydroxyl radical wacławek et al 2017 it is believed that the hydroxyl radical can dehydrogenate hch to form hexachlorobenzenes hcbs afterwards addition of the hydroxyl radical to the hcb ring can cause elimination of the chlorides until reaching the most stable trichlorobenzenes see below senthilnathan and philip 2010 fig 5 on the other hand it was reported khan et al 2017 wacławek et al 2016a that the sulphate radical reacts by causing elimination of the hcl molecule from hch with a further yield of pentachlorocyclohexane pcch the resulting pcch is stabilised in two half chair conformations which can still have as a minimum one trans diaxial hcl pair accessible for elimination upon successive hcl removal pcch can yield tetrachlorocyclohexadiene which is unstable and susceptible to further hcl elimination resulting in the formation of 1 2 4 1 2 3 and 1 3 5 trichlorobenzene these chlorobenzenes can be further hydroxylated to form stable products trichlorophenols interestingly chlorophenols were also detected by kubátová et al 2002 in degradation experiments of γ hch in subcritical water both oh and so4 can eventually react with these aromatic by products due to the high reaction rate constants between the aromatic double bonds located in the chlorophenols chlorobenzenes and the radicals yielding at the beginning simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and finally carbon dioxide and water senthilnathan and philip 2010 wacławek et al 2017 however it should be noted that sometimes the oxidative treatments could cause an increase in toxicity due to more toxic products of oxidation processes even techniques that use green reagents e g photocatalysis or hydrogen peroxide reactions can cause an increase in the toxicity of a processed solution it was e g determined that dioxins could be generated during the oxidation of chlorophenols evans and dellinger 2005 that could be generated during the oxidation of hch dioxins are extremely dangerous and persistent hrabák et al 2016 and could be used as a poison e g polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins and dibenzofurans pcdd fs was used during an attempted poisoning of the ex president of ukraine viktor yushchenko sorg et al 2009 3 1 1 advanced oxidation processes aop advanced oxidation processes aop involve hydroxyl radials hydroxyl radicals are one of the strongest oxidants known standard reduction potential e 0 2 7 v h oh h2o and are often used for remediation of various inorganic and organic contaminants the most popular precursors of hydroxyl radicals are ozone hydrogen peroxide and photocatalytic reactions boczkaj and fernandes 2017 derco et al 2015 dionysiou et al 2000 gkika et al 2004 hiskia et al 2000 ismail et al 2015 khaydarov et al 2013 kudlek et al 2017 several research groups in the last few decades have studied the hch degradation by different approaches in the aop field fu et al 2004 senthilnathan and philip 2012 including the influence of matrix constituents on the reaction rates grannas et al 2012 probably the first to report hydroxyl radical degradation of hch specifically lindane were guillard et al 1995 and hiskia et al 1997 who reported the photocatalytic degradation of lindane by uv light on tio2 and polyoxometallates respectively guillard et al 1995 mainly focused on the reaction intermediates and overall mechanism of lindane transformation they determined that the six chci groups of γ hch were converted not only into ccl and ch groups but also into ch2cl ch2 cci2 chcl2 ch3 and ccl3 groups which suggested that many reactions have taken place on this basis further research developed supplementing and confirming the majority of their conclusions byrappa et al 2000 guo et al 2000 krishnamurthy and bai 2010 zaleska et al 2000 guo et al 2000 reported the photocatalytic hch degradation by microporous polyoxometalates poms sio2 under uv irradiation the hch was completely removed and mineralised to carbon dioxide and hcl moreover the authors determined that the proposed degradation pathway of the hch follows langmuir hinshelwood first order kinetics similar work was done by krishnamurthy and bai 2010 byrappa et al 2000 and zaleska et al 2000 who determined α hch as an oxidation intermediate of lindane the research of murayama et al 2002 and senthilnathan and philip 2010 focused more on the modification of titanium dioxide and its impact on the oxidation of lindane tio2 pillared fluorine mica and n doped tio2 exhibited higher activity for hch oxidation than bare tio2 another photodegradation approach was studied by fu et al 2005 who investigated the possibility of using α fe2o3 for the photodegradation of lindane and the effect of fulvic acid on it they reported that α fe2o3 promoted the photodegradation of lindane while the presence of fulvic acid had a negative effect on the reaction they also proposed the degradation pathway and observed the generation of chlorobenzenes continuing with the photo oxidation field an interesting laboratory design simulating in situ conditions was reported by xue et al 2013 who performed the photoconversion of lindane by uv irradiation in ice snow and water in their research the authors investigated the effect of ions fe2 no2 hco3 no3 and showed that the photoconversion of lindane is faster in snow and slower in ice fe2 enhanced the photoconversion in water and ice while in snow it showed little effects also similarly to the work of zaleska et al 2000 α hch was determined as one of the by products of oxidation at the start of the 21st century researchers started to experiment more with other precursors of hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide and ozone in example nienow et al 2008 reported the fast decomposition of lindane by uv h2o2 best at neutral ph and similarly to the lindane photodegradation studies fu et al 2005 fulvic or humic acid adversely impacted the reaction also nitoi et al 2013 studied the kinetics and mechanisms for lindane degradation by a similar photo fenton reaction the same process as uv h2o2 but with the addition of ferrous iron during the photo oxidation experiments they identified trichlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene as the intermediates after 2 h and 4 h of irradiation the chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations were reduced and 95 and 99 91 of the total organic carbon was removed respectively begum and gautam 2012 were probably the first to study the oxidation of lindane and endosulfan by ozone in more detail the degradation product of lindane was 1 hexene indicating the fission of the cyclohexane ring however at a high ph the ph varied from 9 to 12 at which lindane could be unstable homolková et al 2015 moreover as it was also the first study to report hydrogenolysis of lindane further research should probably be conducted in order to confirm the results cruz gonzález et al 2018 compared the above mentioned methods fenton photo fenton and o3 for the removal of β hch in a synthetic h2o solution as could be predicted β hch was determined to have higher persistence towards oxidation than lindane they found that treatment with the fenton method is not effective for β hch degradation and after 5 h of the reaction its concentration was still around 15 on the contrary uv vis irradiation reached 100 of degradation within 5 h ozonation shows similar but reduced degradation rates in comparison to uv processes initial identification of products of degradation of the photo fenton process showed a compound of summation formula c3h3cl2 probably 1 3 dichloroprop 1 ene as the most abundant fragment very recently electrochemical oxidation of hch has gained popularity especially through the contributions of the group of carmen m dominguez and mehmet a oturan dominguez et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d two of their works focused more on the removal of lindane and another two on hch in contaminated groundwater they investigated different anode platinum and boron doped diamond and cathode carbon felt carbon sponge and stainless steel materials for lindane degradation dominguez et al 2018d the best results were obtained for a boron doped diamond and carbon felt as the anode and cathode respectively these electrodes were further implemented for hch removal from the groundwater dominguez et al 2018a 2018c values of total organic carbon toc were applied as an indicator of hch concentrations and significant mineralisation 90 was observed after 4 h and 400 ma they reported that inorganic salts played a negative effect in the electrochemical process with current densities 100 ma which may have been due to a high consumption of hydroxyl radicals the study of various current densities 50 1000 ma and fe2 concentrations 0 0 5 mm showed the most effective current density at 400 ma for these electrodes dominguez et al 2018b muñoz morales et al 2017 focused on the mineralisation of lindane in soil by surfactant aided soil washing and electrochemical processes they reported very fast lindane oxidation similar very recent work was done by dominguez et al 2018f who has also used a nonionic surfactant for soil flushing followed by successful oxidation of hch isomers 3 1 2 sulphate radical based oxidation processes sr op the sulphate radical is another very strong oxidizing species e 0 2 6 v so4 so4 2 that has been of interest among researchers over recent years this radical can be formed by the activation of peroxydisulphate pds and peroxymonosulphate pms under photo heat transition metal ozone heterogeneous or alkaline catalysed conditions wacławek et al 2018 2017 2015 the first publication cao et al 2008 on the use of the sulphate radical generated from pds for the removal of lindane was made by jiasheng cao et al in 2008 they conducted an experiment with the oxidation of lindane by pds activated with ferrous iron the final products were determined to be carbon dioxide and chloride indicating complete mineralisation of lindane the method was more effective for the removal of lindane in situ in comparison to the classical fenton reaction due to the longer duration of pds in water which resulted in the slow and steady oxidation of lindane a comparison of the classical aops and sr ops for hch removal from artificially spiked sand was reported by the usman group usman et al 2014 the oxidation process was carried out using hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide fe2 sodium persulfate sodium pds fe2 and permanganate interestingly they reported that fe2 improved the oxidation efficiency of hydrogen peroxide but decreased the oxidation activity of pds in their further work usman et al 2017 they used the same oxidants for testing the removal of lindane and β hch in soil under water saturated unsaturated flow through conditions the oxidation was achieved using hydrogen peroxide and pds in the presence of fe2 or permanganate and they reported better degradation efficiencies of β hch by pds and permanganate compared to hydrogen peroxide peng et al 2015 and wacławek et al 2016b reported different pds activation methods namely heat 40 c ph fe iii edta in soil and electrochemical in water respectively while heat activated pds was effective for γ hch degradation within 14 days of reaction and lindane was transformed to trichlorobenzene by ph activation fe iii edta was not an efficient method for lindane degradation in soil however again it should be noted that there was a possible standard alkaline mediated transformation of lindane to chlorobenzenes which were further degraded by pds since the ph was more than or around 12 furthermore the great efficacy of pds activated by electro activation was shown by wacławek et al 2016b they observed that under optimal conditions the pseudo 1st order reaction rate constant of lindane degradation was 0 04 min 1 that was higher in comparison to the rate constant previously detected by cao et al 2008 0 0083 min 1 in the pds fe2 system but lower in comparison to the one observed by khan et al 2016 0 124 min 1 in the pms fe2 uv system very recent work by santos et al 2018b confirmed these conclusions whereby in an alkali activation persulfate at ph 12 hch isomers transformed to trichlorobenzenes mainly 1 2 4 tcb and those products were further oxidized by sr ops it should be mentioned that the hydroxyl ions in excess not only promote the formation of sulphate radicals from persulfate but also mediate generation of hydroxyl radicals from so4 furman et al 2010 sra et al 2014 our group was probably one of the first to evaluate the efficiency of hch isomer degradation by pms activated by cobalt ions wacławek et al 2016a we were also one of the first to determine 2 4 6 trichlorophenol as a stable intermediate of hch oxidation by sr ops the topic was investigated by khan et al 2016 who focused on lindane degradation by pms activated by fe2 the process became more efficient with uv irradiation due the possible regeneration of fe2 the authors reported 92 2 of total organic carbon removal and the release of 96 4 of the chloride ions after 180 min of uv irradiation lindane removal was also improved by increasing the fe2 concentration 10 1000 μm or the pms concentration 50 1000 μm khan et al 2017 described that in a uv pms system 254 nm the rate of lindane degradation depended on the different initial ph at ph 4 5 8 and 8 the rate of degradation was 86 92 and 55 respectively the changes in the rate of degradation may be connected to the different concentrations of oh and so4 they also reported that the addition of humic acid or inorganic anions inhibited the degradation reaction as a summary the sulphate radical has been found to be effective for hch removal and the proposed possible oxidation pathway can be found in fig 6 what should be also noted is that some of those methods are slowly starting to be applied in situ for example isco in the form of an alkaline activated peroxydisulfate was injected at the hch contaminated site bailín spain within the life discovered project http www lifediscovered es programa life html 3 1 3 ferrates ferrates i e iron in a high oxidation state fe iv fe v and fe vi have gathered much interest recently due to their implication in the remediation of a diverse spectrum of common environmental contaminants and non toxic end products i e fe ii fe iii according to our knowledge only one work of homolková et al 2015 has investigated the degradation of lindane with ferrate although under the investigated conditions lindane was transformed into trichlorobenzene isomers as the final product the authors concluded that the high ph of the fe iv solution initiated β elimination of hch rather than the high oxidation reduction potential orp of the solution ferrate probably cannot be used for hch removal under the given conditions it should be mentioned here that alkaline mediated hch transformations generate extremely toxic pcdd f as trace reaction impurities an example of such an undesirable remedial treatment in brazil was described by torres et al 2013 3 1 4 catalytic oxidation catalytic oxidation is a process that involves oxidative treatment of compounds in the presence of catalysts a common application of such treatment is the oxidation of organics by the oxygen in air in the presence of catalyst several alkaline treated materials have been used for the catalytic oxidation of hch for example salvador et al 2002 studied the decomposition of lindane with naoh treated sepiolite under microwave irradiation lindane was dehydrohalogenated by sepiolite to pentachlorocyclohexene and trichlorobenzene as well as being oxidized to co2 rozdyalovskaya and chekryshkin 2013 reported the deep oxidation of lindane on molten eutectic mixtures of alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates with or without the addition of v2o5 cuo and nano3 in the temperature range of 400 750 c the highest activity was exhibited when using molten catalysts based on an eutectic mixture of carbonates of alkali metals with the addition of 10 wt v2o5 and cuo rozdyalovskaya and chekryshkin 2013 except carbon monoxide and dioxide there could be found other products of lindane incomplete oxidation depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst used such as tri di and monochlorobenzenes 3 2 chemical reduction the chemical reduction of hch has been reported to a greater extent than oxidation this is mainly due to the increasing interest in nano scale zero valent iron nzvi soukupova et al 2015 and the easiness in which this iron can reduce all hch isomers the principal abiotic degradation pathways of hch include two reduction oriented types metal mediated dihaloelimination and dehydrohalogenation or β elimination hydrogenolysis can theoretically occur under acidic conditions however it has rarely been reported moreover in 2011 the tremendous work of dan elliott and w x zhan group li et al 2011 touched on many major and minor aspects of reductive hch dehalogenation and many reductive mechanisms this section has been divided into several parts concerning the history and recent advances in gamma irradiation and the metal and non metal reduction of hch 3 2 1 γ radiolysis radiolytically formed solvated electrons can be used to reduce many organic molecules alipour et al 1983 these reactions occur differently in water because of the additional formation of hydroxyl radicals le caër 2011 hamada et al 1977 studied the effects of solvated electrons and determined that lindane underwent more decomposition than the other hch isomers the experiments were performed in 2 propanol except for hcl and acetone they found four major products of lindane decomposition which were determined to be isomers of penta and tetrachlorocyclohexane mohamed et al 2009 performed a very similar experiment in water the tests were carried out in the presence of either humic acid nitrous oxide or both to remove 50 and 90 of lindane the absorbed doses required were 17 97 and 28 79 kgy respectively the presence of humic acid nitrous oxide or both did not influence the radiolytic lindane degradation furthermore no reaction products except the chloride ion were found suggesting that because the reactions were performed in water hydroxyl radicals as products of the water radiolysis degraded all of the formed products 3 2 2 zero valent iron nzvi has gained significant interest in the environmental engineering field over the last two decades therefore it is not surprising that the use of nzvi for the remediation of hch has been studied by many authors probably the first work on this topic was made by elliott et al 2008 who performed laboratory experiments with 2 2 27 0 g l 1 nzvi and determined that more than 95 of the hch could be removed within 48 h they determined the trend in the degradation rate i e γ α β δ in their further paper elliott et al 2009 studied the lindane dehalogenation mechanism they found that a key reaction intermediate was γ 3 4 5 6 tetrachlorocyclohexene from lindane dihaloelimination through the axial chlorides and traces of other degradation products including biphenyl and benzene but only in experiments with a high concentration carried out in 1 to 1 ethanol water solution while in the case of nzvi up to 80 of the cl from the γ hch resulted as dissolved cl but only 38 of the expected cl concentration was detected for the experiments carried out with micro scale zero valent iron mzvi elliott et al 2009 at the same time joo and zhao 2008 and wang et al 2009 examined the degradation of γ hch using stabilised nzvi under anaerobic and aerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions the tests showed that nzvi can be used as strong electron donors and degrade 1 mg l of γ hch iron concentration 0 5 g l with a trace amount of pd 0 05 0 8 of fe as a catalyst it was also reported that the nanoparticles under aerobic conditions can induce fenton like reactions that can lead to the oxidative removal of 65 of lindane under identical conditions carboxymethyl cellulose cmc reduced the concentration of hydroxyl radicals by nearly 50 and hindered the oxidation of the pollutants however particle stabilisation largely enhanced the anoxic degradation moreover it was determined that chlorobenzene and benzene were the two end products of lindane dechlorination and no other products were detected amongst these 2 end products benzene was determined as the major one and chlorobenzene the minor one in all of the systems tested fig 7 lacinova et al 2013 reported hch degradation by different zvi sizes nano micro and macro not surprisingly the results showed that the efficiency of hch degradation was best for nzvi in the concentration of 0 5 g l however hch were completely degraded in all of the systems it was also reported that the different hch isomers were degraded with different efficiencies α γ β δ ε and the results were more or less consistent with those reported by elliott et al 2008 and dominguez et al 2016b later san román et al 2016 focused on the effect of modifying the surface of nzvi on lindane degradation nzvi modified with polyethylene glycol reacted with lindane very fast so that 99 9 of the lindane was removed after 72 h similarly dominguez et al 2016a assessed the effect of different salts on the reaction and stability of mzvi batch tests indicated that increasing the concentration of mzvi or the reaction temperature enhanced lindane removal the continuous mode demonstrated a high stability of mzvi the addition of ions had no effect on the lindane degradation and in the case of hco3 and cl the lindane dechlorination was even promoted most of the reported experiments were performed in the aqueous phase however only very few researchers have investigated the reactions in unsaturated soil in example singh et al 2011 described the complete removal of lindane from spiked soil 10 μg g using 1 6 g l of nzvi and a reaction time of 24 h also yang et al 2010 described the use of nzvi for hch degradation in the soil taken from a manufacturing plant interestingly they reported that nzvi cannot degrade less stable isomers α γ and δ but easily remove the most stable one β hch it was also concluded that zvi can be successfully used for in situ hch remediation dominguez et al 2018e in fact lately at the jaworzno site poland a bio reactive barrier filled among others with zero valent iron was built and is being continuously used for the removal of hch and chlorobenzenes from the groundwater therein https www interreg central eu content node amiiga html 3 2 3 bi metallic fe based nanoparticles bimetallic nanoparticles nps are composed of two different metals nzvi is considered as an unstable material and although it reacts quickly with the pollutants after time its surface is covered with an oxide layer with a growing thickness and this process can decrease its reaction rates with other substances ertl et al 2017 therefore incorporation of a second stable metal on its surface can greatly increase the longevity of the material as well as the rates at which the reactions proceed zhang 2003 for example reported one hundred fold enhancement of the dechlorination rate of trichloroethene tce by nano fe pd bimetallic nps have also attracted interest for the removal of hch three metals in a significantly smaller concentration compared to iron were used for the synthesis of a bimetallic iron material with subsequent lindane removal pd manickam et al 2013 nagpal et al 2010 singh et al 2012 cu chang et al 2011 schlimn and heitz 1996 and ni yang and sun 2015 nagpal et al 2010 have shown the complete removal of lindane from 5 mg l after 5 min of reaction using a np concentration of 0 5 g l the final degradation product was cyclohexane which could indicate a completely different reaction mechanism hydrogenolysis to bare nzvi moreover 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene and or chlorinated benzenes were not detected as reaction by products on the contrary to the reactions of bare nzvi with hch li et al 2011 the two contributions from ritu singh and virendra misra manickam et al 2013 singh et al 2012 focused on the degradation of lindane in contaminated soil they reported total lindane degradation using 0 2 g l of fe pd nps after 6 h of incubation contrary to the results of nagpal et al 2010 tri chlorobenzene di chlorobenzene pentachlorocyclohexene and benzene where identified as the reaction products moreover they tested these nps in an integrated system with the sphingomonas sp strain nm05 manickam et al 2013 the removal of lindane using an integrated nano bio technique showed improved efficiency 1 7 2 1 times greater compared to the use of only either fe pd nps or the sphingomonas sp strain nm05 the cell growth study showed potential growth of nm05 in the presence of nps other metals can also be coupled with nzvi to obtain bimetallic nps with enhanced catalytic activity for hch removal chang et al 2011 reported the removal of lindane by zvi amended with cu and incorporated with granular activated carbon ac through the adsorption of lindane the addition of ac made its degradation faster and 99 of lindane was degraded after a reaction time of 165 min also yang and sun 2015 coupled zvi with ni as well as stabilised them by cmc which resulted in significantly enhanced colloidal stability and the ensuing nps were used for the degradation of lindane they reported that after a reaction time of 5 min the lindane 10 mg l was completely removed not only bimetallic materials containing fe were reported for reductive lindane removal aginhotri et al 2011 studied dechlorination of lindane by bimetallic mg0 pd 4 in a mixed water acetone phase 1 1 v v acetone increased the solubility of the lindane and facilitated the dechlorination process lindane was completely dechlorinated and converted to benzene 3 2 4 other homogeneous and heterogeneous reductive methods pd was used solely for reduction of hch before its use in a bimetallic system with fe schüth and reinhard 1998 reported the hydrogenation and hydrodechlorination of aromatic compounds such as lindane chlorobenzene and naphthalene by pd on alumina in hydrogen saturated water pd al2o3 h2 they reported that lindane was dehydrochlorinated to benzene as it was mentioned before the reactions of dechlorination seemed to be substantially faster than reactions of hydrogenation an extension of this work was made by zinovyev et al 2004 who reported the dehalogenation of γ hch in a heterogeneous catalytic reduction system pd pt and raney ni metal catalyst made up of isooctane and aqueous koh phases and aliquat 336 as a phase transfer agent the study reported the transformation of γ hch to 1 2 4 tricholorobenzene in 5 10 min at 50 c and atmospheric pressure if both aqueous koh and aliquat 336 are present dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination are co promoted several years later mertens et al 2007 reported the use of bio pd for the removal of lindane pd nps were made by precipitation on the biomass of shewanella oneidensis bio pd showed catalytic activity for lindane dechlorination and benzene was identified as the reaction product bio pd employed in a membrane reactor technology removed lindane 98 from 10 mg l from contaminated water after 24 h before the use of sulfidic fe or even nzvi liu et al 2003 reported the abiotic transformation of γ hch in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems containing fes in the homogeneous system they evaluated the transformation of lindane to chlorobenzenes as a function of the ph value the half live of lindane was reduced from approximately 1136 and 126 days to approximately 55 and 50 days in a heterogeneous system at ph 6 9 and 8 3 respectively similarly paknikar et al 2005 reported the possibility of lindane degradation by fes nps stabilised by a polymer extract from basidiomycetous fungus itajahia sp these nps were able to degrade lindane at a concentration of 5 mg l with an efficiency of 94 in 8 h and were stable at room temperature moreover they could be freeze dried without changing any physical properties one of the advantages of this method was found to be the growth of a lin1 culture degrading hch and the settling of fes which could be further eliminated by e g filtration nomura et al 2012 used a different approach for lindane degradation they investigated the mechanochemical removal of lindane using a planetary ball mill in the presence of cao chlorobenzenes and 1 3 4 5 6 pentachlorocyclohexene were identified as intermediates while dichlorobenzenes monochlorobenzene and benzene were found as the final products lindane was completely dechlorinated using this process lately non metal catalysis has gained popularity mainly due to its amazing properties as well as its relative environmental friendliness srivastava et al 2011 were probably the first to discover that similarly to tce molecules lindane can be chemisorbed on the surface of nanocarbons they reported the interaction between fullerene and lindane the molecule surface bonding that interact among them showed that such nanocarbons can be used for lindane removal yang et al 2018 achieved lindane dehydrochlorination by nitrogen containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes n mwcnts they reported that at a ph of 7 9 dehydrochlorination could be achieved by the nitrogen functional group of n mwcnts after 3 cycles the removal of γ hch was still as high as 98 8 showing the good stability and reusability of this material trichlorobenzene isomers and γ 1 3 4 5 6 pentachlorocyclohexene were identified as the final and intermediate products also sen gupta et al 2015 reported the conversion of lindane to trichlorobenzene isomers on a reduced graphene oxide silver composite in a very recent report wang and liang 2018 reported the possibility of lindane degradation using tea extracts and ferrous iron tea extracts containing polyphenols can be used as a reducing and chelating agent green tea extract had a better reducing capability compared to other teas lindane reduction was achieved after 3 h at a ph of 10 the authors reported that increasing the concentration of the green tea extract from 0 05 to 1 g without changing the fe2 concentration increased the lindane removal rates they determined that the main degradation mechanism of this system was reductive dechlorination as well as base catalysed hydrolysis 4 conclusions this review covers chemical degradation methods for the treatment of hch especially lindane the main mechanisms for the chemical degradation of hch were determined to be oxidative reductive or β elimination over many years photocatalytic treatment fenton reagent ozone electro oxidation as well as treatment with persulfates have been considered to be effective for hch oxidation the oxidative pathways for hch degradation remain poorly understood however from the literature survey we can conclude that hch dehydrogenation to chlorobenzenes with subsequent chloride elimination is possibly the main mechanism of oh mediated hch elimination on the other hand the sulphate radical can react slightly differently through the dehydrochlorination of hch to pentachlorocyclohexane tetrachlorocyclohexadiene and the formation of stable 1 2 4 1 2 3 and 1 3 5 trichlorobenzenes and trichlorophenols most authors stated that these aromatic hydrocarbons could be ultimately transformed by oh and so4 to carbon dioxide and water the oxidative processes are often very fast however they are very dependent on the water matrix constituents moreover there is a possibility for creation of very toxic by products on the other hand reductive methods are the most widely used for hch removal from which zvi is the most popular the mechanisms of these reactions mainly involve metal mediated dihaloelimination however different pathways through the hydrogenation of lindane by bimetallic fe pd nps have been reported in contrary to the oxidative treatments the reductive reactions are often much slower but they are less dependent on the water matrix dissolved organic matter and anions and are less capable for creating toxic by products in conclusion chemical hch treatment is not only important from the perspective of the environment but it can also help

18626,although infectious disease risk from recreational exposure to waterborne pathogens has been an active area of research for decades beach sand is a relatively unexplored habitat for the persistence of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria fib beach sand biofilms and water all present unique advantages and challenges to pathogen introduction growth and persistence these dynamics are further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats models of fib and pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach use but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats impede robust modeling climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling because extreme weather events warming water and sea level change may increase human exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between fib and pathogens in addition population growth and urbanization will exacerbate contamination events and increase the potential for human exposure the cumulative effects of anthropogenic changes will alter microbial population dynamics in beach habitats and the assumptions and relationships used in quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and process based models here we review our current understanding of microbial populations and transport dynamics across the sand water continuum at beaches how these dynamics can be modeled and how global change factors e g climate and land use should be integrated into more accurate beachscape based models graphical abstract image 1 keywords pathogens climate change sand water quality models 1 getting our feet wet introduction beaches are dynamic interfaces between shore water and submerged bed providing diverse microbial habitats that vary widely across space and time beaches play an important role in human recreational activities supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs and generating billions of dollars in annual revenue king 1999 each year an estimated 140 million individuals engage in water related recreational activities in the us deflorio barker et al 2016 providing opportunities for contact with beach microbial communities beachgoers expect the sand and water they encounter to be safe at beaches which is not the case when sewage and other sources of fecal waste contaminate beaches with pathogens goodwin et al 2012 heaney et al 2009 korajkic et al 2011 mcquaig et al 2012 sabino et al 2011 soge et al 2009 humans exposed to feces contaminated water and sand at beaches are at increased risk of infections that cause gastroenteritis dermatitis and other illnesses bonilla et al 2007 heaney et al 2012 human exposure to pathogens can occur as they interact with water and or sand contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms from the waste of humans or other animal sources fig 1 epidemiological studies conducted in the us usepa 2009 estimated the risk of acute gastroenteritis attributed to contact with water when swimming and wading to be 15 per 1000 individuals deflorio barker et al 2018 wade et al 2008 wade et al 2006 wade et al 2010 in the us alone the annual cost of illnesses related to recreational water exposure is nearly 3 billion deflorio barker et al 2018 worldwide regulation of recreational water quality is largely dependent on quantification of fecal indicator bacteria fib such as fecal coliforms e coli and enterococci parliament 2006 usepa 2012 who 2003 but sand is not routinely monitored many reviews have noted the pros and cons of using fib as surrogates for pathogens in recreational water including most notably their failure to correlate with pathogens boehm et al 2009 field and samadpour 2007 harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 current understanding of the factors that influence relationships among fib and pathogens in water is incomplete and almost entirely lacking in sand in water fib and pathogen levels are influenced by temperature salinity precipitation sunlight location water sediment vegetation nutrients microbial community structure predation desiccation competition and contamination sources lipp et al 2001 medema et al 1997 wanjugi and harwood 2013 whitman et al 2008 the few studies conducted in sand habitats have found that moisture microbial community structure temperature eichmiller et al 2014 feng et al 2010 mika et al 2009 stranded seaweed wrack quilliam et al 2014 and associated insects swinscoe et al 2018 affect fib and pathogen survival epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to beach sand can increase the risk of gastroenteritis heaney et al 2009 2012 by activities that include hand to mouth transfer of microbiota whitman et al 2009 sand may also offer a transmission mode for opportunistic pathogens of non fecal origin such as dermatophytes which are shed by beach users anderson 1979 havlickova et al 2008 solo gabriele et al 2016 sand is a reservoir for hookworm species ancyclostoma spp and necator americanus yu and blackburn 2018 and the parasitic roundworm strongyloides stercoralis boggild et al 2016 because of the expense of epidemiology studies and the impracticality of measuring all possible waterborne pathogens quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has assumed an increasingly important role in estimating adverse human health outcomes from waterborne and other beach associated pathogens ashbolt et al 2010 brandão et al 2015 haas et al 1999 jang and liang 2018 schoen and ashbolt 2010 shibata and solo gabriele 2012 data generated through the qmra process can also be used in the development of predictive models the qmra framework can help assess the impacts of changing environmental conditions at beaches and may enable more accurate management actions to prevent climate change driven health impacts hofstra 2011 schijven et al 2011 sterk et al 2013 the challenges and costs of protecting public health from waterborne pathogens are continually increasing as population growth and urbanization increase pollution of surface waters from sewage and runoff liu et al 2016 climate change is altering temperature precipitation sea level and storm intensities worldwide ipcc 2014 ipcc 2018 with an estimated cost to utilities in the us of 448 billion to 944 billion nawa and amwa 2009 given that these factors significantly influence the fate of waterborne pathogens and fib climate associated impacts on microbial water quality are expected to be profound table 1 burge et al 2014 coffey et al 2018 dvorak et al 2018 patz et al 2008 the imperfect relationship between fib and pathogens hampers our ability to estimate human health risk from fib levels climate change and associated alteration of microbial habitats may make these relationships even more difficult to characterize thus the existing pressures from human population growth coupled with predictions of further climate change have strong potential to amplify challenges in managing microbial pathogens in the beach sand water continuum in the 21st century islam et al 2018 to protect human health at beaches it will be crucial to address these challenges by characterizing and predicting their impacts using modeling frameworks like quantitative microbial risk assessments and hydrodynamic coastal models fig 2 coffey et al 2014 climate change has the potential to influence levels of waterborne pathogens and fib by increasing pollution inputs and by altering transport pathways and environmental stressors increased concentrations of waterborne pathogens will in turn have direct negative effects on human health climate change will affect mechanistic models used to predict health risk at beaches directly with altered ranges for physical chemical data and indirectly by its direct effects on fib and pathogen levels changing relationships between pathogens and the fib used to predict them will directly affect predictive models of human health effects as a result of recreational water use this review synthesizes the anticipated impact of climate change and other anthropogenic effects on the ecology and human health implications of fib and pathogens in the sand water continuum we focus on transport pathways from sources to beaches habitats within the sand water continuum movement between sand and water and persistence within the sand water continuum we present conceptual and mathematical models of microbial behavior in sand and use the models to discuss the potential implications of global change for human pathogen interactions at beaches 2 pollution pathways sources of fecal microorganisms pathogens and fib enter beach habitats via both 1 direct fecal deposition from humans and animals at the beach and 2 flow of surface water stormwater runoff or groundwater that has been contaminated elsewhere fig 3 cahoon et al 2016 hellberg and chu 2016 hofstra 2011 kelly et al 2018 once present extra intestinal habitats such as aquatic macrophytes and sediments can also facilitate persistence and growth which can then reintroduce microorganisms to the water column badgley et al 2011 beckinghausen et al 2014 whitman et al 2003 global change factors including altered human animal and macrophyte populations chen et al 2011 altered hydrology verhougstraete et al 2015 and changing wastewater infrastructure abreu et al 2016 kessler 2011 o mullan et al 2017 can influence loading of fib and pathogens to the sand water continuum barreras et al 2019 liao et al 2015 2 1 direct inputs deposition to beaches human fecal contamination can be directly deposited to the beach environment via leaking beach sanitation infrastructure stormwater and wastewater treatment plant outfalls especially in the case of combined sewer overflows in extreme rain events or wastewater treatment plant failures accumulation of solid waste such as diapers or by bather shedding cahoon et al 2016 edge et al 2018 kessler 2011 in addition to problems with aging sanitation infrastructure and lack of sanitation infrastructure climate change is also expected to increase the frequency of wastewater treatment plant failures and combined sewer overflow cso discharge to surface water during extreme rain events charlton et al 2018 kessler 2011 trtanj et al 2016 changes in climate human demographics or cultural practices leading to increased bather density may increase risk for beach goers coffey et al 2018 schoen and ashbolt 2010 as a number of studies have linked bather shedding of fecal material and skin associated microorganisms to pathogen levels elmir et al 2007 graczyk et al 2010 plano et al 2011 higher air temperatures and more extreme heat events may increase crowds at beaches seeking relief moreno et al 2009 smith 1993 expansion of recreational use at beaches may be particularly prominent near urban centers due to population density and urban heat islands leading to increased pathogen loading in beach environments from direct shedding compared to less urbanized areas perkins et al 2014 shuval 2003 direct fecal contamination of beach water by animals can result in increased levels of fib and zoonotic pathogens such as e coli o157 h7 garcia et al 2010 human health risks from animal fecal contamination can vary but many animal host species frequently carry human pathogens such as cattle poultry and other birds brown et al 2017 garcia et al 2010 kinzelman et al 2008 soller et al 2010 some animals including birds and rodents can be sources of bacteria and fungi to sands and may cause skin infections like ringworm brandão et al 2002 climate change can affect regional bird abundance as observed in northern europe which may lead to bird associated problems at previously unaffected beaches virkkala and lehikoinen 2017 for example gull and canada goose populations are growing in many urban settings around the world and particularly around the laurentian great lakes marzluff 2001 shochat et al 2010 livestock agriculture which is a major source of microbial pollutants to water is rapidly intensifying as human populations grow and demand the benefits of the industrialized world mateo sagasta et al 2017 2 2 indirect inputs to beaches from water fecal contamination of beaches often occurs indirectly via inputs of water contaminated upstream at almost any beach this can include surface water flow from nearby streams rivers or estuaries molina et al 2014 nevers and whitman 2005 staley and edge 2016 many beaches receive stormwater runoff from urban settings whether directly via sewer and stormwater outfalls or indirectly through overland flow this runoff can be contaminated with fib and pathogens by cso events leaking sewage or cross connected stormwater infrastructure and impervious surface runoff marsalek and rochfort 2004 nevers and whitman 2005 defective septic systems and some wastewater infrastructure leaks can also contaminate groundwater that can then flow to the beach environment bishop et al 1998 foster and chilton 2004 kracht et al 2007 rutsch et al 2008 in fact microorganisms can be transported in the subsurface for considerable distances under certain conditions ahmed et al 2005 arnaud et al 2015 the effects of this contamination source are likely to increase with increasing urbanization and aging infrastructure agricultural runoff can also contribute high loads of ruminant fecal contamination and zoonotic pathogens to adjacent water bodies via runoff from concentrated animal feeding operations cafos grazing fields or following manure application harmel et al 2010 islam et al 2004 jamieson et al 2002 jones et al 2013 niu and phanikumar 2015 quilliam et al 2011 staley et al 2013 predictions of changing precipitation amounts and intensities ipcc 2014 ipcc 2018 are expected to directly alter the transport of pathogens and fib from upstream sources to coastal waters and beaches ackerman and weisberg 2003 curriero et al 2001 fowler and hennessy 1995 hellberg and chu 2016 hofstra 2011 mearns et al 1995 mimura 2013 patz et al 2008 trenberth 1999 the increased storm intensities predicted for many regions may also result in greater resuspension of fib from beach sand and sediment into the water column subsequent effects on water quality can last up to 5 7 days after the event ackerman and weisberg 2003 curriero et al 2001 williamson et al 2017 at the other extreme increased drought may also alter human exposure to microbial pathogens by decreasing the dilution of pollutants and by forcing consumption of contaminated water boyle et al 2013 o dwyer et al 2016 rivm 2010 drought conditions may also favor persistence of certain pathogens and opportunists including the fungal group candida which can survive in dry sands sabino et al 2011 shah et al 2011 the multiple direct and indirect pathways leading to the sand water continuum complicate efforts to predict the magnitude of change in human health risk posed by anthropogenic change extreme storm events intensification of agriculture and increased urbanization will all contribute to increased levels of fib and pathogens transported to beaches deterioration of the sanitary quality of beaches and greater subsequent exposure of humans to waterborne pathogens are very likely without changes in current human and animal waste management practices 3 hangouts biofilm habitats in sand most microbial habitats including sand are dominated by biofilms multispecies communities attached to dry or wet surfaces or even at the water air interface fig 4 almatroudi et al 2015 tan et al 2017 e coli and enterococci form sand associated biofilms phillips et al 2011b wang et al 2011 and there is every reason to expect that waterborne pathogens also survive there pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa survive otherwise inhospitable environments such as drinking water in biofilms mena and gerba 2009 known biofilm inhabitants like e coli can firmly attach to sand grains via biofilms wang et al 2011 whitman et al 2014 one study consistently found pathogen genes eaea enteropathogenic e coli and pic clostridium perfringens in beach sand zhang et al 2016 biofilms benefit inhabitants by providing access to nearby nutrients and protection from chemical and biological harmful agents such as antibiotics balcazar et al 2015 costerton et al 1987 and protozoa matz et al 2004 weitere et al 2005 surface charges and extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by bacteria mediate surface attachment and help create microenvironments in which oxygen levels and nutrient gradients contribute to complexity of the community the close proximity between biofilm members contributes to quorum sensing microbial talk and altered gene expression jayathilake et al 2017 as well as the potential for horizontal gene transfer at fluvial beaches flow is dominated by seasonal fluctuations rather than tidal impacts and biofilms are rather unexplored including the complex communities formed by algae cyanobacteria fungi bacteria and protozoa embedded in a dense eps matrix were identified corcoll et al 2012 images of bacterial biofilms assembled on sediments of a beach in alentejo portugal show dense eps and a close association between phytoplankton and bacteria fig s1 jordao 2016 besides fib enterobacter cloacae mezzatesta et al 2012 klebsiella pneumoniae percival et al 2015 acinetobacter baumanni antunes et al 2014 and aeromonas spp skwor et al 2014 have all been described in this kind of matrix but the full extent to which human pathogens persist in biofilms in beach sand is largely unexplored this constitutes a significant knowledge gap that hinders the effort to estimate human health risk from contact with sand whitman et al 2014 biofilm structure and eps composition are related to both the bacterial species and the surrounding environment biofilms can behave as both viscoelastic solids and liquids fig 4 fabbri et al 2017 peterson et al 2015 allowing them to structurally deform under various shear stresses and recover when the stress is removed if forces such as wave or tidal action overcome the viscoelastic biofilm portions will detach and ultimately be released into the water column fig 4 boehm and weisberg 2005 phillips et al 2014 one conceptual model for biofilms associated with beach sand proposes that biofilms build up and concentrate fib and other fecal microorganisms under low energy conditions the onset of higher energy conditions such as a tidal surge or high wave activity may release the microorganisms from the sand biofilms and into the adjacent surface waters microbial settling and accumulation would be prevented at high energy beaches by constant removal or dilution through hydrodynamic mixing and sediment transport fig 5 feng et al 2016 demonstrated that the frequency of exceedance of water quality standards based on fib levels was negatively correlated with long term mean wave energy at florida usa beaches a body of evidence indicates that beaches with low waves have higher fib levels than beaches with high energy waves abreu et al 2016 donahue et al 2017 piggot et al 2012 yamahara et al 2007 wave energy is influenced by beach bottom slope and seasonality fig s2 the seasonal nature of wave energy which is higher in winter can promote a greater accumulation of eps a surrogate for biofilm quantity during september summer versus february winter figs 5 and s2 given the dynamics between biofilms and wave energy a conceptual model that describes the fib release from biofilm in sand x fib sand in units of numbers of microbes per time could resemble the following 1 x fib sand f t m r eps where t is the time since the last energetic event was greater than 1 standard deviation of the mean wave height m is the magnitude of the event above the mean wave height and r eps is the rate of eps deposition on sand in units of mass per time t will generally vary e g t at a given beach may be smaller during the storm season and larger in dry periods resulting in seasonal variation in biofilm associated fib the magnitude of the wave heights m may also influence x fib sand with greater m leading to more reworking of the sand more turbulence and more sand shear minimizing the degree to which biofilms can accumulate under controlled experimental conditions within a wave flume only 60 of enterococci were removed by waves with m values of up to 10 cm suggesting that very large waves would be necessary to completely eliminate the enterococci reservoir from sand phillips et al 2014 vogel et al 2016 suggests that e coli are also released to surface waters during high intensity wave events the accumulation of eps r eps is influenced by the type of pollution point vs nonpoint source as well as sand grain size and mineralogy vogel et al 2017 haack et al 2003 and skalbeck et al 2010 observed that coarse sands have lower fib densities compared to fine sands there also appear to be relationships between sand mineralogy and the attachment of eps and subsequently fib to sand grains though there is debate over the nature of the relationships only 3 of the total sand fib were released through pore water volume flushing in south florida sand phillips et al 2011b as compared to nearly 100 at a california study site yamahara et al 2007 similarly hernandez et al 2014 observed that calcium carbonate particles retain eps and fib more readily in comparison to quartz at a renovated beach however other cases have reported that mineralogy may not influence fib releases from sand such as is the case reported by abreu et al 2016 for beaches in madeira portugal given the importance of wave action in microbial resuspension from sand increasing surface water temperatures o reilly et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 wu et al 2012 wind speeds wave heights and storm frequencies in coastal regions may decrease the diversity of microbial communities and thus make the coastal ecosystems more prone to disturbances byrnes et al 2011 tokinaga and xie 2011 young et al 2011 storm intensity and frequency increases may lead to shoreline erosion and the development of flat low wave energy areas wu et al 2017 as detailed in 4 2 waves and tides these changes coupled with biofilm dynamics could alter retention and exchange of fib between sand and water along the coast leading to changes in beachgoer risk increases to air and water temperature can also alter microbial communities in both the water and sand expanding ranges of pathogens such as vibrio spp leptospira spp and salmonella spp poleward and into more temperate shoreline systems baker austin et al 2013 sumi et al 2017 viau et al 2011 new experimental data are needed to assess the controlling factors in the retention growth and release of microbes from beach sands and sediments and subsequent impacts to human beach visitors biofilms play a vital role in the hangouts of fib and pathogens in sand by shielding whole multi species communities from external factors and protecting propagules that will withstand erosion associated with high energy waves the effects of climate change on sand biofilms remain largely unexplored but may influence fib and pathogen levels via higher temperature which may alter microbial community structure and physical factors such increased wave energy that may come with changes to frequency and intensity of storm events 4 cruising mechanisms of transport within the beach system various mechanisms mediate microbial movement between surface water sand and groundwater beyond local resuspension fib and pathogens may also be transported through the beach sand matrix and across the sand water continuum via two general pathways through beach or over beach through beach transport of fib including their distribution in the subsurface and potential transport to surface waters via groundwater discharge is governed by infiltration and exfiltration water flowing into through and out of the unsaturated and saturated portions of the beach face interstitial flow and interactions with sediments including attachment detachment and straining bradford et al 2014 brown and boehm 2016 molnar et al 2015 solo gabriele et al 2016 the over beach transport pathway is mainly associated with erosion of beach sand which occurs in response to waves tides rainfall and human actions such as beach grooming and fib detachment that delivers microorganisms to adjacent surface waters vogel et al 2016 4 1 physicochemistry the texture and mineral composition of sand and sediment particles affect both groundwater flow and microbial transport because of relationships with pore size hydraulic conductivity and aggregate structure overall beach sands are relatively unstructured and less conducive to macropore formation abreu et al 2016 but transport can still be short circuited by preferential flow when varying particle size results in paths of higher hydraulic conductivity through the same matrix wang et al 2013 overall however in the absence of significant preferential flow pore scale mechanisms driven by interaction energies between the charged surfaces of organisms and soil particles become increasingly important and can dominate in beach systems 4 2 waves and tides waves drive the transport of fib within the beach environment by changing bottom shear stress chao et al 2008 thupaki et al 2013 and playing a role in the resuspension of sand and sediment bound fib gao et al 2015 thupaki et al 2013 waves lead to infiltration of large quantities of surface water and associated constituents e g fib and nutrients across the beach face particularly in the swash zone area of wave run up malott et al 2017 robinson et al 2018 xin et al 2010 they drive rapid infiltration exfiltration across the unsaturated and saturated portions of the beach face in the swash zone at a frequency of seconds heiss et al 2015 as well as driving deeper interstitial flow circulations through saturated sand longuet higgins 1983 malott et al 2016 tidal fluctuations can also drive large amounts of water flux across the beach face with potential to transport fib across the sand water continuum tide induced surface water infiltration generally dominates in the upper intertidal region and exfiltration dominates towards the low tide mark robinson et al 2007 gast et al 2015 observed that microspheres which were used as surrogates for bacteria were transported from their initial location 0 05 m below the sand surface just below the predicted high tide line vertically to the groundwater table by tide induced infiltration some studies however have shown higher concentrations of fib in supratidal sands above the high tide mark compared to sands in the intertidal zone where greater infiltration and vertical transport of fib into the beach matrix is expected to occur abdelzaher et al 2010 enns et al 2012 phillips et al 2011a whiley et al 2018 in addition using shotgun sequencing mohiuddin et al 2017 showed a greater taxonomic diversity in the supratidal sand than in adjacent surface water and staley and sadowsky 2016 showed that backshore sands had microbial communities distinct from those in nearshore sands these findings may be because of lower moisture content in the supratidal sand compared to intertidal sands which limit the survival of protozoan predators whitman et al 2014 along with various endogenous sources such as bird fecal droppings brown and boehm 2016 4 3 precipitation rainfall events can also facilitate movement of fib within the beach environment direct runoff across the beach surface may lead to over beach transport of fib toward the shoreline and in some cases to the surface water silva et al 2014 for example beversdorf et al 2007 and heaney et al 2014 both showed that fib were washed from the sand to the surface water by rainfall with increases in observed surface water fib and decreases in fib levels in the sand alternatively infiltration of rain through unsaturated sand surfaces may deliver fib to the subsurface and to the water table where they may be transported via through beach mechanisms russell et al 2012 silva et al 2014 suggested that over beach rather than through beach transport was the most plausible mechanism during rainfall events at a freshwater beach in summary microbial transport in the beach environment may proceed via over or through beach routes and is influenced by matrix composition and type precipitation wave and tidal action interactions between microorganisms and particles are particularly important in through beach transport waves and tides drive infiltration and exfiltration of water into the beach subsurface and erosion of sand mediates detachment of microorganisms from particles allowing transport of microorganisms to surface waters precipitation in the form of rainfall or snowmelt can mediate over beach transport of microorganisms to surface waters as such precipitation associated impacts of climate change are likely to alter microbial transport dynamics at beaches 5 bummers environmental stressors the diverse microbial community in beach sand must survive a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors affecting its growth and survival significant fluctuations of nutrients competitors moisture and temperature influence the survival and composition of the microbial community creating a complex spatial and temporal structure winfield and groisman 2003 such fluctuations and their effects on the fib pathogen opportunist communities in the sand water continuum are integral to effective modeling prediction of fib fate and transport as well as nearshore water quality in general microbial levels measured by culturing are influenced more rapidly and profoundly than those obtained by molecular methods korajkic et al 2018 2019 the public health implications of method related discrepancies in decay rates of fib and pathogens in the environment have not been determined korajkic et al 2019 other substantial knowledge gaps exist particularly in the context of differences between sand and water environments and impacts of climate change on interactions between biotic and abiotic stressors 5 1 nutrient availability and starvation nutrient availability in sand can be extremely limited creating potential starvation conditions for gut microorganisms in extra intestinal and environmental settings conversely in some cases delivery and accumulation of particulate and dissolved nutrients to pore water via infiltration and exfiltration across the beach water interface can lead to enriched microbial populations including the potential increase of pathogenic organisms such as campylobacter salmonella and e coli o157 h7 williams et al 2007 other nutrient sources such as beach wrack stranded macroalgae imamura et al 2011 quilliam et al 2014 attached algae and aquatic vegetation and phytoplankton byappanahalli et al 2006 chun et al 2015 can also enhance microbial survival and growth lim and flint 1989 the nutrient content in sand and sediment can also vary between climatic regions leading to differential survival of fib in tropical versus subtropical and temperate environments coffey et al 2018 5 2 biotic interactions fib pathogens and opportunistic microorganisms in beach sand also face the threat of predation by microfauna including protozoans and nematodes while these microscopic organisms have the potential to impact bacterial growth alm et al 2006 hartz et al 2008 the composition of potential predators is not well understood an important factor in water wanjugi and harwood 2013 predation effects may be less notable in sand some studies identified protozoans as contributing significantly to bacterial decline in sand filters bomo et al 2004 but predation has been shown to play a minor role in regulating the population size of e coli and enterococcus faecalis in natural sands feng et al 2010 mika et al 2009 similarly the impacts of protozoa on fib decay rates were negligible in tropical sediments from singapore and protozoa presence was not correlated with fib presence or concentration nshimyimana 2017 5 3 desiccation and solar radiation moisture levels across beaches vary in response to changes in precipitation wave activity tides lake levels hydrology and meteorological conditions as such the wetted beach zone can shift hourly while fecal microbiota are abundant in the wetted foreshore whitman and nevers 2003 wright et al 2011 they are less abundant but still recoverable above the high tide mark abdelzaher et al 2010 and in dry sand of freshwater beaches byappanahalli et al 2006 staley et al 2015 decreased moisture and increased sunlight have deleterious effects on fib in sands caro et al 1999 mika et al 2009 and more broadly moisture availability impacts microbial populations and communities by influencing microbial predation nutrient availability and viability mika et al 2009 uv radiation is also major factor in e coli inactivation jang et al 2017 whitman et al 2004 organic matter can mitigate this stress as humic substances can shield microbes against uv radiation and facilitate moisture retention monteith et al 2007 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 williamson et al 2017 excessive moisture in sand habitats can however be detrimental to microbial survival and many bacteria pathogens and opportunists in the sand water continuum require a water activity value within narrow ranges shah et al 2011 found an inverse relationship between moisture content and survival of fib yeasts and nematodes eichmiller et al 2014 found that elevated moisture significantly impacted decay rates of microbial markers and pathogens with slower decay occurring at 14 versus 28 moisture 5 4 temperature effects of temperature on microbial survival and growth as well as members of autochthonous microbial communities are complex differing by species and habitat and whether microorganisms are measured by culture or molecular methods reviewed in korajkic et al 2019 for example optimal growth of e coli and enterococci was observed between 23 and 32 c and temperatures 50 c reduced their levels beversdorf et al 2007 ishii et al 2007 mika et al 2009 cold temperatures can prolong microbial persistence and some fecal microorganisms survive freezing conditions francy et al 2003 ishii et al 2006 experiments conducted in surface water boehm et al 2018 bussi et al 2017 noble et al 2004 sokolova et al 2012 sand staley et al 2016 and soil ishii et al 2006 suggest that fecal microbe persistence decreases with increasing temperature predicted increases in water surface temperatures associated with climate change ipcc 2014 ipcc 2018 can directly affect growth and survival of microbes in waterways liu et al 2006 the persistence of fecal microbes in the environment may decrease in response to predicted impacts from many climate change since fecal microbes generally degrade faster when temperature increases i e bacterial die off processes are enhanced boehm et al 2018 bussi et al 2017 noble et al 2004 sokolova et al 2012 for example there is a reported negative association between campylobacter and temperature hokajarvi et al 2013 viau et al 2011 alternatively rising temperatures may increase the occurrence of some pathogenic microbes the presence of salmonella spp in hawaiian coastal streams was positively correlated with water temperature viau et al 2011 likewise the presence and persistence of vibrio spp which are capable of multiplying in water environments are closely and positively correlated with water temperatures baker austin et al 2016 baker austin et al 2013 huehn et al 2014 sterk et al 2015 factors such as temperature solar inactivation nutrient availability and community interactions can have substantial impacts on the survival of fib opportunists and pathogens at the sand water continuum however the effects of these factors are complex and may not be generalizable across the many pathogens that may be present in sand these knowledge gaps contribute a great measure of uncertainty to estimates and models of the effects of global change on human health risk from recreational exposure to beach environments 6 putting it all together modeling approaches for fib in the sand water continuum mechanistic models aim to describe complex phenomena by simulating the dynamics of contributing components such models are useful tools for understanding the relative importance of various fecal sources fate processes and transport pathways for fib and pathogens furthermore they can make predictions about the sanitary quality of beach systems and their impacts on human health a conceptual model summarizing fib sources fate and transport processes in the beach system described in previous sections is shown in fig 3 existing process based models of fib in surface waters use some form of the advection dispersion reaction equation shown below in its unsteady 3d form 2 c t u c x v c y w c z x k h c x y k h c y z k v c z s where u v w are the unsteady 3d velocity components in the coordinate directions x y z respectively z denotes the vertical coordinate and t is time c denotes the fib concentration k h k v are the horizontal and vertical mixing coefficients and s is a general loss term s k c if a first order removal rate constant k is used hipsey et al 2008 provided a general formulation for the net loss term that integrates growth water temperature salinity dissolved organic carbon base mortality light mediated inactivation ph dissolved oxygen settling losses suspended sediment concentration and predation and grazing losses however a variety of simpler net loss terms have been used successfully in localized marine and freshwater environments gao et al 2015 safaie et al 2016 a detailed review of the fib fate and transport processes in surface water and their mathematical representation is available in nevers et al 2011 though more effective incorporation of sand microorganisms and interactions into models is likely to improve model predictive ability improved modeling of interactions between fib and sand sediment reservoirs may be key to further improving the performance of the current generation of hydrodynamic surface water models recent work on modeling fib transport within sand at marine and freshwater beaches includes considering sediment transport and sediment bound fib transport brown and boehm 2016 feng et al 2015 gao et al 2011 thupaki et al 2013 within the beach and in nearshore waters different approaches have been used to model interactions between fib and particles in the past including a models of attachment detachment kinetics based on the mobile immobile framework used in subsurface transport modeling brown and boehm 2016 vangenuchten and wagenet 1989 and b sorption isotherm based approaches typically used to describe partitioning of chemicals in the environment gao et al 2011 2015 thupaki et al 2013 models such as those from gao et al 2011 use a linear coefficient k d c s c d for sediment water partitioning of enterococci based on the assumption that attachment detachment dynamics are fast relative to the time scales associated with advection and dispersion here c s c d denote the mass specific e g cfu g concentration of attached fib and volume specific e g cfu ml concentration of unattached fib respectively while the use of a partition coefficient may approximate the distribution of fib empirically in some locations there is limited evidence that suspended and sorbed fib are in equilibrium or that a single partition coefficient is generalizable for all environments nevers et al 2011 an alternate approach modeling dynamic fib particle interactions is to quantify sediment and associated fib transport as discrete groups based on particle size for example relatively fine particle classes with which e coli are known to readily associate brown et al 2013 hipsey et al 2006 jeng et al 2005 krometis et al 2007 and a coarse size class to simulate changes in bed morphology and the release of fib from the sand reservoir rules for exchange of fib between the water column and the bed sediment must be defined for example to quantify sediment related enterococci at hobie beach in florida feng et al 2013 modeled clean and contaminated sand classes and their changes through time the distribution of the contaminated sand fraction in this approach describes the availability of fib for resuspension in contrast the models described in gao et al 2011 and thupaki et al 2013 used a single particle size class to successfully improve upon models without sediment contributions if fib models considering sediment bacteria interactions are extended to include multiple size classes e g fine and coarse sediment model complexity increases significantly introducing a large number of parameters and assumptions that are difficult to constrain and justify therefore questions of model parsimony complexity and equifinality beven 2006 should be addressed based on a careful comparison of different approaches in addition novel field experiments and data that elucidate fundamental mechanisms of sediment transport with a focus on fib transport and biofilms are needed for example the model of biofilm dynamics presented in section 3 and in vignaga et al 2013 suggest that biofilm on sediments behaves like an elastic membrane that ruptures catastrophically above a velocity threshold current sediment transport formulations chao et al 2008 gao et al 2011 assume that grains of sand roll over one another at some critical shear stress and do not consider catastrophic biofilm rupturing the inclusion of biofilm dynamics in process based models of fib in surface waters and at the sediment water interface may improve model predictions accurate simulation of processes at the sand water continuum such as wave run up on the beach face cyclical wetting and drying associated with tides and waves infiltration of water and lateral movement of water and fib close to the sand water continuum all require high spatial resolution cm to meter scale additionally an understanding of how temporal changes associated with climate change and anthropogenic effects impact these processes is also key to modeling them however it is unclear how representative available fib monitoring data and model approaches are for small scale processes in beach systems or conditions predicted by climate change scenarios alexander et al 2006 brown et al 2008 sneed 2017 for example the fast fib attachment detachment kinetics assumption that justifies the use of a linear partition coefficient is based on groundwater studies as discussed in bai and lung 2005 data from streams and agricultural soils suggest the opposite generalization i e slow kinetics relative to advection and dispersion based on evidence that bacteria once attached will remain in that state as part of a biofilm jamieson et al 2005 additional field data from marine and freshwater sites collected under various hydrometeorological conditions will help test and validate new model frameworks for the effective simulation and prediction of nearshore fib fate and transport at the sand water continuum modeling sediment and sand bound fib transport is a complex but important step in understanding beach microbial dynamics subsurface microbial transport and interactions at the sand water continuum remain critical knowledge gaps especially in turbulent and wave impacted environments the advection dispersion reaction equation serves as the foundation for these models but relevant parameters boundary and initial conditions and model complexity can vary greatly depending on the focal nearshore environment and localized factors existing models are at odds in terms of how to predict dynamics at the sand water continuum especially in light of climate change effects additional field data validation and model development focused on sand and sediment fib transport effects on beaches will be crucial to the improvement of nearshore water quality simulations and prediction of future climate change effects 7 emerging concerns and challenges in the face of predicted climate change as highlighted throughout this review any advancements in modeling or managing the sand water continuum with regard to beach water quality must be responsive to the impacts of climate change on microbiological contamination at recreational beaches as the water and land environments warm and experience changes in storm frequencies the sand water continuum will likely experience changes in both the abundance and diversity of fib and pathogens potentially persisting in these habitats such changes may present unique and unprecedented challenges for recreational water quality management 7 1 increased storm frequency coastal areas are expected to experience increases in the frequency and intensity of storm events as a result of climate change ipcc 2014 as these areas begin to experience more frequent and intense storm events localized flooding runoff and combined sewer overflow events will also become more frequent making these sources of contamination to both the beach water and the sand water continuum more commonplace kessler 2011 roca et al 2019 trtanj et al 2016 usepa 2008 contaminant releases from wastewater treatment plants sewage systems and industrial contamination sources will increase by 50 120 in the us great lakes region patz et al 2008 while groundwater contamination via the infiltration of microbes through the vadose zone is expected to impact well water quality more frequently arnaud et al 2015 klove et al 2014 additionally predicted changes in mean sea levels across latitudes suggest that global average coastal water levels 0 26 0 85 m higher than observed in 1986 2005 will impact beaches in tropical and temperate areas by 2100 ipcc 2014 increased water levels combined with predicted changes to storm frequency and wind patterns will lead to larger areas along the marine shoreline affected by wave and tidal action and periodic wetting enhancing the exchange of microbial contamination between the sand and water 7 2 warming waters in similar fashion to the range shifts seen in terrestrial and aquatic macrofauna kerr et al 2015 parmesan and yohe 2003 perry et al 2005 it may be expected that microorganism community ranges will shift poleward in response to climate change burge et al 2014 ford 1996 lafferty 2009 trtanj et al 2016 as global water fig s3 and air temperatures are predicted to warm the thermotolerance thresholds of some microorganisms may be exceeded while the warmer conditions may lead to increased decay rates and die offs for some species e g fib ishii et al 2006 this may open up niches in temperate coastal areas for more thermotolerant microbes that had previously been found in lower latitudes such as vibrio parahaemolyticus vibrio vulnificus and naegleria fowleri baker austin et al 2013 kemble et al 2012 martinez urtaza et al 2010 additionally pathogens opportunists and fib may be transported poleward directly via hurricanes cyclones and tropical storms known products of ocean surface temperature changes wu et al 2016 elevated water and air temperatures may also foster the growth of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms macfadden et al 2018 these microorganisms unlike most fib can be directly associated with adverse human health outcomes cosgrove and carmeli 2003 de kraker et al 2011 o gara 2017 additionally the expansion of previously undetected microorganisms to temperate regions combined with possible increases in antimicrobial resistance and the propensity of microbes to form biofilms within the sand water continuum suggests that the risks to beachgoers from new and dangerous pathogens will increase in response to climate change 7 3 drought impacts while much attention has been devoted to increases in storms as a result of climate change the effects of drought will also have an impact on recreational water and sand quality though additional research is required to determine whether the effects are positive or negative drought conditions can limit the runoff flowing to beaches from upstream in the watershed leading to declines in runoff associated contamination and potentially higher recreational water quality vu 2018 conversely declines in water levels due to drought will likely expose more of the beach face potentially leading to changes in biofilm development and microbial community growth within the sand water continuum smaller beach face areas subject to wave and tide associated periodic wetting due to water level declines may be expected to facilitate biofilm growth and reduce areas prone to biofilm detachment boehm and weisberg 2005 phillips et al 2014 however a lack of moisture sources to mediate temperature in the sand may result in enhanced decay of microorganisms ishii et al 2006 mika et al 2009 lower water levels will also yield increased surface area for which beachgoers to contact the sand water continuum and its associated microbial communities potentially increasing the risks to beachgoers connected to microbes in the sand water continuum beach management for public health will thus require adaptation for increased beach usage associated with greater surface area for beachgoers to utilize as well as changes to biofilm dynamics and resulting risks to beachgoers 8 management for the future the predicted effects of climate change necessitate a paradigm shift within recreational beach management and policy development coffey et al 2014 effective beach management to protect public health into the future will not only account for contamination in the sand water continuum but will also take an adaptive approach that can be adjusted in response to the impacts of changing storm frequency flooding effects and upstream contamination potential beach managers particularly in temperate regions affected by warming air and water temperatures will need to monitor both beach sand and recreational water for a greater variety of pathogenic species than they have in the past to ensure public health predicted droughts may also necessitate more effective management of recreational water quality especially terms of the exchange of water and associated microbes between sand and water environments at the beach this will require an adaptive and holistic management strategy an adaptive approach that can be altered in response to climate change impacts will be most effective for management of water resources under rapidly and substantially changing conditions likewise a holistic beachscape approach to management of recreational water systems can effectively account for the entire beach system weiskerger and whitman 2018 such an approach will incorporate water sand wildlife human and upstream contamination runoff impacts on beach health rather than simply focusing on recreational water kelly et al 2018 and can lead to management and policy that preserves human wildlife and environmental health at beaches 9 conclusions beach ecosystems are dynamic mosaics of aquatic sand and sediment habitats the sand water continuum plays an important role in the accumulation transport and persistence of microbial contaminants at beach systems though it is difficult to model and is often overlooked in nearshore research management and policy making efforts local hydrometeorological and infrastructural conditions can influence contamination patterns at beaches over time and across space so localized monitoring and modeling efforts are needed to effectively manage beach systems in the face of contamination in both the nearshore and at the sand water continuum beach management policies are lagging behind the research into the role of sand as a contamination source however several nations and the who have recognized sand as an important reservoir of fib and route of exposure to pathogens the recognition and ongoing discussion of sand as a contamination source at beaches may signal a paradigm shift toward more holistic beachscape frameworks for guiding beach research and management actions future efforts to model nearshore human health risks must be robust and adaptable to account for the association disassociation of human health relevant biofilm and particle bound constituents associated with beach sands and underlying sediments as well as uncertainty associated with changing

18626,although infectious disease risk from recreational exposure to waterborne pathogens has been an active area of research for decades beach sand is a relatively unexplored habitat for the persistence of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria fib beach sand biofilms and water all present unique advantages and challenges to pathogen introduction growth and persistence these dynamics are further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats models of fib and pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach use but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats impede robust modeling climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling because extreme weather events warming water and sea level change may increase human exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between fib and pathogens in addition population growth and urbanization will exacerbate contamination events and increase the potential for human exposure the cumulative effects of anthropogenic changes will alter microbial population dynamics in beach habitats and the assumptions and relationships used in quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and process based models here we review our current understanding of microbial populations and transport dynamics across the sand water continuum at beaches how these dynamics can be modeled and how global change factors e g climate and land use should be integrated into more accurate beachscape based models graphical abstract image 1 keywords pathogens climate change sand water quality models 1 getting our feet wet introduction beaches are dynamic interfaces between shore water and submerged bed

beaches are at increased risk of infections that cause gastroenteritis dermatitis and other illnesses bonilla et al 2007 heaney et al 2012 human exposure to pathogens can occur as they interact with water and or sand contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms from the waste of humans or other animal sources fig 1 epidemiological studies conducted in the us usepa 2009 estimated the risk of acute

annual cost of illnesses related to recreational water exposure is nearly 3 billion deflorio barker et al 2018 worldwide regulation of recreational water quality is largely dependent on quantification of fecal indicator bacteria fib such as fecal coliforms e coli and enterococci parliament 2006 usepa 2012 who 2003 but sand is not routinely monitored many reviews have noted the pros and cons of using fib as surrogates for pathogens in recreational water including most notably their failure to correlate with pathogens boehm et al 2009 field and samadpour 2007 harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 current understanding of the factors that influence relationships among fib and pathogens in water is incomplete and almost entirely lacking in sand in water fib and pathogen levels are influenced by temperature salinity precipitation sunlight location water sediment vegetation nutrients microbial community structure predation desiccation competition and contamination sources lipp et al 2001 medema et al 1997 wanjugi and harwood 2013 whitman et al 2008 the few studies conducted in sand habitats have found that moisture microbial community structure temperature eichmiller et al 2014 feng et al 2010 mika et al 2009 stranded seaweed wrack quilliam et al 2014 and associated insects swinscoe et al 2018 affect fib and pathogen survival epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to beach sand can increase the risk of gastroenteritis heaney et al 2009 2012 by activities that include hand to mouth transfer of microbiota whitman et al 2009 sand may also offer a transmission mode for opportunistic pathogens of non fecal origin such as dermatophytes which are shed by beach users anderson 1979 havlickova et al 2008 solo gabriele et al 2016 sand is a reservoir for hookworm species ancyclostoma spp and necator americanus yu and blackburn 2018 and the parasitic roundworm strongyloides stercoralis boggild et al 2016 because of the expense of epidemiology studies and the impracticality of measuring all possible waterborne pathogens quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has assumed an increasingly important role in estimating adverse human health

generated through the qmra process can also be used in the development of predictive models the qmra framework can help assess the impacts of changing environmental conditions at beaches and may enable more accurate management actions to prevent climate change driven health impacts hofstra 2011 schijven et al 2011 sterk et al 2013 the challenges and costs of protecting public health from waterborne pathogens are continually increasing as population growth and urbanization increase pollution of surface waters from sewage and runoff liu et al 2016 climate change is altering temperature

significantly influence the fate of waterborne pathogens and fib climate associated impacts on microbial water quality are expected to be profound table 1 burge et al 2014 coffey et al 2018 dvorak et al 2018 patz et al 2008 the imperfect relationship between fib and pathogens hampers our ability to estimate human health risk from fib levels climate change and associated alteration of microbial habitats may make these relationships even more difficult to characterize thus the existing pressures from human population growth coupled with predictions of further climate change have strong potential to amplify challenges in managing microbial pathogens in the beach sand water continuum in the 21st century islam et al 2018 to protect human health at beaches it will be crucial to address these challenges by characterizing and predicting their impacts using modeling frameworks like quantitative microbial risk assessments and hydrodynamic coastal models fig 2 coffey et al 2014 climate change has the potential to influence levels of waterborne pathogens and fib by increasing pollution inputs and by altering transport pathways and environmental stressors increased concentrations of waterborne pathogens will in turn have direct negative effects on human health climate change will affect mechanistic models used to predict health risk at beaches directly with altered ranges for physical chemical data and indirectly by its direct effects on fib and pathogen levels changing relationships between pathogens and the fib used to predict them will directly affect predictive models of human health effects as a result of recreational water use this review synthesizes the anticipated impact of climate change and other anthropogenic effects on the ecology and human health implications of fib and pathogens in the sand water continuum we focus on transport pathways from sources to beaches habitats within the sand water continuum movement between sand and water and persistence within the sand water continuum we present conceptual and mathematical models of microbial behavior in sand and use the models to discuss the potential implications of global change for human pathogen interactions at beaches 2 pollution pathways sources of fecal microorganisms pathogens and fib enter beach habitats via both 1 direct fecal deposition from humans and animals at the beach and 2 flow of surface water stormwater runoff or groundwater that has been contaminated elsewhere fig 3 cahoon et al 2016 hellberg and chu 2016 hofstra 2011 kelly et al 2018 once present extra intestinal habitats such as aquatic macrophytes and sediments can also facilitate persistence and growth which can then reintroduce microorganisms to the water column badgley et al 2011 beckinghausen et al 2014 whitman et al 2003 global change factors including altered human animal and macrophyte populations chen et al 2011 altered hydrology verhougstraete et al 2015 and changing wastewater infrastructure abreu et al 2016 kessler 2011 o mullan et al 2017 can influence loading of fib and pathogens to the sand water continuum barreras et al 2019 liao et al 2015 2 1 direct inputs deposition to beaches human fecal contamination can be directly deposited to the beach environment via leaking beach sanitation infrastructure stormwater and wastewater treatment plant outfalls especially in the case of combined sewer overflows in extreme rain events or wastewater treatment plant failures accumulation of solid waste such as diapers or by bather shedding cahoon et al 2016 edge et al 2018 kessler 2011 in addition to problems with aging sanitation infrastructure and lack of sanitation infrastructure climate change is also expected to increase the frequency of wastewater treatment plant failures and combined sewer overflow cso discharge to surface water during extreme rain events charlton et al 2018 kessler 2011 trtanj et al 2016 changes in climate human demographics or cultural practices leading to increased bather density may increase risk for beach goers coffey et al 2018 schoen and ashbolt 2010 as a number of studies have linked bather shedding of fecal material and skin associated microorganisms to pathogen levels elmir et al 2007 graczyk et al 2010 plano et al 2011 higher air temperatures and more extreme heat events may increase crowds at beaches seeking relief moreno et al 2009 smith 1993 expansion of recreational use at beaches may be particularly prominent near urban centers due to population density and urban heat islands leading to increased pathogen loading in beach environments from direct shedding compared to less urbanized areas perkins et al 2014 shuval 2003 direct fecal contamination of beach water by animals can result in increased levels of fib and zoonotic pathogens such as e coli o157 h7 garcia et al 2010 human health risks from animal fecal contamination can vary but many animal host species frequently carry human pathogens such as cattle poultry and other birds brown et al 2017 garcia et al 2010 kinzelman et al 2008 soller et al 2010 some animals including birds and rodents can be sources of bacteria and fungi to sands and may cause skin infections like ringworm brandão et al 2002 climate change can affect regional bird abundance as observed in northern europe which may lead to bird associated problems at previously unaffected beaches virkkala and lehikoinen 2017 for example gull and canada goose populations are growing in many urban settings around the world and particularly around the laurentian great lakes marzluff 2001 shochat et al 2010 livestock agriculture which is a major source of microbial pollutants to water is rapidly intensifying as human populations grow and demand the benefits of the industrialized world mateo sagasta et al 2017 2 2 indirect inputs to beaches from water fecal contamination of beaches often occurs indirectly via inputs of water contaminated upstream at almost any beach this can include surface water flow from nearby streams rivers or estuaries molina et al 2014 nevers and whitman 2005 staley and edge 2016 many beaches receive stormwater runoff from urban settings whether directly via sewer and stormwater outfalls or indirectly through overland flow this runoff can be contaminated with fib and pathogens by cso events leaking sewage or cross connected stormwater infrastructure and impervious surface runoff marsalek and rochfort 2004 nevers and whitman 2005 defective septic systems and some wastewater infrastructure leaks can also contaminate groundwater that can then flow to the beach environment bishop et al 1998 foster and chilton 2004 kracht et al 2007 rutsch et al 2008 in fact microorganisms can be transported in the subsurface for considerable distances under certain conditions ahmed et al 2005 arnaud et al 2015 the effects of this contamination source are likely to increase with increasing urbanization and aging infrastructure agricultural runoff can also contribute high loads of ruminant fecal contamination and zoonotic pathogens to adjacent water bodies via runoff from concentrated animal feeding operations cafos grazing fields or following manure application harmel et al 2010 islam et al 2004 jamieson et al 2002 jones et al 2013 niu and phanikumar 2015 quilliam et al 2011 staley et al 2013 predictions of changing precipitation amounts and intensities ipcc 2014 ipcc 2018 are expected to directly alter the transport of pathogens and fib from upstream sources to coastal waters and beaches ackerman and weisberg 2003 curriero et al 2001 fowler and hennessy 1995 hellberg and chu 2016 hofstra 2011 mearns et al 1995 mimura 2013 patz et al 2008 trenberth 1999 the increased storm intensities predicted for many regions may also result in greater resuspension of fib from beach sand and sediment into the water column subsequent effects on water quality can last up to 5 7 days after the event ackerman and weisberg 2003 curriero et al 2001 williamson et al 2017 at the other extreme increased drought may also alter human exposure to microbial pathogens by decreasing the dilution of pollutants and by forcing consumption of contaminated water boyle et al 2013 o dwyer et al 2016 rivm 2010 drought conditions may also favor persistence of certain pathogens and opportunists including the fungal group candida which can survive in dry sands sabino et al 2011 shah et al 2011 the multiple direct and indirect pathways leading to the sand water continuum complicate efforts to predict the magnitude of change in human health risk posed by anthropogenic change extreme storm events intensification of agriculture and increased urbanization will all contribute to increased levels of fib and pathogens transported to beaches deterioration of the sanitary quality of beaches and greater subsequent exposure of humans to waterborne pathogens are very likely without changes in current human and animal waste management practices 3 hangouts biofilm habitats in sand most microbial habitats including sand are dominated by biofilms multispecies communities attached to dry or wet surfaces or even at the water air interface fig 4 almatroudi et al 2015 tan et al 2017 e coli and enterococci form sand associated biofilms phillips et al 2011b wang et al 2011 and there is every reason to expect that waterborne pathogens also survive there pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa survive otherwise inhospitable environments such as drinking water in biofilms mena and gerba 2009 known biofilm inhabitants like e coli can firmly attach to sand grains via biofilms wang et al 2011 whitman et al 2014 one study consistently found pathogen genes eaea enteropathogenic e coli and pic clostridium perfringens in beach sand zhang et al 2016 biofilms benefit inhabitants by providing access to nearby nutrients and protection from chemical and biological harmful agents such as antibiotics balcazar et al 2015 costerton et al 1987 and protozoa matz et al 2004 weitere et al 2005 surface charges and extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by bacteria mediate surface attachment and help create microenvironments in which oxygen levels and nutrient gradients contribute to complexity of the community the close proximity between biofilm members contributes to quorum sensing microbial talk and altered gene expression jayathilake et al 2017 as well as the potential for horizontal gene transfer at fluvial beaches flow is dominated by seasonal fluctuations rather than tidal impacts and biofilms are rather unexplored including the complex communities formed by algae cyanobacteria fungi bacteria and protozoa embedded in a dense eps matrix were identified corcoll et al 2012 images of bacterial biofilms assembled on sediments of a beach in alentejo portugal show dense eps and a close association between phytoplankton and bacteria fig s1 jordao 2016 besides fib enterobacter cloacae mezzatesta et al 2012 klebsiella pneumoniae percival et al 2015 acinetobacter baumanni antunes et al 2014 and aeromonas spp skwor et al 2014 have all been described in this kind of matrix but the full extent to which human pathogens persist in biofilms in beach sand is largely unexplored this constitutes a significant knowledge gap that hinders the effort to estimate human health risk from contact with sand whitman et al 2014 biofilm structure and eps composition are related to both the bacterial species and the surrounding environment biofilms can behave as both viscoelastic solids and liquids fig 4 fabbri et al 2017 peterson et al 2015 allowing them to structurally deform under various shear stresses and recover when the stress is removed if forces such as wave or tidal action overcome the viscoelastic biofilm portions will detach and ultimately be released into the water column fig 4 boehm and weisberg 2005 phillips et al 2014 one conceptual model for biofilms associated with beach sand proposes that biofilms build up and concentrate fib and other fecal microorganisms under low energy conditions the onset of higher energy conditions such as a tidal surge or high wave activity may release the microorganisms from the sand biofilms and into the adjacent surface waters microbial settling and accumulation would be prevented at high energy beaches by constant removal or dilution through hydrodynamic mixing and sediment transport fig 5 feng et al 2016 demonstrated that the frequency of exceedance of water quality standards based on fib levels was negatively correlated with long term mean wave energy at florida usa beaches a body of evidence indicates that beaches with low waves have higher fib levels than beaches with high energy waves abreu et al 2016 donahue et al 2017 piggot et al 2012 yamahara et al 2007 wave energy is influenced by beach bottom slope and seasonality fig s2 the seasonal nature of wave energy which is higher in winter can promote a greater accumulation of eps a surrogate for biofilm quantity during september summer versus february winter figs 5 and s2 given the dynamics between biofilms and wave energy a conceptual model that describes the fib release from biofilm in sand x fib sand in units of numbers of microbes per time could resemble the following 1 x fib sand f t m r eps where t is the time since the last energetic event was greater than 1 standard deviation of the mean wave height m is the magnitude of the event above the mean wave height and r eps is the rate of eps deposition on sand in units of mass per time t will generally vary e g t at a given beach may be smaller during the storm season and larger in dry periods resulting in seasonal variation in biofilm associated fib the magnitude of the wave heights m may also influence x fib sand with greater m leading to more reworking of the sand more turbulence and more sand shear minimizing the degree to which biofilms can accumulate under controlled experimental conditions within a wave flume only 60 of enterococci were removed by waves with m values of up to 10 cm suggesting that very large waves would be necessary to completely eliminate the enterococci reservoir from sand phillips et al 2014 vogel et al 2016 suggests that e coli are also released to surface waters during high intensity wave events the accumulation of eps r eps is influenced by the type of pollution point vs nonpoint source as well as sand grain size and mineralogy vogel et al 2017 haack et al 2003 and skalbeck et al 2010 observed that coarse sands have lower fib densities compared to fine sands there also appear to be relationships between sand mineralogy and the attachment of eps and subsequently fib to sand grains though there is debate over the nature of the relationships only 3 of the total sand fib were released through pore water volume flushing in south florida sand phillips et al 2011b as compared to nearly 100 at a california study site yamahara et al 2007 similarly hernandez et al 2014 observed that calcium carbonate particles retain eps and fib more readily in comparison to quartz at a renovated beach however other cases have reported that mineralogy may not influence fib releases from sand such as is the case reported by abreu et al 2016 for beaches in madeira portugal given the importance of wave action in microbial resuspension from sand increasing surface water temperatures o reilly et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 wu et al 2012 wind speeds wave heights and storm frequencies in coastal regions may decrease the diversity of microbial communities and thus make the coastal ecosystems more prone to disturbances byrnes et al 2011 tokinaga and xie 2011 young et al 2011 storm intensity and frequency increases may lead to shoreline erosion and the development of flat low wave energy areas wu et al 2017 as detailed in 4 2 waves and tides these changes coupled with biofilm dynamics could alter retention and exchange of fib between sand and water along the coast leading to changes in beachgoer risk increases to air and water temperature can also alter microbial communities in both the water and sand expanding ranges of pathogens such as vibrio spp leptospira spp and salmonella spp poleward and into more temperate shoreline systems baker austin et al 2013 sumi et al 2017 viau et al 2011 new experimental data are needed to assess the controlling factors in the retention growth and release of microbes from beach sands and sediments and subsequent impacts to human beach visitors biofilms play a vital role in the hangouts of fib and pathogens in sand by shielding whole multi species communities from external factors and protecting propagules that will withstand erosion associated with high energy waves the effects of climate change on sand biofilms remain largely unexplored but may influence fib and pathogen levels via higher temperature which may alter microbial community structure and physical factors such increased wave energy that may come with changes to frequency and intensity of storm events 4 cruising mechanisms of transport within the beach system various mechanisms mediate microbial movement between surface water sand and groundwater beyond local resuspension fib and pathogens may also be transported through the beach sand matrix and across the sand water continuum via two general pathways through beach or over beach through beach transport of fib including their distribution in the subsurface and potential transport to surface waters via groundwater discharge is governed by infiltration and exfiltration water flowing into through and out of the unsaturated and saturated portions of the beach face interstitial flow and interactions with sediments including attachment detachment and straining bradford et al 2014 brown and boehm 2016 molnar et al 2015 solo gabriele et al 2016 the over beach transport pathway is mainly associated with erosion of beach sand which occurs in response to waves tides rainfall and human actions such as beach grooming and fib detachment that delivers microorganisms to adjacent surface waters vogel et al 2016 4 1 physicochemistry the texture and mineral composition of sand and sediment particles affect both groundwater flow and microbial transport because of relationships with pore size hydraulic conductivity and aggregate structure overall beach sands are relatively unstructured and less conducive to macropore formation abreu et al 2016 but transport can still be short circuited by preferential flow when varying particle size results in paths of higher hydraulic conductivity through the same matrix wang et al 2013 overall however in the absence of significant preferential flow pore scale mechanisms driven by interaction energies between the charged surfaces of organisms and soil particles become increasingly important and can dominate in beach systems 4 2 waves and tides waves drive the transport of fib within the beach environment by changing bottom shear stress chao et al 2008 thupaki et al 2013 and playing a role in the resuspension of sand and sediment bound fib gao et al 2015 thupaki et al 2013 waves lead to infiltration of large quantities of surface water and associated constituents e g fib and nutrients across the beach face particularly in the swash zone area of wave run up malott et al 2017 robinson et al 2018 xin et al 2010 they drive rapid infiltration exfiltration across the unsaturated and saturated portions of the beach face in the swash zone at a frequency of seconds heiss et al 2015 as well as driving deeper interstitial flow circulations through saturated sand longuet higgins 1983 malott et al 2016 tidal fluctuations can also drive large amounts of water flux across the beach face with potential to transport fib across the sand water continuum tide induced surface water infiltration generally dominates in the upper intertidal region and exfiltration dominates towards the low tide mark robinson et al 2007 gast et al 2015 observed that microspheres which were used as surrogates for bacteria were transported from their initial location 0 05 m below the sand surface just below the predicted high tide line vertically to the groundwater table by tide induced infiltration some studies however have shown higher concentrations of fib in supratidal sands above the high tide mark compared to sands in the intertidal zone where greater infiltration and vertical transport of fib into the beach matrix is expected to occur abdelzaher et al 2010 enns et al 2012 phillips et al 2011a whiley et al 2018 in addition using shotgun sequencing mohiuddin et al 2017 showed a greater taxonomic diversity in the supratidal sand than in adjacent surface water and staley and sadowsky 2016 showed that backshore sands had microbial communities distinct from those in nearshore sands these findings may be because of lower moisture content in the supratidal sand compared to intertidal sands which limit the survival of protozoan predators whitman et al 2014 along with various endogenous sources such as bird fecal droppings brown and boehm 2016 4 3 precipitation rainfall events can also facilitate movement of fib within the beach environment direct runoff across the beach surface may lead to over beach transport of fib toward the shoreline and in some cases to the surface water silva et al 2014 for example beversdorf et al 2007 and heaney et al 2014 both showed that fib were washed from the sand to the surface water by rainfall with increases in observed surface water fib and decreases in fib levels in the sand alternatively infiltration of rain through unsaturated sand surfaces may deliver fib to the subsurface and to the water table where they may be transported via through beach mechanisms russell et al 2012 silva et al 2014 suggested that over beach rather than through beach transport was the most plausible mechanism during rainfall events at a freshwater beach in summary microbial transport in the beach environment may proceed via over or through beach routes and is influenced by matrix composition and type precipitation wave and tidal action interactions between microorganisms and particles are particularly important in through beach transport waves and tides drive infiltration and exfiltration of water into the beach subsurface and erosion of sand mediates detachment of microorganisms from particles allowing transport of microorganisms to surface waters precipitation in the form of rainfall or snowmelt can mediate over beach transport of microorganisms to surface waters as such precipitation associated impacts of climate change are likely to alter microbial transport dynamics at beaches 5 bummers environmental stressors the diverse microbial community in beach sand must survive a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors affecting its growth and survival significant fluctuations of nutrients competitors moisture and temperature influence the survival and composition of the microbial community creating a complex spatial and temporal structure winfield and groisman 2003 such fluctuations and their effects on the fib pathogen opportunist communities in the sand water continuum are integral to effective modeling prediction of fib fate and transport as well as nearshore water quality in general microbial levels measured by culturing are influenced more rapidly and profoundly than those obtained by molecular methods korajkic et al 2018 2019 the public health implications of method related discrepancies in decay rates of fib and pathogens in the environment have not been determined korajkic et al 2019 other substantial knowledge gaps exist particularly in the context of differences between sand and water environments and impacts of climate change on interactions between biotic and abiotic stressors 5 1 nutrient availability and starvation nutrient availability in sand can be extremely limited creating potential starvation conditions for gut microorganisms in extra intestinal and environmental settings conversely in some cases delivery and accumulation of particulate and dissolved nutrients to pore water via infiltration and exfiltration across the beach water interface can lead to enriched microbial populations including the potential increase of pathogenic organisms such as campylobacter salmonella and e coli o157 h7 williams et al 2007 other nutrient sources such as beach wrack stranded macroalgae imamura et al 2011 quilliam et al 2014 attached algae and aquatic vegetation and phytoplankton byappanahalli et al 2006 chun et al 2015 can also enhance microbial survival and growth lim and flint 1989 the nutrient content in sand and sediment can also vary between climatic regions leading to differential survival of fib in tropical versus subtropical and temperate environments coffey et al 2018 5 2 biotic interactions fib pathogens and opportunistic microorganisms in beach sand also face the threat of predation by microfauna including protozoans and nematodes while these microscopic organisms have the potential to impact bacterial growth alm et al 2006 hartz et al 2008 the composition of potential predators is not well understood an important factor in water wanjugi and harwood 2013 predation effects may be less notable in sand some studies identified protozoans as contributing significantly to bacterial decline in sand filters bomo et al 2004 but predation has been shown to play a minor role in regulating the population size of e coli and enterococcus faecalis in natural sands feng et al 2010 mika et al 2009 similarly the impacts of protozoa on fib decay rates were negligible in tropical sediments from singapore and protozoa presence was not correlated with fib presence or concentration nshimyimana 2017 5 3 desiccation and solar radiation moisture levels across beaches vary in response to changes in precipitation wave activity tides lake levels hydrology and meteorological conditions as such the wetted beach zone can shift hourly while fecal microbiota are abundant in the wetted foreshore whitman and nevers 2003 wright et al 2011 they are less abundant but still recoverable above the high tide mark abdelzaher et al 2010 and in dry sand of freshwater beaches byappanahalli et al 2006 staley et al 2015 decreased moisture and increased sunlight have deleterious effects on fib in sands caro et al 1999 mika et al 2009 and more broadly moisture availability impacts microbial populations and communities by influencing microbial predation nutrient availability and viability mika et al 2009 uv radiation is also major factor in e coli inactivation jang et al 2017 whitman et al 2004 organic matter can mitigate this stress as humic substances can shield microbes against uv radiation and facilitate moisture retention monteith et al 2007 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 williamson et al 2017 excessive moisture in sand habitats can however be detrimental to microbial survival and many bacteria pathogens and opportunists in the sand water continuum require a water activity value within narrow ranges shah et al 2011 found an inverse relationship between moisture content and survival of fib yeasts and nematodes eichmiller et al 2014 found that elevated moisture significantly impacted decay rates of microbial markers and pathogens with slower decay occurring at 14 versus 28 moisture 5 4 temperature effects of temperature on microbial survival and growth as well as members of autochthonous microbial communities are complex differing by species and habitat and whether microorganisms are measured by culture or molecular methods reviewed in korajkic et al 2019 for example optimal growth of e coli and enterococci was observed between 23 and 32 c and temperatures 50 c reduced their levels beversdorf et al 2007 ishii et al 2007 mika et al 2009 cold temperatures can prolong microbial persistence and some fecal microorganisms survive freezing conditions francy et al 2003 ishii et al 2006 experiments conducted in surface water boehm et al 2018 bussi et al 2017 noble et al 2004 sokolova et al 2012 sand staley et al 2016 and soil ishii et al 2006 suggest that fecal microbe persistence decreases with increasing temperature predicted increases in water surface temperatures associated with climate change ipcc 2014 ipcc 2018 can directly affect growth and survival of microbes in waterways liu et al 2006 the persistence of fecal microbes in the environment may decrease in response to predicted impacts from many climate change since fecal microbes generally degrade faster when temperature increases i e bacterial die off processes are enhanced boehm et al 2018 bussi et al 2017 noble et al 2004 sokolova et al 2012 for example there is a reported negative association between campylobacter and temperature hokajarvi et al 2013 viau et al 2011 alternatively rising temperatures may increase the occurrence of some pathogenic microbes the presence of salmonella spp in hawaiian coastal streams was positively correlated with water temperature viau et al 2011 likewise the presence and persistence of vibrio spp which are capable of multiplying in water environments are closely and positively correlated with water temperatures baker austin et al 2016 baker austin et al 2013 huehn et al 2014 sterk et al 2015 factors such as temperature solar inactivation nutrient availability and community interactions can have substantial impacts on the survival of fib opportunists and pathogens at the sand water continuum however the effects of these factors are complex and may not be generalizable across the many pathogens that may be present in sand these knowledge gaps contribute a great measure of uncertainty to estimates and models of the effects of global change on human health risk from recreational exposure to beach environments 6 putting it all together modeling approaches for fib in the sand water continuum mechanistic models aim to describe complex phenomena by simulating the dynamics of contributing components such models are useful tools for understanding the relative importance of various fecal sources fate processes and transport pathways for fib and pathogens furthermore they can make predictions about the sanitary quality of beach systems and their impacts on human health a conceptual model summarizing fib sources fate and transport processes in the beach system described in previous sections is shown in fig 3 existing process based models of fib in surface waters use some form of the advection dispersion reaction equation shown below in its unsteady 3d form 2 c t u c x v c y w c z x k h c x y k h c y z k v c z s where u v w are the unsteady 3d velocity components in the coordinate directions x y z respectively z denotes the vertical coordinate and t is time c denotes the fib concentration k h k v are the horizontal and vertical mixing coefficients and s is a general loss term s k c if a first order removal rate constant k is used hipsey et al 2008 provided a general formulation for the net loss term that integrates growth water temperature salinity dissolved organic carbon base mortality light mediated inactivation ph dissolved oxygen settling losses suspended sediment concentration and predation and grazing losses however a variety of simpler net loss terms have been used successfully in localized marine and freshwater environments gao et al 2015 safaie et al 2016 a detailed review of the fib fate and transport processes in surface water and their mathematical representation is available in nevers et al 2011 though more effective incorporation of sand microorganisms and interactions into models is likely to improve model predictive ability improved modeling of interactions between fib and sand sediment reservoirs may be key to further improving the performance of the current generation of hydrodynamic surface water models recent work on modeling fib transport within sand at marine and freshwater beaches includes considering sediment transport and sediment bound fib transport brown and boehm 2016 feng et al 2015 gao et al 2011 thupaki et al 2013 within the beach and in nearshore waters different approaches have been used to model interactions between fib and particles in the past including a models of attachment detachment kinetics based on the mobile immobile framework used in subsurface transport modeling brown and boehm 2016 vangenuchten and wagenet 1989 and b sorption isotherm based approaches typically used to describe partitioning of chemicals in the environment gao et al 2011 2015 thupaki et al 2013 models such as those from gao et al 2011 use a linear coefficient k d c s c d for sediment water partitioning of enterococci based on the assumption that attachment detachment dynamics are fast relative to the time scales associated with advection and dispersion here c s c d denote the mass specific e g cfu g concentration of attached fib and volume specific e g cfu ml concentration of unattached fib respectively while the use of a partition coefficient may approximate the distribution of fib empirically in some locations there is limited evidence that suspended and sorbed fib are in equilibrium or that a single partition coefficient is generalizable for all environments nevers et al 2011 an alternate approach modeling dynamic fib particle interactions is to quantify sediment and associated fib transport as discrete groups based on particle size for example relatively fine particle classes with which e coli are known to readily associate brown et al 2013 hipsey et al 2006 jeng et al 2005 krometis et al 2007 and a coarse size class to simulate changes in bed morphology and the release of fib from the sand reservoir rules for exchange of fib between the water column and the bed sediment must be defined for example to quantify sediment related enterococci at hobie beach in florida feng et al 2013 modeled clean and contaminated sand classes and their changes through time the distribution of the contaminated sand fraction in this approach describes the availability of fib for resuspension in contrast the models described in gao et al 2011 and thupaki et al 2013 used a single particle size class to successfully improve upon models without sediment contributions if fib models considering sediment bacteria interactions are extended to include multiple size classes e g fine and coarse sediment model complexity increases significantly introducing a large number of parameters and assumptions that are difficult to constrain and justify therefore questions of model parsimony complexity and equifinality beven 2006 should be addressed based on a careful comparison of different approaches in addition novel field experiments and data that elucidate fundamental mechanisms of sediment transport with a focus on fib transport and biofilms are needed for example the model of biofilm dynamics presented in section 3 and in vignaga et al 2013 suggest that biofilm on sediments behaves like an elastic membrane that ruptures catastrophically above a velocity threshold current sediment transport formulations chao et al 2008 gao et al 2011 assume that grains of sand roll over one another at some critical shear stress and do not consider catastrophic biofilm rupturing the inclusion of biofilm dynamics in process based models of fib in surface waters and at the sediment water interface may improve model predictions accurate simulation of processes at the sand water continuum such as wave run up on the beach face cyclical wetting and drying associated with tides and waves infiltration of water and lateral movement of water and fib close to the sand water continuum all require high spatial resolution cm to meter scale additionally an understanding of how temporal changes associated with climate change and anthropogenic effects impact these processes is also key to modeling them however it is unclear how representative available fib monitoring data and model approaches are for small scale processes in beach systems or conditions predicted by climate change scenarios alexander et al 2006 brown et al 2008 sneed 2017 for example the fast fib attachment detachment kinetics assumption that justifies the use of a linear partition coefficient is based on groundwater studies as discussed in bai and lung 2005 data from streams and agricultural soils suggest the opposite generalization i e slow kinetics relative to advection and dispersion based on evidence that bacteria once attached will remain in that state as part of a biofilm jamieson et al 2005 additional field data from marine and freshwater sites collected under various hydrometeorological conditions will help test and validate new model frameworks for the effective simulation and prediction of nearshore fib fate and transport at the sand water continuum modeling sediment and sand bound fib transport is a complex but important step in understanding beach microbial dynamics subsurface microbial transport and interactions at the sand water continuum remain critical knowledge gaps especially in turbulent and wave impacted environments the advection dispersion reaction equation serves as the foundation for these models but relevant parameters boundary and initial conditions and model complexity can vary greatly depending on the focal nearshore environment and localized factors existing models are at odds in terms of how to predict dynamics at the sand water continuum especially in light of climate change effects additional field data validation and model development focused on sand and sediment fib transport effects on beaches will be crucial to the improvement of nearshore water quality simulations and prediction of future climate change effects 7 emerging concerns and challenges in the face of predicted climate change as highlighted throughout this review any advancements in modeling or managing the sand water continuum with regard to beach water quality must be responsive to the impacts of climate change on microbiological contamination at recreational beaches as the water and land environments warm and experience changes in storm frequencies the sand water continuum will likely experience changes in both the abundance and diversity of fib and pathogens potentially persisting in these habitats such changes may present unique and unprecedented challenges for recreational water quality management 7 1 increased storm frequency coastal areas are expected to experience increases in the frequency and intensity of storm events as a result of climate change ipcc 2014 as these areas begin to experience more frequent and intense storm events localized flooding runoff and combined sewer overflow events will also become more frequent making these sources of contamination to both the beach water and the sand water continuum more commonplace kessler 2011 roca et al 2019 trtanj et al 2016 usepa 2008 contaminant releases from wastewater treatment plants sewage systems and industrial contamination sources will increase by 50 120 in the us great lakes region patz et al 2008 while groundwater contamination via the infiltration of microbes through the vadose zone is expected to impact well water quality more frequently arnaud et al 2015 klove et al 2014 additionally predicted changes in mean sea levels across latitudes suggest that global average coastal water levels 0 26 0 85 m higher than observed in 1986 2005 will impact beaches in tropical and temperate areas by 2100 ipcc 2014 increased water levels combined with predicted changes to storm frequency and wind patterns will lead to larger areas along the marine shoreline affected by wave and tidal action and periodic wetting enhancing the exchange of microbial contamination between the sand and water 7 2 warming waters in similar fashion to the range shifts seen in terrestrial and aquatic macrofauna kerr et al 2015 parmesan and yohe 2003 perry et al 2005 it may be expected that microorganism community ranges will shift poleward in response to climate change burge et al 2014 ford 1996 lafferty 2009 trtanj et al 2016 as global water fig s3 and air temperatures are predicted to warm the thermotolerance thresholds of some microorganisms may be exceeded while the warmer conditions may lead to increased decay rates and die offs for some species e g fib ishii et al 2006 this may open up niches in temperate coastal areas for more thermotolerant microbes that had previously been found in lower latitudes such as vibrio parahaemolyticus vibrio vulnificus and naegleria fowleri baker austin et al 2013 kemble et al 2012 martinez urtaza et al 2010 additionally pathogens opportunists and fib may be transported poleward directly via hurricanes cyclones and tropical storms known products of ocean surface temperature changes wu et al 2016 elevated water and air temperatures may also foster the growth of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms macfadden et al 2018 these microorganisms unlike most fib can be directly associated with adverse human health outcomes cosgrove and carmeli 2003 de kraker et al 2011 o gara 2017 additionally the expansion of previously undetected microorganisms to temperate regions combined with possible increases in antimicrobial resistance and the propensity of microbes to form biofilms within the sand water continuum suggests that the risks to beachgoers from new and dangerous pathogens will increase in response to climate change 7 3 drought impacts while much attention has been devoted to increases in storms as a result of climate change the effects of drought will also have an impact on recreational water and sand quality though additional research is required to determine whether the effects are positive or negative drought conditions can limit the runoff flowing to beaches from upstream in the watershed leading to declines in runoff associated contamination and potentially higher recreational water quality vu 2018 conversely declines in water levels due to drought will likely expose more of the beach face potentially leading to changes in biofilm development and microbial community growth within the sand water continuum smaller beach face areas subject to wave and tide associated periodic wetting due to water level declines may be expected to facilitate biofilm growth and reduce areas prone to biofilm detachment boehm and weisberg 2005 phillips et al 2014 however a lack of moisture sources to mediate temperature in the sand may result in enhanced decay of microorganisms ishii et al 2006 mika et al 2009 lower water levels will also yield increased surface area for which beachgoers to contact the sand water continuum and its associated microbial communities potentially increasing the risks to beachgoers connected to microbes in the sand water continuum beach management for public health will thus require adaptation for increased beach usage associated with greater surface area for beachgoers to utilize as well as changes to biofilm dynamics and resulting risks to beachgoers 8 management for the future the predicted effects of climate change necessitate a paradigm shift within recreational beach management and policy development coffey et al 2014 effective beach management to protect public health into the future will not only account for contamination in the sand water continuum but will also take an adaptive approach that can be adjusted in response to the impacts of changing storm frequency flooding effects and upstream contamination potential beach managers particularly in temperate regions affected by warming air and water temperatures will need to monitor both beach sand and recreational water for a greater variety of pathogenic species than they have in the past to ensure public health predicted droughts may also necessitate more effective management of recreational water quality especially terms of the exchange of water and associated microbes between sand and water environments at the beach this will require an adaptive and holistic management strategy an adaptive approach that can be altered in response to climate change impacts will be most effective for management of water resources under rapidly and substantially changing conditions likewise a holistic beachscape approach to management of recreational water systems can effectively account for the entire beach system weiskerger and whitman 2018 such an approach will incorporate water sand wildlife human and upstream contamination runoff impacts on beach health rather than simply focusing on recreational water kelly et al 2018 and can lead to management and policy that preserves human wildlife and environmental health at beaches 9 conclusions beach ecosystems are dynamic mosaics of aquatic sand and sediment habitats the sand water continuum plays an important role in the accumulation transport and persistence of microbial contaminants at beach systems though it is difficult to model and is often overlooked in nearshore research management and policy making efforts local hydrometeorological and infrastructural conditions can influence contamination patterns at beaches over time and across space so localized monitoring and modeling efforts are needed to effectively manage beach systems in the face of contamination in both the nearshore and at the sand water continuum beach management policies are lagging behind the research into the role of sand as a contamination source however several nations and the who have recognized sand as an important reservoir of fib and route of exposure to pathogens the recognition and ongoing discussion of sand as a contamination source at beaches may signal a paradigm shift toward more holistic beachscape frameworks for guiding beach research and management actions future efforts to model nearshore human health risks must be robust and adaptable to account for the association disassociation of human health relevant biofilm and particle bound constituents associated with beach sands and underlying sediments as well as uncertainty associated with changing

18627,epidemiological studies have consistently associated the consumption of chlorinated drinking water with an enhanced risk of bladder cancer while this suggests that some disinfection byproducts dbps are bladder carcinogens causal agents are unknown this study aims to highlight likely candidates to achieve this structures of known and hypothesised dbps were compared with 76 known bladder carcinogens the latter are dominated by nitrogenous and aromatic compounds only 10 are halogenated under 10 of the chlorine applied during drinking water treatment is converted into identified halogenated byproducts most of the chlorine is likely to be consumed during the generation of unidentified non halogenated oxidation products six nitrosamines are among the nine most potent bladder carcinogens and two of them are known to be dbps n nitrosodiphenylamine and nitrosodibutylamine however these and other nitrosamines are formed in insufficiently low concentrations in chlorinated drinking water to account for the observed bladder cancer risk furthermore although not proven bladder carcinogens certain amines haloamides halocyclopentenoic acids furans and haloquinones are potential candidates at present most identified bladder carcinogens are nitrogenous whereas 90 of natural organic matter is not therefore non nitrogenous dbps are likely to contribute to the bladder cancer risk given the high proportion of dbps that remains uncharacterised it is important that future research prioritises compounds believed to be potent toxicants graphical abstract image 1

trihalomethane tox total organic halides uplc ultra performance liquid chromatography us epa united states environmental protection agency 1 introduction chlorine disinfection is commonly used in drinking water treatment for deactivating pathogens and preventing waterborne diseases including typhoid and cholera boorman et al 1999 chaidou et al 1999 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 however chlorine can also react with most organic and inorganic compounds in water and form undesirable disinfection byproducts dbps gottschalk et al 2010 li and mitch 2018 plewa and wagner 2015 rook 1974 the nature and concentration of dbps formed in drinking water depend on the conditions of disinfection and on the composition of the source water bruzzoniti and sarzanini 2011 gottschalk et al 2010 hrudey 2008 lipmann 2009 natural organic matter nom which consists of terrestrial principally humic substances and microbially derived material e g from algae sewage or bacteria is the main source of dbp precursors bond et al 2012 hileman 1982 weinberg 1999 nom is a complex mixture of organic compounds with a wide range of molecular weights and chemical functionalities bull et al 2011 and its composition varies by location season and climate boorman et al 1999 lipmann 2009 weinberg 1999 therefore there is a wide variety of dbps that can form from nom as illustrated by over 700 dbps having been identified in drinking water wastewater and synthetic samples thun et al 2017 since the discovery of dbps in the 1970s rook 1974 concerns have risen about their toxicity as a result regulating bodies have enforced limits for the amount of dbps present in drinking water the united states environmental protection agency us epa has regulated the concentration of the sum of four trihalomethanes thms chloroform bromoform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane the sum of five haloacetic acids haas monochloro dichloro trichloro monobromo dibromoacetic acid bromate and chlorite fig s1 in supplementary material while in europe the sum of the same four thms and bromate are regulated table s1 council of the european union 1998 us epa 2002 the maximum permitted concentrations of regulated dbps effectively represent both known and unknown dbps indeed while nitrogenous and iodinated dbps are unregulated they have been reported to be more toxic than their non nitrogenous and brominated chlorinated analogues respectively wagner and plewa 2017 in the past 40 years several epidemiological studies have found an association between the long term consumption of chlorinated water and an increased risk of urinary bladder cancer villanueva et al 2003 this association has been observed repeatedly and in different regions of the world including america king and marrett 1996 mcgeehin et al 1993 wilkins and comstock 1981 and europe koivusalo et al 1998 the us epa has estimated that the proportion of bladder cancer cases attributable to the consumption of chlorinated drinking water is between 2 and 17 us epa 2003 since chlorine itself has not been found to be carcinogenic the observed risk of bladder cancer has been linked to dbps formed during chlorination bull et al 2006 lipmann 2009 toxicological studies have identified only two bladder carcinogens amongst known dbps nitrosodibutylamine ndba and n nitrosodiphenylamine ndpha however these were present at very low concentrations in drinking water low ng l range for ndpha and 20 ng l for ndba li et al 2011 wang et al 2011 thus the results obtained in epidemiological and toxicological studies diverge there remains a need to identify plausible bladder carcinogens that are formed during chlorination of drinking water in sufficient concentrations to account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies richardson et al 2007 reported that this mismatch has not yet been explained and bull et al 2006 noted only limited efforts to fill this gap in dbp research a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the dbps responsible have not been toxicologically characterised yet indeed of the 700 individual dbps identified in water only about 80 have been subject to systematic toxicological studies bull et al 2006 lipmann 2009 melnick and hooth 2011 plewa and wagner 2015 richardson et al 2007 another possible explanation is that toxicological studies assess the health effect caused by individual chemicals or simple mixtures whereas in reality people are exposed to the entire mixture of dbps present in water little is known of the toxicological effects of the dbps interactions within such a complex mixture kogenivas and villanueva 2011 additive or synergistic toxicological effects could contribute to explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed in agreement with this tatematsu et al 1977 showed that a mixture of 3 carcinogens n butyl n 4 hydroxybutyl nitrosamine n 4 5 nitro 2 furyl 2 thiazolyl formamide and n 2 fluorenylacetamide caused bladder cancer in 26 of the rats studied whereas when administered individually they did not also interactions between dbps within a mixture could potentially impact the toxicity the mode of action and the target organs of individual dbps more research is needed on the toxicological effects of mixtures of dbps kogenivas and villanueva 2011 finally it is likely that the critical dbps are yet to be identified in drinking water lending credence to this hypothesis only 60 of halogenated dbps have been characterised pressman et al 2010 while the equivalent figure for non halogenated dbps is much lower this review aims to assess which known or hypothesised dbps dbps whose presence has been proposed but not confirmed in drinking water may be implicated in the bladder cancer association to achieve this the toxicological significance of known dbps is discussed and the structures of known and hypothesised dbps compared with those of known bladder carcinogens a secondary aim was to highlight dbps that may have been missed or overlooked by commonly used sample preparation or analysis methods recognising potentially critical dbps will contribute to dbp research by suggesting compounds that should be prioritised in future occurrence and toxicology studies 2 toxicological significance of known dbps 2 1 carcinogenic dbps different forms of toxicity can be assessed including cytotoxicity genotoxicity mutagenicity or carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity measurements in chinese hamster ovary cho cells have received considerable attention for determining the experimental toxicity of a range of dbps jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2008 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 however the present work mainly uses carcinogenicity data as these were available for a wider range of molecules and quantify their ability to cause cancer specifically td50 median toxic dose values of dbps which describe their potency to induce cancer were analysed this parameter corresponds to the dose of chemical that would produce cancer in 50 of the population studied in a lifetime bull et al 2006 lipmann 2009 td50 values are derived from toxicological tests with experimental animals they are indicative as there is uncertainty on how to translate the carcinogenicity observed in animals to humans the sensitivity to a carcinogen and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis vary among species which makes it complex to extrapolate the cancer risk from experimental animal studies to humans bull et al 2006 kogenivas and villanueva 2011 the carcinogenicity of 409 dbps was examined more than 700 dbps have been reported in the literature thun et al 2017 but we selected only those that are known to occur in drinking water as opposed to wastewater or synthetic water samples details in and below table s2 the dbps present in the carcinogenic potency database developed by gold 2011 were considered to be carcinogens they are gathered in table 1 with their td50 values in units of mg kg day and the corresponding target organs the typical concentrations at which they occur in drinking water were taken from lipmann 2009 when available and from other sources richardson 2011 li et al 2011 wang et al 2011 krasner et al 2006 otherwise the values of td50 concentration were calculated for each dbp using their lowest td50 value when several were available for different species worst case scenario this ratio was calculated in order to assess the risk of each dbp for causing cancer by taking into account both their carcinogenic potency and the concentrations at which they have been observed in water the td50 concentration can be interpreted as the daily consumption of drinking water that would cause a 50 increase in cancer risk the average daily recommended water consumption is 1 7 l day 2 5 and 2 l day recommended water intake for men and women respectively of which 70 80 comes from drinking european food safety authority 2010 therefore the average daily water consumption per mass of body weight ranges between 17 and 34 ml kg day for adults weighing between 50 and 100 kg any dbp present in water having a td50 concentration close to or lower than this range therefore represents a high risk of developing cancer of the 409 dbps analysed 22 have been reported as carcinogenic in animals table 1 the most potent carcinogenic dbps based on their td50 values are nitrosamines and mutagen x mx 3 chloro 4 dichloromethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone table 1 most nitrosamines including n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosomorpholine ndmor n nitrosopyrrolidine ndpyr and ndba have td50 values 1 mg kg day table 1 ndma and ndea are recognised by the international agency for research on cancer iarc as probable human carcinogens iarc 1987 whereas ndmor n nitrosopiperidine ndpip and ndpyr are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens according to the national toxicology program ntp national toxicology program ntp 1981 equally mx is a very potent carcinogen with a td50 of 0 583 mg kg day table 1 note that the regulated thms and haas are at least 3 orders of magnitude less potent than ndea which is the most potent carcinogen amongst selected dbps table 1 however when taking into account the concentration of these compounds in drinking water none appear to be a potential candidate for explaining the risk of cancer observed nitrosamines are the dbps that have the greatest risk of inducing cancer as indicated by their low td50 concentration value indeed ndma ndea ndmor and ndpyr have td50 concentration 20 l kg day yet these values are 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than the daily recommended water consumption 17 34 ml kg day and therefore these nitrosamines cannot explain the risk of cancer observed in agreement with this hrudey and charrois 2012 reported that the concentration and occurrence of nitrosamines are too low to account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies similarly mx which is one of the most potent carcinogens among known dbps table 1 has a td50 concentration as high as 686 l kg day reflecting the low concentrations at which it occurs in drinking water 0 85 μg l assuming a similar potency for humans as observed in experimental animals this means that mx itself cannot account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies however structurally similar dbps such as 4 bromochloromethyl 3 chloro 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone bmx 1 3 chloro 4 dibromomethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone bmx 2 3 bromo 4 dibromomethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone bmx 3 3 chloro 4 dichloromethyl 2 5h furanone red mx or z 2 3 dichloro 4 oxobutenoic acid mca fig s2 have also been found in drinking water richardson et al 2007 to date there are insufficient toxicological data available for these compounds collectively they could be of concern providing they have a similar carcinogenic potency as mx bull et al 2006 hrudey 2009 the case of mx shows how important it is to consider the concentration of dbps in water in combination with their potency in order to investigate the observed risk of cancer hrudey 2009 reported that the doses at which chlorination dbps produce toxic effects in animals are between 100 and 10 000 times higher than the doses resulting from an average daily consumption of chlorinated water thus he concluded that individually none of the chlorination dbps identified at that time could explain the risk of bladder cancer observed however it is uncertain whether as a group and considering interactions and synergistic effects they could account for this risk another striking point that can be drawn from the analysis of toxicological studies relates to the organs affected by tumours epidemiological studies have found the consumption of chlorinated water was primarily associated with urinary bladder cancer whereas most identified dbps produce tumours in the liver kidney or other organs table 1 since the kidney and urinary bladder are both part of the urinary tract it is possible that dbps producing tumours in the kidney could also affect the urinary bladder however apart from ndba and ndpha whose concentrations in combination with their carcinogenic potency are too low to account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies table 1 no other dbp is currently known to cause bladder cancer principally due to their complexity and economic cost the number of in vivo carcinogenic studies on dbps is limited however emerging approaches including in vitro cell transformation assays appear to be simpler alternatives to identify the carcinogenic potential of new dbps marsà et al 2018 2017 wang et al 2017 deangelo et al 2007 one advantage of this approach is that in vitro assays can be performed on human cells and especially on target organ cells e g t24 bladder cells marsà et al 2018 this eliminates the uncertainty of in vivo studies on how to translate the carcinogenic risk from animals to humans this approach is relevant for investigating which dbps could contribute to the risk of bladder cancer 2 2 metabolism of dbps into mutagens tests for carcinogenicity mutagenicity or genotoxicity are often performed on animals or animals cells inbred strains are normally used in such experiments which limits genetic variability conversely differences in human genotypes can impact the incidence of bladder cancer cantor et al 2010 the enzyme glutathione s transferase theta 1 gstt1 has been found to activate brominated thms into mutagens in salmonella demarini et al 1997 the activated thms can then react with deoxyribonucleic acid dna to produce mutations regli et al 2015 however in subjects having a gstt1 null genotype as opposed to gstt1 present genotype this activation is inhibited cantor et al 2010 the urinary tract contains high levels of the gstt1 enzyme cantor et al 2010 therefore in subjects having the gstt1 present genotype brominated thms reaching the urinary tract may be activated into mutagens increasing the risk of bladder cancer this has been observed experimentally in humans by cantor et al 2010 they found that subjects with the gstt1 present genotype had a 2 2 fold increased risk of bladder cancer compared to subjects with the null genotype for an average long term thms exposure 49 0 μg l this effect has been observed for brominated thms but it is possible that polymorphisms can activate other dbps into mutagens or carcinogens in a similar way a study by villanueva et al 2007 indicated that besides ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation of dbps in water by showering swimming or bathing were also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer indeed swimmers had a 60 increased risk for bladder cancer relative to non swimmers villanueva et al 2007 contrastingly the enzyme glutathione s transferase zeta 1 gstz1 has been found to detoxify dichloro and α haloacids kogenivas and villanueva 2011 some of which are carcinogenic in animals table 1 board and anders 2005 found that the enzyme gstz1 transformed the carcinogenic haas dichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid into glyoxylic acid the latter is not reported as a carcinogen by the iarc or the carcinogenic potency database gold 2011 the gene that codes for this enzyme is polymorphic the ct tt forms of the gene as opposed to the cc form inhibit the activity of the enzyme gstz1 as a consequence cantor et al 2010 have observed that subjects having the gstz1 ct tt genotype that were exposed to concentrations of thms 49 0 μg l had a 2 9 fold increase in the risk of bladder cancer compared to subjects exposed to concentrations of thms 8 0 μg l whereas subjects presenting the cc genotype only had a 1 3 increased risk for the same exposure kogenivas and villanueva 2011 indicated a similar detoxifying action for the n acetyl transferase 2 nat2 enzyme they reported that subjects having the high risk form of the nat2 gene have a limited capacity to detoxify aromatic amines which represent a substantial proportion of bladder carcinogens details in section 4 1 as a result they reported a 40 increase in the risk of bladder cancer for people having the high risk genotype for nat2 similarly cantor et al 2010 observed a significant 1 3 fold increase in the risk of bladder cancer for people having the nat2 slow genotype relative to subjects having the nat2 fast genotype these results suggest that brominated thms α haloacids and aromatic amines may account for the increase in the risk of bladder cancer observed regli et al 2015 3 dbps potentially missed or overlooked in water 3 1 missing fraction of dbps over 700 individual dbps have been identified in various sample types thun et al 2017 pressman et al 2010 reported that 75 halogenated dbps only accounted for 59 by mass of the total organic halides tox formed in chlorinated samples leaving 41 of unknown halogenated compounds krasner et al 2006 observed an even higher proportion of unknown dbps in 12 drinking water treatment plants located in the usa they found that 92 selected halogenated dbps accounted for only 30 by mass of the tox on average fig s3 in addition many non halogenated dbps are formed during the chlorination of drinking water and have been poorly characterised in comparison to the halogenated dbps richardson et al 2007 it is considered impractical to quantify the non halogenated dbps hrudey 2008 hileman 1982 reported that 50 80 of the chlorine used to disinfect water takes part in oxidation reactions while only 1 6 16 of the chlorine leads to the formation of halogenated compounds with the balance comprising other types of reactions while the ultimate product of nom oxidation is co2 many intermediate oxidation products are also expected larson and weber 1994 sigleo et al 1980 chlorinated a treated estuarine water and found 6 37 of applied chlorine resulted in the mineralisation of organic matter into co2 based on a chlorine mass balance using these references hileman 1982 pressman et al 2010 sigleo et al 1980 and assuming that dbps generated remain in water the amount of characterised tox represents only up to 10 of applied chlorine whereas 13 74 is used to form intermediate oxidation products the vast majority of which are unknown consequently the fraction of unidentified dbps in chlorinated drinking water is far higher than indicated by research into halogenated dbps these numbers are sobering given the amount of resources devoted since the 1970s to the identification of dbps and illustrate the need to be strategic when it comes to searching for currently unknown compounds several studies aiming to characterise the missing fraction of dbps suggested it is mostly made of high molecular weight 500 g mol non volatile and polar compounds richardson 2002 richardson et al 2000 urbansky and magnuson 2002 weinberg 1999 zhang et al 2005 zhang and minear 2002 in particular analysis using ultrafiltration membranes indicated that about 50 of the tox produced from chlorination is comprised of compounds having a molecular weight above 500 g mol richardson 2011 richardson et al 2002 an international workshop held in 1998 aimed at investigating unidentified dbps bromoamines nitrosamines chloroketamines chloroaldamines polycarboxylic acids polyamines and organic peroxides were proposed as dbps from the missing fraction fig 1 richardson 2003 by modelling the reactions between disinfectants and substructures of nom bull et al 2006 suggested haloquinones halocyclopentenoic acids and nitrosamides as proposed dbps a study performed on drinking water samples of 11 utilities using chlorine ozone chloramine chlorine dioxide or a combination of these suggested that ndma the most prevalent of the seven nitrosamines identified in water generally constituted only 5 by mass of the total nitrosamines on a median basis dai and mitch 2013 this suggests that there are more nitrosamines to be discovered in chlorinated water as little is known about the toxicity of the dbps from the missing fraction it potentially contains compounds that could account for the elevated risk of bladder cancer associated with the consumption of chlorinated water 3 2 potential dbps missed during sampling and analytical procedures pre analytical treatment is a possible cause of loss of dbps from water samples kinani et al 2016a 2016b particularly dbps can be missed or overlooked due to use of unsuitable quenching agents these are commonly used in order to stop chlorination reactions after sampling and before analysis at the same time several studies have shown that selected quenching agents such as sodium arsenite or sodium sulphite can degrade dbps croue and reckhow 1989 liu and zhang 2013 yu and reckhow 2016 liu and zhang 2013 found that sodium arsenite decomposed polar brominated dbps and other halogenated organic dbps including chloropicrin trichloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile similarly yu and reckhow 2016 observed that n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide had been previously missed in water samples as it was reduced to dichloroacetamide by commonly used quenching agents ascorbic acid sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate croue and reckhow 1989 reported that sodium sulphite degraded dbps such as chloropicrin trichloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile a study assessing the degradation of 31 dbps by 5 quenching agents showed that sodium sulphite is suitable for the analysis of inorganic dbps whereas ascorbic acid is recommended for organic dbps kristiana et al 2014 nonetheless no quenching agent is thought to be suitable for all dbps larson and weber 1994 reported that sulfoxides n nitrosamines quinones halogenated nitroaromatic and azoaromatic compounds can be degraded in natural reducing environments fig 2 therefore those compounds are also predicted to be susceptible to reduction by quenching agents those dbps that are deteriorated by unsuitable quenching agents may represent part of the unknown fraction of dbps despite being the most common method for analysing unknown dbps gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms has some limitations richardson 2002 weinberg 1999 polar dbps are not suitable for analysis by gc ms richardson 2003 2002 wang et al 2016 weinberg 1999 they produce broad peaks which can make their resolution from other compounds difficult richardson 2002 the chromatographic separation of small and hydrophilic compounds is also challenging weinberg 1999 further very hydrophilic dbps are difficult to extract from water weinberg 1999 2009 another limitation of the gc ms relates to the analysis of dbps of limited volatility richardson 2003 wang et al 2016 weinberg 1999 weinberg 2009 reported that compounds with a boiling point higher than 200 c are not suitable for gc analysis similarly compounds that have a molecular weight 500 g mol are difficult to analyse by gc as they tend to be less volatile richardson 2002 zhang et al 2005 thermally unstable dbps such as halonitromethanes hnms or ndpha are degraded during gc analysis boyd et al 2011 richardson et al 2008 richardson and ternes 2014 wang et al 2016 and finally ionic dbps can be missed using gc ms unless the ph of samples is lowered to render them neutral richardson 2002 wang et al 2016 in order to analyse polar non volatile thermally unstable or ionic dbps methods such as liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry lc ms or alternative sample preparation techniques should be considered derivatisation techniques can overcome the limitations of sample extraction and analysis using gc ms they can either increase the volatility or the ionisation efficiency of dbps improve their thermal stability or decrease their polarity kinani et al 2016b weinberg 1999 this can be illustrated by the us epa method 552 2 for the analysis of haas munch et al 1995 their reaction with acidic methanol results in an increase in their volatility and reduced polarity prior to their analysis by gc coupled with electron capture detector gc ecd weinberg 2009 o 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine pfbha can be used to derivatise small and polar aldehydes and ketones with less than ten carbon atoms which are difficult to extract from water the resulting oximes are non polar hence can be easily extracted from water for further analysis by gc ms richardson 2011 2002 weinberg 1999 in summary the analytical difficulties associated with positively identifying dbps could contribute to the mismatch between the toxicologically characterised dbps and the elevated risk of bladder cancer associated with the consumption of water disinfected with chlorine 4 prediction and prioritisation of toxicologically important dbps 4 1 structural considerations for predicting carcinogenicity the structures of known bladder carcinogens were analysed to identify structural similarities among them a total of 76 compounds are named as bladder carcinogens in the carcinogenic potency database gold 2011 and in bull et al 2006 table s3 the functional groups present in each compound were identified and reported to assess their incidence across all known bladder carcinogens fig 3 as the carcinogenicity of a compound is related to its structure zhang et al 2016 identifying the functional groups present among bladder carcinogens can give indications about the structural moieties responsible among the 76 bladder carcinogens 84 have a molecular weight between 100 and 300 g mol the proportion of nitrogenous compounds 83 is striking fig 3 table s3 many are amines but there are also nine nitro compounds eleven amides and nine nitrosamines the latter being a recognised class of chemicals among dbps in addition 75 of bladder carcinogens possess five or six membered rings with 82 of them being aromatic cycles fig 3 table s3 several quinones and furans have also been identified as bladder carcinogens as a result of the presence of many aromatics and many nitrogenous compounds among bladder carcinogens half of them posess both functionalities fig 3 aromatic and heterocyclic amines nitrosamines and quinones are the groups of bladder carcinogens the most likely to be dbps formed from nom bull et al 2006 bull et al 2006 reported that compounds with a td50 10 mg kg day are unlikely to explain the risk of bladder cancer observed in epidemiological studies unless their concentration is higher than 100 μg l twenty four bladder carcinogens have a td50 10 mg kg day table s4 eight of them are aromatic amines and six are amides furthermore among the nine nitrosamines that are known bladder carcinogens eight of them have a td50 10 mg kg day and 6 have a td50 1 mg kg day table s4 not only are they the predominant group among the most potent bladder carcinogens but they also have been identified as dbps as several compounds of their class are very potent bladder carcinogens currently unknown nitrosamines are plausible bladder carcinogens it is noticeable that only ten known bladder carcinogens are halogenated and none of them are structurally similar to known dbps fig 3 table s3 based on this observation it is possible that the non halogenated fraction of unidentified byproducts may account for the missing toxicologically significant compounds contrastingly it has been reported that nitrogenous and iodinated dbps had an increased toxicity compared to their non nitrogenous and brominated chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 in particular iodinated thms and haas were respectively more cytotoxic in cho cells and more genotoxic than their brominated analogues richardson et al 2007 similarly the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of brominated haas were higher than those of their chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 overall based on genotoxicity and cytotoxicity data of 18 analogues dbps iodinated dbps were found to be more toxic than brominated ones which were in turn more toxic than their chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 brominated compounds were also found to have a higher carcinogenicity than their chlorinated analogues hileman 1982 richardson 2003 richardson et al 2007 richardson and ternes 2014 carcinogenesis is a complex process carcinogens interact directly or indirectly via metabolic transformation with dna or proteins and alter their functioning wu et al 2015 the carcinogenic potential of chemicals is related to their molecular structure zhang et al 2016 however owing to the many mechanisms that can cause cancer and the range of factors that can influence carcinogenesis no existing model can predict the target organs of carcinogens bull et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 and morales helguera et al 2005 identified several physichochemical properties as being important for predicting the carcinogenicity of chemical compounds an increase in hydrophobicity enhanced carcinogenicity this is because hydrophobic compounds can more readily penetrate biological membranes and reach organs and tissues in the body morales helguera et al 2005 also electronic related properties such as the bond dipole moment influence carcinogenicity morales helguera et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 an increase in polarity decreased the carcinogenic potency as polarity and hydrophobicity are negatively correlated morales helguera et al 2005 finally carcinogenicity decreased when the number of hydrogen donors and the molecular weight increased zhang et al 2016 some nitrogenous structural fragments were found to contribute positively to carcinogenicity casalegno and sello 2016 morales helguera et al 2005 morales helguera et al 2005 used descriptors of hydrophobic electronic and steric features of carcinogenic compounds and highlighted nitro and nitrosamine fragments in particular similarly casalegno and sello 2016 suggested that nitrofuran nitrosamine aromatic and aromatic amine moieties contribute to carcinogenic activity however their presence does not imply carcinogenicity many counterexamples were found and no plausible reason based on their structure could discriminate two compounds having the same moieties but different carcinogenic potencies casalegno and sello 2016 4 2 prioritisation of dbp research based on toxicological potency as the total number of dbps present in water is daunting and for many compounds little is known of their toxicity prioritising research on dbps by focussing on toxicologically significant structures is a sensible approach woo et al 2002 and bull et al 2006 used predictive structure activity relationship sar and quantitative structure toxicity relationship qstr methods to rank dbps based on their potential carcinogenicity these models compare compounds that have not been experimentally tested for their toxicity with compounds having similar structures and that have been toxicologically characterised woo et al 2002 however they cannot give any information on the target organ of a compound predicted to be carcinogenic bull et al 2006 out of the 209 dbps considered woo et al 2002 selected 20 compounds with a moderate or high moderate carcinogenic potential fig s4 these included halofuranones haloalkanes alkenes halonitriles and haloketones the halofuranones bmx 1 bmx 2 and bmx 3 fig s4 were the dbps predicted to be of the highest priority woo et al 2002 furthermore bull et al 2006 identified n haloamines as toxicologically important using a similar approach however based on the occurrence and the predicted loaels of the dbps identified to date bull et al 2006 reported that no established dbp would have enough potency to account for the risk of cancer observed in epidemiological studies thus the possibility that the critical dbps have not been identified yet in drinking water appears as one of the most plausible explanation to the mismatch observed by modelling the reactions of sub structures of nom with chlorine and chloramine and using qstr to predict their toxicity bull et al 2006 identified 16 probable dbps of significant toxicological importance fig s5 and table s5 their prioritisation criteria were that the dbps either have an actual or predicted loael 1 mg kg day or are predicted to be carcinogenic with a td50 or loael 10 mg kg or that they belong to a class containing toxicologically potent compounds bull et al 2011 2006 they also identified four classes of novel dbps of high priority haloquinones halocyclopentenoic acids nitrosamines and nitrosamides halonitriles and haloamides bull et al 2006 some of these have been subsequently found to occur in drinking water the nitrosamine ndpha was identified in chlorinated and chloraminated waters in concentrations ranging between 0 19 and 1 8 ng l li et al 2011 and the haloquinones 2 6 dichloro 3 methyl 1 4 benzoquinone dcmbq 2 3 6 trichloro 1 4 benzoquinone tcbq 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone dcbq and 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone dbbq at concentrations between 0 5 and 274 5 ng l li et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 5 potential candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed the compounds that have the potential to explain the bladder cancer risk attributed to dbps were investigated as bull et al 2006 reported that the dbps identified in water to date cannot explain the risk of bladder cancer observed based on their predicted lowest observed adverse effect level loael emerging and undiscovered dbps are emphasised the structures and functional groups present in toxicologically important compounds and bladder carcinogens identified in section 2 and 4 were compared with those of proposed dbps identified in section 3 the toxicologically important compounds structures considered included known dbps that are potent carcinogens table 1 known dbps prioritised by woo et al 2002 fig s4 structures that contribute to carcinogenicity section 4 1 and structures that are present in bladder carcinogens fig 3 compounds considered as proposed dbps included those named in the international workshop of 1998 richardson 2003 as members of the missing fraction of dbps fig 1 compounds susceptible to reduction by quenching agents fig 2 and dbps predicted to form by modelling reactions of chlorine with nom fig s5 table s5 and section 4 2 the incidence of the groups of compounds present in the 2 categories is represented in fig 4 the classes of compounds that were both identified as proposed dbps and toxicologically important compounds were considered as potential candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed 5 1 nitrogenous dbps 5 1 1 nitrosamines as nitrosamines are plausible bladder carcinogens and some compounds of this class were proposed as dbps from the missing fraction fig 1 section 4 2 novel nitrosamines appear as serious candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed in epidemiological studies the concentrations of the nitrosamines identified to date in chlorinated water are too low to account for the risk observed table 1 although this class of compounds is mainly formed from chloramination nitrosamines can also be found in water disinfected with chlorine in 12 chlorinated systems in north america the average concentration of ndma which is the most prevalent of the nitrosamines identified to date in water was 7 3 ng l in comparison to 27 1 ng l in 10 chloraminated systems boyd et al 2011 at this concentration novel nitrosamines would need to be 5 to 6 orders of magnitude more potent than ndma table 1 to produce a significant risk of causing bladder cancer i e to have a td50 concentration value equal to the daily recommended water consumption of 17 34 ml kg day in addition the most reactive ndma precursors are anthropogenic bond et al 2017 and therefore the formation of ndma is greater in drinking water sources impacted by treated wastewater krasner et al 2013 5 1 2 amines and aromatic amines certain amines including bromoamines and polyamines were proposed as unidentified dbps fig 1 richardson 2003 moreover bull et al 2006 and woo et al 2002 prioritised haloamines for their toxicity although these compounds are known to occur in water only limited occurrence and toxicological data exists bull et al 2011 as no compound structurally similar to n chloramines had any carcinogenicity data the qstr analysis undertaken by bull et al 2006 could not assess their carcinogenic potential however haloamines were considered of high priority because n chloramines have been predicted to induce adverse effects and some of their plausible metabolic products have structures similar to that of known bladder carcinogens bull et al 2006 aromatic amines represented half of the identified bladder carcinogens fig 3 interestingly chevrier et al 2004 observed a reduction in the risk of bladder cancer when the water was disinfected with ozone instead of chlorine this suggests that the precursors of bladder carcinogens were degraded by ozonation as ozone reacts principally with amines sulphur containing compounds polycyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds activated with hydroxyl or amino groups gottschalk et al 2010 larson and weber 1994 von gunten 2003 these groups including aromatic amines may be linked to potential precursors of bladder carcinogens many aromatic amines have been observed amongst anthropogenic compounds table s6 and these could generate aromatic amine dbps however due to the low concentration of their precursors in water ng l to low μg l dbps formed from anthropogenic compounds would need to be extremely potent carcinogens if they are responsible for the association with bladder cancer table 1 to illustrate this point a chemical occurring at a concentration of 0 5 or 5 μg l in drinking water would need to have respective td50 values of 0 017 and 0 17 μg kg day in order to have td50 concentration values of 34 ml kg day the daily recommended water consumption these median toxic doses are 150 1500 times lower than that of the most potent carcinogenic dbp ndea table 1 5 1 3 haloamides and halonitriles haloamides and halonitriles were predicted to form as novel dbps chlorination experiments of naturally occurring amino acids suggested that higher molecular weight halonitriles and haloamides could form in water bull et al 2006 several were predicted to be carcinogens 3 bromopropionitrile 3 3 dichloropropionitrile 2 3 dibromopropionitrile 3 3 3 trichloropropionitrile dichloroacetamide bromochloroacetamide 2 bromo 3 chloropropamide 2 3 dibromopropamide 2 3 dichloropropamide bull et al 2011 2006 and 11 amides are in the list of bladder carcinogens fig 3 two aromatic halonitriles 2 chlorophenylacetonitrile and 3 4 dichlorophenylacetonitrile were recently identified as new dbps in chlorinated and chloraminated waters and were found to be 1 order of magnitude more cytotoxic than their aliphatic analogues zhang et al 2018 5 2 non nitrogenous dbps 5 2 1 halocyclopentenoic acids furans and halofuranones bull et al 2006 predicted that several halocyclopentenoic acids form during disinfection table s5 the authors considered this class of compounds to be of high priority because of their structural resemblance to the halofuranone mx which has been shown to target the urinary bladder in some species bull et al 2006 mx was also the most carcinogenic dbp after the nitrosamines table 1 and halofuranones especially brominated ones were prioritised for their toxicity by woo et al 2002 due to the low predicted loael of the compounds of this class they could collectively present a significant risk bull et al 2006 especially 3 5 dichloro 1 hydroxylcyclopent 2 enoic acid has a very low predicted loael of 0 250 μg kg day bull et al 2006 table s5 assuming it occurred in water at a concentration of 1 μg l a consumption of water of 0 250 l kg day would cause adverse health effects this value is much lower than the equivalent value calculated for the most carcinogenic dbp ndea based on its td50 the consumption of water that would cause a 50 increase in the risk of cancer due to the presence of ndea is 2 7 l kg day table 1 therefore if halocyclopentenoic acids were present in the missing fraction of dbps they might contribute to explaining the gap between epidemiological and toxicological studies bull et al 2011 to our knowledge the presence of halocyclopentenoic acids has not been reported in water to date however gong et al 2005 observed the formation of a similar compound 2 2 4 trichloro 5 methoxycyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione from chlorination of the nom surrogate syringaldehyde more research is needed to determine whether this compound and some halocyclopentenoic acids do indeed occur in drinking water mx has been shown to be generated from model phenolic compounds langvik et al 1991 zou et al 2000 the precise formation mechanisms are complex with syringaldehyde identified as the most reactive precursor forming a 0 01 mol mol yield of mx under controlled laboratory chlorination conditions zou et al 2000 5 2 2 haloquinones haloquinones can form from reactions between chlorine chloramine and phenolic polyphenolic or polymethoxy organic precursors bull et al 2006 kosaka et al 2017 reported that para substituted phenolic compounds and para substituted aromatic amines are precursors of the haloquinone dcbq and phenolic compounds are common constituents of nom thurman 1985 haloquinones were predicted to form during chlorination by bull et al 2006 four of the 76 bladder carcinogens are quinones table s3 fig 3 several haloquinones were predicted to be carcinogens table s5 and the literature on toxicology of quinones suggests they could cause bladder cancer bull et al 2011 2006 li et al 2015 indeed haloquinones have some similarities with known bladder carcinogens that have polyphenolic or quinone structures and their metabolic activation resembles that of bladder carcinogens bull et al 2006 haloquinones have the potential to be of significant health concern even at low concentrations as their predicted loaels range between 5 and 80 μg kg day bull et al 2011 2006 bull et al 2006 reported that if the concentrations of tcbq and dcmbq were higher than 10 ng l and they were confirmed as bladder carcinogens these haloquinones could account for the risks observed in epidemiological studies following the predictions of bull et al 2006 haloquinones have received considerable attention li et al 2011 have developed a solid phase extraction spe lc esi ms ms method to quantify four halobenzoquinones dcmbq tcbq dcbq and dbbq these compounds were subsequently detected in chlorinated waters at concentrations between 0 5 and 274 5 ng l li et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 tcbq and dcmbq were found in chlorinated water at concentrations in the range 2 9 9 1 and 0 9 6 5 ng l respectively li et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 in vitro experiments have shown that the four halobenzoquinones identified in water were 1 000 times more cytotoxic than some regulated thms li et al 2015 in addition their transformation byproducts can damage dna which suggests that they could be genotoxic and carcinogenic li et al 2015 following the discovery of halobenzoquinones in water wang et al 2014 observed that they naturally degrade to form halo hydroxyl benzoquinones these are more stable than their parent compounds and were found to be 2 times less cytotoxic albeit still considerably more cytotoxic than the regulated dbps wang et al 2014 additional in vivo studies are needed to determine the carcinogenic potential of halobenzoquinones and their transformation products and conclude on the risk that they present for humans 5 2 3 aromatics aromatics are another class of compounds that could contribute to explain the observed risk of bladder cancer fig 4 many anthropogenic compounds have been found to produce aromatics upon chlorination table s6 and aromatic nom such as humic and fulvic substances have the potential to form aromatic dbps in addition some aromatic compounds including azo aromatic and nitro aromatic compounds are susceptible to be easily reduced by quenching agents fig 2 and therefore could be overlooked the aromatic moiety is believed to add to the carcinogenic potential casalegno and sello 2016 and the present review has showed that 62 of the bladder carcinogens possess aromatic rings fig 3 however activated aromatic compounds which include many potent thm precursors bond and graham 2017 react strongly with chlorine to generate a range of intermediate halogenated aromatic compounds before eventually aliphatic products are generated through ring cleavage boyce and hornig 1983 deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore it remains to be clarified to what extent aromatic products are generated from chlorination of humic and fulvic substances in drinking water non activated aromatics react more slowly with chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 so this group may potentially contain precursors of aromatic dbps 5 3 potential of nitrogenous and non nitrogenous dbps for explaining the observed bladder cancer risk nitrogenous dbps are expected to form in lower concentrations than non nitrogenous dbps in chlorinated waters indeed the organic nitrogen content in water is only between 0 5 and 10 by weight of the nom westerhoff and mash 2002 however water sources impacted by wastewater and algal activity have higher nitrogenous content dotson et al 2009 for example the concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen in source waters of treatment plants in the usa was 56 higher when these were affected by algae or wastewater 186 μg n l compared to 290 μg n l in impacted waters dotson et al 2009 waters with such characteristics are predicted to become more widespread in the future due to population growth and climate change as a result of their formation at low concentration in chlorinated waters nitrogenous dbps such as nitrosamines amines haloamides or halonitriles would have to be very potent carcinogens if they were responsible for the association with bladder cancer as most of the nom is comprised of non nitrogenous humic substances this limits the potential to form high concentrations of nitrogenous dbps in drinking water consequently although most bladder carcinogens are nitrogenous non nitrogenous dbps such as halocyclopentenoic acids halofuranones or haloquinones could also potentially explain the association between chlorinated drinking water and bladder cancer 6 conclusions polar large 500 g mol hydrophilic insufficiently volatile thermally unstable and ionic dbps can potentially be overlooked by gc ms analysis halogenated compounds nitroaromatic compounds azoaromatic compounds sulfoxides nitrosamines and quinones are susceptible to reduction by quenching agents by comparing the structures of known and potentially undiscovered dbps with that of known bladder carcinogens the nitrogenous compounds nitrosamines amines halonitriles and haloamides were found to be potential candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer whereas most bladder carcinogens are nitrogenous the majority of the nom is not and therefore non nitrogenous dbps such as halocyclopentenoic acids halofuranones and haloquinones could also explain the risk of bladder cancer observed in epidemiological studies

18627,epidemiological studies have consistently associated the consumption of chlorinated drinking water with an enhanced risk of bladder cancer while this suggests that some disinfection byproducts dbps are bladder carcinogens causal agents are unknown this study aims to highlight likely candidates to achieve this structures of known and hypothesised dbps were compared with 76 known bladder carcinogens the latter are dominated by nitrogenous and aromatic compounds only 10 are halogenated under 10 of the chlorine applied during drinking water treatment is converted into identified halogenated byproducts most of the chlorine is likely to be consumed during the generation of unidentified non halogenated oxidation products six nitrosamines are among the nine most potent bladder carcinogens and two of them are known to be dbps n nitrosodiphenylamine and nitrosodibutylamine however these and other nitrosamines are formed in insufficiently low concentrations in chlorinated drinking water to account for the observed bladder cancer risk furthermore although not proven bladder carcinogens certain amines haloamides halocyclopentenoic acids furans and haloquinones are potential candidates at present most identified bladder carcinogens are nitrogenous whereas 90 of natural organic matter is not therefore non nitrogenous dbps are likely to contribute to the bladder cancer risk given the high proportion of dbps that remains uncharacterised it is important that future research prioritises compounds believed to be potent toxicants graphical abstract image 1

trihalomethane tox total organic halides uplc ultra performance liquid chromatography us epa united states environmental protection agency 1 introduction chlorine disinfection is commonly used in drinking water treatment for deactivating pathogens and preventing waterborne diseases including typhoid and cholera boorman et al 1999 chaidou et al 1999 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 however chlorine can also react with most organic and inorganic compounds in water and form undesirable disinfection byproducts dbps gottschalk et al 2010 li and mitch 2018 plewa and wagner 2015 rook 1974 the nature and concentration of dbps formed in drinking water depend on the conditions of disinfection and on the composition of the source water bruzzoniti and sarzanini 2011 gottschalk et al 2010 hrudey 2008 lipmann 2009 natural organic matter nom which consists of terrestrial principally humic substances and microbially derived material e g from algae sewage or bacteria is the main source of dbp precursors bond et al 2012 hileman 1982 weinberg 1999 nom is a complex mixture of organic compounds with a wide range of molecular weights and chemical functionalities bull et al 2011 and its composition varies by location season and climate boorman et al 1999 lipmann 2009 weinberg 1999 therefore there is a wide variety of dbps that can form from nom as illustrated by over 700 dbps having been identified in drinking water wastewater and synthetic samples thun et al 2017 since the discovery of dbps in the 1970s rook 1974 concerns have risen about their toxicity as a result regulating bodies have enforced limits for the amount of dbps present in drinking water the united states environmental protection agency us epa has regulated the concentration of the sum of four trihalomethanes thms chloroform bromoform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane the sum of five haloacetic acids haas monochloro dichloro trichloro monobromo dibromoacetic acid bromate and chlorite fig s1 in supplementary material while in europe the sum of the same four thms and bromate are regulated table s1 council of the european union 1998 us epa 2002 the maximum permitted concentrations of regulated dbps effectively represent both known and unknown dbps indeed while nitrogenous and iodinated dbps are unregulated they have been reported to be more toxic than their non nitrogenous and brominated chlorinated analogues respectively wagner and plewa 2017 in the past 40 years several epidemiological studies have found an association between the long term consumption of chlorinated water and an increased risk of urinary bladder cancer villanueva et al 2003 this association has been observed repeatedly and in different regions of the world including america king and marrett 1996 mcgeehin et al 1993 wilkins and comstock 1981 and europe koivusalo et al 1998 the us epa has estimated that the proportion of bladder cancer cases attributable to the consumption of chlorinated drinking water is between 2 and 17 us epa 2003 since chlorine itself has not been found to be carcinogenic the observed risk of bladder cancer has been linked to dbps formed during chlorination bull et al 2006 lipmann 2009 toxicological studies have identified only two bladder carcinogens amongst known dbps nitrosodibutylamine ndba and n nitrosodiphenylamine ndpha however these were present at very low concentrations in drinking water low ng l range for ndpha and 20 ng l for ndba li et al 2011 wang et al 2011 thus the results obtained in epidemiological and toxicological studies diverge there remains a need to identify plausible bladder carcinogens that are formed during chlorination of drinking water in sufficient concentrations to account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies richardson et al 2007 reported that this mismatch has not yet been explained and bull et al 2006 noted only limited efforts to fill this gap in dbp research a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the dbps responsible have not been toxicologically characterised yet indeed of the 700 individual dbps identified in water only about 80 have been subject to systematic toxicological studies bull et al 2006 lipmann 2009 melnick and hooth 2011 plewa and wagner 2015 richardson et al 2007 another possible explanation is that toxicological studies assess the health effect caused by individual chemicals or simple mixtures whereas in reality people are exposed to the entire mixture of dbps present in water little is known of the toxicological effects of the dbps interactions within such a complex mixture kogenivas and villanueva 2011 additive or synergistic toxicological effects could contribute to explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed in agreement with this tatematsu et al 1977 showed that a mixture of 3 carcinogens n butyl n 4 hydroxybutyl nitrosamine n 4 5 nitro 2 furyl 2 thiazolyl formamide and n 2 fluorenylacetamide caused bladder cancer in 26 of the rats studied whereas when administered individually they did not also interactions between dbps within a mixture could potentially impact the toxicity the mode of action and the target organs of individual dbps more research is needed on the toxicological effects of mixtures of dbps kogenivas and villanueva 2011 finally it is likely that the critical dbps are yet to be identified in drinking water lending credence to this hypothesis only 60 of halogenated dbps have been characterised pressman et al 2010 while the equivalent figure for non halogenated dbps is much lower this review aims to assess which known or hypothesised dbps dbps whose presence has been proposed but not confirmed in drinking water may be implicated in the bladder cancer association to achieve this the toxicological significance of known dbps is discussed and the structures of known and hypothesised dbps compared with those of known bladder carcinogens a secondary aim was to highlight dbps that may have been missed or overlooked by commonly used sample preparation or analysis methods recognising potentially critical dbps will contribute to dbp research by suggesting compounds that should be prioritised in future occurrence and toxicology studies 2 toxicological significance of known dbps 2 1 carcinogenic dbps different forms of toxicity can be assessed including cytotoxicity genotoxicity mutagenicity or carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity measurements in chinese hamster ovary cho cells have received considerable attention for determining the experimental toxicity of a range of dbps jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2008 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 however the present work mainly uses carcinogenicity data as these were available for a wider range of molecules and quantify their ability to cause cancer specifically td50 median toxic dose values of dbps which describe their potency to induce cancer were analysed this parameter corresponds to the dose of chemical that would produce cancer in 50 of the population studied in a lifetime bull et al 2006 lipmann 2009 td50 values are derived from toxicological tests with experimental animals they are indicative as there is uncertainty on how to translate the carcinogenicity observed in animals to humans the sensitivity to a carcinogen and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis vary among species which makes it complex to extrapolate the cancer risk from experimental animal studies to humans bull et al 2006 kogenivas and villanueva 2011 the carcinogenicity of 409 dbps was examined more than 700 dbps have been reported in the literature thun et al 2017 but we selected only those that are known to occur in drinking water as opposed to wastewater or synthetic water samples details in and below table s2 the dbps present in the carcinogenic potency database developed by gold 2011 were considered to be carcinogens they are gathered in table 1 with their td50 values in units of mg kg day and the corresponding target organs the typical concentrations at which they occur in drinking water were taken from lipmann 2009 when available and from other sources richardson 2011 li et al 2011 wang et al 2011 krasner et al 2006 otherwise the values of td50 concentration were calculated for each dbp using their lowest td50 value when several were available for different species worst case scenario this ratio was calculated in order to assess the risk of each dbp for causing cancer by taking into account both their carcinogenic potency and the concentrations at which they have been observed in water the td50 concentration can be interpreted as the daily consumption of drinking water that would cause a 50 increase in cancer risk the average daily recommended water consumption is 1 7 l day 2 5 and 2 l day recommended water intake for men and women respectively of which 70 80 comes from drinking european food safety authority 2010 therefore the average daily water consumption per mass of body weight ranges between 17 and 34 ml kg day for adults weighing between 50 and 100 kg any dbp present in water having a td50 concentration close to or lower than this range therefore represents a high risk of developing cancer of the 409 dbps analysed 22 have been reported as carcinogenic in animals table 1 the most potent carcinogenic dbps based on their td50 values are nitrosamines and mutagen x mx 3 chloro 4 dichloromethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone table 1 most nitrosamines including n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosomorpholine ndmor n nitrosopyrrolidine ndpyr and ndba have td50 values 1 mg kg day table 1 ndma and ndea are recognised by the international agency for research on cancer iarc as probable human carcinogens iarc 1987 whereas ndmor n nitrosopiperidine ndpip and ndpyr are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens according to the national toxicology program ntp national toxicology program ntp 1981 equally mx is a very potent carcinogen with a td50 of 0 583 mg kg day table 1 note that the regulated thms and haas are at least 3 orders of magnitude less potent than ndea which is the most potent carcinogen amongst selected dbps table 1 however when taking into account the concentration of these compounds in drinking water none appear to be a potential candidate for explaining the risk of cancer observed nitrosamines are the dbps that have the greatest risk of inducing cancer as indicated by their low td50 concentration value indeed ndma ndea ndmor and ndpyr have td50 concentration 20 l kg day yet these values are 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than the daily recommended water consumption 17 34 ml kg day and therefore these nitrosamines cannot explain the risk of cancer observed in agreement with this hrudey and charrois 2012 reported that the concentration and occurrence of nitrosamines are too low to account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies similarly mx which is one of the most potent carcinogens among known dbps table 1 has a td50 concentration as high as 686 l kg day reflecting the low concentrations at which it occurs in drinking water 0 85 μg l assuming a similar potency for humans as observed in experimental animals this means that mx itself cannot account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies however structurally similar dbps such as 4 bromochloromethyl 3 chloro 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone bmx 1 3 chloro 4 dibromomethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone bmx 2 3 bromo 4 dibromomethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone bmx 3 3 chloro 4 dichloromethyl 2 5h furanone red mx or z 2 3 dichloro 4 oxobutenoic acid mca fig s2 have also been found in drinking water richardson et al 2007 to date there are insufficient toxicological data available for these compounds collectively they could be of concern providing they have a similar carcinogenic potency as mx bull et al 2006 hrudey 2009 the case of mx shows how important it is to consider the concentration of dbps in water in combination with their potency in order to investigate the observed risk of cancer hrudey 2009 reported that the doses at which chlorination dbps produce toxic effects in animals are between 100 and 10 000 times higher than the doses resulting from an average daily consumption of chlorinated water thus he concluded that individually none of the chlorination dbps identified at that time could explain the risk of bladder cancer observed however it is uncertain whether as a group and considering interactions and synergistic effects they could account for this risk another striking point that can be drawn from the analysis of toxicological studies relates to the organs affected by tumours epidemiological studies have found the consumption of chlorinated water was primarily associated with urinary bladder cancer whereas most identified dbps produce tumours in the liver kidney or other organs table 1 since the kidney and urinary bladder are both part of the urinary tract it is possible that dbps producing tumours in the kidney could also affect the urinary bladder however apart from ndba and ndpha whose concentrations in combination with their carcinogenic potency are too low to account for the risk observed in epidemiological studies table 1 no other dbp is currently known to cause bladder cancer principally due to their complexity and economic cost the number of in vivo carcinogenic studies on dbps is limited however emerging approaches including in vitro cell transformation assays appear to be simpler alternatives to identify the carcinogenic potential of new dbps marsà et al 2018 2017 wang et al 2017 deangelo et al 2007 one advantage of this approach is that in vitro assays can be performed on human cells and especially on target organ cells e g t24 bladder cells marsà et al 2018 this eliminates the uncertainty of in vivo studies on how to translate the carcinogenic risk from animals to humans this approach is relevant for investigating which dbps could contribute to the risk of bladder cancer 2 2 metabolism of dbps into mutagens tests for carcinogenicity mutagenicity or genotoxicity are often performed on animals or animals cells inbred strains are normally used in such experiments which limits genetic variability conversely differences in human genotypes can impact the incidence of bladder cancer cantor et al 2010 the enzyme glutathione s transferase theta 1 gstt1 has been found to activate brominated thms into mutagens in salmonella demarini et al 1997 the activated thms can then react with deoxyribonucleic acid dna to produce mutations regli et al 2015 however in subjects having a gstt1 null genotype as opposed to gstt1 present genotype this activation is inhibited cantor et al 2010 the urinary tract contains high levels of the gstt1 enzyme cantor et al 2010 therefore in subjects having the gstt1 present genotype brominated thms reaching the urinary tract may be activated into mutagens increasing the risk of bladder cancer this has been observed experimentally in humans by cantor et al 2010 they found that subjects with the gstt1 present genotype had a 2 2 fold increased risk of bladder cancer compared to subjects with the null genotype for an average long term thms exposure 49 0 μg l this effect has been observed for brominated thms but it is possible that polymorphisms can activate other dbps into mutagens or carcinogens in a similar way a study by villanueva et al 2007 indicated that besides ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation of dbps in water by showering swimming or bathing were also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer indeed swimmers had a 60 increased risk for bladder cancer relative to non swimmers villanueva et al 2007 contrastingly the enzyme glutathione s transferase zeta 1 gstz1 has been found to detoxify dichloro and α haloacids kogenivas and villanueva 2011 some of which are carcinogenic in animals table 1 board and anders 2005 found that the enzyme gstz1 transformed the carcinogenic haas dichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid into glyoxylic acid the latter is not reported as a carcinogen by the iarc or the carcinogenic potency database gold 2011 the gene that codes for this enzyme is polymorphic the ct tt forms of the gene as opposed to the cc form inhibit the activity of the enzyme gstz1 as a consequence cantor et al 2010 have observed that subjects having the gstz1 ct tt genotype that were exposed to concentrations of thms 49 0 μg l had a 2 9 fold increase in the risk of bladder cancer compared to subjects exposed to concentrations of thms 8 0 μg l whereas subjects presenting the cc genotype only had a 1 3 increased risk for the same exposure kogenivas and villanueva 2011 indicated a similar detoxifying action for the n acetyl transferase 2 nat2 enzyme they reported that subjects having the high risk form of the nat2 gene have a limited capacity to detoxify aromatic amines which represent a substantial proportion of bladder carcinogens details in section 4 1 as a result they reported a 40 increase in the risk of bladder cancer for people having the high risk genotype for nat2 similarly cantor et al 2010 observed a significant 1 3 fold increase in the risk of bladder cancer for people having the nat2 slow genotype relative to subjects having the nat2 fast genotype these results suggest that brominated thms α haloacids and aromatic amines may account for the increase in the risk of bladder cancer observed regli et al 2015 3 dbps potentially missed or overlooked in water 3 1 missing fraction of dbps over 700 individual dbps have been identified in various sample types thun et al 2017 pressman et al 2010 reported that 75 halogenated dbps only accounted for 59 by mass of the total organic halides tox formed in chlorinated samples leaving 41 of unknown halogenated compounds krasner et al 2006 observed an even higher proportion of unknown dbps in 12 drinking water treatment plants located in the usa they found that 92 selected halogenated dbps accounted for only 30 by mass of the tox on average fig s3 in addition many non halogenated dbps are formed during the chlorination of drinking water and have been poorly characterised in comparison to the halogenated dbps richardson et al 2007 it is considered impractical to quantify the non halogenated dbps hrudey 2008 hileman 1982 reported that 50 80 of the chlorine used to disinfect water takes part in oxidation reactions while only 1 6 16 of the chlorine leads to the formation of halogenated compounds with the balance comprising other types of reactions while the ultimate product of nom oxidation is co2 many intermediate oxidation products are also expected larson and weber 1994 sigleo et al 1980 chlorinated a treated estuarine water and found 6 37 of applied chlorine resulted in the mineralisation of organic matter into co2 based on a chlorine mass balance using these references hileman 1982 pressman et al 2010 sigleo et al 1980 and assuming that dbps generated remain in water the amount of characterised tox represents only up to 10 of applied chlorine whereas 13 74 is used to form intermediate oxidation products the vast majority of which are unknown consequently the fraction of unidentified dbps in chlorinated drinking water is far higher than indicated by research into halogenated dbps these numbers are sobering given the amount of resources devoted since the 1970s to the identification of dbps and illustrate the need to be strategic when it comes to searching for currently unknown compounds several studies aiming to characterise the missing fraction of dbps suggested it is mostly made of high molecular weight 500 g mol non volatile and polar compounds richardson 2002 richardson et al 2000 urbansky and magnuson 2002 weinberg 1999 zhang et al 2005 zhang and minear 2002 in particular analysis using ultrafiltration membranes indicated that about 50 of the tox produced from chlorination is comprised of compounds having a molecular weight above 500 g mol richardson 2011 richardson et al 2002 an international workshop held in 1998 aimed at investigating unidentified dbps bromoamines nitrosamines chloroketamines chloroaldamines polycarboxylic acids polyamines and organic peroxides were proposed as dbps from the missing fraction fig 1 richardson 2003 by modelling the reactions between disinfectants and substructures of nom bull et al 2006 suggested haloquinones halocyclopentenoic acids and nitrosamides as proposed dbps a study performed on drinking water samples of 11 utilities using chlorine ozone chloramine chlorine dioxide or a combination of these suggested that ndma the most prevalent of the seven nitrosamines identified in water generally constituted only 5 by mass of the total nitrosamines on a median basis dai and mitch 2013 this suggests that there are more nitrosamines to be discovered in chlorinated water as little is known about the toxicity of the dbps from the missing fraction it potentially contains compounds that could account for the elevated risk of bladder cancer associated with the consumption of chlorinated water 3 2 potential dbps missed during sampling and analytical procedures pre analytical treatment is a possible cause of loss of dbps from water samples kinani et al 2016a 2016b particularly dbps can be missed or overlooked due to use of unsuitable quenching agents these are commonly used in order to stop chlorination reactions after sampling and before analysis at the same time several studies have shown that selected quenching agents such as sodium arsenite or sodium sulphite can degrade dbps croue and reckhow 1989 liu and zhang 2013 yu and reckhow 2016 liu and zhang 2013 found that sodium arsenite decomposed polar brominated dbps and other halogenated organic dbps including chloropicrin trichloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile similarly yu and reckhow 2016 observed that n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide had been previously missed in water samples as it was reduced to dichloroacetamide by commonly used quenching agents ascorbic acid sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate croue and reckhow 1989 reported that sodium sulphite degraded dbps such as chloropicrin trichloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile a study assessing the degradation of 31 dbps by 5 quenching agents showed that sodium sulphite is suitable for the analysis of inorganic dbps whereas ascorbic acid is recommended for organic dbps kristiana et al 2014 nonetheless no quenching agent is thought to be suitable for all dbps larson and weber 1994 reported that sulfoxides n nitrosamines quinones halogenated nitroaromatic and azoaromatic compounds can be degraded in natural reducing environments fig 2 therefore those compounds are also predicted to be susceptible to reduction by quenching agents those dbps that are deteriorated by unsuitable quenching agents may represent part of the unknown fraction of dbps despite being the most common method for analysing unknown dbps gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms has some limitations richardson 2002 weinberg 1999 polar dbps are not suitable for analysis by gc ms richardson 2003 2002 wang et al 2016 weinberg 1999 they produce broad peaks which can make their resolution from other compounds difficult richardson 2002 the chromatographic separation of small and hydrophilic compounds is also challenging weinberg 1999 further very hydrophilic dbps are difficult to extract from water weinberg 1999 2009 another limitation of the gc ms relates to the analysis of dbps of limited volatility richardson 2003 wang et al 2016 weinberg 1999 weinberg 2009 reported that compounds with a boiling point higher than 200 c are not suitable for gc analysis similarly compounds that have a molecular weight 500 g mol are difficult to analyse by gc as they tend to be less volatile richardson 2002 zhang et al 2005 thermally unstable dbps such as halonitromethanes hnms or ndpha are degraded during gc analysis boyd et al 2011 richardson et al 2008 richardson and ternes 2014 wang et al 2016 and finally ionic dbps can be missed using gc ms unless the ph of samples is lowered to render them neutral richardson 2002 wang et al 2016 in order to analyse polar non volatile thermally unstable or ionic dbps methods such as liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry lc ms or alternative sample preparation techniques should be considered derivatisation techniques can overcome the limitations of sample extraction and analysis using gc ms they can either increase the volatility or the ionisation efficiency of dbps improve their thermal stability or decrease their polarity kinani et al 2016b weinberg 1999 this can be illustrated by the us epa method 552 2 for the analysis of haas munch et al 1995 their reaction with acidic methanol results in an increase in their volatility and reduced polarity prior to their analysis by gc coupled with electron capture detector gc ecd weinberg 2009 o 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine pfbha can be used to derivatise small and polar aldehydes and ketones with less than ten carbon atoms which are difficult to extract from water the resulting oximes are non polar hence can be easily extracted from water for further analysis by gc ms richardson 2011 2002 weinberg 1999 in summary the analytical difficulties associated with positively identifying dbps could contribute to the mismatch between the toxicologically characterised dbps and the elevated risk of bladder cancer associated with the consumption of water disinfected with chlorine 4 prediction and prioritisation of toxicologically important dbps 4 1 structural considerations for predicting carcinogenicity the structures of known bladder carcinogens were analysed to identify structural similarities among them a total of 76 compounds are named as bladder carcinogens in the carcinogenic potency database gold 2011 and in bull et al 2006 table s3 the functional groups present in each compound were identified and reported to assess their incidence across all known bladder carcinogens fig 3 as the carcinogenicity of a compound is related to its structure zhang et al 2016 identifying the functional groups present among bladder carcinogens can give indications about the structural moieties responsible among the 76 bladder carcinogens 84 have a molecular weight between 100 and 300 g mol the proportion of nitrogenous compounds 83 is striking fig 3 table s3 many are amines but there are also nine nitro compounds eleven amides and nine nitrosamines the latter being a recognised class of chemicals among dbps in addition 75 of bladder carcinogens possess five or six membered rings with 82 of them being aromatic cycles fig 3 table s3 several quinones and furans have also been identified as bladder carcinogens as a result of the presence of many aromatics and many nitrogenous compounds among bladder carcinogens half of them posess both functionalities fig 3 aromatic and heterocyclic amines nitrosamines and quinones are the groups of bladder carcinogens the most likely to be dbps formed from nom bull et al 2006 bull et al 2006 reported that compounds with a td50 10 mg kg day are unlikely to explain the risk of bladder cancer observed in epidemiological studies unless their concentration is higher than 100 μg l twenty four bladder carcinogens have a td50 10 mg kg day table s4 eight of them are aromatic amines and six are amides furthermore among the nine nitrosamines that are known bladder carcinogens eight of them have a td50 10 mg kg day and 6 have a td50 1 mg kg day table s4 not only are they the predominant group among the most potent bladder carcinogens but they also have been identified as dbps as several compounds of their class are very potent bladder carcinogens currently unknown nitrosamines are plausible bladder carcinogens it is noticeable that only ten known bladder carcinogens are halogenated and none of them are structurally similar to known dbps fig 3 table s3 based on this observation it is possible that the non halogenated fraction of unidentified byproducts may account for the missing toxicologically significant compounds contrastingly it has been reported that nitrogenous and iodinated dbps had an increased toxicity compared to their non nitrogenous and brominated chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 in particular iodinated thms and haas were respectively more cytotoxic in cho cells and more genotoxic than their brominated analogues richardson et al 2007 similarly the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of brominated haas were higher than those of their chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 overall based on genotoxicity and cytotoxicity data of 18 analogues dbps iodinated dbps were found to be more toxic than brominated ones which were in turn more toxic than their chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 brominated compounds were also found to have a higher carcinogenicity than their chlorinated analogues hileman 1982 richardson 2003 richardson et al 2007 richardson and ternes 2014 carcinogenesis is a complex process carcinogens interact directly or indirectly via metabolic transformation with dna or proteins and alter their functioning wu et al 2015 the carcinogenic potential of chemicals is related to their molecular structure zhang et al 2016 however owing to the many mechanisms that can cause cancer and the range of factors that can influence carcinogenesis no existing model can predict the target organs of carcinogens bull et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 and morales helguera et al 2005 identified several physichochemical properties as being important for predicting the carcinogenicity of chemical compounds an increase in hydrophobicity enhanced carcinogenicity this is because hydrophobic compounds can more readily penetrate biological membranes and reach organs and tissues in the body morales helguera et al 2005 also electronic related properties such as the bond dipole moment influence carcinogenicity morales helguera et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 an increase in polarity decreased the carcinogenic potency as polarity and hydrophobicity are negatively correlated morales helguera et al 2005 finally carcinogenicity decreased when the number of hydrogen donors and the molecular weight increased zhang et al 2016 some nitrogenous structural fragments were found to contribute positively to carcinogenicity casalegno and sello 2016 morales helguera et al 2005 morales helguera et al 2005 used descriptors of hydrophobic electronic and steric features of carcinogenic compounds and highlighted nitro and nitrosamine fragments in particular similarly casalegno and sello 2016 suggested that nitrofuran nitrosamine aromatic and aromatic amine moieties contribute to carcinogenic activity however their presence does not imply carcinogenicity many counterexamples were found and no plausible reason based on their structure could discriminate two compounds having the same moieties but different carcinogenic potencies casalegno and sello 2016 4 2 prioritisation of dbp research based on toxicological potency as the total number of dbps present in water is daunting and for many compounds little is known of their toxicity prioritising research on dbps by focussing on toxicologically significant structures is a sensible approach woo et al 2002 and bull et al 2006 used predictive structure activity relationship sar and quantitative structure toxicity relationship qstr methods to rank dbps based on their potential carcinogenicity these models compare compounds that have not been experimentally tested for their toxicity with compounds having similar structures and that have been toxicologically characterised woo et al 2002 however they cannot give any information on the target organ of a compound predicted to be carcinogenic bull et al 2006 out of the 209 dbps considered woo et al 2002 selected 20 compounds with a moderate or high moderate carcinogenic potential fig s4 these included halofuranones haloalkanes alkenes halonitriles and haloketones the halofuranones bmx 1 bmx 2 and bmx 3 fig s4 were the dbps predicted to be of the highest priority woo et al 2002 furthermore bull et al 2006 identified n haloamines as toxicologically important using a similar approach however based on the occurrence and the predicted loaels of the dbps identified to date bull et al 2006 reported that no established dbp would have enough potency to account for the risk of cancer observed in epidemiological studies thus the possibility that the critical dbps have not been identified yet in drinking water appears as one of the most plausible explanation to the mismatch observed by modelling the reactions of sub structures of nom with chlorine and chloramine and using qstr to predict their toxicity bull et al 2006 identified 16 probable dbps of significant toxicological importance fig s5 and table s5 their prioritisation criteria were that the dbps either have an actual or predicted loael 1 mg kg day or are predicted to be carcinogenic with a td50 or loael 10 mg kg or that they belong to a class containing toxicologically potent compounds bull et al 2011 2006 they also identified four classes of novel dbps of high priority haloquinones halocyclopentenoic acids nitrosamines and nitrosamides halonitriles and haloamides bull et al 2006 some of these have been subsequently found to occur in drinking water the nitrosamine ndpha was identified in chlorinated and chloraminated waters in concentrations ranging between 0 19 and 1 8 ng l li et al 2011 and the haloquinones 2 6 dichloro 3 methyl 1 4 benzoquinone dcmbq 2 3 6 trichloro 1 4 benzoquinone tcbq 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone dcbq and 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone dbbq at concentrations between 0 5 and 274 5 ng l li et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 5 potential candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed the compounds that have the potential to explain the bladder cancer risk attributed to dbps were investigated as bull et al 2006 reported that the dbps identified in water to date cannot explain the risk of bladder cancer observed based on their predicted lowest observed adverse effect level loael emerging and undiscovered dbps are emphasised the structures and functional groups present in toxicologically important compounds and bladder carcinogens identified in section 2 and 4 were compared with those of proposed dbps identified in section 3 the toxicologically important compounds structures considered included known dbps that are potent carcinogens table 1 known dbps prioritised by woo et al 2002 fig s4 structures that contribute to carcinogenicity section 4 1 and structures that are present in bladder carcinogens fig 3 compounds considered as proposed dbps included those named in the international workshop of 1998 richardson 2003 as members of the missing fraction of dbps fig 1 compounds susceptible to reduction by quenching agents fig 2 and dbps predicted to form by modelling reactions of chlorine with nom fig s5 table s5 and section 4 2 the incidence of the groups of compounds present in the 2 categories is represented in fig 4 the classes of compounds that were both identified as proposed dbps and toxicologically important compounds were considered as potential candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed 5 1 nitrogenous dbps 5 1 1 nitrosamines as nitrosamines are plausible bladder carcinogens and some compounds of this class were proposed as dbps from the missing fraction fig 1 section 4 2 novel nitrosamines appear as serious candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer observed in epidemiological studies the concentrations of the nitrosamines identified to date in chlorinated water are too low to account for the risk observed table 1 although this class of compounds is mainly formed from chloramination nitrosamines can also be found in water disinfected with chlorine in 12 chlorinated systems in north america the average concentration of ndma which is the most prevalent of the nitrosamines identified to date in water was 7 3 ng l in comparison to 27 1 ng l in 10 chloraminated systems boyd et al 2011 at this concentration novel nitrosamines would need to be 5 to 6 orders of magnitude more potent than ndma table 1 to produce a significant risk of causing bladder cancer i e to have a td50 concentration value equal to the daily recommended water consumption of 17 34 ml kg day in addition the most reactive ndma precursors are anthropogenic bond et al 2017 and therefore the formation of ndma is greater in drinking water sources impacted by treated wastewater krasner et al 2013 5 1 2 amines and aromatic amines certain amines including bromoamines and polyamines were proposed as unidentified dbps fig 1 richardson 2003 moreover bull et al 2006 and woo et al 2002 prioritised haloamines for their toxicity although these compounds are known to occur in water only limited occurrence and toxicological data exists bull et al 2011 as no compound structurally similar to n chloramines had any carcinogenicity data the qstr analysis undertaken by bull et al 2006 could not assess their carcinogenic potential however haloamines were considered of high priority because n chloramines have been predicted to induce adverse effects and some of their plausible metabolic products have structures similar to that of known bladder carcinogens bull et al 2006 aromatic amines represented half of the identified bladder carcinogens fig 3 interestingly chevrier et al 2004 observed a reduction in the risk of bladder cancer when the water was disinfected with ozone instead of chlorine this suggests that the precursors of bladder carcinogens were degraded by ozonation as ozone reacts principally with amines sulphur containing compounds polycyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds activated with hydroxyl or amino groups gottschalk et al 2010 larson and weber 1994 von gunten 2003 these groups including aromatic amines may be linked to potential precursors of bladder carcinogens many aromatic amines have been observed amongst anthropogenic compounds table s6 and these could generate aromatic amine dbps however due to the low concentration of their precursors in water ng l to low μg l dbps formed from anthropogenic compounds would need to be extremely potent carcinogens if they are responsible for the association with bladder cancer table 1 to illustrate this point a chemical occurring at a concentration of 0 5 or 5 μg l in drinking water would need to have respective td50 values of 0 017 and 0 17 μg kg day in order to have td50 concentration values of 34 ml kg day the daily recommended water consumption these median toxic doses are 150 1500 times lower than that of the most potent carcinogenic dbp ndea table 1 5 1 3 haloamides and halonitriles haloamides and halonitriles were predicted to form as novel dbps chlorination experiments of naturally occurring amino acids suggested that higher molecular weight halonitriles and haloamides could form in water bull et al 2006 several were predicted to be carcinogens 3 bromopropionitrile 3 3 dichloropropionitrile 2 3 dibromopropionitrile 3 3 3 trichloropropionitrile dichloroacetamide bromochloroacetamide 2 bromo 3 chloropropamide 2 3 dibromopropamide 2 3 dichloropropamide bull et al 2011 2006 and 11 amides are in the list of bladder carcinogens fig 3 two aromatic halonitriles 2 chlorophenylacetonitrile and 3 4 dichlorophenylacetonitrile were recently identified as new dbps in chlorinated and chloraminated waters and were found to be 1 order of magnitude more cytotoxic than their aliphatic analogues zhang et al 2018 5 2 non nitrogenous dbps 5 2 1 halocyclopentenoic acids furans and halofuranones bull et al 2006 predicted that several halocyclopentenoic acids form during disinfection table s5 the authors considered this class of compounds to be of high priority because of their structural resemblance to the halofuranone mx which has been shown to target the urinary bladder in some species bull et al 2006 mx was also the most carcinogenic dbp after the nitrosamines table 1 and halofuranones especially brominated ones were prioritised for their toxicity by woo et al 2002 due to the low predicted loael of the compounds of this class they could collectively present a significant risk bull et al 2006 especially 3 5 dichloro 1 hydroxylcyclopent 2 enoic acid has a very low predicted loael of 0 250 μg kg day bull et al 2006 table s5 assuming it occurred in water at a concentration of 1 μg l a consumption of water of 0 250 l kg day would cause adverse health effects this value is much lower than the equivalent value calculated for the most carcinogenic dbp ndea based on its td50 the consumption of water that would cause a 50 increase in the risk of cancer due to the presence of ndea is 2 7 l kg day table 1 therefore if halocyclopentenoic acids were present in the missing fraction of dbps they might contribute to explaining the gap between epidemiological and toxicological studies bull et al 2011 to our knowledge the presence of halocyclopentenoic acids has not been reported in water to date however gong et al 2005 observed the formation of a similar compound 2 2 4 trichloro 5 methoxycyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione from chlorination of the nom surrogate syringaldehyde more research is needed to determine whether this compound and some halocyclopentenoic acids do indeed occur in drinking water mx has been shown to be generated from model phenolic compounds langvik et al 1991 zou et al 2000 the precise formation mechanisms are complex with syringaldehyde identified as the most reactive precursor forming a 0 01 mol mol yield of mx under controlled laboratory chlorination conditions zou et al 2000 5 2 2 haloquinones haloquinones can form from reactions between chlorine chloramine and phenolic polyphenolic or polymethoxy organic precursors bull et al 2006 kosaka et al 2017 reported that para substituted phenolic compounds and para substituted aromatic amines are precursors of the haloquinone dcbq and phenolic compounds are common constituents of nom thurman 1985 haloquinones were predicted to form during chlorination by bull et al 2006 four of the 76 bladder carcinogens are quinones table s3 fig 3 several haloquinones were predicted to be carcinogens table s5 and the literature on toxicology of quinones suggests they could cause bladder cancer bull et al 2011 2006 li et al 2015 indeed haloquinones have some similarities with known bladder carcinogens that have polyphenolic or quinone structures and their metabolic activation resembles that of bladder carcinogens bull et al 2006 haloquinones have the potential to be of significant health concern even at low concentrations as their predicted loaels range between 5 and 80 μg kg day bull et al 2011 2006 bull et al 2006 reported that if the concentrations of tcbq and dcmbq were higher than 10 ng l and they were confirmed as bladder carcinogens these haloquinones could account for the risks observed in epidemiological studies following the predictions of bull et al 2006 haloquinones have received considerable attention li et al 2011 have developed a solid phase extraction spe lc esi ms ms method to quantify four halobenzoquinones dcmbq tcbq dcbq and dbbq these compounds were subsequently detected in chlorinated waters at concentrations between 0 5 and 274 5 ng l li et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 tcbq and dcmbq were found in chlorinated water at concentrations in the range 2 9 9 1 and 0 9 6 5 ng l respectively li et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 in vitro experiments have shown that the four halobenzoquinones identified in water were 1 000 times more cytotoxic than some regulated thms li et al 2015 in addition their transformation byproducts can damage dna which suggests that they could be genotoxic and carcinogenic li et al 2015 following the discovery of halobenzoquinones in water wang et al 2014 observed that they naturally degrade to form halo hydroxyl benzoquinones these are more stable than their parent compounds and were found to be 2 times less cytotoxic albeit still considerably more cytotoxic than the regulated dbps wang et al 2014 additional in vivo studies are needed to determine the carcinogenic potential of halobenzoquinones and their transformation products and conclude on the risk that they present for humans 5 2 3 aromatics aromatics are another class of compounds that could contribute to explain the observed risk of bladder cancer fig 4 many anthropogenic compounds have been found to produce aromatics upon chlorination table s6 and aromatic nom such as humic and fulvic substances have the potential to form aromatic dbps in addition some aromatic compounds including azo aromatic and nitro aromatic compounds are susceptible to be easily reduced by quenching agents fig 2 and therefore could be overlooked the aromatic moiety is believed to add to the carcinogenic potential casalegno and sello 2016 and the present review has showed that 62 of the bladder carcinogens possess aromatic rings fig 3 however activated aromatic compounds which include many potent thm precursors bond and graham 2017 react strongly with chlorine to generate a range of intermediate halogenated aromatic compounds before eventually aliphatic products are generated through ring cleavage boyce and hornig 1983 deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore it remains to be clarified to what extent aromatic products are generated from chlorination of humic and fulvic substances in drinking water non activated aromatics react more slowly with chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 so this group may potentially contain precursors of aromatic dbps 5 3 potential of nitrogenous and non nitrogenous dbps for explaining the observed bladder cancer risk nitrogenous dbps are expected to form in lower concentrations than non nitrogenous dbps in chlorinated waters indeed the organic nitrogen content in water is only between 0 5 and 10 by weight of the nom westerhoff and mash 2002 however water sources impacted by wastewater and algal activity have higher nitrogenous content dotson et al 2009 for example the concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen in source waters of treatment plants in the usa was 56 higher when these were affected by algae or wastewater 186 μg n l compared to 290 μg n l in impacted waters dotson et al 2009 waters with such characteristics are predicted to become more widespread in the future due to population growth and climate change as a result of their formation at low concentration in chlorinated waters nitrogenous dbps such as nitrosamines amines haloamides or halonitriles would have to be very potent carcinogens if they were responsible for the association with bladder cancer as most of the nom is comprised of non nitrogenous humic substances this limits the potential to form high concentrations of nitrogenous dbps in drinking water consequently although most bladder carcinogens are nitrogenous non nitrogenous dbps such as halocyclopentenoic acids halofuranones or haloquinones could also potentially explain the association between chlorinated drinking water and bladder cancer 6 conclusions polar large 500 g mol hydrophilic insufficiently volatile thermally unstable and ionic dbps can potentially be overlooked by gc ms analysis halogenated compounds nitroaromatic compounds azoaromatic compounds sulfoxides nitrosamines and quinones are susceptible to reduction by quenching agents by comparing the structures of known and potentially undiscovered dbps with that of known bladder carcinogens the nitrogenous compounds nitrosamines amines halonitriles and haloamides were found to be potential candidates for explaining the risk of bladder cancer whereas most bladder carcinogens are nitrogenous the majority of the nom is not and therefore non nitrogenous dbps such as halocyclopentenoic acids halofuranones and haloquinones could also explain the risk of bladder cancer observed in epidemiological studies

18628,release of carbon materials cms into water and wastewater treatment systems occurs due to their increasing utilization as adsorbents for water treatment when the cms mixed with natural organic matter nom interact with disinfectants used during water treatment e g chlorine the released cms can affect the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in this study three common cms were investigated to reveal their possible effects and the mechanisms of dbp formation during the chlorination of nom the experimental results indicate that dbps generation decreased by 10 40 in the presence of cms when suwannee river humic acid srha was chlorinated the adsorption of srha by cms was hypothesized as the major cause for the dbps inhibition cms could irreversibly adsorb dbp precursors in their mesopores through π π bonding and hydrophobic effects oh groups on the surface of cms were shown to be critical for dbps inhibition through linking with the oh or cooh groups on the surface of nom via hydrogen bonding the study also showed that water chemistry parameters such as ph and salinity can affect dbp formation by changing the adsorption of nom onto cms with diverse nom components the presence of cms resulted in decreased formation of trichloromethane from 57 1 μg l to 23 8 38 4 and 40 4 μg l when coal made activated carbon cac wheat straw made bc pyrolyzed at

total organic carbon efom effluent derived organic matter 1 introduction chlorine is a low cost and effective disinfectant however it produces disinfection byproducts dbps due to reactions with natural organic matter in recent years different halogenated dbps have been found in chlorinated wastewater yang et al 2019a including halogenated salicylic acid halogenated phenol halogenated nitrophenol halogenated hydroxybenzaldehyde liu et al 2019 to date many studies focused on the effects of dbp formation with various disinfectants and natural organic matter nom as well as dbps toxicity han et al 2017 han and zhang 2018 hao et al 2017 li et al 2017 2019 liu et al 2019 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2019b while a few studies investigated dbp formation with the presence of carbon materials the use of carbon materials cms in industrial and consumer applications will lead to their release into municipal and industrial waste streams during typical water or wastewater treatment a big portion of cms may be removed due to coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration zhang et al 2013 however cms are also used as an adsorbent after the coagulation and sedimentation adeleye et al 2016 these cms if not completely removed may react with disinfectants forming toxic organic materials zhan et al 2010 studies reported that some carbon nanomaterials such as nc60 and graphene oxide which may be intentionally or accidently released into drinking water sources adeleye et al 2019 goodwin et al 2018 keller and lazareva 2013 can act as precursors for dbp formation during water chlorination du et al 2016 2017 du et al 2016 demonstrated that the c atoms in the middle of two meta positioned c oh groups on the aromatic ring of graphene oxide are very active causing the opening of the aromatic ring structure and the formation of trihalomethanes thms in addition activated carbon ac and biochar bc are more commonly used for water and wastewater polishing or post treatment before or after disinfection this is accordance with the epa s recommendation of these materials as one of the best available technologies for water utilities jiang et al 2017 u s epa 2006 more so the adsorption of dbp precursors and dbps by these widely used cms has been considered for instance such as shimizu et al 2018 reported that ac and carbon nanotubes cnts can absorb nom to reduce the production of dbps in the same vein jiang et al 2017 demonstrated a new approach to control the production of halogenated dbps by using ac to remove intermediate aromatic halogenated dbps however it is unknown whether the adsorption of dbp precursors onto cms will affect dbp formation the effectiveness of a carbon adsorbent is subject to its physicochemical characteristics such as pore size distribution specific area mechanical strength and functional groups e g oh groups for instance high molecular weight humic substances a major fraction of nom in raw water are unable to diffuse into micropores and may even block some mesopores in ac ac or bc used for water treatment normally last for 6 12 months due to corrosion and disruption and several mg l carbon residual can be detected downstream simpson 2008 since they share similar properties with nom in terms of aromatic rings and functional groups ac and bc can potentially participate in or influence dbp formation during chlorination to test this hypothesis the mechanism of dbps formation in the presence of cms and the effects of cms properties such as functional groups surface area and pore volume on dbp formation need to be explored in this study three different cms namely coal made ac cac wheat straw made bc pyrolyzed at 300 c wsbc300 and multiwalled cnts mwcnts were selected and used to investigate the effects of cms on dbp formation during chlorination as aforementioned the cac and bc are the most commonly used materials for the water and wastewater treatment and mwcnts are widely used as adsorbents for water purification adeleye et al 2016 shimizu et al 2018 four dbps trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetonitrile dcan chloral

to 7 by using a 10 mm phosphate buffer solution before the chlorination the concentration of all the cms used in the experiments was 10 mg l to amplify the possible reactions during water and wastewater treatment du et al 2016 the cms selected for the experiment were not uniformly dispersed in the aqueous solution thus equal amounts of the materials were added to the aqueous solution and ultrasonicated at 100 w for 2 h by using a vibra cell vcx800 sonicator sonics material newtown ct then the disinfectants were added a cm free water sample served as control the cm containing raw water comprised a mixture of different cms with srha which simulates the water containing carbon adsorbents released after the coagulation and sedimentation processes all reactions were performed in the

followed by rapid extraction with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe kristiana et al 2014 the extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography 2 5 analytical methods four dbps namely tcm dcan tca and 1 1 1 tcp were measured in this study according to epa 551 1 method using gas chromatography agilent 6890n santa clara ca equipped with an electron capture detector agilent technologies santa clara ca the

no2 n concentration were examined by the nessler reagent spectrophotometry gb 7479 87 and spectrophotometry gb 7493 87 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation with carbon materials the dbps formed in presence of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt upon chlorination are shown in fig 1 the total tcm concentrations measured in the cac wsbc300 and mwcnt samples were 13 8 77 4 and 23 6 μg l respectively fig 1a and the amount of dcan were 0 5 6 5 and 2 8 μg l fig 1b the concentrations of tca fig 1c and 1 1 1 tcp fig 1d were less than 5 μg l but the production trends were similar with those of tcm the tcm formation in the presence of graphene oxide was evaluated in a previous study du et al 2016 and the results indicated that the mechanism of tcm formation with cms is similar to that of nom arnold et al 2008 li et al 2000 rook 1977 but the total produced tcm was less the o containing functional groups of cms at their edges are the major cause for dbp formation mauter and elimelech 2008 the c oh groups on a benzene ring benefit the formation of c cl bond on the surface of cms while two meta positioned c oh groups on the surface of aromatic ring benefit the formation of tcm as the c atoms in the middle of the oh groups were very active causing the opening of the aromatic ring structure and the formation of tcm arnold et al 2008 du et al 2016 rook 1977 however with additional atoms or groups such as cn co or c oh in the aromatic rings of the cms the referent aromatic ring on the cms becomes highly active and may form dbps such as dcan tca and 1 1 1 tcp directly arnold et al 2008 mauter and elimelech 2008 the functional groups of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were evaluated by xps figs s1 s2 and the quantitative results are shown in table 1 the c o ratios of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were 13 50 4 64 and 37 38 wsbc300 exhibited the highest o ratio reaching 17 4 some n was also found in wsbc300 and mwcnt with ratios of 1 8 and 0 2 respectively the ratio of o containing functional groups c oh c o c o co and co of wsbc300 was the highest especially the oh concentrations which was 11 6 the surface functional groups of the cms were further characterized by ftir fig s3 all the cms exhibited four characteristic peaks located at 1227 1383 1628 and 1735 cm 1 which correspond to phenolic hydroxyl group hydroxyl epoxy groups oh c o c aromatic cc stretching and co stretching respectively acik et al 2011 hontoria lucas et al 1995 kratschmer et al 1990 li et al 2012 in agreement with xps ftir results showed the o functional groups on the wsbc300 were the highest especially the phenolic hydroxyl group the highest concentration of all dbps was found in the wsbc300 sample which also has the highest ratio of oh group the contents of n on the surface of wsbc300 and mwcnt contributed the dcan formation considering that dcan is a nitrogen containing dbp as tcm tca and 1 1 1 tcp are all carbon containing dbps their production trends were similar the proposed reaction pathways of the cms and the formation of dbps are shown in fig 2 3 2 dbp formation with srha and additional carbon materials the concentrations of the four studied dbps formed with chlorinated srha are shown in fig 3 and the effects of the different cms on dbp formation during srha chlorination are also depicted compared with the dbps formed with only cms fig 1 the dbps formed from srha chlorination were much higher in concentration reaching 379 2 16 5 12 5 and 12 3 μg l for tcm dcan tca and 1 1 1 tcp respectively as shown in fig 3a when the three cms cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were added the tcm concentrations decreased but with to different degrees the most significant decrease in tcm occurred in the sample with cac which decreased to 249 8 μg l whereas tcm only decreased to 366 5 and 348 2 μg l in the samples with wsbc300 and mwcnt respectively a similar trend was found in the other studied dbps fig 3b d the results indicate that the effect of different cms on dbp formation with srha chlorination is similar when srha was mixed with wsbc300 with chlorination thereafter the dcan concentration increased compared to the dcan formed from the chlorination of srha alone however this phenomenon only occurred for dcan but not other dbps a possible explanation is that wsbc300 can also form dcan with a relatively high concentration 6 5 μg l during chlorination and it may contribute to the formation of dcan during chlorination from the results obtained in fig 3 we speculated that the cms may have two major effects on dbp formation first cms could form dbps directly upon chlorination as shown in fig 1 and contribute to the total amount of dbps however except tcm the concentration of dbp formed by the chlorination of cms was very low and marginally subsidize the total amount of dbps second as an excellent adsorbent the cms can adsorb the dbp precursors srha and inhibit the formation of dbps nom may be adsorbed by cms via π π bonding hydrophobic effect hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions among all the mechanisms π π interaction is the most prominent in aromatic structures which can mediate the interactions between cms and nom lin and xing 2008 liu et al 2011 zhu and pignatello 2005 hydrophobic effect is also important for the hydrophobic regions between cms and nom liu et al 2011 yang et al 2006 similarly hydrogen bonding is effective on materials with o containing functional groups such as oh and cooh and may be crucial for wsbc300 and srha nevskaia and guerrero ruiz 2001 wang et al 2010 the phpzc of all cms 5 44 3 87 and 5 89 for cac wsbc300 and mwcnt respectively were lower than the reaction ph 7 0 consequently all the cms as well as srha were negatively charged which would prevent strong adsorption machado et al 2011 mendez diaz et al 2012 apart from the adsorption of srha cms could also adsorb dbps directly and reduce the concentration of dbps for instance jiang et al 2018 reported that activated carbon significantly reduced the levels of halogenated aromatic dbps trihalomethanes halo acetic acids and total organic halogen during chlorination jiang et al 2018 jiang and zhang 2018 higher surface area of cms corresponds to large numbers of π π bonds hydrophobic range and o functional groups which can form hydrogen bonding between cms and srha thus benefiting the adsorption of srha by cms as shown in the s4 cac exhibited the most developed pore structure among the three materials which indicates its relatively better adsorption capacity danmaliki and saleh 2017 mwcnt had the most abundant nano sized particles which also exert effects on the adsorption the surface structure of wsbc300 was relatively smooth for the 300 c pyrolyzed material the surface areas of all the cms were further evaluated by multipoint n2 adsorption desorption table 1 the surface areas of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were 510 6 6 2 and 146 6 m2 g respectively the distinctly different surface areas of the cms can remarkable affect adsorption from the data obtained cac has the highest surface area so it can adsorb more srha however some studies showed that the adsorbed nom can also be chlorinated to form dbps while desorbing later on hu et al 2016 shimizu et al 2018 whether the adsorption ability of cms corresponds to the inhibition of dbp formation needs to be further evaluated 3 3 effects of pore size of carbon materials on the dbp formation with higher pyrolysis temperature wsbc300 can be upgraded to wsbc500 and wsbc700 table 2 and fig s5 show the chemical characteristics including element composition and functional groups of wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 the surface area and pore volumes of wsbcs changed significantly after different pyrolysis temperature the surface area of wsbc300 increased from 6 2 m2 g when pyrolyzed at 300 c to 108 0 m2 g and 468 2 m2 g for wsbc500 and wsbc700 respectively the volume of wsbc300 s micropores pores 2 nm in diameter also increased significantly but the volume of mesopores pores 2 300 nm in diameter did not change much fig 4 a shows the tcm formed with wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 at 77 4 25 3 and 8 0 μg l respectively the tcm concentrations decreased significantly as the pyrolysis temperature of wsbc increased which may due to the decrease of oh group fig 4b shows the effects of wsbcs on tcm formation with different srha concentrations tcm concentrations increased significantly with increasing srha concentration however the tcm formation with wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 decreased slightly noticeably the surface area and functional groups of wsbc700 table 2 were comparable to those of cac table 1 but their effects on the dbp formation were quite different compared to the wsbc700 the effects of cac on dbp inhibition was much more significant the results indicate that in addition to surface area and functional groups other properties of cms may also be important for dbp formation when adsorbed nom is weakly and reversibly attached to the surface of cms therefore adsorbed nom can also be oxidized by chlorine disinfectants and form detectable dbps hu et al 2016 shimizu et al 2018 some research has also indicated that nom adsorbed in the pore structures of cms is strongly attached and difficult to be oxidized dastgheib et al 2004 matilainen et al 2006 quinlivan et al 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2005 however not all pores are suitable for nom adsorption the average size of nom is between 1 and 5 nm whereas the micropores on the surface of cms are smaller than 2 nm dastgheib et al 2004 the effective pore structures for the strong adsorption of nom are mesopores which are between 2 and 300 nm as shown in tables 1 and 2 the mesopores volume of cac and wsbc700 were 0 19 and 0 06 cm3 g respectively the different quantity of mesopores results in the different amount of dbp formation 3 4 effects of functional groups of carbon materials on the dbp formation as discussed previously the functional groups of cms may also affect the formation of dbp by changing the hydrogen bonding between cms and srha therefore the mwcnt was treated by hydroxylation and carboxylation to change the quantity and types of functional groups to evaluate the independent influences of the functional groups of cms on dbp formation table 3 and fig s6 show the chemical and physical characteristics of mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt no micropores and mesopores were detected on the surface of mwcnts as shown in table 3 the c o ratios of oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt decreased significantly after the hydroxylation and carboxylation treatments respectively the oh group was the highest on the oh mwcnt s surface and the cooh group was the highest on the cooh mwcnt s surface fig 5 a shows the tcm concentrations of 23 6 35 5 and 28 4 μg l were formed with mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt respectively fig 5b shows the effects of mwcnts on the formation of tcm with different srha concentrations tcm formation from the different srha concentrations decreased to different extents in the presence of mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt tcm concentrations decreased significantly when the srha was 1 mg l but slightly decreased when the srha increased to 5 mg l as mentioned previously the interaction of mwcnts with srha by hydrogen bonding can increase with more o containing functional groups as a weak interaction similar to π π force hydrogen bonding may not fully respond to the inhibition of dbp formation by adsorption however the adsorption via hydrogen bonding between oh and oh or cooh groups may weaken the reactivity of c atom between two meta positioned oh groups and prevent the formation of dbps with many o containing functional groups existing on srha surface the increase in o containing functional groups on the mwcnt would have a remarkable effect when srha concentrations decreased 3 5 effects of water chemistry on the dbp formation with additional carbon materials in addition to the physicochemical characteristics of cms water chemistry such as ph and salinity can also affect the formation of dbps with the presence cms fig 6 a shows the effects of ph on dbp formation with wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 tcm concentration increased as the ph increased a similar trend was obtained with mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt fig 6b as reported by hua et al 2007 tcm formation occurs via base catalyzed hydrolytic reactions and is favored under alkaline conditions benefiting the dbp formation at higher ph however the effects of additional cms on dbp formation at different ph range were not significant in contrast to ph the effects of salt on dbp formation with cms are much more complicated and remarkable nacl has minimal effects on dbp formation ding et al 2013 however at high salt concentrations the mesopores of wsbc500 and wsbc700 could be occupied by the salt ions and minimize the inhibition of dbp formation akhtar et al 2015 fig 6c different from wsbc the presence of aggregated pores with large mesopore volume is an important factor for the enhanced adsorption capacity of cnts lu and su 2007 aggregation of mwcnt occurs at higher nacl concentration adeleye and keller 2014 leading to the formation of numerous aggregated mesopores that may enhance the irreversible removal of dbp precursors fig 6d 3 6 effects of carbon materials on the dbp formation in the natural water two natural water samples surface water and wastewater secondary effluent were used to determine the effects of different cms on dbp formation in natural waters the main properties of the natural waters are shown in table s1 as shown in fig 7 a the tcm formed by chlorination of surface water was only 86 8 μg l when cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were added the tcm concentrations were significantly reduced to 42 3 65 3 and 60 1 μg l respectively compared to the dbp formation with srha the dbp formed from chlorination of surface water was much lower we hypothesized that the nom composition in the surface water sample is different from srha which affected dbp formation as shown in fig 6a the tcm concentrations decreased significantly with the addition of cms during the chlorination of surface water the result indicates that the inhibitory effects of cms on dbp formation was significant in the natural waters since the surface water did not differ remarkably from the simple solutions tested in this study in terms of ph doc and nacl we adduced the increased dbp inhibition in the surface water to the interactions of cms with surface water nom in comparison with dbps formed in surface water the total concentrations of dbps formed in wastewater were much lower fig 7b the tcm formed by chlorination of wastewater was 30 6 μg l when cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were added the tcm concentrations reduced to 20 0 19 2 and 13 2 μg l respectively according to literature effluent derived organic matter efom is minimally reactive with chlorine on a per doc concentration basis sirivedhin and gray 2005 the high concentration of toc in the wastewater sample did not result in high dbp formation due to the low reactivity of efom similar to the results obtained in surface water the inhibitory effects of cms on dbp formation also considerably increased when added to wastewater with comparable water chemistry we think that the components of efom interacted differently with cms which resulted in the inhibition of dbps 4 conclusions the release of cms into water and wastewater treatment systems can affect dbp formation upon chlorination in this study dbp formation was significantly reduced by 10 40 when srha was chlorinated in the presence of cms the irreversible adsorption of srha in the mesopore structure of cms via hydrogen bonding which weakened the reaction between srha and chlorine was identified as the major cause for dbps inhibition water chemistry significantly affected the irreversible adsorption between srha and cms and caused the variation of dbp formation with complicated water chemistry and diverse nom components the inhibited effects of cms on dbp formation in natural waters were much stronger the concentration of tcm formed decreased from 57 1 μg l to 23 8 38 4 and 40 4 μg l with the addition of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt respectively in surface water and from 30 6 μg l to 20 0 19 2 and 13 2 μg l respectively in wastewater declaration of

18628,release of carbon materials cms into water and wastewater treatment systems occurs due to their increasing utilization as adsorbents for water treatment when the cms mixed with natural organic matter nom interact with disinfectants used during water treatment e g chlorine the released cms can affect the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in this study three common cms were investigated to reveal their possible effects and the mechanisms of dbp formation during the chlorination of nom the experimental results indicate that dbps generation decreased by 10 40 in the presence of cms when suwannee river humic acid srha was chlorinated the adsorption of srha by cms was hypothesized as the major cause for the dbps inhibition cms could irreversibly adsorb dbp precursors in their mesopores through π π bonding and hydrophobic effects oh groups on the surface of cms were shown to be critical for dbps inhibition through linking with the oh or cooh groups on the surface of nom via hydrogen bonding the study also showed that water chemistry parameters such as ph and salinity can affect dbp formation by changing the adsorption of nom onto cms with diverse nom components the presence of cms resulted in decreased formation of trichloromethane from 57 1 μg l to 23 8 38 4 and 40 4 μg l when coal made activated carbon cac wheat straw made bc pyrolyzed at

natural organic matter in recent years different halogenated dbps have been found in chlorinated wastewater yang et al 2019a including halogenated salicylic acid halogenated phenol halogenated nitrophenol halogenated hydroxybenzaldehyde liu et al 2019 to date many studies focused on the effects of dbp formation with various disinfectants and natural organic matter nom as well as dbps toxicity han et al 2017 han and zhang 2018 hao et al 2017 li et al 2017 2019 liu et al 2019 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2019b while a few studies investigated dbp formation with the presence of carbon materials the use of carbon materials cms in industrial and consumer applications will lead to their release into municipal and industrial waste streams during typical water or wastewater treatment a big portion of cms may be removed due to coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration zhang et al 2013 however cms are also used as an adsorbent after the coagulation and sedimentation adeleye et al 2016 these cms if not completely removed may react with disinfectants forming toxic organic materials zhan et al 2010 studies reported that some carbon nanomaterials such as nc60 and graphene oxide which may be intentionally or accidently released into drinking water sources adeleye et al 2019 goodwin et al 2018 keller and lazareva 2013 can act as precursors for dbp formation during water chlorination du et al 2016 2017 du et al 2016 demonstrated that the c atoms in the middle of two meta positioned c oh groups on the aromatic ring of graphene oxide are very active causing the opening of the aromatic ring structure and the formation of trihalomethanes thms in addition activated carbon ac and biochar bc are more commonly used for water and wastewater polishing or post treatment before or after disinfection this is accordance with the epa s recommendation of these materials as one of the best available technologies for water utilities jiang et al 2017 u s epa 2006 more so the adsorption of dbp precursors and dbps by these widely used cms has been considered for instance such as shimizu et al 2018 reported that ac and

particles and microorganisms and stored at 4 c until use ph dissolved organic carbon doc concentration uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 cl br nh3 n and no2 n concentrations were determined specific uv absorbance suva was calculated as uv254 divided by doc zhai et al 2017 the major properties of the water samples are shown in table s1 2 4 experimental procedures the ph of all solutions was adjusted to 7 by using a 10 mm phosphate buffer solution before the chlorination the concentration of all the cms used in the experiments was 10 mg l to amplify the possible reactions during water and wastewater treatment du et al 2016 the cms selected for the experiment were not uniformly dispersed in the aqueous solution thus equal amounts of the materials were added to the aqueous solution and ultrasonicated at 100 w for 2 h by using a vibra cell vcx800 sonicator sonics material newtown ct then the disinfectants were added a cm free water sample served as control the cm containing raw water comprised a mixture of different cms with srha which simulates the water containing carbon adsorbents released after the coagulation and sedimentation processes all reactions were performed in the dark for 3 days at room temperature of 20 1 c the concentration of naclo was 10 mg l as cl2 and the concentration of srha was 3 mg l as c the quenching reaction was carried out by using ascorbic acid followed by rapid extraction with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe kristiana et al 2014 the extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography 2 5 analytical methods four dbps namely tcm dcan tca and 1 1 1 tcp were measured in this study according to epa 551 1 method using gas chromatography agilent 6890n santa clara ca equipped with an electron capture detector agilent technologies santa clara ca the column used for detection was an hp 5ms fused silica capillary column 30 mm 0 25 mm i d with film thickness of 0 25 mm j w scientific usa uv254 was measured by using a uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu scientific instruments usa the total organic carbon toc concentration was measured using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 germany the ph of the water samples was measured by using a sevencompact s230 basic ph meter mettler toledo international inc zurich switzerland cl and br concentrations were determined using an ion chromatograph ics1600 thermo fisher scientific usa nh3 n concentration and no2 n concentration were examined by the nessler reagent spectrophotometry gb 7479 87 and spectrophotometry gb 7493 87 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation with carbon materials the dbps formed in presence of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt upon chlorination are shown in fig 1 the total tcm concentrations measured in the cac wsbc300 and mwcnt samples were 13 8 77 4 and 23 6 μg l respectively fig 1a and the amount of dcan were 0 5 6 5 and 2 8 μg l fig 1b the concentrations of tca fig 1c and 1 1 1 tcp fig 1d were less than 5 μg l but the production trends were similar with those of tcm the tcm formation in the presence of graphene oxide was evaluated in a previous study du et al 2016 and the results indicated that the mechanism of tcm formation with cms is similar to that of nom arnold et al 2008 li et al 2000 rook 1977 but the total produced tcm was less the o containing functional groups of cms at their edges are the major cause for dbp formation mauter and elimelech 2008 the c oh groups on a benzene ring benefit the formation of c cl bond on the surface of cms while two meta positioned c oh groups on the surface of aromatic ring benefit the formation of tcm as the c atoms in the middle of the oh groups were very active causing the opening of the aromatic ring structure and the formation of tcm arnold et al 2008 du et al 2016 rook 1977 however with additional atoms or groups such as cn co or c oh in the aromatic rings of the cms the referent aromatic ring on the cms becomes highly active and may form dbps such as dcan tca and 1 1 1 tcp directly arnold et al 2008 mauter and elimelech 2008 the functional groups of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were evaluated by xps figs s1 s2 and the quantitative results are shown in table 1 the c o ratios of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were 13 50 4 64 and 37 38 wsbc300 exhibited the highest o ratio reaching 17 4 some n was also found in wsbc300 and mwcnt with ratios of 1 8 and 0 2 respectively the ratio of o containing functional groups c oh c o c o co and co of wsbc300 was the highest especially the oh concentrations which was 11 6 the surface functional groups of the cms were further characterized by ftir fig s3 all the cms exhibited four characteristic peaks located at 1227 1383 1628 and 1735 cm 1 which correspond to phenolic hydroxyl group hydroxyl epoxy groups oh c o c aromatic cc stretching and co stretching respectively acik et al 2011 hontoria lucas et al 1995 kratschmer et al 1990 li et al 2012 in agreement with xps ftir results showed the o functional groups on the wsbc300 were the highest especially the phenolic hydroxyl group the highest concentration of all dbps was found in the wsbc300 sample which also has the highest ratio of oh group the contents of n on the surface of wsbc300 and mwcnt contributed the dcan formation considering that dcan is a nitrogen containing dbp as tcm tca and 1 1 1 tcp are all carbon containing dbps their production trends were similar the proposed reaction pathways of the cms and the formation of dbps are shown in fig 2 3 2 dbp formation with srha and additional carbon materials the concentrations of the four studied dbps formed with chlorinated srha are shown in fig 3 and the effects of the different cms on dbp formation during srha chlorination are also depicted compared with the dbps formed with only cms fig 1 the dbps formed from srha chlorination were much higher in concentration reaching 379 2 16 5 12 5 and 12 3 μg l for tcm dcan tca and 1 1 1 tcp respectively as shown in fig 3a when the three cms cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were added the tcm concentrations decreased but with to different degrees the most significant decrease in tcm occurred in the sample with cac which decreased to 249 8 μg l whereas tcm only decreased to 366 5 and 348 2 μg l in the samples with wsbc300 and mwcnt respectively a similar trend was found in the other studied dbps fig 3b d the results indicate that the effect of different cms on dbp formation with srha chlorination is similar when srha was mixed with wsbc300 with chlorination thereafter the dcan concentration increased compared to the dcan formed from the chlorination of srha alone however this phenomenon only occurred for dcan but not other dbps a possible explanation is that wsbc300 can also form dcan with a relatively high concentration 6 5 μg l during chlorination and it may contribute to the formation of dcan during chlorination from the results obtained in fig 3 we speculated that the cms may have two major effects on dbp formation first cms could form dbps directly upon chlorination as shown in fig 1 and contribute to the total amount of dbps however except tcm the concentration of dbp formed by the chlorination of cms was very low and marginally subsidize the total amount of dbps second as an excellent adsorbent the cms can adsorb the dbp precursors srha and inhibit the formation of dbps nom may be adsorbed by cms via π π bonding hydrophobic effect hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions among all the mechanisms π π interaction is the most prominent in aromatic structures which can mediate the interactions between cms and nom lin and xing 2008 liu et al 2011 zhu and pignatello 2005 hydrophobic effect is also important for the hydrophobic regions between cms and nom liu et al 2011 yang et al 2006 similarly hydrogen bonding is effective on materials with o containing functional groups such as oh and cooh and may be crucial for wsbc300 and srha nevskaia and guerrero ruiz 2001 wang et al 2010 the phpzc of all cms 5 44 3 87 and 5 89 for cac wsbc300 and mwcnt respectively were lower than the reaction ph 7 0 consequently all the cms as well as srha were negatively charged which would prevent strong adsorption machado et al 2011 mendez diaz et al 2012 apart from the adsorption of srha cms could also adsorb dbps directly and reduce the concentration of dbps for instance jiang et al 2018 reported that activated carbon significantly reduced the levels of halogenated aromatic dbps trihalomethanes halo acetic acids and total organic halogen during chlorination jiang et al 2018 jiang and zhang 2018 higher surface area of cms corresponds to large numbers of π π bonds hydrophobic range and o functional groups which can form hydrogen bonding between cms and srha thus benefiting the adsorption of srha by cms as shown in the s4 cac exhibited the most developed pore structure among the three materials which indicates its relatively better adsorption capacity danmaliki and saleh 2017 mwcnt had the most abundant nano sized particles which also exert effects on the adsorption the surface structure of wsbc300 was relatively smooth for the 300 c pyrolyzed material the surface areas of all the cms were further evaluated by multipoint n2 adsorption desorption table 1 the surface areas of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were 510 6 6 2 and 146 6 m2 g respectively the distinctly different surface areas of the cms can remarkable affect adsorption from the data obtained cac has the highest surface area so it can adsorb more srha however some studies showed that the adsorbed nom can also be chlorinated to form dbps while desorbing later on hu et al 2016 shimizu et al 2018 whether the adsorption ability of cms corresponds to the inhibition of dbp formation needs to be further evaluated 3 3 effects of pore size of carbon materials on the dbp formation with higher pyrolysis temperature wsbc300 can be upgraded to wsbc500 and wsbc700 table 2 and fig s5 show the chemical characteristics including element composition and functional groups of wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 the surface area and pore volumes of wsbcs changed significantly after different pyrolysis temperature the surface area of wsbc300 increased from 6 2 m2 g when pyrolyzed at 300 c to 108 0 m2 g and 468 2 m2 g for wsbc500 and wsbc700 respectively the volume of wsbc300 s micropores pores 2 nm in diameter also increased significantly but the volume of mesopores pores 2 300 nm in diameter did not change much fig 4 a shows the tcm formed with wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 at 77 4 25 3 and 8 0 μg l respectively the tcm concentrations decreased significantly as the pyrolysis temperature of wsbc increased which may due to the decrease of oh group fig 4b shows the effects of wsbcs on tcm formation with different srha concentrations tcm concentrations increased significantly with increasing srha concentration however the tcm formation with wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 decreased slightly noticeably the surface area and functional groups of wsbc700 table 2 were comparable to those of cac table 1 but their effects on the dbp formation were quite different compared to the wsbc700 the effects of cac on dbp inhibition was much more significant the results indicate that in addition to surface area and functional groups other properties of cms may also be important for dbp formation when adsorbed nom is weakly and reversibly attached to the surface of cms therefore adsorbed nom can also be oxidized by chlorine disinfectants and form detectable dbps hu et al 2016 shimizu et al 2018 some research has also indicated that nom adsorbed in the pore structures of cms is strongly attached and difficult to be oxidized dastgheib et al 2004 matilainen et al 2006 quinlivan et al 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2005 however not all pores are suitable for nom adsorption the average size of nom is between 1 and 5 nm whereas the micropores on the surface of cms are smaller than 2 nm dastgheib et al 2004 the effective pore structures for the strong adsorption of nom are mesopores which are between 2 and 300 nm as shown in tables 1 and 2 the mesopores volume of cac and wsbc700 were 0 19 and 0 06 cm3 g respectively the different quantity of mesopores results in the different amount of dbp formation 3 4 effects of functional groups of carbon materials on the dbp formation as discussed previously the functional groups of cms may also affect the formation of dbp by changing the hydrogen bonding between cms and srha therefore the mwcnt was treated by hydroxylation and carboxylation to change the quantity and types of functional groups to evaluate the independent influences of the functional groups of cms on dbp formation table 3 and fig s6 show the chemical and physical characteristics of mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt no micropores and mesopores were detected on the surface of mwcnts as shown in table 3 the c o ratios of oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt decreased significantly after the hydroxylation and carboxylation treatments respectively the oh group was the highest on the oh mwcnt s surface and the cooh group was the highest on the cooh mwcnt s surface fig 5 a shows the tcm concentrations of 23 6 35 5 and 28 4 μg l were formed with mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt respectively fig 5b shows the effects of mwcnts on the formation of tcm with different srha concentrations tcm formation from the different srha concentrations decreased to different extents in the presence of mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt tcm concentrations decreased significantly when the srha was 1 mg l but slightly decreased when the srha increased to 5 mg l as mentioned previously the interaction of mwcnts with srha by hydrogen bonding can increase with more o containing functional groups as a weak interaction similar to π π force hydrogen bonding may not fully respond to the inhibition of dbp formation by adsorption however the adsorption via hydrogen bonding between oh and oh or cooh groups may weaken the reactivity of c atom between two meta positioned oh groups and prevent the formation of dbps with many o containing functional groups existing on srha surface the increase in o containing functional groups on the mwcnt would have a remarkable effect when srha concentrations decreased 3 5 effects of water chemistry on the dbp formation with additional carbon materials in addition to the physicochemical characteristics of cms water chemistry such as ph and salinity can also affect the formation of dbps with the presence cms fig 6 a shows the effects of ph on dbp formation with wsbc300 wsbc500 and wsbc700 tcm concentration increased as the ph increased a similar trend was obtained with mwcnt oh mwcnt and cooh mwcnt fig 6b as reported by hua et al 2007 tcm formation occurs via base catalyzed hydrolytic reactions and is favored under alkaline conditions benefiting the dbp formation at higher ph however the effects of additional cms on dbp formation at different ph range were not significant in contrast to ph the effects of salt on dbp formation with cms are much more complicated and remarkable nacl has minimal effects on dbp formation ding et al 2013 however at high salt concentrations the mesopores of wsbc500 and wsbc700 could be occupied by the salt ions and minimize the inhibition of dbp formation akhtar et al 2015 fig 6c different from wsbc the presence of aggregated pores with large mesopore volume is an important factor for the enhanced adsorption capacity of cnts lu and su 2007 aggregation of mwcnt occurs at higher nacl concentration adeleye and keller 2014 leading to the formation of numerous aggregated mesopores that may enhance the irreversible removal of dbp precursors fig 6d 3 6 effects of carbon materials on the dbp formation in the natural water two natural water samples surface water and wastewater secondary effluent were used to determine the effects of different cms on dbp formation in natural waters the main properties of the natural waters are shown in table s1 as shown in fig 7 a the tcm formed by chlorination of surface water was only 86 8 μg l when cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were added the tcm concentrations were significantly reduced to 42 3 65 3 and 60 1 μg l respectively compared to the dbp formation with srha the dbp formed from chlorination of surface water was much lower we hypothesized that the nom composition in the surface water sample is different from srha which affected dbp formation as shown in fig 6a the tcm concentrations decreased significantly with the addition of cms during the chlorination of surface water the result indicates that the inhibitory effects of cms on dbp formation was significant in the natural waters since the surface water did not differ remarkably from the simple solutions tested in this study in terms of ph doc and nacl we adduced the increased dbp inhibition in the surface water to the interactions of cms with surface water nom in comparison with dbps formed in surface water the total concentrations of dbps formed in wastewater were much lower fig 7b the tcm formed by chlorination of wastewater was 30 6 μg l when cac wsbc300 and mwcnt were added the tcm concentrations reduced to 20 0 19 2 and 13 2 μg l respectively according to literature effluent derived organic matter efom is minimally reactive with chlorine on a per doc concentration basis sirivedhin and gray 2005 the high concentration of toc in the wastewater sample did not result in high dbp formation due to the low reactivity of efom similar to the results obtained in surface water the inhibitory effects of cms on dbp formation also considerably increased when added to wastewater with comparable water chemistry we think that the components of efom interacted differently with cms which resulted in the inhibition of dbps 4 conclusions the release of cms into water and wastewater treatment systems can affect dbp formation upon chlorination in this study dbp formation was significantly reduced by 10 40 when srha was chlorinated in the presence of cms the irreversible adsorption of srha in the mesopore structure of cms via hydrogen bonding which weakened the reaction between srha and chlorine was identified as the major cause for dbps inhibition water chemistry significantly affected the irreversible adsorption between srha and cms and caused the variation of dbp formation with complicated water chemistry and diverse nom components the inhibited effects of cms on dbp formation in natural waters were much stronger the concentration of tcm formed decreased from 57 1 μg l to 23 8 38 4 and 40 4 μg l with the addition of cac wsbc300 and mwcnt respectively in surface water and from 30 6 μg l to 20 0 19 2 and 13 2 μg l respectively in wastewater declaration of

18629,urban drainage system uds researchers have applied the concept of resilience for minimizing the magnitude and duration of urban flooding in response to climate change currently the relationship between conventional design and resilience analysis still remains unknown while persistent rain has not been included in resilience assessment the present study proposes new metrics by means of resilience profile graph for uds stressed by synthetic short duration storms and real persistent rains the graph unifies the concepts of reliability robustness resilience and failure as well as design standards for sewer surcharging sewer flooding and property flooding which are linked into curves to show a complete performance under climate stress scenarios the obtained results show that resilience profile curves for short duration storms are well fitted by power functions with coefficient of determination 98 13 99 9 chicago hyetograph was used as critical input hyetograph where the error range was 0 34 6 83 compared with actual hyetograph resilience profile graphs for persistent rains reveal that resilience assessment based on short duration storms underestimates the effect of persistent rains and it can be obtained by using segmental and reference reliability metrics to reduce working time from weeks to hours for the rain of the same intensity resilience to persistent rain was 18 4 33 1 lower than for single rains threat of persistent rain doesn t fall under the rains of high intensity but under large rainfall in total which exceeds 25 of local annual rainfall while re

urban drainage system 1 introduction in the context of climate change safe and efficient storm water drainage is a common challenge for global cities gaines 2016 jiang et al 2018 larsen et al 2016 pluvial flooding is the inundation when storm water overwhelms drainage infrastructure which is expected to increase in frequency severity and impact due to the combined effects of climate change and urbanization rosenzweig et al 2018 in the past pluvial flooding only presented a nuisance while today they can potentially turn into a black swan catastrophe for example since 1951 when meteorological observation began in beijing the strongest rainfall hit the city on 21 july 2012 triggering a torrential rain disaster that paralyzed the traffic caused death of 78 people 525 flight cancellation and economic losses of 1 72 us dollars chen et al 2012 qiu 2012 sun et al 2012 water sector has gradually embraced the idea of resilience to face the challenge however the relationship between conventional design and resilience approach still remains unclear conventional design of urban drainage system uds is accomplished by first choosing a suitable design storm return period that is statistically based on historical rainfall records under the assumption of stationarity this is a typical risk analysis and probabilistic thinking approach nevertheless the probability is unjustifiable due to the changes in climate conditions simonovic et al 2016 moreover the trends of long term climate evolution still remain unknown linkov et al 2014 in the face of these unknowns building resilience becomes the optimal course of action resilience the ability to bounce back or cope successfully despite substantial adversity has received attention from nearly every possible domains such as children resilience earvolino ramirez 2007 mental resilience garcia dia et al 2013 young and rushton 2017 social resilience francis and bekera 2014 ecosystem resilience oliver et al 2015 and engineering resilience holling 1996 unlike the risk analysis resilience analysis shifts the emphasis from identification and analysis of uncertain threats to the more identifiable and measurable system response in stressed state which can also be defined as a possibilistic thinking de bruijn et al 2017 its key benefit is that multiple threats including unknown ones resulting in the same system response in stressed state can be addressed by a single analysis butler et al 2017 resilience analysis related to uds serves to minimize flooding magnitude and duration and to complement the risk analysis or conventional approach park et al 2013 however the relationship between them is still unknown butler et al 2014 exploration of that relationship is hindered by confusing definitions some terms such as reliability and robustness appear to be similar to resilience moreover the term resilience has the property performance duality that is often muddled in literature butler et al 2017 which creates further confusion juan garcía et al have performed a detailed review of related terms in urban wastewater systems management 2017 nonetheless widely accepted definition of resilience is still in its infancy makropoulos et al 2018 in addition novel metrics are needed for the real world application of the concept of resilience xue et al 2015 because of a wide range of threats contributing to urban flooding current studies have assessed uds resilience to external threats such as increasing rainfall urbanization and dry weather flows dong et al 2017 mugume et al 2014 as well as internal threats such as equipment malfunction sewer collapse and blockages ke et al 2016 mugume et al 2015a although the above listed threats are different resilience metrics used in these studies are universal to some extent since they are almost all developed by measuring flooding magnitude and or duration casal campos et al 2018 francis and bekera 2014 this just reflects the benefit of resilience analysis in which multiple threats resulting in the same system response in stressed state can be addressed by a single analysis mugume et al 2015b 2017 have introduced a global analysis approach to provide a panoramic evaluation of resilience to a wide range of scenarios these attempts to measure uds resilience are very helpful while their shortcoming is that only short duration storms are considered in the assessments persistent rain that continues for one or several days is also a common form of dangerous weather the later text will introduce a persistent rain if it is separated into independent hourly rains maximum return period is only 0 49 year that shouldn t cause flooding nevertheless in the form of a persistent rain it can cause severe flooding indicating that resilience assessment based on short duration storms may underestimate the effect of persistent rains therefore the current study introduces a method for climate resilience assessment by means of resilience profile graphs for uds stressed by short duration storms and real persistent rains the graphs unify the concepts and metrics of reliability robustness resilience and failure and incorporate conventional design standards for sewer surcharging sewer flooding and property flooding the graphs explain the relationship between conventional design standards and resilience analysis in a quantitative and graphical way and can reveal the effect of persistent rains on uds resilience in a rapid way then the methodology was applied to a case study in which different options are tested for their climate resilience 2 methods and case study 2 1 method development 2 1 1 flooding thresholds and uds reliability urban storm water drainage system consists of minor and major system fig 1 conventionally their design is based on three flooding threshold level standards butler et al 2018 threshold 1 is used in design practice of storm sewers and denotes the pipe full flow referred to as sewer surcharging return period because storm sewers are laid below ground they can actually accommodate a considerable surcharge and pressurized flow when a closed conduit becomes full threshold 2 denotes the maximum pipe surcharged flow without sewer flooding referred to as sewer flooding return period once this threshold is crossed pluvial flooding begins to occur threshold 3 is used in design practice of urban flooding control and denotes the maximum overland flow without property flooding referred to as property flooding return period for example in china it denotes that 1 buildings bottom floors are not flooded and 2 water depth of a lane in the road is less than 15 cm mohurd 2017 2016 since the existence of threshold 3 there is an acceptable level of sewer flooding only when threshold 3 is crossed the performance of drainage system can be seen as failed by definition engineered system services are a function of demand there is no service without demand for it urban areas and in particular cities are high demand areas for drainage service due to high concentrations of people and assets the degree to which the demand is met can be defined as 1 r 1 d e f i c i t d e m a n d where r is reliability that varies from 0 to 1 and 1 signifies that the demand is fully met the demand for storm water drainage is to safely and efficiently drain storm water and thus the service deficit or function deficit can be measured by storm water that isn t drained in time 2 r f 1 q f 1 t i 0 t i q i d t where r f is flow reliability t i is rainfall duration q i is rainfall intensity and q f is sewer flooding flow that equals the sum of excess flow overflowing all nodes of the drainage system excess flow that overflows a node equals total inflow entering the node from all upstream sewers plus any external source such as runoff flow minus total flow rate in the sewers leaving the node and the change of in sewer storage rossman 2017 instead of actual rainfall intensity average rainfall intensity over rainfall duration is used as the denominator to avoid q f 0 but q i 0 that will lead to infinity the total duration during which at least one node in the system is flooded is defined as flooding duration t f in addition specific durations with different flooding magnitude are written as 3 t r f y 0 t f if r f y 1 0 d t 4 t r f y 1 y 2 t r f y 2 t r f y 1 where y is a value from 0 to 1 t r f y is specific flooding duration with r f y specially t f t r f 1 and t r f y 1 y 2 is specific flooding duration with r f y 1 y 2 overall performance following a flooding event can be measured by 5 r v 1 0 t f q f d t 0 t i q i d t where r v is volumetric reliability although the calculation of r v is based on minor system it can be used to analyze the whole drainage system because major systems could contribute to r v too 2 1 2 resilience profile graph based on r v a stress strain diagram can be obtained where stress is increasing rainfall intensity or return period and strain is decreasing reliability fig 2 although we also thought of the graph in our research makropoulos et al 2018 have recently published it and named it as resilience profile graph adopting the term of resilience profile graph the present study further explained the relationship between conventional design standards and resilience analysis and assessed uds resilience to persistent rains in fig 2 both robustness and resilience reflect system performance under stresses especially those beyond threshold 1 robustness is defined as the extent to which a system can prevent surface flooding under increasing stresses r v 1 the limit of robustness is threshold 2 which represents the efficacy of minor system once this threshold is crossed surface flooding starts to occur r v 1 threshold 3 corresponds to a lower but acceptable level of reliability r a failure is defined as the occurrence of unacceptable surface flooding r v r a resilience is defined as the degree to which a system can minimize surface flooding under increasing stress and is measured by the area under the curve r e s increasing robustness will increase resilience but increasing resilience won t necessarily increase robustness in resilience profile graph conventional design standards presented by discrete points are linked into curves to show a complete uds response a more resilient system has a larger area under the curve which means flooding under the climate stresses can be controlled to a lower level while the definition reflects the degree of successfully coping despite climate threats it offers no explanation of mechanisms underlying resilience medical researchers have used defining attributes to analyze the concept of human resilience defining attributes are characteristics of a concept that are mostly associated with the concept and allow the analyst the broader insight into the concept earvolino ramirez 2007 garcia dia et al 2013 for uds resilience defining attributes include conveyance capacity redundancy adaptivity flexibility and resourcefulness their definitions are listed in table 1 building resilience in an uds can be achieved through adjusting these attributes with the guidance of updated design philosophy and standard persistent rain includes multiple rain peaks resulting in successive rainfall loadings the impact of persistent rain on uds resilience is evaluated by two steps firstly persistent rain is separated into independent short duration rains and uds responses to each of them are assessed secondly the differences between uds responses are compared to single rains and persistent rains in order to alleviate the high computational burden imposed by the first step this work proposes a rapid assessment method based on two specific reliability metrics as follow 6 r v x 1 n x x δ t q f d t 0 t i q i d t 7 r v 1 n x 1 n r v x where δ t is duration of time segment n is t f δ t round up to the nearest whole number and r v x is segmental volumetric reliability for the xth segment r v x decomposes r v into n reliabilities for every time segment with flooding occurrence therefore average r v x should equal r v this is a criterion to judge whether the calculation of r v x is correct or not see example in supplementary information si fig s1 by assuming rainfall in the xth segment is independent rain so obtained r v is termed reference volumetric reliability r v x the impact of persistent rains on uds resilience can be manifested by comparing r v x and r v x if r v x computed based on actual hyetograph can be replaced by those based on critical input hyetograph the latter can be obtained quickly and thus the assessment time can be greatly saved 2 2 case study herein the theoretical concepts and methodology were applied to a case study of an area in shanghai china covering 61 06 hectare si fig s2 local annual rainfall is 1133 mm yr on average and monthly distribution is uneven fang et al 2012 persistent rains have flooded the area twice in 2013 and 2015 exposing people living there to inundation si fig s3 therefore rehabilitating the drainage system therein is needed to enhance climate resilience 2 2 1 storm events 2 2 1 1 short duration block rainfall the most commonly used rainfall data for the design and planning of drainage system is the intensity duration frequency idf relationship of maximum rainfall amounts because storms with shorter duration have statistically higher intensity short duration storms are used in the design of storm sewer shanghai water authority 2017 issued short duration idf formula as 8 i 9 5808 1 0 846 l g p t i 7 0 656 where p is return period yr t i is rainfall duration applicable from 5 to 180 min and i is average rainfall intensity during t i mm min idf formula provides the simplest and least realistic storm profile termed block rainfall that has the same intensity over rainfall duration block rainfall is widely used in the rational method to estimate maximum flow rate of storm sewers for a given return period butler et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 2 2 1 2 persistent rain the probability and intensity of persistent rains in the future are unknown thus two historical persistent rains that flooded the study area were used to represent persistent rains rainfall records were from a rain gauge 780 meters away from the center of study area and named as r2013 2013 10 05 00 05 2013 10 10 00 00 5 min resolution 296 6 mm and r2015 2013 6 15 00 01 2015 6 20 00 00 1 min resolution 284 2 mm as shown in fig 3 the extremity of the two rains is that both rainfalls were more than 25 of local annual rainfall 2 2 1 3 critical input hyetograph to fully assess the performance of a sewer system storms of different return period are applied for a wide range of durations and hyetographs which is almost impossible and unnecessary a critical duration and critical input hyetograph can be determined by defining the representative event butler et al 2018 in r2013 and r2015 many rain peaks and especially the two highest rain peaks red dotted boxes are 1 hr single peak rainfalls fig 3 thus 1 hr is presumed as critical duration chicago method developed by keifer and chu 1957 which is widely used to produce single peak rainfall qin et al 2013 xie et al 2017 is adopted as critical input hyetograph by shanghai water authority 2017 si eq s1 and s2 thus chicago hyetograph is presumed as critical input hyetograph block rainfall and chicago hyetograph for the same return period have the same mean intensities but the latter has a peakedness of 4 018 that is defined as the ratio of maximum to mean intensity 2 2 2 retrofitting options and assessment scenarios there is a separate storm water sewer system in the study area we didn t find sewer surcharging return period for it because the area was built up since 1950s and relevant information was lost yet the system certainly doesn t meet the current code of urban drainage chinese government has modified the code for three times since 2011 in response to increased flooding risk caused by climate change mohurd 2016 2014 2011 according to the code that was in use before 2011 sewer surcharging return period was estimated to be no more than 0 5 yr because the study area has been built up it is almost impossible to re plan surface flood pathway moreover the terrain in the area is too flat to be used for planning surface flood pathway therefore the key for rehabilitating the existing drainage system is to minimize sewer flooding possible solutions include reducing inflow increasing conveyance and storing more flow fig 1 a previous study has evaluated the effect of green infrastructures such as green roof and rainwater garden on reducing rainfall runoff in the study area liu et al 2017 but such schemes have not been adopted by property owner thus the current study considered retrofitting sewer system and utilizing blue infrastructure blue infrastructure as a part of major system refers to urban infrastructure relating to water such as rivers streams ponds and lakes which may naturally exist within cities or may be added to an urban environment as an aspect of its design blue infrastructure is of growing importance due to the projected increases of extreme precipitation events under current and future climate change gunnell et al 2019 the water landscape in the study area is a blue infrastructure if it is used as a retarding basin retrofitting options are listed as follow si fig s5 which relate to defining attributes of resilience such as conveyance redundancy adaptivity and flexibility prevention of the inflow from outside a metro line was built up at the east side of the study area in 2010 since then the external ground become higher than the inner ground si fig s6 the outlets at the east side could be blocked adjacent sewers retrofitted and a new pumping station built to make up the loss of conveyance capacity for blocking the outlets cleaning the sediments in sewers this option restores conveyance capacity pre lowering of water level when receiving early warnings lower water level in water landscape by pump a this option increases redundancy adaptivity and flexibility re planning of water landscape water landscape area could be expanded and two more links between water landscape and sewer system added this option increases redundancy adaptivity and flexibility assessment scenarios are shown in table 2 where each scenario is composed of two variables uds condition and storm event thus the scenarios are named as uds condition storm event for example c4 5 yr 1 hr chicago hyetograph means uds condition c4 under 5 yr 1 hr chicago storm a hydrological and hydraulic model were developed using arcgis and storm water management model swmm 5 1 rossman 2015 to simulate the scenarios model development and simulation refer to si section s3 3 results 3 1 short duration storms fig 4 shows uds flow reliability r f to different short duration storms with synthetic hyetograph i e block rainfall and chicago hyetograph at the same return period block rainfall and chicago hyetograph had the same rainfall depth but flow reliability curve of chicago hyetograph was deeper because the rain was more concentrated in chicago rainfall no matter what hyetograph was the greater the rainfall intensity the deeper and wider the flow reliability curve a greater flood volume corresponded to a longer flood duration this regularity and similarity led to smooth resilience profile curves as shown in fig 5 where volumetric reliability r v decreased with the increase of climate stress represented by rainfall return period compared with chicago rainfall the current uds condition c4 was more robust and resilient to block rainfall the resilience of c4 to block rainfall and chicago rainfall was 0 705 and 0 650 respectively resilience profile curves of c4 and c5 almost overlapped by re planning water landscape as retarding basin c7 increased robustness and particularly resilience resilience of c7 to chicago rainfall was 0 797 and resilience profile curve was above r a calculation of r a refer to si section s4 in the zone of r v 1 the correlation between volumetric reliability and return period were well fitted by power functions with coefficients of determination r 2 being 98 13 99 9 which means that volumetric reliability for a given return period can be quickly computed by the fitted equations if the synthetic hyetograph can be used as critical input hyetograph whether block rainfall or chicago rainfall can be used as critical input hyetograph was examined actual hyetographs are from r2013 and r2015 they were separated into 240 independent hourly rains 120 for each uds response to actual hourly rains were simulated one by one to calculate r v and the results are reference volumetric reliability r v x based on actual hyetograph given hourly rainfalls corresponding return periods were calculated by using idf formula maximum return period of hourly rains in r2013 and r2015 were 0 49 yr and 1 07 yr respectively given return periods r v were computed by using the fitted equations from fig 5 and the results were r v x based on synthetic hyetograph comparison of r v x based on different hyetograph is shown in fig 6 while rainfall duration for synthetic hyetograph was 1 hr rainfall duration of some hourly rains that were separated from r2013 and r2015 were actually less than 1 hr nonetheless r v x of chicago hyetograph were close to those of actual hyetograph relative differences between them quantified by chicago result actual result actual result were only from 2 5 to 1 87 and 0 34 6 83 for r2013 and r2015 respectively therefore chicago hyetograph was used as critical input hyetograph or reference hyetograph in the following resilience analysis of persistent rains 3 2 persistent rains fig 7 shows uds flow reliability r f to r2013 and r2015 with minute resolution both hyetograph and r f were very irregular and similar rainfall does not always cause similar r f for example rainfall at the 57th and 67th hour in r2013 were similar but r f at the 67th hour was much lower and rainfall at the 19th and 53rd hour in r2015 were similar but r f at the 53rd hour was much lower the reason is that antecedent rainfall interferes with the drainage of subsequent rainfall as shown in fig 4 flooding duration was longer than rainfall duration thus the time necessary for draining out storm water was even longer such time is available for short duration storms but not for persistent rains when it rains the last hour s rain has not been drained out and has remained in the sewers this impact was particularly aggravated by continuous rainfall overlapping such as the 74th 82nd hour in r2013 and 47th 53rd hour in r2015 this impact can be proved by comparing uds responses to persistent rains and single rains r2013 and r2015 were manually separated into 240 independent hourly rains 120 for each and corresponding uds responses were simulated one by one fig 7 while hyetographs were the same r f in persistent rains grey line were much lower than those in single rains color line for example minimum r f in single rains of r2013 was only 0 61 but it turned into 2 58 in persistent rains although the comparison is precise and detailed simulating uds responses to every single rain imposes high computational burden and is time consuming resilience profile graph for persistent rain can be obtained by using segmental volumetric reliability r v x and reference volumetric reliability r v x r v x are reliabilities to hourly rains in persistent rains while r v x are reliabilities to hourly rains that are separated into single rains and are computed by using the fitted equations based on chicago hyetograph figs 5 and 6 this approach is less precise but satisfactory and it reduces working time from weeks to hours the current uds condition c4 is adequate to drain most of single rains fig 8 a b with minimum r v x being 0 94 in r2013 and 0 88 in r2015 by contrast resilience profile curves for persistent rains were much lower with minimum r v x being 0 41 in r2013 and 0 37 in r2015 resilience is the ratio of the area under the curves r e s persistent rains and r e s reference single rains and the impact of persistent rain can be quantified by r e s r e s r e s for c4 it was 18 4 in r2013 and 33 1 in r2015 the more concentrated rainfall in r2015 led to higher reduction of resilience by re planning the water landscape and utilizing it as retarding basin c7 mitigated the impact of persistent rain to 5 8 in r2013 and 11 8 in r2015 fig 8c d fig 9 can further explain flooding phenomena of persistent rains in short duration storms lower volumetric reliability corresponded to longer flooding duration however this trend was not observed in persistent rains compared with r2013 lower volumetric reliabilities corresponded to shorter flooding durations in r2015 which seemed contradictory indeed this just reflects the characteristics of the two rains total rainfalls in r2013 296 6 mm and r2015 284 2 mm were almost the same but rainfall duration of r2015 1082 min was 49 less than that of r2013 2105 min the more concentrated rainfall in r2015 led to larger flooding magnitude over shorter duration the way retrofitting scheme minimizes flooding magnitude and duration is revealed by specific flooding durations t r f compared with c4 flooding duration with larger flooding magnitude t r f 0 was reduced by c5 and c7 while flooding duration with smaller flooding magnitude could be increased for example in r2013 t r f 0 75 1 493min for c4 while it respectively equaled 590 min and 672 min for c5 and c7 indicating that larger flooding flows turned into smaller ones 4 discussion the current work presents a unified and rapid assessment of climate resilience of urban drainage system although only climate threats were studied in this work this method can be used for resilience assessment of other threats or stressors without major modifications this is because multiple threats including unknown ones resulting in the same system response under stressed state can be addressed by a single resilience analysis here unified assessment means that resilience profile graphs unify the concepts and metrics of reliability robustness resilience and failure as well as conventional design standards and can be used to assess both short duration storms and persistent rains rapid assessment means that resilience profile graph for persistent rain can be obtained by using segmental volumetric reliability r v x and reference volumetric reliability r v x based on critical input hyetograph which reduces working time from weeks to hours the premise here is that time segment for calculating r v x must be the same with rainfall duration for calculating r v x the selection of rainfall and setting of the flooding threshold influence the assessment results in this work 1 hr rainfall with chicago hyetograph was used as critical input hyetograph a drawback here is that 1 hr is likely to be longer than the time of concentration of the drainage network time of concentration is used in the rational method to calculate design flow of storm sewer threshold 1 it is often a short duration e g in the range of 10 15 min with statistically higher rain intensity the sewer network in this study contained 2 pumping stations and 5 gravity outlets by designing uds operation condition c1 c3 we tried to determine the time of concentration but failed to do so as a result c1 c3 were not presented in table 2 and thus the assessment of design standard of sewer system was shifted from threshold 1 to threshold 2 namely from sewer surcharging return period to sewer flooding return period however the determination of threshold 2 was also challenging we used a very small flood volume as threshold 2 by which the resulting sewer flooding return period was only 0 2 0 22 year it is precise but probably irrational to use a very small flood volume from just a node to judge the whole system especially a large and complex system therefore threshold 2 in fig 5 was determined by inputting r v 1 to the fitted equations calculation of segmental volumetric reliability r v x may by affected by the similar problem using a very small flood volume from just a node to judge flooding duration may lead to irrational r v x this can be solved by try and error to set an appropriate threshold of effective flood volume to judge flooding duration this work revealed the impact of persistent or antecedent rains on reducing uds resilience the impact of antecedent rainfall has also been used for explaining why rainfall retained in situ by storm water source controls was less than design objective wang et al 2018 as a key component of most urban drainage system storm sewers are designed based on short duration storm with statistically higher rainfall intensity which favor fast drainage and are disadvantaged in storing storm flow thus lacking the resilience to persistent rains in order to build a climate resilient uds short duration storms and persistent rains should be both considered in uds planning the two persistent rains do not pose a threat through high rain intensity but large rainfall in total given that both rainfalls exceeded 25 of local annual rainfall designing engineering measures e g storage tank to store so much storm water can be costly adaptive design of blue infrastructure provides a technique for increasing uds resilience to persistent rains in an economic and ecological way moreover blue infrastructure is multifunctional providing ecosystem services such as mitigating urban heat island intensity gunawardena et al 2017 and social services such as blue space visibility that promote mental well being and reduce distress nutsford et al 2016 regardless of these benefits blue spaces often give way to urbanization and agriculturalization for example the total area of lakes in wuhan china shrank by 35 1 from 1995 to 2005 huang et al 2012 among which the neisha lake shrank the most reaching 83 6 yongli et al 2014 which aggravates the problem of urban flooding in rainy season xia et al 2017 cities need retarding basin or temporary storage to increase the resilience to climate change the proposed method aids an integrated analysis of minor system and retarding basin in major system by means of resilience profile graphs for short duration storms and persistent rains 5 conclusion this present study presents a method for assessing climate resilience of urban drainage system by means of resilience profile graph the proposed methodology was applied to a case study in which different retrofit options were tested for their climate resilience the main conclusions are as follow 1 resilience profile graph incorporates the concepts and metrics of reliability robustness resilience and failure as well as conventional design standards for sewer surcharging sewer flooding and property flooding where conventional design standards presented by points are linked into curves to show a complete uds performance both short duration storms and persistent rains can be assessed by the graph a more resilient system has a larger area under resilience profile curve which means flooding in the climate stress scenarios can be controlled to a lower level 2 resilience profile curves for short duration storms with synthetic hyetograph i e block rainfall and chicago hyetograph are well fitted by power functions with coefficient of determination r 2 up to 98 13 99 9 chicago hyetograph can be used as critical input hyetograph of which the error range is 0 34 6 83 compared with actual hyetograph resilience profile graph for persistent rain can be obtained by using segmental and reference volumetric reliability based on chicago hyetograph which reduce working time from weeks to hours 3 this work demonstrates that resilience assessment based on short duration storms underestimates the impact of persistent rains for the rains of the same intensity current system c4 s resilience to persistent rains is 18 4 33 1 lower than for single rains because in persistent rains antecedent rains interfere with the drainage of subsequent ones and these impacts overlap during continuous rainfall threat of the persistent rains doesn t lie in high rain intensities but large rainfall in total which exceeds 25 of local annual rainfall by re planning water landscape as retarding basin c7 can reduce the impact to 5 8 11 8 acknowledgement this study was supported by science and technology commission of

18629,urban drainage system uds researchers have applied the concept of resilience for minimizing the magnitude and duration of urban flooding in response to climate change currently the relationship between conventional design and resilience analysis still remains unknown while persistent rain has not been included in resilience assessment the present study proposes new metrics by means of resilience profile graph for uds stressed by synthetic short duration storms and real persistent rains the graph unifies the concepts of reliability robustness resilience and failure as well as design standards for sewer surcharging sewer flooding and property flooding which are linked into curves to show a complete performance under climate stress scenarios the obtained results show that resilience profile curves for short duration storms are well fitted by power functions with coefficient of determination 98 13 99 9 chicago hyetograph was used as critical input hyetograph where the error range was 0 34 6 83 compared with actual hyetograph resilience profile graphs for persistent rains reveal that resilience assessment based on short duration storms underestimates the effect of persistent rains and it can be obtained by using segmental and reference reliability metrics to reduce working time from weeks to hours for the rain of the same intensity resilience to persistent rain was 18 4 33 1 lower than for single rains threat of persistent rain doesn t fall under the rains of high intensity but under large rainfall in total which exceeds 25 of local annual rainfall while re planning water landscape as retarding basin reduces the impact of persistent rains to 5 8 11 8 graphical abstract image 1 keywords pluvial flooding urban drainage system reliability robustness

urban drainage system 1 introduction in the context of climate change safe and efficient storm water drainage is a common challenge for global cities gaines 2016 jiang et al 2018 larsen et al 2016 pluvial flooding is the inundation when storm water overwhelms drainage infrastructure which is expected to increase in frequency severity and impact due to the combined effects of climate change and urbanization rosenzweig et al 2018 in the past pluvial flooding only presented a nuisance while today they can potentially turn into a black swan catastrophe for example since 1951 when meteorological observation began in beijing the strongest rainfall hit the city on 21 july 2012 triggering a torrential rain disaster that paralyzed the traffic caused death of 78 people 525 flight cancellation and economic losses of 1 72 us dollars chen et al 2012 qiu 2012 sun et al 2012 water sector has gradually embraced the idea of resilience to face the challenge however the relationship between conventional design and resilience approach still remains unclear conventional design of urban drainage system uds is accomplished by first choosing a suitable design storm return period that is statistically based on historical rainfall records under the assumption of stationarity this is a typical risk analysis and probabilistic thinking approach nevertheless the probability is unjustifiable due to the changes in climate conditions simonovic et al 2016 moreover the trends of long term climate evolution still remain unknown linkov et al 2014 in the face of these unknowns building resilience becomes the optimal course of action resilience the ability to bounce back or cope successfully despite substantial adversity has received attention from nearly every possible domains such as children resilience earvolino ramirez 2007 mental resilience garcia dia et al 2013 young and rushton 2017 social resilience francis and bekera 2014 ecosystem resilience oliver et al 2015 and engineering resilience holling 1996 unlike the risk analysis resilience analysis shifts the emphasis from identification and analysis of uncertain threats to the more identifiable and measurable system response in stressed state which can also be defined as a possibilistic thinking de bruijn et al 2017 its key benefit is that multiple threats including unknown ones resulting in the same system response in stressed state can be addressed by a single analysis butler et al 2017 resilience analysis related to uds serves to minimize flooding magnitude and duration and to complement the risk analysis or conventional approach park et al 2013 however the relationship between them is still unknown butler et al 2014 exploration of that relationship is hindered by confusing definitions some terms such as reliability and robustness appear to be similar to resilience moreover the term resilience has the property performance duality that is often muddled in literature butler et al 2017 which creates further confusion juan garcía et al have performed a detailed review of related terms in urban wastewater systems management 2017 nonetheless widely accepted definition of resilience is still in its infancy makropoulos et al 2018 in addition novel metrics are needed for the real world application of the concept of resilience xue et al 2015 because of a wide range of threats contributing to urban flooding current studies have assessed uds resilience to external threats such as increasing rainfall urbanization and dry weather flows dong et al 2017 mugume et al 2014 as well as internal threats such as equipment malfunction sewer collapse and blockages ke et al 2016 mugume et al 2015a although the above listed threats are different resilience metrics used in these studies are universal to some extent since they are almost all developed by measuring flooding magnitude and or duration casal campos et al 2018 francis and bekera 2014 this just reflects the benefit of resilience analysis in which multiple threats resulting in the same system response in stressed state can be addressed by a single analysis mugume et al 2015b 2017 have introduced a global analysis approach to provide a panoramic evaluation of resilience to a wide range of scenarios these attempts to measure uds resilience are very helpful while their shortcoming is that only short duration storms are considered in the assessments persistent rain that continues for one or several days is also a common form of dangerous weather the later text will introduce a persistent rain if it is separated into independent hourly rains maximum return period is only 0 49 year that shouldn t cause flooding nevertheless in the form of a persistent rain it can cause severe flooding indicating that resilience assessment based on short duration storms may underestimate the effect of persistent rains therefore the current study introduces a method for climate resilience assessment by means of resilience profile graphs for uds stressed by short duration storms and real persistent rains the graphs unify the concepts and metrics of reliability robustness resilience and failure and incorporate conventional design standards for sewer surcharging sewer flooding and property flooding the graphs explain the relationship between conventional design standards and resilience analysis in a quantitative and graphical way and can reveal the effect of persistent rains on uds resilience in a rapid way then the methodology was applied to a case study in which different options are tested for their climate resilience 2 methods and case study 2 1 method development 2 1 1 flooding thresholds and uds reliability urban storm water drainage system consists of minor and major system fig 1 conventionally their design is based on three flooding threshold level standards butler et al 2018 threshold 1 is used in design practice of storm sewers and denotes the pipe full flow referred to as sewer surcharging return period because storm sewers are laid below ground they can actually accommodate a considerable surcharge and pressurized flow when a closed conduit becomes full threshold 2 denotes the maximum pipe surcharged flow without sewer flooding referred to as sewer flooding return period once this threshold is crossed pluvial flooding begins to occur threshold 3 is used in design practice of urban flooding control and denotes the maximum overland flow without property flooding referred to as property flooding return period for example in china it denotes that 1 buildings bottom floors are not flooded and 2 water depth of a lane in the road is less than 15 cm mohurd 2017 2016 since the existence of threshold 3 there is an acceptable level of sewer flooding only when threshold 3 is crossed the performance of drainage system can be seen as failed by definition engineered system services are a function of demand there is no service without demand for it urban areas and in particular cities are high demand areas for drainage service due to high concentrations of people and assets the degree to which the demand is met can be defined as 1 r 1 d e f i c i t d e m a n d where r is reliability that varies from 0 to 1 and 1 signifies that the demand is fully met the demand for storm water drainage is to safely and efficiently drain storm water and thus the service deficit or function deficit can be measured by storm water that isn t drained in time 2 r f 1 q f 1 t i 0 t i q i d t where r f is flow reliability t i is rainfall duration q i is rainfall intensity and q f is sewer flooding flow that equals the sum of excess flow overflowing all nodes of the drainage system excess flow that overflows a node equals total inflow entering the node from all upstream sewers plus any external source such as runoff flow minus total flow rate in the sewers leaving the node and the change of in sewer storage rossman 2017 instead of actual rainfall intensity average rainfall intensity over rainfall duration is used as the denominator to avoid q f 0 but q i 0 that will lead to infinity the total duration during which at least one node in the system is flooded is defined as flooding duration t f in addition specific durations with different flooding magnitude are written as 3 t r f y 0 t f if r f y 1 0 d t 4 t r f y 1 y 2 t r f y 2 t r f y 1 where y is a value from 0 to 1 t r f y is specific flooding duration with r f y specially t f t r f 1 and t r f y 1 y 2 is specific flooding duration with r f y 1 y 2 overall performance following a flooding event can be measured by 5 r v 1 0 t f q f d t 0 t i q i d t where r v is volumetric reliability although the calculation of r v is based on minor system it can be used to analyze the whole drainage system because major systems could contribute to r v too 2 1 2 resilience profile graph based on r v a stress strain diagram can be obtained where stress is increasing rainfall intensity or return period and strain is decreasing reliability fig 2 although we also thought of the graph in our research makropoulos et al 2018 have recently published it and named it as resilience profile graph adopting the term of resilience profile graph the present study further explained the relationship between conventional design standards and resilience analysis and assessed uds resilience to persistent rains in fig 2 both robustness and resilience reflect system performance under stresses especially those beyond threshold 1 robustness is defined as the extent to which a system can prevent surface flooding under increasing stresses r v 1 the limit of robustness is threshold 2 which represents the efficacy of minor system once this threshold is crossed surface flooding starts to occur r v 1 threshold 3 corresponds to a lower but acceptable level of reliability r a failure is defined as the occurrence of unacceptable surface flooding r v r a resilience is defined as the degree to which a system can minimize surface flooding under increasing stress and is measured by the area under the curve r e s increasing robustness will increase resilience but increasing resilience won t necessarily increase robustness in resilience profile graph conventional design standards presented by discrete points are linked into curves to show a complete uds response a more resilient system has a larger area under the curve which means flooding under the climate stresses can be controlled to a lower level while the definition reflects the degree of successfully coping despite climate threats it offers no explanation of mechanisms underlying resilience medical researchers have used defining attributes to analyze the concept of human resilience defining attributes are characteristics of a concept that are mostly associated with the concept and allow the analyst the broader insight into the concept earvolino ramirez 2007 garcia dia et al 2013 for uds resilience defining attributes include conveyance capacity redundancy adaptivity flexibility and resourcefulness their definitions are listed in table 1 building resilience in an uds can be achieved through adjusting these attributes with the guidance of updated design philosophy and standard persistent rain includes multiple rain peaks resulting in successive rainfall loadings the impact of persistent rain on uds resilience is evaluated by two steps firstly persistent rain is separated into independent short duration rains and uds responses to each of them are assessed secondly the differences between uds responses are compared to single rains and persistent rains in order to alleviate the high computational burden imposed by the first step this work proposes a rapid assessment method based on two specific reliability metrics as follow 6 r v x 1 n x x δ t q f d t 0 t i q i d t 7 r v 1 n x 1 n r v x where δ t is duration of time segment n is t f δ t round up to the nearest whole number and r v x is segmental volumetric reliability for the xth segment r v x decomposes r v into n reliabilities for every time segment with flooding occurrence therefore average r v x should equal r v this is a criterion to judge whether the calculation of r v x is correct or not see example in supplementary information si fig s1 by assuming rainfall in the xth segment is independent rain so obtained r v is termed reference volumetric reliability r v x the impact of persistent rains on uds resilience can be manifested by comparing r v x and r v x if r v x computed based on actual hyetograph can be replaced by those based on critical input hyetograph the latter can be obtained quickly and thus the assessment time can be greatly saved 2 2 case study herein the theoretical concepts and methodology were applied to a case study of an area in shanghai china covering 61 06 hectare si fig s2 local annual rainfall is 1133 mm yr on average and monthly distribution is uneven fang et al 2012 persistent rains have flooded the area twice in 2013 and 2015 exposing people living there to inundation si fig s3 therefore rehabilitating the drainage system therein is needed to enhance climate resilience 2 2 1 storm events 2 2 1 1 short duration block rainfall the most commonly used rainfall data for the design and planning of drainage system is the intensity duration frequency idf relationship of maximum rainfall amounts because storms with shorter duration have statistically higher intensity short duration storms are used in the design of storm sewer shanghai water authority 2017 issued short duration idf formula as 8 i 9 5808 1 0 846 l g p t i 7 0 656 where p is return period yr t i is rainfall duration applicable from 5 to 180 min and i is average rainfall intensity during t i mm min idf formula provides the simplest and least realistic storm profile termed block rainfall that has the same intensity over rainfall duration block rainfall is widely used in the rational method to estimate maximum flow rate of storm sewers for a given return period butler et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 2 2 1 2 persistent rain the probability and intensity of persistent rains in the future are unknown thus two historical persistent rains that flooded the study area were used to represent persistent rains rainfall records were from a rain gauge 780 meters away from the center of study area and named as r2013 2013 10 05 00 05 2013 10 10 00 00 5 min resolution 296 6 mm and r2015 2013 6 15 00 01 2015 6 20 00 00 1 min resolution 284 2 mm as shown in fig 3 the extremity of the two rains is that both rainfalls were more than 25 of local annual rainfall 2 2 1 3 critical input hyetograph to fully assess the performance of a sewer system storms of different return period are applied for a wide range of durations and hyetographs which is almost impossible and unnecessary a critical duration and critical input hyetograph can be determined by defining the representative event butler et al 2018 in r2013 and r2015 many rain peaks and especially the two highest rain peaks red dotted boxes are 1 hr single peak rainfalls fig 3 thus 1 hr is presumed as critical duration chicago method developed by keifer and chu 1957 which is widely used to produce single peak rainfall qin et al 2013 xie et al 2017 is adopted as critical input hyetograph by shanghai water authority 2017 si eq s1 and s2 thus chicago hyetograph is presumed as critical input hyetograph block rainfall and chicago hyetograph for the same return period have the same mean intensities but the latter has a peakedness of 4 018 that is defined as the ratio of maximum to mean intensity 2 2 2 retrofitting options and assessment scenarios there is a separate storm water sewer system in the study area we didn t find sewer surcharging return period for it because the area was built up since 1950s and relevant information was lost yet the system certainly doesn t meet the current code of urban drainage chinese government has modified the code for three times since 2011 in response to increased flooding risk caused by climate change mohurd 2016 2014 2011 according to the code that was in use before 2011 sewer surcharging return period was estimated to be no more than 0 5 yr because the study area has been built up it is almost impossible to re plan surface flood pathway moreover the terrain in the area is too flat to be used for planning surface flood pathway therefore the key for rehabilitating the existing drainage system is to minimize sewer flooding possible solutions include reducing inflow increasing conveyance and storing more flow fig 1 a previous study has evaluated the effect of green infrastructures such as green roof and rainwater garden on reducing rainfall runoff in the study area liu et al 2017 but such schemes have not been adopted by property owner thus the current study considered retrofitting sewer system and utilizing blue infrastructure blue infrastructure as a part of major system refers to urban infrastructure relating to water such as rivers streams ponds and lakes which may naturally exist within cities or may be added to an urban environment as an aspect of its design blue infrastructure is of growing importance due to the projected increases of extreme precipitation events under current and future climate change gunnell et al 2019 the water landscape in the study area is a blue infrastructure if it is used as a retarding basin retrofitting options are listed as follow si fig s5 which relate to defining attributes of resilience such as conveyance redundancy adaptivity and flexibility prevention of the inflow from outside a metro line was built up at the east side of the study area in 2010 since then the external ground become higher than the inner ground si fig s6 the outlets at the east side could be blocked adjacent sewers retrofitted and a new pumping station built to make up the loss of conveyance capacity for blocking the outlets cleaning the sediments in sewers this option restores conveyance capacity pre lowering of water level when receiving early warnings lower water level in water landscape by pump a this option increases redundancy adaptivity and flexibility re planning of water landscape water landscape area could be expanded and two more links between water landscape and sewer system added this option increases redundancy adaptivity and flexibility assessment scenarios are shown in table 2 where each scenario is composed of two variables uds condition and storm event thus the scenarios are named as uds condition storm event for example c4 5 yr 1 hr chicago hyetograph means uds condition c4 under 5 yr 1 hr chicago storm a hydrological and hydraulic model were developed using arcgis and storm water management model swmm 5 1 rossman 2015 to simulate the scenarios model development and simulation refer to si section s3 3 results 3 1 short duration storms fig 4 shows uds flow reliability r f to different short duration storms with synthetic hyetograph i e block rainfall and chicago hyetograph at the same return period block rainfall and chicago hyetograph had the same rainfall depth but flow reliability curve of chicago hyetograph was deeper because the rain was more concentrated in chicago rainfall no matter what hyetograph was the greater the rainfall intensity the deeper and wider the flow reliability curve a greater flood volume corresponded to a longer flood duration this regularity and similarity led to smooth resilience profile curves as shown in fig 5 where volumetric reliability r v decreased with the increase of climate stress represented by rainfall return period compared with chicago rainfall the current uds condition c4 was more robust and resilient to block rainfall the resilience of c4 to block rainfall and chicago rainfall was 0 705 and 0 650 respectively resilience profile curves of c4 and c5 almost overlapped by re planning water landscape as retarding basin c7 increased robustness and particularly resilience resilience of c7 to chicago rainfall was 0 797 and resilience profile curve was above r a calculation of r a refer to si section s4 in the zone of r v 1 the correlation between volumetric reliability and return period were well fitted by power functions with coefficients of determination r 2 being 98 13 99 9 which means that volumetric reliability for a given return period can be quickly computed by the fitted equations if the synthetic hyetograph can be used as critical input hyetograph whether block rainfall or chicago rainfall can be used as critical input hyetograph was examined actual hyetographs are from r2013 and r2015 they were separated into 240 independent hourly rains 120 for each uds response to actual hourly rains were simulated one by one to calculate r v and the results are reference volumetric reliability r v x based on actual hyetograph given hourly rainfalls corresponding return periods were calculated by using idf formula maximum return period of hourly rains in r2013 and r2015 were 0 49 yr and 1 07 yr respectively given return periods r v were computed by using the fitted equations from fig 5 and the results were r v x based on synthetic hyetograph comparison of r v x based on different hyetograph is shown in fig 6 while rainfall duration for synthetic hyetograph was 1 hr rainfall duration of some hourly rains that were separated from r2013 and r2015 were actually less than 1 hr nonetheless r v x of chicago hyetograph were close to those of actual hyetograph relative differences between them quantified by chicago result actual result actual result were only from 2 5 to 1 87 and 0 34 6 83 for r2013 and r2015 respectively therefore chicago hyetograph was used as critical input hyetograph or reference hyetograph in the following resilience analysis of persistent rains 3 2 persistent rains fig 7 shows uds flow reliability r f to r2013 and r2015 with minute resolution both hyetograph and r f were very irregular and similar rainfall does not always cause similar r f for example rainfall at the 57th and 67th hour in r2013 were similar but r f at the 67th hour was much lower and rainfall at the 19th and 53rd hour in r2015 were similar but r f at the 53rd hour was much lower the reason is that antecedent rainfall interferes with the drainage of subsequent rainfall as shown in fig 4 flooding duration was longer than rainfall duration thus the time necessary for draining out storm water was even longer such time is available for short duration storms but not for persistent rains when it rains the last hour s rain has not been drained out and has remained in the sewers this impact was particularly aggravated by continuous rainfall overlapping such as the 74th 82nd hour in r2013 and 47th 53rd hour in r2015 this impact can be proved by comparing uds responses to persistent rains and single rains r2013 and r2015 were manually separated into 240 independent hourly rains 120 for each and corresponding uds responses were simulated one by one fig 7 while hyetographs were the same r f in persistent rains grey line were much lower than those in single rains color line for example minimum r f in single rains of r2013 was only 0 61 but it turned into 2 58 in persistent rains although the comparison is precise and detailed simulating uds responses to every single rain imposes high computational burden and is time consuming resilience profile graph for persistent rain can be obtained by using segmental volumetric reliability r v x and reference volumetric reliability r v x r v x are reliabilities to hourly rains in persistent rains while r v x are reliabilities to hourly rains that are separated into single rains and are computed by using the fitted equations based on chicago hyetograph figs 5 and 6 this approach is less precise but satisfactory and it reduces working time from weeks to hours the current uds condition c4 is adequate to drain most of single rains fig 8 a b with minimum r v x being 0 94 in r2013 and 0 88 in r2015 by contrast resilience profile curves for persistent rains were much lower with minimum r v x being 0 41 in r2013 and 0 37 in r2015 resilience is the ratio of the area under the curves r e s persistent rains and r e s reference single rains and the impact of persistent rain can be quantified by r e s r e s r e s for c4 it was 18 4 in r2013 and 33 1 in r2015 the more concentrated rainfall in r2015 led to higher reduction of resilience by re planning the water landscape and utilizing it as retarding basin c7 mitigated the impact of persistent rain to 5 8 in r2013 and 11 8 in r2015 fig 8c d fig 9 can further explain flooding phenomena of persistent rains in short duration storms lower volumetric reliability corresponded to longer flooding duration however this trend was not observed in persistent rains compared with r2013 lower volumetric reliabilities corresponded to shorter flooding durations in r2015 which seemed contradictory indeed this just reflects the characteristics of the two rains total rainfalls in r2013 296 6 mm and r2015 284 2 mm were almost the same but rainfall duration of r2015 1082 min was 49 less than that of r2013 2105 min the more concentrated rainfall in r2015 led to larger flooding magnitude over shorter duration the way retrofitting scheme minimizes flooding magnitude and duration is revealed by specific flooding durations t r f compared with c4 flooding duration with larger flooding magnitude t r f 0 was reduced by c5 and c7 while flooding duration with smaller flooding magnitude could be increased for example in r2013 t r f 0 75 1 493min for c4 while it respectively equaled 590 min and 672 min for c5 and c7 indicating that larger flooding flows turned into smaller ones 4 discussion the current work presents a unified and rapid assessment of climate resilience of urban drainage system although only climate threats were studied in this work this method can be used for resilience assessment of other threats or stressors without major modifications this is because multiple threats including unknown ones resulting in the same system response under stressed state can be addressed by a single resilience analysis here unified assessment means that resilience profile graphs unify the concepts and metrics of reliability robustness resilience and failure as well as conventional design standards and can be used to assess both short duration storms and persistent rains rapid assessment means that resilience profile graph for persistent rain can be obtained by using segmental volumetric reliability r v x and reference volumetric reliability r v x based on critical input hyetograph which reduces working time from weeks to hours the premise here is that time segment for calculating r v x must be the same with rainfall duration for calculating r v x the selection of rainfall and setting of the flooding threshold influence the assessment results in this work 1 hr rainfall with chicago hyetograph was used as critical input hyetograph a drawback here is that 1 hr is likely to be longer than the time of concentration of the drainage network time of concentration is used in the rational method to calculate design flow of storm sewer threshold 1 it is often a short duration e g in the range of 10 15 min with statistically higher rain intensity the sewer network in this study contained 2 pumping stations and 5 gravity outlets by designing uds operation condition c1 c3 we tried to determine the time of concentration but failed to do so as a result c1 c3 were not presented in table 2 and thus the assessment of design standard of sewer system was shifted from threshold 1 to threshold 2 namely from sewer surcharging return period to sewer flooding return period however the determination of threshold 2 was also challenging we used a very small flood volume as threshold 2 by which the resulting sewer flooding return period was only 0 2 0 22 year it is precise but probably irrational to use a very small flood volume from just a node to judge the whole system especially a large and complex system therefore threshold 2 in fig 5 was determined by inputting r v 1 to the fitted equations calculation of segmental volumetric reliability r v x may by affected by the similar problem using a very small flood volume from just a node to judge flooding duration may lead to irrational r v x this can be solved by try and error to set an appropriate threshold of effective flood volume to judge flooding duration this work revealed the impact of persistent or antecedent rains on reducing uds resilience the impact of antecedent rainfall has also been used for explaining why rainfall retained in situ by storm water source controls was less than design objective wang et al 2018 as a key component of most urban drainage system storm sewers are designed based on short duration storm with statistically higher rainfall intensity which favor fast drainage and are disadvantaged in storing storm flow thus lacking the resilience to persistent rains in order to build a climate resilient uds short duration storms and persistent rains should be both considered in uds planning the two persistent rains do not pose a threat through high rain intensity but large rainfall in total given that both rainfalls exceeded 25 of local annual rainfall designing engineering measures e g storage tank to store so much storm water can be costly adaptive design of blue infrastructure provides a technique for increasing uds resilience to persistent rains in an economic and ecological way moreover blue infrastructure is multifunctional providing ecosystem services such as mitigating urban heat island intensity gunawardena et al 2017 and social services such as blue space visibility that promote mental well being and reduce distress nutsford et al 2016 regardless of these benefits blue spaces often give way to urbanization and agriculturalization for example the total area of lakes in wuhan china shrank by 35 1 from 1995 to 2005 huang et al 2012 among which the neisha lake shrank the most reaching 83 6 yongli et al 2014 which aggravates the problem of urban flooding in rainy season xia et al 2017 cities need retarding basin or temporary storage to increase the resilience to climate change the proposed method aids an integrated analysis of minor system and retarding basin in major system by means of resilience profile graphs for short duration storms and persistent rains 5 conclusion this present study presents a method for assessing climate resilience of urban drainage system by means of resilience profile graph the proposed methodology was applied to a case study in which different retrofit options were tested for their climate resilience the main conclusions are as follow 1 resilience profile graph incorporates the concepts and metrics of reliability robustness resilience and failure as well as conventional design standards for sewer surcharging sewer flooding and property flooding where conventional design standards presented by points are linked into curves to show a complete uds performance both short duration storms and persistent rains can be assessed by the graph a more resilient system has a larger area under resilience profile curve which means flooding in the climate stress scenarios can be controlled to a lower level 2 resilience profile curves for short duration storms with synthetic hyetograph i e block rainfall and chicago hyetograph are well fitted by power functions with coefficient of determination r 2 up to 98 13 99 9 chicago hyetograph can be used as critical input hyetograph of which the error range is 0 34 6 83 compared with actual hyetograph resilience profile graph for persistent rain can be obtained by using segmental and reference volumetric reliability based on chicago hyetograph which reduce working time from weeks to hours 3 this work demonstrates that resilience assessment based on short duration storms underestimates the impact of persistent rains for the rains of the same intensity current system c4 s resilience to persistent rains is 18 4 33 1 lower than for single rains because in persistent rains antecedent rains interfere with the drainage of subsequent ones and these impacts overlap during continuous rainfall threat of the persistent rains doesn t lie in high rain intensities but large rainfall in total which exceeds 25 of local annual rainfall by re planning water landscape as retarding basin c7 can reduce the impact to 5 8 11 8 acknowledgement this study was supported by science and technology commission of
